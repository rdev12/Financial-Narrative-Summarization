CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Innovation Group provides software and outsourcing services
to the insurance industry. Our vision is to provide technology and
best practice for the administration of policies and claims for the
world’s insurers and risk carriers. The Group is totally focused on this
market and delivers its two broad offerings through a single client-
centric organisation. We are a multinational player operating in the
world’s largest insurance markets with a strong proportion of our
clients being international in nature. Our 2,100 people across the
world have extensive insurance experience and they are ably
supported by our partners.
The year in review
During 2007 we continued to make strong progress in all aspects of
our business and have now completed the transition into a
technology-led outsourcing company with recurring revenue now
77% of the business. We delivered signiﬁcant growth in both revenue
and proﬁts reaching our highest ever levels on both counts and we
had strong cash generation with an operating cash inﬂow of £15.2m.
Client satisfaction is the underlying strength of our business and
these client relationships continued to prosper during the year.  
We extended our outsourcing relationships with existing clients and
also won new clients, including our largest ever outsourcing
transaction – a multi year agreement with Royal and Sun Alliance.
In addition, we secured three new recurring software licence projects,
two in the UK and one overseas including one in partnership with IBM.
In December 2006 we made the strategic acquisition of First Notice
Systems (“FNS”) which has provided the Group with an important
entry into the insurance outsourcing market in the USA. 
The integration of FNS has been extremely smooth and has exceeded
all of our internal expectations. The acquisition was funded by a 2 for
5 Rights issue of 180,600,771 new Ordinary Shares to raise
approximately £37.9m (before expenses). In addition, we made six
smaller acquisitions to further extend the reach of the Group. 
In South Africa we secured our status as a Black Economic
Empowered (“BEE”) supplier within that country by introducing a
qualifying equity partner which is majority owned by an employee
trust.
Since the year end we completed the acquisition of Nobilas Claims
and Fleet Solutions Limited (“Nobilas”), the accident management
business of Akzo Nobel, which expands our European footprint into
France, Benelux and Spain and also takes us into the fleet
management and leasing markets. This acquisition joins our existing
Motorcare operations to give us a truly pan-European offering.
Financial results
Revenue for the year ended 30 September 2007 was £110.5m (2006:
£79.7m); recurring revenues increased from £55.4m to £85.0m and
now represent 77% of the total revenue. Outsourcing revenue was
£75.4m (2006: £48.3m) and software and services revenue was
£35.1m (2006: £31.3m). 
Adjusted proﬁt* for the year ended 30 September 2007 was £16.1m
(2006: £10.9m) and profit before tax was £10.4m (2006: £8.5m),
representing adjusted EPS of 1.93p (2006: 1.64p) and basic EPS of
1.17p (2006: 1.28p).
Operating cash flow for the year ended 30 September 2007 was
£15.2m (2006: £10.0m).
The ﬁnancial results for the year are impacted by the strength of
Sterling against, in particular, the US Dollar and the South African
Rand.
*Adjusted proﬁt before tax is proﬁt before tax after adding back the
amortisation charge of £2.9m, impairment charge of £1.1m, a share
based payments charge of £1.5m and utilisation of pre-acquisition
brought forward tax losses of £0.2m as analysed on the face of the
income statement.

Organisation and employees
I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding teamwork and
commitment to clients displayed by our employees during the year .
I would also like to extend a warm welcome to our new recruits and
to partners’ employees who are working with us on client
engagements. During the year we increased our headcount from
1,400 to 2,100 and with the integration of Nobilas this has increased
to 2,300. Innovation continues to attract and retain some of the best
people in the industry and we recognise them as the foundation of
our future success.
The Board and corporate governance
I am pleased to welcome Kurt Lauk and James Morley to the roster
of Non-Executive Directors. Kurt brings considerable global
experience in both the automotive and technology industries, whilst
James has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and operational experience in the
insurance industry. Chris Banks and David Thorpe continue as Non-
Executive Directors and Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration
committees respectively and I remain as Non-Executive Chairman
of the Board. In line with best practice, I no longer sit on the Audit
and Remuneration Committees but continue to chair the Nomination
Committee. 
Paul Smolinski resigned as Group Finance Director on 31 January
2007. John Sidwell joined the Board as Group Finance Director on 19
March 2007 and resigned on 21 May 2007. Paul Hemsley, who had
been interim Finance Director since December 2006, then joined the
Board as Group Finance Director on 22 May 2007. 
With the exception of the Chairman’s seat on the Audit and
Remuneration Committees until 5 May 2007, the Group has been in
full compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout
the year .
Dividend policy
As advised in our interim statement we have reviewed our dividend
policy and have decided to recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 0.3 pence
per share. This dividend will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting on 13 March 2008 and if approved paid on 28 March 2008.
The record date is 29 February 2008.
Outlook
The Board is very pleased with the progress of the business and is
encouraged by the current high level of demand for its services
across the globe. This demand, supported by an encouraging pipeline
of prospects and higher than expected levels of future recurring
revenue, led the Group to revise upwards its expectations for 2008. 
We have robust recurring revenue models in both the outsourcing and
software segments. We have an extensive outsourcing client base and
the pipelines remain healthy in each geography. We anticipate growth
to continue in 2008 through our simple objective of delivering more
beneﬁts, to more clients, in more markets. Software licence sales still
remain attractive and we have a better business model through
which to manage the volatility of software licence revenue. Our ﬁve
year relationship with IBM gives us the platform to distribute our
software products on a global basis. We made good progress with IBM
in 2007 and we anticipate seeing further results from this partnership
in the 2008 ﬁnancial year .
In summary, the Group is well positioned as we enter 2008. We aim
to continue the momentum gained throughout 2007 and look forward
to the future with optimism.

RELIABILITY THAT 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE
Innovation Group is our principal outsourcing partner 
and we have had an excellent working relationship with 
Innovation Motorcare for over ten years. The work that 
they do for us in handling our repair claims, containing 
our costs and in conﬁguring bespoke solutions is key 
to the ongoing success of our business.

TIG R&A AW Front   25/1/08  10:27  Page 7 8
We have had a record year in both revenue and adjusted proﬁt in
2007 and in constant currency terms our performance would have
been even stronger. Through both organic growth and acquisitions
in North America, Europe and Africa we continue to extend our global
reach and our business delivered 39% (2006: 31%) year on year
revenue growth. In constant currencies this growth would have been
51%. Our customer base which exceeds 200 worldwide, before the
post year-end Nobilas acquisition, increasingly provides a revenue
stream that is of a recurring nature and hence more predictable. We
manage in excess of 3 million transactions across the world. 
Strategic update
Our conversion to a technology-led Business Process Outsourcing
group, founded upon longer term contracts that provide a recurring
revenue stream, is now complete. 
As a technology business we continue to develop innovative new
products for use both within our own outsourcing business and where
required for licence sales, with implementation of both provided by
our own dedicated solution delivery resource. 
In servicing our customers we provide both pan-European and global
capabilities which are unrivalled. The FNS acquisition and our post
year end Nobilas acquisition have significantly added to these
capabilities.
Market drivers
The global insurance industry continues to face competitive and
regulatory challenges that require it to seek initiatives that reduce
both their own transaction processing costs and the costs of the
underlying claim which are a considerable proportion of their
premium income and their costs. Innovation is well placed to provide
a technology solution for high volume lower value claims processing
and supply chain management which is increasingly demanded on
a multi-national basis.
Operational review
Innovation has now completed the transformation to a technology–led
Business Process Outsourcing provider reﬂected in the fact that 77%
of revenues are now recurring. 
During 2007 we have signed several multi-million pound outsourcing
contracts with blue-chip clients, including the Group’s largest ever
BPO deal with Royal & Sun Alliance. Our outsourcing segment now
represents 68% of Group revenue (2006: 61%) and 71% (2006: 69%)
of Group adjusted profit. This represents a year on year revenue
increase of £27.1m or 56%.
Licences, software rental, maintenance, solution delivery and hosting
revenues were £35.1m (2006: £31.3m) up 12%. Our software segment
now represents 32% of Group revenue (2006: 39%) and 29% (2006:
31%) of Group adjusted proﬁt. In line with our strategic shift to a
recurring revenue model, there has been a 35% increase in our
recurring software revenues to £9.6m (2006: £7.1m) and one-time
licence fees decreased by almost half to £3.7m.
In North America we achieved revenue growth of 68% largely arising
from the acquisition of FNS in late December 2006. These results
reﬂect nine full months of FNS activity being revenues of £8.7m and
proﬁt before tax of £1.8m. The integration of FNS within Innovation’s
existing US activities is proceeding ahead of plan. Our acquisition of
51% of Sureplan International Pty Limited in the US in October 2006
was augmented in August 2007 by the purchase of the remaining
49%. Our solution delivery business has had an excellent year
reﬂecting the global expertise and professionalism of our technology
focussed staff. Our exclusive partnership with IBM for software sales
resulted in one US-based software and solution delivery contract
win during the year and we remain conﬁdent of further wins arising
from this relationship, which has been further strengthened by the
establishment of an insurance centre of excellence with IBM
Bangalore, India.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
“
We aim to continue the
momentum gained throughout
2007. Our business plan calls
for further organic growth
augmented by selected
acquisitions.
”
TIG R&A AW Front   25/1/08  10:27  Page 8 9
There was another strong performance from our well established
and market leading business in South Africa which achieved 10%
revenue growth. In local currency terms the business performed in
excess of its own target, growing revenues 30% year on year . This is
a credit to the new management team following the relocation of Eric
Wadsworth to the US. Holmswood and Back and Manson Pty Limited,
a travel insurance company in which we acquired a 61.86% stake 
in November 2006, contributed £1.4m to the profit before tax of 
the Group.
In the UK we secured revenue growth of 36% and commenced the
Group’s largest ever outsourcing contract with Royal & Sun Alliance
worth £25m revenue over 5 years. Through developing our existing
property business model we have secured a leading UK market
position ready for further expansion. Motorcare has performed well
and is suitably positioned to consolidate the UK operations acquired
from Nobilas post year-end. We secured two major software
contracts for the implementation of Innovation products in the
property and auto sectors which are in progress at the year end with
delivery timed for 2008. There was one major licence extension
recorded during the year .
Revenue growth in Germany was 101% and the outsourcing property
and motor business continues to grow both organically and through
integration of the acquisitions of Service Konzept and IFN, the parts
supply business that was acquired in October 2006. Our motor division
is well placed to consolidate the German operations acquired from
Nobilas post year-end.
Our Australian business performed to expectations with revenue
growth of 41% integrating newly acquired Sureplan Australia Pty. We
completed a major software solution delivery project during the year .
The Japanese business continues to suffer from poor sales conversion.
Going forward we aim to continue the momentum gained throughout
2007. Our business plan calls for further organic revenue growth
augmented by selected acquisitions. Following the Nobilas acquisition,
as in 2007, we anticipate a bias towards the second half of the year .
Market risks and uncertainties
As required by EU reporting requirements the Board monitors the risk
factors facing the business. As with any company, risks may affect
the Group, its results and the Board’s ability to deliver strategy. The
Board has reduced or mitigated certain risks during the year,
speciﬁcally with reference to the minimisation of the dependence
upon the timing of software milestones, project delivery and the
regulatory challenges of BEE in South Africa.
Key risks and uncertainties include:
• On a global basis the Group needs to remain competitive 
• The Group is dependent upon the maintenance of service level
agreements with insurance industry clients
• The Group relies on its relationships with its supplier networks
• The Group’s software solutions must remain technologically
competitive and the associated intellectual property must be
properly protected
• The Group is exposed to certain external risks including exchange
translation risks (as approximately 75% of Innovation revenues
are generated outside of the UK) or the ﬁnancial failure of a major
customer
Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”)
As previously announced, the Group completed the ZAR 132m (£9.6m)
restructuring of its South African subsidiary passing a 25% equity
stake in its South African subsidiary to Inthutuko Investments Limited
(Inthutuko). Inthutuko is 78% owned by Innovation employees in South
Africa through an Employee Beneﬁt Trust and 22% by Jala Capital
Investments Limited and was ﬁnanced by a ZAR 132m (£9.6m) loan
from Barclays Bank. This loan is guaranteed by The Innovation Group
plc. With our improved BEE status in South Africa we are well placed
to secure new customers from a strong pipeline in sectors that require
BEE pre-qualiﬁcation as well as developing new business with existing
customers.

Financial Overview
I am delighted to present these 2007 results, my first since
appointment to the Board earlier this year, as not only does this
represent a record year but it marks the transition to a recurring
revenue business model.
Total revenues for the year are £110.5m (2006: £79.7m) up 39% of
which 77% (2006: 70%) are of a recurring nature. Organic growth is
14% (2006: 23%). Adjusted proﬁt of £16.1m (2006: £10.9m) is up by
47%. Proﬁt before tax is £10.4m (2006: £8.5m) up 23%. On a constant
currency basis, total revenues and adjusted profit would have
increased by 51% and 63% respectively. Adjusted earnings per share
is 1.93 pence (2006: 1.64 pence) and basic earnings per share is 1.17
pence (2006: 1.28 pence).
The Group has once again achieved a gross margin of 47% while
adjusted margin is up 1% point to 15%. The performance was
materially weighted towards the second half of the year which
generated adjusted proﬁt of £10.0m (2006: £5.7m).
Segment Information
In the Outsourcing segment revenues are £75.4m (2006: £48.3m) up
56% reflecting the impact of both acquisitions of £20.0m (2006:
£4.8m) of which FNS was £8.7m and organic growth. Adjusted proﬁt
is £11.4m (2006: £7.5m) and represents 71% of Group adjusted proﬁt.
In our Software segment, revenues are £35.1m (2006: £31.3m)
reﬂecting recurring software rental, maintenance and hosting of
£9.6m (2006: £7.1m) solution delivery of £21.8m (£17.4m) and one
time licences of £3.7m (2006: £6.8m). Adjusted proﬁt is £4.7m (2006:
£3.4m) and represents 29% of Group adjusted proﬁt. 
Foreign Currencies
The Group undertakes operations on a global basis and the results
for the year are subject to movements in exchange rates. The Group
has a policy of not hedging translation movements that arise either
positive or negative although all material transactions are hedged at
the point they become more than likely to occur . During the year the
weakening of the South African Rand and US Dollar against the
budgeted Sterling exchange rates, lowered adjusted profits by
approximately £0.8m. 
Taxation 
The Group tax charge of £2.3m (2006: £1.6m) increased primarily
due to rising proﬁts in South Africa and Germany which cannot be
offset against losses in other countries. The Group’s effective tax
rate being the tax charge, prior to deferred tax on acquisitions,
expressed as a percentage of adjusted proﬁt has increased to 20%
(2006: 15%). The tax charge expressed as a percentage of pre tax
proﬁts is 22% (2006: 19%). The Group continues to carry forward
signiﬁcant tax losses in the UK and US.
Investment activity
In December 2006 the Group acquired FNS from Concentra Services
Inc for $51.5m (£28.2m) which was funded by the proceeds of a 2 for
5 rights issue which had a 95% take up at 21p per share. Our 2007
results reﬂect nine months of activity from FNS, our US based ﬁrst
notice of loss business. 
In October 2006 a 51% controlling equity interest was acquired in
Sureplan International Pty Limited, a leading supplier of accident
management services to the leasing industry in the US, from
LeasePlan NV for $6.5m (£3.3m) with the remaining 49% being
acquired in August 2007 for $4.9m (£2.7m). In addition, there is
contingent deferred consideration payable details of which are given
in note 16c. The entire transaction was funded from debt of which
£0.9m was repaid during the year .
In November 2006 we acquired 61.86% of Holmswood and Back and
Manson Pty Limited, a supplier of travel insurance administration and
insurance consultancy services in South Africa, for a cash
consideration of ZAR 64.0m (£4.5m). This transaction was ﬁnanced
from existing cash resources.
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Total revenues for the year are

are of a recurring nature.

In October 2006, the Group acquired 60% of IFN GmbH for a cash
consideration of €0.15m (£0.1m). This company, which supplies motor
vehicle parts, has been renamed Innovation Parts GmbH.
In April 2007 we also acquired the remaining 75% stake in Conversant
Data Limited for £3.1m. Conversant Data Limited is our insurance
fraud investigation business which is now being marketed as an
outsourcing service within our UK business. This transaction was
ﬁnanced by a combination of cash and new issue shares.
Subsequent to the year end, the Group acquired Nobilas from Akzo
Nobel for €0.85m (£0.6m). 
Black Economic Empowerment
In May 2007 the Group completed a restructuring of its South African
subsidiary passing a 25% stake in its South African subsidiary to
Inthutuko Investments Limited, a company which is 77.8% owned
by our South African employees through an Employee Beneﬁt Trust
and 22.2% by Jala Capital. The purchase consideration of ZAR 132m
was provided by a loan to Inthutuko, guaranteed by The Innovation
Group plc. In view of this, Inthutuko Investments Limited is 100%
consolidated into the Group accounts as a special purpose entity in
accordance with SIC 12.
Cash ﬂow
Cash conversion was 95% (2006: 91%) of adjusted proﬁt. Net cash,
being cash balances less debt, at the year end was £18.6m (2006:
£9.0m).
Operating cash of £15.2m (2006: £10.0m) reﬂects operating proﬁts
of £8.6m (2006: £7.4m) adjusted for depreciation, amortisation,
impairment, share based payments and a working capital decrease.
Investment expenditure of £42.7m (2006: £11.6m) included £43.8m
(2006: £12.1m) of acquisitions principally £29.4m for FNS, fixed
assets of £3.2m (2006: £1.4m) and net investment income of £1.8m
(2006: £1.2m). Financing cash inflows of £45.3m (2006: £4.1m)
included £37.1m (2006: £0.1m) of proceeds from the issue of shares,
new debt of £14.8m (2006: £8.1m) including £9.6m in respect of the
BEE loan, and repayments of borrowings of £4.9m (2006: £3.4m).
Overall cash and cash equivalents increased by £17.8m (2006: £2.4m)
and after reﬂecting opening cash of £19.0m (2006: £19.8m), adjusted
for the effect of exchange rates, resulted in closing cash of £39.8m.
Included in closing cash of £39.8m (2006: £19.0m) is £7.9m (2006:
£8.8m) of balances held in Innovation bank accounts on behalf of
customers for which there is a corresponding balance sheet liability
generally for the settlement of the transaction cost on behalf of those
customers.

During 2007, to reflect changes in the overall business model,
contract initiation costs for long term outsourcing contracts may be
incurred at the commencement of the contract and where material
these are being deferred and expensed over the contract term.
Included in current assets is an amount of £0.2m (2006: Nil).
In 2007 we commenced a global project to upgrade Innovation
technology within our own outsourcing businesses. These costs have
been capitalised as internally generated software and will be
amortised over the useful life when available for use. Included in
intangible ﬁxed assets is an amount of £0.5m (2006: Nil).
We have not capitalised any development expenditure in 2007 as it
did not meet the criteria under IAS 38. We will review all new
development projects in 2008 and where amounts qualify these will
be capitalised.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued
Supplier payment policy
It is Company policy to agree and clearly communicate the terms of
payment as part of the commercial arrangement negotiated with
suppliers and then to pay according to those terms based upon the
satisfactory completion of contractual obligations and timely receipt
of an accurate invoice. Trade creditor days of the Company for the
year ended 30 September 2007 were 42 days (2006: 44 days),
calculated in accordance with the requirements set down in the
Companies Act 1985.
Treasury policy
Treasury activities are managed under policies and procedures
approved and monitored by the Board. These are designed to reduce
the ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group, which relate primarily to
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and currency risk. Details are given
in note 25 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Events since the balance sheet date
On 28 November 2007 the Group received shareholder approval at an
Extraordinary General Meeting for the acquisition of Nobilas Claims
and Fleet Solutions for a cash consideration of €850,000 (approx.
£600,000). This acquisition was completed on 3 December 2007.
Directors’ liabilities
The Company has granted an indemnity to its Directors against liability
in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the
conditions set out in s234 of the Companies Act 2006. Such qualifying
third party indemnity provision was in force throughout the period
and remains in force as at the date of approving the Directors’ Report.
Takeovers directive
Where not provided previously in this Directors' Report, the following
provides the additional information required for shareholders as a
result of the implementation of the Takeovers Directive into UK law. 
At 30 September 2007, the Company's issued share capital comprised
a single class of shares referred to as ordinary shares. Details of
the share capital and shares purchased and cancelled in the year can
be found in note 26. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every
holder of shares present in person and entitled to vote shall have one
vote and on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. 
The notice of the general meeting speciﬁes deadlines for exercising
voting rights either by proxy notice or present in person or by proxy
in relation to resolutions to be passed at general meeting. All proxy
votes are counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation
to each resolution are announced at the Annual General Meeting
and published on the Company's website after the meeting. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the
Company other than:
  certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
  pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require 
the approval of the Company to deal in the Company's 
securities.
There have been no changes in share capital, no purchases by the
Company of its own shares and the Company holds no shares in
treasury.
A resolution will be proposed as a special resolution at the 2008
Annual General Meeting which will give the Company authority to use
its available cash resources to acquire up to 5% of its own shares in
the market for either cancellation or to hold them as treasury shares.
The Directors will continue to use this authority only after careful
consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at
the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels,
and the overall position of the Company. The Directors only purchase
such shares after taking into account the effects on earnings per
share and the beneﬁts for shareholders.
There are no shares issued under share schemes with rights not
directly exercisable by employees as the shares are only issued when
the share option is exercised by the employee.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and for
voting rights other than two acquisition agreements which restrict
the vendor shareholders from transferring shares in the Company
given as consideration for a certain period.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or
otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. The agreements
between the Company and its Directors for compensation for loss of
ofﬁce are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements which take
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a
takeover bid of the Company.
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 18 19
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution
or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds ofﬁce only
until the next Annual General Meeting and is not taken into account
in determining the Directors who are to retire by rotation at that
meeting. Unless and until otherwise determined by ordinary
resolution, the number of Directors shall not be less than two and
shall not be subject to any maximum. 
The Company's articles of association may only be amended by a
special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. At the
Company's Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 March 2008,
a resolution will be put to shareholders proposing amendments to
the existing articles of association, in accordance with the provision
of the new Companies Act 2006. 
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors will be put
to the members at the Annual General Meeting.
Authority to purchase own shares
On 5 March 2007 the shareholders granted the Company authority
to purchase a maximum of 31,738,507 (being 5% of issued share
capital at that date) of its own shares. This authority remains in
place at 30 September 2007.
Directors’ Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of
approving the Directors’ report are listed on page 104. Having made
enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each
of these Directors conﬁrms that:
  to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is
no information relevant to the preparation of their report of
which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
  each Director has taken all the steps a Director might
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors
are aware of that information.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Innovation Group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. As required, this statement describes how the Group has
applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (“the Code”) published by the FSA in July 2003. The
Board considers that subsequent to the appointment of the new
Non-Executive Directors in March 2007, it has complied with the
provisions of the Code. Prior to their appointment, the Non-Executive
Chairman sat on the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee
which is not in compliance with the recommendations of the Smith
Guidance and the Code which states that a Non-Executive Chairman
should not be a member of these Committees.
The Board
At the start of the year the Board of Directors comprised two
Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors (including a
Non-Executive Chairman) as detailed below. As described in the
Director’s Report on page 17 with effect from March 2007 the Board
now comprises two Executive Directors and five Non-Executive
Directors (including a Non-Executive Chairman). The structure of
the Board is aligned with the recommendations of the Code which for
large companies requires a board structure where at least half the
members of the Board excluding the Chairman are Independent
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management
of the Group and for its system of corporate governance. The Board
meets regularly and prior to significant decisions being taken. 
Non-Executive Directors meet regularly as a group without the
executives present and at least once a year without the Chairman
present. During the year there were six scheduled and three 
non-scheduled Board meetings and four Board calls. In advance of
each meeting, each member receives documentation concerning
the Group’s operational performance, an update on legal matters
and other information to enable decisions to be taken on the
resolutions proposed. These resolutions are made with reference
to a formal schedule of matters reserved for Board approval, which
include:
  the Group’s long term objectives, commercial strategy and
related plan
  approval of interim and ﬁnal ﬁnancial statements and reports 
  the Group’s acquisition and divestment policy and any
transactions arising
  approval of major capital expenditure projects and consideration
of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters
  approval of all circulars, listing particulars and press releases
concerning matters decided by the Board
  the approval of the annual budgets
  matters concerning the Board and its committees’ membership
and terms of reference.
Operational management of the Group is delegated to the Executive
Directors and senior management team who meet regularly to
discuss and approve operational matters, again under a schedule of
matters reserved for this forum. These matters include project
delivery, maintaining customer relationships and initial due diligence
on mergers and acquisitions.
The Board has concluded that the Non-Executive Directors
comprising the Chairman, Geoff Squire (notwithstanding his role 
as Non-Executive Chairman), the Senior Independent Director, 
Chris Banks, David Thorpe, Kurt Lauk and James Morley are
independent of management in both character, judgement and
opinion. In coming to this assessment, the Board has taken into
consideration the criteria contained in the Code which are whether
the Director: 
  has been an employee of the Group within the last ﬁve years
  has, or has had within the last three years, a material business
relationship with the Group
  has received or receives additional remuneration from the Group
apart from a Director’s fee
  has close family ties with any of the Group’s advisers, Directors
or senior employees
  holds cross-directorships or has signiﬁcant links with other
Directors through involvement in other companies or bodies
  represents a signiﬁcant shareholder
  has served on the Board for more than nine years from the date
of their ﬁrst election.
All Directors, in accordance with the Code, will submit themselves
for re-election at least once every three years and at the ﬁrst Annual
General Meeting following their appointment as a Director .
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary and are entitled in furtherance of their duties to take
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense, including if
necessary requesting the attendance of external legal counsel or
other professional advisors at Board meetings.
The Board has established three standing committees which deal
with speciﬁc aspects of the Group’s affairs as determined by their
written terms of reference which are available for inspection on the
Group’s website. The Board members, their respective committee
responsibilities and their attendance details, including those where
attendance has been by telephone, for the year ended 30 September
2007 are as follows:

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Chris Banks (Chairman), David Thorpe
and James Morley, who are, in the opinion of the Board, independent
of management. During the year, following the appointment of James
Morley, Geoff Squire resigned from the Audit Committee. The Company
is now in full compliance with the recommendations of the Smith
Guidance and the Code which states that a Non-Executive Chairman
should not be a member of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee meets prior to the release of ﬁnancial results
to consider the interim and full year results announcements. The
external auditors, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Group Finance Director
attend each meeting by invitation as required. The committee also
meets the auditors without the Executive Directors present, and is
authorised by the Board to obtain outside legal or independent
professional advice if it considers this necessary. The purpose of the
committee includes:

appointment of Kurt Lauk and James Morley, both Geoff Squire and
Chris Banks resigned from the Remuneration Committee. 
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 21 22
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued
The Company is now in full compliance with the recommendations of
the Smith Guidance and the Code which states that a Non-Executive
Chairman should not be a member of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year to:
  consider and recommend to the Board the total individual
remuneration package of each Executive Director, the Chairman
and certain senior employees. No Director plays a part in setting
their own remuneration
  propose targets for any performance related pay schemes and
measure performance against those targets
  determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements,
service agreements for the Executive Directors, termination
payments and compensation commitments.
The Committee consults the Chairman about its proposals and has
access to professional advice from outside the Group as necessary.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 26 to 31 and
includes full details of the components of Directors’ remuneration.
During the year the Remuneration Committee met four times to fulﬁl
these responsibilities.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Geoff Squire (Chairman), Chris
Banks and Kurt Lauk who are, in the opinion of the Board, independent
from management. During the year, following the appointment of Kurt
Lauk, David Thorpe resigned from the Nomination Committee.
During the year, four new Directors were appointed to the Board. 
The Chairman ran the recruitment programmes for all of the
appointments and external searches were carried out.
The Nomination Committee meets at least annually and its key
responsibilities include:
  making recommendations to the Board as to its structure, size
and composition
  preparing a description of the role and capabilities required for
any particular appointment
  being responsible for identifying and nominating for the approval
of the Board, candidates to ﬁll Board vacancies as and when
they arise
  reviewing succession planning processes with regard to both
Board and senior appointments
  assessing and articulating the time needed to fulﬁl the role of
Chairman, and Non-Executive Directors
  undertaking an annual performance evaluation to ensure 
that all members of the Board have devoted sufﬁcient time to
their duties. 
During the year the Nomination Committee met three times to fulﬁl
these responsibilities. 
Performance evaluation
The Code requires each company to conduct performance evaluations
of its Board, committees and individual Directors and to report on
these evaluations. Evaluations of the individual Directors, the Board,
the Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees were
performed during the year through the use of tailored questionnaires.
The results of each questionnaire were reviewed and reported back
to the Board or relevant committee by the Chairman of that body. In
each case, specific strengths and perceived weaknesses were
highlighted and discussed, and any resultant requirements
documented.
The performance evaluation of each individual Director, including the
Chairman, was also performed during the year by the completion by
each Board member and the Company Secretary of a series of
questionnaires. The results of these were communicated to the Board
by the Chairman, or in the case of the appraisal of the Chairman, by
the Non-Executive Directors led by the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director noting any appropriate actions that were required. 
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the signiﬁcance of effective communication
with both institutional and private investors, and the need to respond
promptly to queries received. During the year the Group published
interim ﬁnancial statements, which are available to all shareholders
via the Group’s website (www.innovation-group.com). The website
also includes material presented at institutional investor meetings,
a library of all stock exchange notices issued by the Group and other
information on the Group such as press releases and contact details.
During the year the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Group
Finance Director held presentations for, and attended meetings with,
analysts and institutional shareholders. The Annual General Meeting
is also used as a forum to introduce the Directors to shareholders and
to take questions from investors. All Non-Executive Directors attended
the Annual General Meeting held in 2007, including the Senior
Independent Director. The Senior Independent Director attends
sufﬁcient meetings to develop a balanced view of shareholders needs.
In addition the Chairman and Senior Independent Director have
notiﬁed themselves to all major shareholders and offered themselves
as an alternative point of contact for any matters of concern. 
The Directors meet the Group’s brokers to discuss items raised by
shareholders and feedback from the analysts attending the interim
and annual presentations is also collated by the Group’s advisors and
reviewed by the Directors. The Directors also receive copies of analyst
coverage as and when it is released. 
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 22 23
Internal control and risk management
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining the
Group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness.
By its nature however, such a system is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and
can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. 
The Board views risk management as integral to good business
practice and has designed its risk identiﬁcation and management
processes so as to be part of its normal review and decision making
activities. These include a continuous process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group with
controls and review processes designed to ensure effort and
management time is focused on the areas where attention is required.
The Board is also regularly updated on issues of importance through
the Board meeting documentation and determines appropriate actions
as necessary.
As with any business, risk factors may affect the Group, its results and
the Board’s ability to deliver on its strategy. A list of some of the main
risk areas, not all of which are within the Directors’ control, is given
below:
  on a global basis the Group’s footprint within certain territories
compared to competitors
  the Group is dependent upon the maintenance of service level
agreements with insurance industry clients
  the Group relies on its relationships with its supplier networks
  the Group’s software solutions must remain technologically
competitive and these must be properly protected
  the Group is exposed to certain external risks including
exchange translation risks as approximately 75% of Innovation
revenues are generated outside of the UK
  the ﬁnancial failure of a major customer .
Other factors may also affect the Group.
Key elements of the Group’s internal control system, targeted at
mitigating the above risks include:
  a clearly defined management structure and delegation of
authority to committees of the Board, executive committee and
business units
  a detailed budgeting process culminating in approval by the
Board
  timely and accurate ﬁnancial reporting of historical results and
regular re-forecasting of future proﬁt and cash ﬂow performance 
  Board information and meeting agendas linked to identiﬁed
risks to ensure review of progress in key risk areas
  quality, knowledge and integrity of personnel maintained
through recruitment, training and communication activities
  day to day hands-on involvement in selected business areas by
the Executive Directors
  use of internal audit and external professional advisors.
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with
Turnbull guidance. It has been in place for the year under review and
up to the date of the approval of these ﬁnancial statements. The
Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, including
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls, based on a review of
signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed and reports prepared by management, and
the internal and external auditors.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee and the Board consider auditor objectivity and
independence, ensuring, in particular, that this is not compromised
where the auditor provides non-audit services. It is the Group’s policy
to use the services of advisors other than the external auditors for
non-audit work where conflicts may arise for significant new
assignments, but it is also recognised that in certain cases the
incumbent auditor is often best placed to provide a cost and time
efficient service, in particular in areas such as tax advice and
compliance and due diligence. In order to safeguard and help ensure
independence the Chairman of the Audit Committee is consulted
prior to each major non-audit engagement where the use of the
auditor is proposed. 
Going concern basis
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have formed a
judgement, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, that
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason the Directors have adopted the going concern
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board recognises that to achieve objectives over the long term,
sustainability of the environment, contributing to the local and global
communities, taking a responsible and positive approach to
employment practices and employees and generally building a
position as a respected corporate citizen are issues that cannot be
overlooked.
The Board also recognises that corporate social responsibility needs
to be considered as part of the Board’s strategy of actively managing
the risks faced by the business, its responsibilities to its clients and
stakeholders, as well as to its reputation.
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 23 24
The approach to corporate responsibility consequently covers three
key areas:
  governance, in which the Group has an established governance
framework compliant with the requirements of the Code 
  employees and health and safety, where the aim is to have
skilled and motivated employees working in safe environments
supported through Group HR and health and safety policies
  the environment, community involvement and corporate
conduct.
The Board as a whole is responsible for health and safety and
environmental matters however on a day to day basis these matters
are reported to the Group Finance Director .
The Board is supportive of environmental initiatives where these are
commercially viable, and continues to support the recycling program
initiated by the Group’s UK business.
Across the Group, the following have been identiﬁed as being areas
where its activities directly impact the environment:
  employee travel
  water and energy consumption
  waste management and use of hazardous materials
  site management and good housekeeping
  materials used in its purchases of ﬁxed assets and consumables.
The Group also indirectly impacts the environment through the actions
of its suppliers, in particular where the outsourcing businesses
perform supply chain management services. In these cases, the
Group’s supply chain is required to ensure it complies with local
health and safety and environmental legislation.
Primarily as a result of the BEE transaction in South Africa several
new initiatives have started. The Group’s South African business now
sponsors 10 students to have access to education, stationery, school
uniforms and food and provides tuition fees and books for five
university students. These individuals will be joining the Company
after graduation. An HIV/AIDS initiative has also commenced where
the Group is in partnership with AIDS consortium providing education
and mentoring for people who care for very ill AIDS patients and
caring for orphans and vulnerable children as a result of HIV/AIDS.
Employees in the Group’s South African business continue to support
sports sponsorship, particularly soccer development and cycling,
orphans Christmas parties and old age home support.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
as adopted by the European Union. 
The Directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each
ﬁnancial year which present fairly the ﬁnancial position of the Group
and the ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows of the Group for that
period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are
required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; 
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial
performance; and
  state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) currently comprises
David Thorpe (Chairman), Kurt Lauk and James Morley who are, in
the opinion of the Board, independent of management. Following the
appointment to the Board of Kurt Lauk and James Morley, both Geoff
Squire and Chris Banks, previously members of the Committee,
resigned from the Committee. The attendance at meetings of all
members during the year is shown on page 21. The terms of reference
of the Committee are available on the Group’s website at
www.innovation-group.com. As described in more detail in the
Corporate Governance report above, the Committee is responsible for
recommending the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the
Chairman to the Board. In addition, the Committee also reviews the
remuneration of the senior management team. 
The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants,
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (“NBSC”), to advise on all aspects
of Senior Executive remuneration. NBSC has no other connection
with the Group other than in the provision of advice on executive and
employee remuneration. The Chief Executive also provides guidance
to the Committee on remuneration of the Senior Executive team at the
invitation of the Committee. 
The remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors is
determined by the executive members of the Board within the limits
set out in the Articles of Association. Non-Executive Directors are
not eligible to participate in short or long term incentive plans or to
receive any pension from the Group. 
A review of Non-Executive Directors’ fees has taken place in light of
comparable fee levels paid in the wider market and each individual
Director’s anticipated time commitment and responsibilities.The
result of the review was that the Non-Executive fees have been
increased as follows:
Chairman £90,000 
Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of Audit Committee £47,000
Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of Remuneration Committee £47,000
Other Non-Executive Directors £44,000 
Remuneration policies
The Group’s remuneration policy which applies to the year under
review, and is intended to apply in the forthcoming year, seeks to
provide remuneration in a form and amount to attract, motivate and
retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Group’s
position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value
to shareholders. In line with the Code’s recommendations, a substantial
proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is delivered through
short and long term performance related pay schemes.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors:
1. ﬁxed pay, comprising base salary, pension scheme contributions
and other beneﬁts
2. annual performance related remuneration
3. long term performance related remuneration in the form of
performance share plan (“PSP”) incentives and global
management incentives (“GMIP”) (see audited section below).
Base Salaries
The salary levels of individual Executive Directors are reviewed
annually, by the Committee, during the ﬁrst quarter of each ﬁnancial
year with account taken of individual performance, skill and pay levels
for similar roles in comparable international computer and software
companies and the wider market. A review of Executive Directors’
base salaries at the start of the ﬁnancial year under review was
performed and as a result the base salary for the Chief Executive,
Hassan Sadiq was increased to £285,000 from £220,000. The
Committee considered this increase appropriate to maintain a broadly
median base salary level vis-à-vis companies of a comparable size
within the FTSE Computer and Software Services Sector and
companies of a similar size drawn across all FTSE Sectors. In addition,
in setting this revised base salary level, the Committee also took into
consideration the Chief Executive’s performance in post, his below
market pension provision and the fact that this increase was the ﬁrst
he has received in two years.
Pension & Beneﬁts
The Executive Directors participate in a defined contribution
arrangement into which the Company contributes 7.5% of base salary.
In addition to pension beneﬁts, the Executive Directors also receive
private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and a fully
expensed company car or car allowance. 
Annual performance related remuneration
Year ended 30 September 2007
For the year under review, the maximum bonus opportunity for the
Chief Executive was 100% of base salary and 75% of base salary for the
Group Finance Director . These bonuses, which were payable on a sliding
scale were dependent on the achievement of targets relating to adjusted
proﬁt (as deﬁned in the Finance Director’ s Review) which the Committee
believe were stretching. Based on the Group’s performance relative to
these targets both the Executive Directors received a bonus on account
of the Group’s adjusted proﬁt target of approximately 70% of the
maximum achievable. The Group Finance Director’s payment relates
to his time in post as both interim Group Finance Director with effect
from 6 December 2006 and subsequently permanent Group Finance
Director following his appointment on 22 May 2007.
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 26 27
Annual performance related remunerationcontinued
Year ended 30 September 2008
The total potential bonus payable to Directors is 100% of base salary
in the case of the Chief Executive and 75% of base salary in the case
of the Group Finance Director. The bonus targets are set by the
Committee at the start of each ﬁnancial year and the bonuses are
payable predominantly with reference to the achievement of a sliding
scale of challenging adjusted proﬁt targets (as deﬁned in the Finance
Director’s Review).
Long Term Performance Related Remuneration 
The Committee reviews the incentive arrangements offered to the
Senior Executive population on an annual basis, taking into
consideration the strategic objectives of the Company and investors’
best practice guidelines. As a result of a review in 2006, the
Committee recommended the implementation of a new Global
Management Incentive Plan (the “GMIP”) which was subsequently
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in
March 2007.
The GMIP enables three types of awards to be made:
  Performance Awards
  Restricted Stock Awards; and
  Deferred Bonus Awards
Only Executive Directors are eligible to receive Performance Awards,
with the other types of award being introduced to motivate the most
Senior Non-Board Executives, particularly those based outside of 
the U.K.
Performance Awards were to be made on a “one-off” basis only to
Executive Directors, recognising the Company’s objectives of creating
returns for shareholders through the growth of its existing businesses
at the same time as providing a material incentive to deliver value from
the acquisition of First Notice Systems, leverage the growth
opportunities that the acquisition provided and assist in the
recruitment of a new Group Finance Director .
A summary of the Performance Awards made under the GMIP is set
out below, with full details of the GMIP having been set out in last
year’s Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Award Limit
The Chief Executive received a conditional award of 6,000,000 shares.
The Group Finance Director received a conditional award of 1,000,000
shares granted on 20 December 2007. The terms of this award were
agreed on appointment but due to restrictions in share dealings this
was the earliest available date the Remuneration Committee were
able to make the award. The performance conditions on these awards
are measured over a three year period commencing 1 October 2006. 
Performance Conditions
Two separate earnings per share (“EPS”) growth conditions were set.
For a third of the shares comprising each award, vesting takes place
based on the following EPS performance:
Adjusted EPS Growth
over the three year period Proportion of Award Vesting
RPI + 21% 0%
RPI + 60% 100%
Straight line vesting occurs between these points
For the remaining two thirds, vesting takes place based on the
following, more challenging EPS performance:
Adjusted EPS Growth
over the three year period Proportion of Award Vesting
RPI + 60% 0%
RPI + 100% 100%
Straight line vesting occurs between these points
In addition to the above EPS growth conditions, vesting will also be
contingent on the satisfaction of a total shareholder return underpin
that requires the Company total shareholder return to be at least
equal to the median of that of the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap
Index over the performance period (although the Committee may
determine it inappropriate to apply the underpinning condition in
exceptional circumstances).
To the extent that the above performance award vests, shares will
be released one-half on 15 March 2010 with half of the balance of
shares each being released on 15 March 2011 and 15 March 2012,
subject to continued employment. The phased release of shares is
considered by the Committee to have the potential to act as substantial
retention mechanism and further align the interests of the Executive
Directors with shareholders.
The use of EPS as the primary performance measure reﬂects the
Company’s strong focus on the delivery of earnings growth during
the next three-year period with the total shareholder return underpin
reﬂecting the Company’s commitment to deliver above market returns
to shareholders. 
From 2008 onwards, Executive Directors will revert to participating in
the Company’s Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), adopted on 29 June
2005. No awards were made to the Executive Directors under the
PSP during the year under review in light of the adoption of the GMIP .
The key features of the PSP are as follows:
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 27 28
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Award Limit
The PSP enables Executive Directors to receive conditional annual
awards of shares up to an equivalent of 1 x their annual base salary.
Performance Conditions
For awards made to date under the PSP, the vesting of awards has
been conditional on meeting the performance conditions set out
below over a three year performance period.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (50% of awards)
Three Year EPOS Growth Percentage of Award Vesting
Below RPI + 12% No vesting
RPI + 12% 15%
RPI + 45% 50%
Straight line vesting occurs between these points
Total Shareholder Return (50% of awards)
The Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) is measured relative to
the constituents of the FTSE Software and Computer Services and
FTSE Support Services with vesting taking place as set out below:
Ranking of the Company’s TSR Percentage of Award Vesting
Below Median No vesting
Median 15%
Upper Quartile 50%
Straight line vesting occurs between these points
While the Committee does not currently anticipate changing the
performance measures applying to PSP awards in advance of making
awards in 2008, the performance ranges will be revisited to ensure
that they remain appropriate for the current circumstances of 
the Company.
The Group has historically operated share option schemes. Details
of awards made and the associated performance conditions are 
set out in the table contained on page 29. Future options issues 
will vest based upon EPS growth plus 10%, although it is not currently
anticipated that Executive Directors will participate in any future
share option awards.
Dilution limits
Shareholders approved a reworking of the Company’s dilution limits
at the AGM in March 2007 that allows it to issue up to 12.5% of its
issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period to employees under
all share plans. Previously the Company had operated within a 10%
in 10 years discretionary limit and a 15% in 10 years all schemes
limit. This re-working of the existing dilution limits was considered
to provide a better balance between the need to operate competitive
incentive schemes in a global environment and limiting shareholder
dilution. The current level of dilution is approximately 7.2% and the
Company remains committed to managing dilution as efﬁciently as
possible. 
Service contracts 
The Directors have each entered in to service agreements or letters
of appointment between themselves and the Group as noted below.
The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for all the
Executive Directors that continue indeﬁnitely unless determined by
notice. Each of the Non-Executive Directors is employed for an initial
term of three years. In line with the Code, each Non-Executive Director
is typically expected to serve two three-year terms, although in certain
circumstances the Board may decide to extend this to three or more
three-year terms.
In October 2007 Geoff Squire renewed his employment terms for a
further three years, his previous letter of employment having expired.
Geoff Squire has served two three-year terms on the Board and was
invited by the Board to serve a further three years.
In March 2007 Kurt Lauk and James Morley were appointed to the
Board as Non-Executive Directors. Details of their service contracts
are given below along with those of the other Directors serving during
the year .
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive Directors
with regard to compensation in the event of loss of ofﬁce or in the event
of a change of control.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Share options and long-term incentives continued
Option/LTIP grants and corresponding prices above have been
adjusted to reﬂect the rights issue completed in December 2006 in line
with the relevant plan rules. The intended impact of the adjustment
was to maintain the “value” to each option/LTIP award pre and post
rights issue.
Paul Smolinski ceased to be a Director on 31 January 2007 and, 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, was assigned ‘good

a gain of £448,000 on the exercise of options and awards exercised 
on 30 January 2007 on which date the share price was £0.35p. 
There were no other gains to any other Director in either the current
or previous ﬁnancial years.
In accordance with his service contract, Paul Hemsley was granted an
award comprising 1,000,000 shares under the GMIP on 20 December
2007. 
On 15 March 2007, the date of grant of the awards to Hassan Sadiq,
the Company’s share price was £0.33.
Performance conditions
Full details of performance conditions are given in note 27 to these
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) In common with all options granted by the Company prior to 
4 October 2003, these options had no performance conditions

given above if EPS growth, adjusted for amortisation of intangible
assets, share-based payment charges and any adjustments
required in respect of exceptional gains or charges that may
arise (including for example the impact of IFRS on the Group’s
future results) as made at the discretion of the Committee,
exceeds RPI plus 3% per annum. The base EPS being that for the
year ended 30 September 2004. 
(c) Awards will vest subject to the performance conditions set out
above for awards made under the PSP .
(d) Awards will vest subject to the performance conditions set out
above for awards made under the GMIP .

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
THE INNOVATION GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of The Innovation
Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 32. These Group
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of The Innovation Group Plc for the year ended 
30 September 2007 and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group ﬁnancial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information
given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information
presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Statement and the Finance Director’s Review that is cross referenced
from the Review of the Business section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined
Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover
all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement,
the Finance Director’s Review, the Corporate Governance Statement
and the unaudited section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
Group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
Group ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2007 and of
its proﬁt for the year then ended; 
  the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the Group ﬁnancial statements.

1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS
The ﬁnancial statements of The Innovation Group plc (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 September 2007 were authorised for issue by the
Board of the Directors on 3 December 2007 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Paul Hemsley. The Innovation Group
plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London
Stock Exchange.
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted
by the European Union. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2. 
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Group is required to prepare its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Group ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000s), except where
otherwise indicated. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of The Innovation Group plc and the entities it controls drawn up to 
30 September 2007.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the
investee so as to obtain beneﬁt from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights; currently exercisable
or convertible potential voting rights; or by way of contractual agreement. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same
reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated,
including unrealised proﬁts and losses arising from them.
The results and cash ﬂows relating to a business are included in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Minority interests represent the portion of proﬁt or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented
separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from parent shareholders’ equity.
Interests in associates
The Group’s interests in associates, being those entities over which it has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and which are not subsidiaries, are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost
plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in the
value of individual investments. The Group income statement reﬂects the share of the associate’s results after tax.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share
of the net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the associate
and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater
than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of the associate’s proﬁt or loss in the period in which the
investment is acquired. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, management has had to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
that have been made in preparing the consolidated financial statements are detailed below and in specific accounting policy notes. 
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events which can vary from what is anticipated.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Unearned premium reserves
The assumption is made that future claims will follow a similar pattern to that of historical experience. A claims curve is derived from the
claims experience of the Group and is based on expired contracts. The majority of the contracts issued are 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months in
length. Contracts with different term lengths are pro-rated. Revenue is recognised according to its position on the curve. Costs are recognised
as incurred. The claims curves are assessed on an annual basis by management and updated for any signiﬁcant changes in the trend of claims.
This year the management review resulted in an additional £60,000 being recognised as revenue.
Deferred income in the outsourcing division
Administration fees are recognised according to management’s best estimate of when effort is incurred and service delivered. Previously,
administration fees earned in the Groups maintenance division were recognised on a straight line basis however during the year recognition
was moved to best reﬂect effort incurred. This resulted in an additional £750,000 being recognised as revenue.
Due to changes in the risk proﬁle on one subsidence customer, allocation of administration fees has been amended resulting in a further
£322,000 being recognised as revenue in the year .
Proﬁt recognition in Group cell captives
Management recognise proﬁt in the cell captive based on an excess of funds held compared to future costs to settle claims. Management
have sufﬁcient history on the proﬁle of these claims to predict future costs with a high degree of accuracy.
Intangible assets
In accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included within
intangible assets. IFRS 3 also requires the identiﬁcation of other intangible assets acquired. Although the techniques used to value these
assets are in line with internationally used models, they do require the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes. Models
used are the Multi Period Excess Earnings for customer relationships and lists and the Relief From Royalty method for valuing trade names
and software.
Income taxes
In recognising income taxes and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions
and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where the ﬁnal outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different,
from previous assessments made by management, a change in the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in
the period in which such determination is made.
Revenue
The Group derives its revenues from fees for transactions processed on behalf of clients, the sale of software licences, solution delivery
implementation services, maintenance and post contract customer support services (“PCS services”) and licence rental fees. 
Fees earned by the outsourcing division – The Group receives payments either as principal or agent. Receipts typically comprise one or more
of the following elements: administrative fees, fees for which the Group provides an additional service or where the Group receives funds in
relation to claims it has assumed the risk for settling.
Revenue is normally recorded on a net basis and comprises fees for administrative and other services. Where the Group has assumed the risk
of settling claims on behalf of the client, revenue is recorded on a gross basis and includes the element of income relating to that cost.
Revenues are recognised in line with the performance of the related services or referred work, including where appropriate, an assessment
of accrued income. 
On-risk contracts
In a small number of cases the Group has entered into ‘risk and reward’ contracts.
The Group receives premiums in advance for on-risk contracts. The premium is split between administration fees paid in advance and a fund
portion, which is used to cover the future claims that relate to the contract.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Revenue continued
In the case of service and maintenance plans the administration fees received in advance are recognised according to the effort incurred
and service delivered. The fund portion is deferred, but is recognised over the period of the contract based on a claims curve derived from
past claims experience. 
In the case of subsidence claims the administration fee is recognised over the period of the claim and the fund portion is deferred in a ‘repairer
reserve’ in the balance sheet in order to meet future repair costs. As repair costs are incurred, income will be recognised from the repairer
reserve to cover this cost. Any anticipated losses are accrued immediately. If there are any reserves remaining at the conclusion of a
contract, these are released to the income statement. 
New solution sales often involve software licences being sold together with PCS and/or implementation services. Where the commercial
substance of such a combination is that the individual components operate independently of each other and fair values are attributable to
each of the components, each are then recognised in accordance with their respective policies described below.
Fees earned by the software division – Where it is not possible to attribute reliable fair values to two or more components these are viewed
as a combination and revenue is recognised on the combined revenue streams in proportion to the Group’s right to receiving consideration
on the combination at the balance sheet date. For example, when software licences are sold together with implementation services and the
fair value of either element is not determinable, both software licence and the implementation services are recognised using the percentage
of completion method with provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts being recorded in the period in which such losses become
probable based on the current contract cost estimates. When software licences are sold together with PCS services and the fair value of
either revenue stream is not determinable, the licence income is recognised over the period of the PCS services.
The revenue recognition policies for separately identiﬁable revenue streams are as follows:
Initial licence fees – revenues are recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the licence fee
is ﬁxed or determinable, the collection of the fee is reasonably assured, no signiﬁcant obligations with regard to installation or implementation
of the software remain, and customer acceptance, when applicable, has been obtained.
Maintenance and other PCS services – revenues are recognised rateably over the explicit, or an implicit, PCS services term.
Solution delivery implementation services – revenues are billed on a time-and-materials basis and are recognised as the related services
are performed. However, if the consulting agreement is a ﬁxed-fee arrangement, revenue may be recognised using the percentage of
completion method as the related services are performed, or recognised in stages on achievement of milestones. Provisions for estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract cost
estimates. 
Contract initiation costs
Signiﬁcant start up costs for long term outsourcing contracts incurred at the commencement of the contract are deferred and expensed
over the contract term. 
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure incurred in the development of software and hardware products for use or sale by the business, and their related intellectual
property rights, is capitalised as an intangible asset only when:
  technical feasibility has been demonstrated;
  adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources exist to complete the development, which the Group intends to complete and use;
  future economic beneﬁts expected to arise are deemed probable; and
  the costs can be reliably measured.
Development costs not meeting these criteria are expensed in the income statement as incurred. Capitalised development costs are
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives once the related software and hardware products are available to use.
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:03  Page 40 41
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s
interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and
is not amortised. 
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before 1 October 2004. As a result
goodwill recognised on any business combinations that took place prior to 1 October 2004 is recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP
in the functional currency of the acquiring entity. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review. 
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets or equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the
date of exchange, plus costs directly attributed to the acquisition. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses are never reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business
segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken
into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it. 
Deferred consideration is capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition and is discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Where the
consideration is contingent, any revision to the amount payable is adjusted through goodwill. 
Where a put or call option exists the option is fair valued by reference to the present value of its expected exercise price. If it is considered
that the option gives the Group, in substance, present ownership in the shares, the option is considered to be contingent consideration and
the corresponding minority interest will be derecognised. Where this is not the case, the option is treated as a ﬁnancial liability with
subsequent fair value movements being taken to the income statement. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Internally generated intangible assets, excluding internally generated software and capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and
expenditure is charged against income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite. Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over the
useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life is reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial
year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset are
accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates and adjustments
are reﬂected prospectively. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense
category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The useful economic lives of the intangible assets are as follows:
Software licences 5 to 7 years
Customer relationships 5 to 12 years
Customer lists 2 years
Trade names 5 years
Intellectual property 5 years

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such cost includes costs
directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. On other assets it is calculated to write off their cost less estimated residual value, based on
prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. These are
as follows:
Freehold property 50 years
Property improvements 10 to 15 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings 4 to 15 years
Motor vehicles 4 years 
Computer systems 5 years
Computer equipment 2 to 3 years
The useful economic lives and residual values assigned to property, plant and equipment are assessed on an annual basis. The carrying
values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
may not be recoverable. 
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or
when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined
for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to
its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no
longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss
is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment
loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset
in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Pensions
The Group contributes to group personal pension schemes for its staff according to individual’s contract terms. Contributions payable by
the Group to these schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate. All such schemes are deﬁned contribution
arrangements, the assets of which are held separately from the Group.

Share based payments
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity settled awards so as to apply
IFRS 2 only to those equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 and which vest on or after 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the
award. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any
vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition,
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, provided that all other performance conditions
are satisﬁed. Where awards contain both market and non-market conditions, the fair value will be determined using a model that takes into
account the market conditions, however a charge will only be incurred to the extent the non-market conditions are expected to be achieved. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments
that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁcation, based on the difference between the fair value
of the original award and the fair value of the modiﬁed award, both as measured on the date of the modiﬁcation. No reduction is recognised
if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the
income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprises cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents, 
as previously deﬁned, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Investments
Investments in unquoted equity investments which do not have a reliable market value are stated at cost less provision for any impairment
in value. For investments where there is an actively traded market the investment is stated at fair value, determined by reference to a
quoted market bid price at the close of business on the balance sheet date. 
Leases and hire purchase contracts
Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and disclosed under property, plant and equipment at their
estimated fair value, or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments on the inception of each lease or contract and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. The capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the total ﬁnance charge is allocated
over the period of the lease or contract in such a way as to give a constant charge on the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals payable or receivable are charged or credited to the income statement over the lease term.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses
on translation are included in the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency loans to foreign currency subsidiaries
which form part of the net investment. These are taken directly to equity until the date of disposal of the net investment, at which time they
are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, where this represents a reasonable approximation of actual exchange
rates at the date of transactions. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a
foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income
statement.
The Group previously applied the exemption in IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption” to reset cumulative exchange differences on net investment in
foreign operations to zero at the date of transition.
During the year the most signiﬁcant currencies, other than Sterling, were the US Dollar, South African Rand and the Euro. The average annual
exchange rates used to convert results into Sterling are shown in the table below: 
Currency 2007 2006
US dollar 1.98 1.80
South African Rand 14.18 11.99
Euro 1.48 1.46
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed, based
on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable proﬁt. 
Deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised on all temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and associates
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable
future. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction, other than
a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss.
Deferred tax assets on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries or associates are recognised only to the extent that it
is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable proﬁts will be available against which the temporary
difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary
difference or unused deferred tax asset can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Where deferred tax assets are recognised subsequent to an acquisition, such as when the beneﬁt of the acquiree’s income tax loss carry
forwards have since been realised, the deferred tax income is recognised in taxation and a corresponding reduction is made to goodwill,
which is recognised as an operating expense. The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:04  Page 44 45
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Taxation continued
In the United Kingdom, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as remuneration on exercise of certain employee share
options. As explained under “Share based payments” above, a remuneration expense is recorded in the Group’s income statement over the
period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax
bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded. The deferred tax asset arising on share option awards is calculated as the estimated amount
of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the Group’s share price at the balance sheet date) pro-rated to the extent that the
services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period. If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration
expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings. Similarly, current tax relief in excess of
the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is also recorded in retained earnings. No remuneration charge is
recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005. Nevertheless, tax deductions have
arisen and will continue to arise on these options. The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity against
retained earnings. No deferred tax asset is recognised with respect to this where there is no certainty of taxable proﬁts being generated in
appropriate locations that the deferred tax asset could be utilised against. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability
is settled. This is based upon tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classiﬁed as either ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and receivables and
held-to-maturity investments, as appropriate. When ﬁnancial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the
case of ﬁnancial assets not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classiﬁcation
of its ﬁnancial assets after initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each ﬁnancial year-end.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets classiﬁed as held for trading are included in the category ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss’. Financial assets
are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives are also classiﬁed as held for
trading unless they are designated and effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Gains and losses are recognised in net proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management believe it to be probable
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to net present value where this is deemed to be material.

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements in the period of initial application. 
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its ﬁnancial instruments, their signiﬁcance and the
nature and extent of risks that they give rise to. More speciﬁcally the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its ﬁnancial instruments
and its risk exposure in greater detail. There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
During the year the Group adopted IFRIC 4 and in the prior year adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39. None of these have had a material impact on
the Group.

There are temporary differences which arise in connection with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries. Since the Group is able to control
the dividend distributions from these companies it is unlikely that further UK tax on repatriation of these earnings will be payable in the
foreseeable future. Consequently, no deferred tax liability has been provided.

Unutilised deferred tax assets largely relate to carried forward tax losses which are available for offset against future proﬁts of the companies
in which the losses have arisen. These losses do not expire. These assets have not been recognised on the basis that there is insufﬁcient evidence
that the asset will be recoverable at the balance sheet date. The assets will only be recognised with improved predictability of taxable proﬁts. 
During March 2007 the UK government announced Budget tax changes which, if enacted in the proposed manner, will have a signiﬁcant
effect on the Company’s future tax position. At 30 September 2007 these changes to the UK tax system had not been implemented and so
their effect is not reﬂected in the Company’s balance sheet at 30 September 2007. However, as at the date of signing, they may be regarded
as ‘substantively enacted’. It is proposed that the rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008. This rate
change will both affect the amount of future cash tax payments to be made by the Company and will also reduce the size of the Company’s
unrecognised deferred tax asset. The unrecognised deferred tax disclosed above has been adjusted for this rate change. 
Changes to the UK capital allowance regime have also been proposed; the most signiﬁcant of these changes for the Company is the
reduction in the rate of capital allowances applicable to plant and machinery expenditure from 25% to 20% per annum on a reducing
balance basis from 1 April 2008.

13. GOODWILL continued
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units. The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying
value of goodwill using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied and
the future growth rate of net operating cash ﬂows. 
The goodwill acquired at 1 October 2004 has been allocated to one of two cash-generating units, outsourcing or software. Since 1 October
2004, goodwill arising on acquisition shall be allocated to individual cash-generating units, where it is possible to continue to attribute future
cash ﬂows to these cash-generating units.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units is as follows:

Pre 1 October 2004 and integrated acquisitions 19,135 11,984
70,575 33,372
The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts for these cash generating units based on the most recent annual budgets approved by the Board.
These are based upon internal forecasts of future growth over a ﬁve year period and cash ﬂows beyond the ﬁve year period extrapolated
using expected growth rates. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The calculation of value in use for all of the business units is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
  EBITA
  discount rates
  growth rates used to extrapolate cash ﬂows beyond the budget period. 
EBITA is derived from management budgets which are based on the performance of the Group over the past twelve months. 
Discount rates reﬂect management’s estimation of the rate of return that would be expected from a rational investor over the period of the
forecast. These pre-tax rates vary from 8% to 16% for the outsourcing segment and 9% for the software segment.
Growth rate estimates for a three year period are based on discounted forecasts. Growth estimates for future years exceeding the forecast
are in the range of 3% to 5%. These rates have been discounted from analysts’ expectations.

13. GOODWILL continued
Impairment
At 30 September 2007 an impairment provision of £679,000 was made against the carrying value of the goodwill attributable to Maxicare
Holdings Pty Limited (“Maxicare”), a subsidiary of the Group’s South African subsidiary. Value in use calculations were prepared using a
growth assumption of 5% and a post tax discount rate of 11.76%. Due to both changes in the underlying market in which the subsidiary operates
and foreign exchange ﬂuctuations between Sterling and the South African Rand future cash ﬂows no longer supported the carrying value. 
Impairment provisions as at 30 September 2006 amounted to £40,000.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regard to the assessment of value in use of all Group businesses management believes that, with the exception of Maxicare as noted
above, there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed
its recoverable amount. 
For Maxicare, which was impaired by £679,000 to leave £2,596,000 of goodwill at the year end, there are reasonably possible changes which
could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. This is discussed below:
  Growth rates – management recognises that the demand for the current Maxicare product in South Africa has fallen. Should the
growth rates identiﬁed, particularly around new product lines and customers, not materialise this would give rise to a further decrease
in carrying value. At zero growth rate, a further impairment of £440,000 would arise.

The Group has a 100% shareholding in a cell captive structure which is part of Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited (registered in South
Africa). As the Group has no control over the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the cell it has not been consolidated. The Group does have
a signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the cell and it is therefore accounted for as an associate using the equity method of accounting. The Group’s
share of net proﬁt has been brought into the income statement with the investment carried at fair value in the balance sheet. The cell is a
“Special Purpose Entity” as deﬁned by SIC 12.

On-risk contracts currently fall into two categories: service and maintenance plan contracts and subsidence contracts.
a Subsidence contracts
In order to manage the risks around these contracts, each individual subsidence claim is assessed for possible repudiation and total
potential exposure to costs if it is not possible to repudiate the claim. Analysis is performed on a regular basis to ensure that there are adequate
funds available to cover the assessed potential exposure to costs. This includes an assessment of costs to complete on a contract by
contract basis. If this percentage remains below 100%, then there are sufﬁcient funds to cover the potential future costs. In both the current
and previous ﬁnancial years, the percentage is below 100%. The contract includes terms to ensure that any excess of three claims greater
than £75,000 are reverted to the insurer. The insurance company is invoiced in advance for claims so cash is always available to meet the
repair costs. Since October 2006 all amounts are re-insured.
b Service and maintenance plans
In order to manage the risks around these contracts all vehicles are assessed in terms of make, model, age and distance driven to date.
Service plan contracts are only sold for vehicles if the above criteria fall within set parameters. 
Fund burn analyses are performed periodically to ensure that there are adequate funds available to pay future expected claims. If this
percentage remains below 100%, then the fund is sufﬁcient to cover future claims. In both the current and previous ﬁnancial years, the
percentage is below 100%. 
The Group has on-risk contracts for both service and maintenance plans. The ratio at the end of the year is 94.5% service and 5.5%
maintenance (2006: 97% and 3%). As these plans can be priced accurately due to parts having to be replaced at speciﬁc intervals, risk due
to uncertainty is mitigated to satisfactory levels.
Both service and maintenance plans expire on the earlier of either the ﬁxed length of the plan or the distance limit being reached. 
These contracts are not re-insured as management believe it is possible to price the contracts very accurately.

Borrowings comprise the following:
A bank loan advanced during the year to purchase Sureplan International (Pty) Limited. See note 16c for further information on this
transaction. This loan, totalling £5,250,000, was advanced in two stages. The ﬁrst £3,000,000 was advanced on 25 October 2006 when the
51% stake was acquired and a subsequent £2,250,000 on 29 August 2007 on purchase of the remaining 49%. The loan is repayable on a
quarterly basis, with the ﬁnal repayment to be made on 1 September 2010. Interest is charged based on a rate that is 1.625% above LIBOR
on the 1st day of that quarter. As at 30 September 2007 the balance outstanding on this loan was £4,327,000 (2006: £nil).
A bank loan of ZAR 132,000,000 advanced to Inthutuko Investments Limited in order to acquire a 25% shareholding in The Innovation Group
(Pty) Limited as part of the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transaction. Due to the majority share holding in Inthutuko Investments
by an Employee Beneﬁt Trust of The Innovation Group (Pty) Limited, Inthutuko is considered by management to be controlled by the
Innovation Group plc via interpretation of SIC 12 Special Purpose Entities. Interest is charged on this loan based on JIBAR rate plus a 1.5%
margin. At the same time the Group entered into an interest rate swap to ﬁx the interest rate (see note 25).Repayment of the capital is based
on an increasing ratchet as economic beneﬁt of the BEE deal is achieved. In order to obtain the loan, a guarantee for repayment of the loan
was provided by the ultimate parent company of the Group, The Innovation Group plc. As at 30 September 2007 the balance outstanding on
this loan was £9,692,000 (2006: £nil).
A bank loan advanced during the previous year represents a €10,000,000 facility utilised by the Group to purchase Innovation Property AG
(previously Service Konzept AG). See Note 16i for further information on this transaction. This loan is repayable according to a standard
quarterly repayment schedule ending on 1 December 2009. The loan bears interest at 2% above the European Interbank rate (Euribor) and
is paid on a quarterly basis. As at 30 September 2007 the balance outstanding on this loan was £3,937,000 (2006: £5,504,000)
A bank loan acquired in the previous year as part of the AMK Associates Limited acquisition. See note 16i for further information on this
transaction. As at 30 September 2007 the balance outstanding on this loan was £157,000 (2006: £188,000).
Other loans comprise a mortgage of £3,152,000 (2006: £4,300,000) secured on the Group’s two freehold premises and is repayable according
to a standard quarterly repayment schedule ending on 2 January 2010. The mortgage bears interest at 1.5% above LIBOR and is paid on a
quarterly basis. 
There are no undrawn amounts under the facilities noted above at 30 September 2007 (30 September 2006: £nil). 
As part of the terms and conditions of the bank loans, the Group has to satisfy a number of covenants on a quarterly basis. Since the date
of the advancement of the bank loans and to the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements, these covenants have not been breached.
Finance leases held by the Group primarily relate to the rental of ﬁxtures & ﬁttings and computer equipment for Group companies to utilise
in the course of their business. The leases cover periods of between two to ﬁve years and are payable under terms with equal monthly or
quarterly instalments. There are no other signiﬁcant restrictions in place in regards to these assets.

25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Objectives, policies and strategies
The Group’s objective has been to ﬁnance acquisitions through new debt capital and cash reserves. Investments in intangible ﬁxed assets,
property, plant and equipment have been made through cash and ﬁnance lease borrowings.
The Group’s policy towards using ﬁnancial instruments is to manage credit, interest rate, liquidity and currency exposure risk without
exposing the Group to undue risk or speculation. The policy is kept under review by the Directors according to the Group’s foreign exchange
and treasury policy.
Risk management
The risks arising from the Group’s operations are explained below.
Credit risk
The Group monitors its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Cash investments are only allowed in liquid securities with major
ﬁnancial institutions that satisfy speciﬁc criteria. The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying
value of ﬁnancial assets and there are no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk. 
Interest rate risk
Interest bearing ﬁnancial assets comprise cash and other debtors and receivables (all due within one year). Interest bearing ﬁnancial
liabilities comprise net obligations under ﬁnance leases, bank loans used to fund the Service Konzept and Sureplan International Pty
Limited acquisitions and the Black Economic Empowerment transaction plus property mortgages (see note 23 for maturity proﬁle). 
The Group currently relies on the natural hedge of ﬁnancial assets versus ﬁnancial liabilities to manage the risk arising from changes to
ﬂoating interest rates in the majority of cases and it is generally the policy of the Group to hold assets under ﬂoating interest rates. 
The only exception being in relation to the loan taken out for the Black Economic Empowerment transaction. In this instance the Group entered
into an interest rate swap to hedge against the risk of interest rate movements on the Inthutuko loan (as disclosed in note 23). The swap
with a notional value of ZAR 132,000,000 swapped the variable interest rate from JIBAR plus the 1.5% margin to a ﬁxed rate. Gains and losses
on this swap are taken to the income statement and in the current year amounted to a gain of £245,000. The corresponding ﬁnancial asset
is disclosed in note 18.
The interest rate risk proﬁle of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is as follows:

The interest rate risk proﬁle above details cash and cash equivalents only. All other ﬁnancial assets are non-interest bearing. Interest on
ﬂoating rate assets is based on the relevant national inter-bank rates, with short-term deposits being made for varying periods of between
one and seven days depending upon the immediate cash requirements of the Group. Interest rates on these assets range from 0% to 8%
depending on the type of account and the location of the Group entity.

Liquidity risk
The Group’s funds are principally held either as cash or short term money market investments. Short term receivables and payables have
been excluded from the disclosures as they are non-interest bearing and fair value approximates carrying value. 
Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
A summary of the fair values and book values of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is noted below. Market values have been used
to determine the fair value of the listed ﬁnancial assets. The fair values of all other items have been calculated by discounting expected
future cash ﬂows at the prevailing interest rates.

Currency risk
Currency exposure arises through intra-group loans and trading balances throughout all Group locations. Natural hedging is employed, 
to the extent possible, to minimise net exposures, however where signiﬁcant exposures arise outside of intra-group trading, it is Group policy
to enter in to formal hedging arrangements where these can be shown to be effective. It is currently management’s opinion that there is no
need for any such arrangements at this point in time. 
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency
of the operating unit involved, other than those borrowings treated as hedges of foreign equity investments. In general all overseas operating
units trade in their operating currency. The parent company has long term intercompany loans designated in foreign currency. As these are
of a long term nature any foreign exchange arising is taken straight to reserves.

27. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
The Group operates four equity settled share-based payment arrangements: the unapproved company share option scheme, the global share
option and incentive plan, the performance share plan and the global management incentive plan. A summary of the main terms of the
arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment charge has been
recognised.
Unapproved Company Share Option Scheme
No grants have been made under this scheme since 10 August 2000 and it is the expectation of management that the scheme will not be
used in the future. There are no performance conditions attached to these options. All options issued under this scheme are signiﬁcantly
underwater. Due to the early date of grant no share-based payment charge has been recognised for any options under this scheme.
Global Share Option and Incentive Plan
Options granted under this scheme have historically been to Senior Executives and management across the Group, as well as to staff with
high potential or to recognise signiﬁcant achievements. Under this scheme options will usually vest after between two and ﬁve years and
be exercisable between two and ten years following grant, provided that the employee remains in employment at the date of exercise.
Options issued up to 16 March 2004 have no performance conditions attached. Awards issued after this date will vest and become exercisable
between the given dates if EPS growth, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, share-based payment charges and any adjustments
required in respect of exceptional gains or charges that may arise as made at the discretion of the remuneration committee, exceeds 
3% per annum. The base EPS is that for the year ended 30 September 2004. Future options under this scheme will vest based on EPS growth
plus 10%. No awards have been granted under this scheme in the current year.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Awards under this scheme are made to Senior Executives and managers across the Group. The awards will vest subject to meeting the
following two performance conditions. Vesting of up to 50% of the award is based upon the Group's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR")
relative to the TSR of a comparator group of other companies comprising the software and computer services and the support services sector
of the FTSE, over a three year performance period ending 30 September 2007. If the Group's TSR growth ranks below the 50th percentile
over the three year period 0% of the award will vest. At the 50th percentile 15% will vest and at 75% or above, 50% will vest. Between the
50th and 75th percentile vesting will occur on a straight line basis. Vesting of the remaining 50% of the award will be subject to the growth
of the Group's adjusted EPS. 15% of an award will vest for total adjusted EPS growth of 12% above RPI over the performance period, with
50% of an award vesting for total adjusted EPS growth of 45% or more above RPI over the performance period. Between these points, vesting
will occur on a straight line basis. No awards were issued under this scheme in the current year.
Global Management Incentive Plan (“GMIP”)
This scheme was implemented during the year following shareholder approval at the AGM in March 2007. The GMIP enables three types
of awards to be made:
  Performance awards
  Restricted Stock Awards; and
  Deferred bonus awards
Executive Directors only are eligible for performance awards with other types of award being introduced to motivate the most Senior Non-
Board Executives, particularly those based outside of the UK. During the year performance awards were granted to the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer,
as detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 31. Restricted stock awards were granted to Senior Executives. No deferred
bonus awards were made.
Performance conditions on all awards are measured over a three year period commencing 1 October 2006. The performance awards vest
50% in March 2010, 25% in March 2011 and 25% in March 2012 subject to meeting earnings per share (“EPS”) growth targets. No awards
will vest until adjusted EPS growth is RPI+ 21%. One third of the awards will vest on achieving an adjusted EPS growth of RPI+ 60% with the
remaining two thirds vesting on achieving adjusted EPS growth of RPI +100%. Vesting takes place on a straight line basis between these

amounts. In addition to the adjusted EPS growth conditions, vesting will also be contingent on the satisfaction of a total shareholder return
underpin which requires the Company total shareholder return to be at least equal to the median of that of the constituents of the FTSE Small
Cap Index over the performance period (although the Remuneration Committee may determine it inappropriate to apply the underpinning 
condition in exceptional circumstances). The restricted stock awards vest 50% in December 2009, 25% in December 2010 and 25% in
December 2011 subject to meeting EPS growth targets. No awards will vest unless the adjusted EPS growth over the three year period to
30 September 2009 is RPI+ 15.7625% and there is continued employment. On achieving this adjusted EPS growth awards vest in full, subject
to continued employment.
The number of shares subject to options (including those granted to Executive Directors), the date on which they were granted and the periods
in which they may be exercised are given below. Options/LTIP grants and corresponding prices have been adjusted to reﬂect the rights issue
completed in December 2006 in line with the relevant plan rules. The intended impact of the adjustment was to maintain the “value” to each
option/LTIP award pre and post rights issue.

Jala Capital and Employee Trust Fund
Through the Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”) transaction 25% of our South African subsidiary was sold to Inthutuko Investments
Limited (“Inthutuko”). Inthutuko is owned 77.8% by an Employee Share Trust, the beneﬁciaries of which are the Group’s South African
Employees and 22.2% by Jala Capital Investments Limited (“Jala”). Inthutuko is a special purpose vehicle in accordance with SIC 12 and 
is controlled by the Group, hence consolidated. The loan received by Inthutuko to provide the purchase consideration is guaranteed by 
The Innovation Group plc.
The shares granted to Jala are contingent on the achievement of future revenue targets. In the event that these future revenue targets are
met, the shares granted to Jala become owned by Jala for no consideration. If the revenue targets are not met, Jala may purchase the shares
for a ﬁxed amount. The shares granted to Jala attract an IFRS 2 charge. This charge has been calculated over a three year period at
£2,100,000 with £230,000 being charged in the current year and is the fair value of the shares granted to Jala based on the value of the company.
The employees are entitled to income from the dividends granted to the trust for their beneﬁt on a basis proportional to length of service.
No shares are ultimately held by the individuals and hence there is no IFRS2 charge. This charge will be charged to administrative expenses
in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
Further details of the BEE transaction are given in note 32.

Assumptions used in the valuation of share-based payments
In calculating the fair value of the share-based payment arrangements under the Global Share Option and Incentive Plan and the Performance
Share Plan the Group has used the Hull White trinomial model. The fair value of the awards granted under the GMIP scheme and the
assumptions used in the calculation of their fair value on the date of grant were as follows:
2007 2006
Global Management Global Management
Incentive Plan Incentive Plan
Weighted average assumptions
Fair value per share option £0.29 —
Share price on date of grant £0.33 —
Exercise price £0.00 —
Share options granted in the year 16,700,000 —
Vesting period (years) 3 —
Expected volatility 50% —
Expected life (years) n/a —
Risk-free rate of return 5.75% —
The only awards granted during the year were under the Global Management and Incentive Plan. No awards were granted under any
scheme in 2006.
Expected volatility was determined using the historic volatility of the Company’s share price over the expected life of the option. 
At the date of grant, it was assumed that the non-market performance conditions for all awards would be met. Adjustments will be made
in future periods, where necessary, to reﬂect updated assessments of whether the performance conditions will be met. The share-based
payment expense also takes into account the expected and actual forfeitures over the vesting period as a result of cessation of employment. 
A charge of £1,234,000 (2006: £928,000) has been made in the income statement to spread the fair value of the share options under the Global
and Share Option and Incentive Plan, awards under the PSP and GMIP schemes. 
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS2 and has applied the standard only to those awards granted after 
07 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
28. OBLIGATIONS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties and items of equipment. At 30 September 2007 the Group had outstanding
commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows:

Between two and ﬁve years 829 1,401 141 30
After ﬁve years 250 25 — —
4,593 3,828 473 195
Group companies other than the parent have sublet ofﬁce space in certain properties. The future minimum sublease payments expected
to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 30 September 2007 is £104,000 (2006: £393,000). Operating leases operated
by the Group primarily relate to the rental of ofﬁce space for the use of Group companies. The leases cover periods of between two to six
years and the majority of these leases have options to renew at the expiry of these periods. An extension of the lease would typically be
associated by an escalation in the level of the rent payable on the lease in line with market changes. There are no other signiﬁcant restrictions
in place in regards to the assets being leased.

29. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 28 November 2007 the Group received shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting for the acquisition of Nobilas Claims
and Fleet Solutions for a cash consideration of €850,000 (approx. £600,000). This acquisition was competed on 3 December 2007. Given the
proximity to the year end the Group is still in the process of allocating fair values and hence no IFRS 3 calculations have been presented.
30. CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS
At 30 September 2007 there was no capital expenditure (2006: £nil) contracted for and not provided in the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group had guaranteed a line of credit to the buyer of the trade and assets of The Innovation Group/MTW Inc. to the extent of $400,000
(£226,000) in the previous ﬁnancial year. This guarantee expired during the current ﬁnancial year at no cost to the Group.

32. BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
In May 2007 the Group completed a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transaction in respect of its South African subsidiary, 
The Innovation Group (Pty) Limited. Through this transaction, Inthutuko Investments (Pty) Limited (Inthutuko) obtained a bank loan of 
ZAR 132,000,000 to acquire a 25% shareholding in The Innovation Group (Pty) Limited. Full details on this loan, guaranteed by the parent
company, Innovation Group Plc, are given in note 23.
Inthutuko is 77.8% owned by an Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) of The Innovation Group (Pty) Limited and 22.2% owned by Jala Capital. 
Jala Capital is an independent third party owned by Investec Bank, Salala Lesela, Pumulani Ncube and Kumaran Padayachee. Since the
majority shareholding in Inthutuko is by the EBT of The Innovation Group (Pty), Inthutuko is considered by management to be controlled by
the Group via interpretation of SIC 12 Special Purpose Entities. In view of this Inthutuko is consolidated into the Group accounts. 
The shares awarded to Jala Capital are subject to an IFRS 2 share based payment charge (see note 27). Jala Capital's rights to the shares
is conditional on the achievement of revenue targets by The Innovation Group (Pty) Limited. The shares granted to Jala have to be held for
a minimum of three years. After this date Jala are entitled to sell their shares after offering them ﬁrst to the EBT and secondly to Innovation
Group before any sale to third party can occur. The EBT has to hold its shares for a minimum of 3 years. After this date the EBT is entitled
to sell its shares after offering them ﬁrst to Jala and secondly to Innovation Group before any sale to a third party can occur. Neither Jala
nor Innovation Group is obliged to purchase the shares. In the event that Jala and the EBT vote to sell the shares in Inthutuko, via a simple
majority, Innovation Group is obliged to purchase these shares at market value. No disposal of the shares granted to Jala Capital is recorded
until Jala Capital's right to the shares becomes unconditional. No liability has been recorded to reﬂect this obligation as Innovation Group
are able to control the voting of the EBT and therefore the voting of Intuhuko.
In the event that future revenue targets are met, the shares granted to Jala become owned by Jala for no consideration. If the revenue targets
are not met, Jala may purchase the shares for a ﬁxed amount.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements
for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for
that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are
required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE INNOVATION
GROUP PLC IN RELATION TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
The Innovation Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2007
which comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes
1 to 15. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of 
The Innovation Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report
is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in
the Directors' Report includes that speciﬁc information presented
in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement and
the Finance Director’s Review that is cross referenced from the
Review of the Business section of the Directors' Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement,
the Finance Director’s Review, the Corporate Governance Statement
and Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates
and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent
company ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company's affairs as at
30 September 2007; 
  the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
  the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent
with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

COMPANY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are
set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year. The Company has taken advantage of the
exemption provided under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual proﬁt and loss account and related notes.
Financial assets
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Investments in unquoted equity investments which do not have a reliable market value are stated at cost less provision for any impairment
in value. For investments where there is an actively traded market the investment is stated at fair value, determined by reference to a
quoted market bid price at the close of business on the balance sheet date. 
Cash
Cash in bank represents cash in hand and deposits repayable with any qualifying institution. 
Debtors
Debtors are recorded at initial measurement and are provided for where management consider an element of the balance to be irrecoverable. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts which give rise to them and are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial
liabilities at fair value through the proﬁt and loss or loans and payables as appropriate. When ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised initially,
they are measured at fair value, plus in the case of ﬁnancial liabilities not at fair value through proﬁt and loss, directly attributable transaction
costs. The Company determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial liabilities at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each
ﬁnancial year end. 
A ﬁnancial liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing
liability are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in proﬁt
or loss. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss 
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt and loss constitute ﬁnancial guarantee contracts.The fair value is calculated based on an
assessment of both the likelihood that the ﬁnancial guarantee would be called upon and expected cashﬂows which could arise. Liabilities
are carried in the balance sheet at fair value and re-evaluated at each ﬁnancial year end. with gains or losses recognised in the proﬁt and
loss account. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management believe it to be probable
that the Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to net present value where this is deemed to be material. 
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable
on settlement and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the proﬁt and loss account using the effective rate of interest
method. 
TIG FINANCIALS 17-104  25/1/08  11:04  Page 94 95
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses
on translation are included in the proﬁt and loss account. 
Taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right
to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in
which they are included in ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not
that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised once paid and once formally approved and recorded as a liability.
Share-based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted using
an appropriate model. 
A cost is recorded where the employee performs a signiﬁcant majority of their services together with an assessment based on where they
are contractually employed and where their other remuneration is incurred. Since there are no employees within The Innovation Group plc
no charge has been recorded in the current or previous year .
During the year the Company changed its accounting policy for share based payments and now accounts for the charge relating to share
options granted to employees of subsidiary companies as a capital contribution, increasing the investment in subsidiaries, with the
corresponding credit going to reserves.
This has increased investments and reserves at 1 October 2006 by £3,116,000 and at 30 September 2007 by £4,350,000.
There is no impact on the current year proﬁt and loss account.
2. PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY 
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its proﬁt and loss account. The parent company’s
proﬁt for the year ended 30 September 2007 was £39,735,000 (2006: £15,769,000).

Performance conditions
a These options had no performance conditions attached.
b The awards will vest and become exercisable between the dates given above if Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth, adjusted for goodwill
amortisation and any adjustments required in respect of exceptional gains or charges that may arise (including for example the impact
of IFRS on the Group’s future results) as made at the discretion of the remuneration committee, exceeds the Retail Price Index (“RPI”)
plus 3% per annum. The base EPS being that for the year ended 30 September 2004. Future options issued will vest based on EPS growth
plus 10%.
c The awards will vest subject to meeting the following two performance conditions. Vesting of up to 50% of the award is based upon the
Group's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") relative to the TSR of a comparator group of other companies comprising the software and
computer services and the support services sector of the FTSE, over a three year performance period ending 30 September 2007. If
the Group's TSR growth ranks below the 50th percentile over the three year period 0% of the award will vest. At the 
50th percentile 15% will vest and at 75% or above, 50% will vest. Between the 50th and 75th percentile vesting will occur on a straight
line basis. Vesting of the remaining 50% of the award will be subject to the growth of the Group's EPS. 15% of an award will vest for
total EPS growth of 12% above RPI over the performance period, with 50% of an award vesting for total EPS growth of 45% or more
above RPI over the performance period. Between these points, vesting will occur on a straight line basis.
d Performance conditions on all awards are measured over a three year period commencing 1 October 2006. The performance awards
vest 50% in March 2010, 25% in March 2011 and 25% in March 2012 subject to meeting earnings per share (“EPS”) growth targets. 
No awards will vest until EPS growth is RPI+ 21%. One third of the awards will vest on achieving an EPS growth of RPI+ 60% with the
remaining two thirds vesting on achieving EPS growth of RPI +100%. Vesting takes place on a straight line basis between these amounts.
In addition to the EPS growth conditions, vesting will also be contingent on the satisfaction of a total shareholder return underpin
which requires the Company total shareholder return to be at least equal to the median of that of the constituents of the FTSE Small
Cap Index over the performance period (although the Remuneration Committee ma determine it inappropriate to apply the underpinning
condition in exceptional circumstances). The restricted stock awards vest 50% in December 2009, 25% in December 2010 and 25% in
December 2011 subject to meeting EPS growth targets. No awards will vest unless the EPS growth over the three year period to 
30 September 2009 is RPI+ 15.7625%. On achieving this EPS growth awards vest in full.
The number of share options available to relevant employees has increased due to the dilution of options caused by the rights issue
held during the year .

11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within paragraph 3(c) of FRS 8 not to disclose such transactions as it is prepares
consolidated ﬁnancial statements which are publicly available. 
Transactions with the Directors of the Company are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and in the notes to the Group ﬁnancial
statements.
12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
At 30 September 2007 there was no capital expenditure (2006: £nil) contracted for and not provided in the Company ﬁnancial statements.
The Company had guaranteed a line of credit to the buyer of the trade and assets of The Innovation Group/MTW Inc. to the extent of £226,000
($400,000) in the previous ﬁnancial year. The item to which this line of credit related to was settled during the year hence is no longer
required. The Company has also guaranteed a loan to Barclays Bank plc as discussed in note 15. There are no other contingent liabilities
in relation to the Company (2006: £nil). 
13. STATUTORY AND OTHER INFORMATION
There are no employees of the Company (2006: nil).
Directors’ remuneration is disclosed on page 30 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Company paid £8,000 (2006: £8,000) to its auditors in respect of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company.
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for non-audit services to the Company are not disclosed in the individual accounts of The Innovation Group
plc because Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
14. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
On 28 November 2007 the Company received shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting for the acquisition of Nobilas
Claims and Fleet Solutions for a cash consideration of €850,000 (approx. £600,000). This acquisition was completed on 3 December 2007.
15. FINANCIAL GUARANTEE
The Company has guaranteed a loan to Barclays Bank plc to the value of £9.6m. This loan was taken out in May 2007 by a fellow subsidiary
as part of the South African restructuring for the Black Economic Empowerment transaction as detailed in notes 23 and 32 to the Group
ﬁnancial statements. The Company has guaranteed to honour the loan to the extent it is not repayable from proﬁts generated in South Africa.
The guarantee is recorded at a fair value of £nil. The fair value is calculated based on an assessment of both the likelihood the guarantee
would be called upon and the expected cash ﬂows which would arise. On arriving at the fair value future forecasts for the South African business
have been reviewed to ensure surplus proﬁts and cash are available to service the loan. Management forecasts are available until 2010 after
which an annual growth assumption of 3% has been applied. Sensitivity has been applied to the current forecasts which leave proﬁts
unchanged from the 2007 level. In this sensitised case the South African business continues to generate sufﬁcient proﬁts and cash to meet
future repayment obligations.

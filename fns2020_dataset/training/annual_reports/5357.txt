The strong set of results in 2008 reflects some of the 
benefits captured through the continuing actions taken by 
the Board to raise returns across the Group. The strategic 
focus of our business is to invest in the growth of our 
Specialty Products division and a major step forward was 
made in July 2008 when we completed the purchase of the 
Deuchem additives business and the Yuhong organoclay plant, 
thereby significantly expanding our presence in the Asia Pacific 
region. In the Chromium business, we took advantage of 
exceptional and positive market conditions in 2008, which 
boosted this division’s profitability, but these exceptional 
market circumstances are not expected to recur in 2009. 
Our UK facility is more exposed to a downturn in demand 
because of evolving competition in its end markets, where it 
produces less differentiated products than our US business, 
and its profitability depends heavily on supplying intermediate 
products to the US business. As a result, we are currently 
evaluating the closure of our UK chromium manufacturing 
facility to rationalise capacity. The combination of Elementis’ 
strong free cash flow, net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0 at the 
2008 year end and borrowing facilities not expiring until 
July 2011, provide the Board with the relative comfort, 
in the face of the current dramatic changes in the global 
economy, to increase the full year dividend by 7 per cent 
to 2.9 pence per share.

Results
Operating profit, before exceptional items,
1
 improved by 
36 per cent in 2008 to £52.0 million on sales of £400.5 million, 
which is an increase of 34 per cent over 2007 or 17 per cent 
excluding currency effects and acquisitions. Earnings per share, 
before exceptional items, increased by 26 per cent to 9.1 pence. 
The Group recorded an impairment charge of £20.5 million 
in 2008, in relation to the Chromium business’ UK facility, 
and this is shown as an exceptional item in the Income 
Statement. After taking account of this, reported earnings 
per share was 4.5 pence compared to 10.8 pence in the 
previous year.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.4 pence, 
taking the total return to shareholders for the year to 
2.9 pence, an increase of 7 per cent. Subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid 
on 22 May 2009 to members on the register at the close 
of business on 24 April 2009. The Board intends to continue 
to review the dividend policy as earnings performance and 
debt levels permit.
Health, safety and environment 
I am happy to report that our activities in this important 
area of our business have continued to be of a high standard 
during 2008 with no significant incidents reported by any of 
our businesses.
People
Elementis has made excellent progress in recent years by 
continuously improving operating results and credit for this 
outstanding performance must go to all of our employees. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank them for their 
tremendous effort and commitment.
Outlook
Going forward it is clear that 2009 is going to be a challenging 
year . Market conditions in the latter half of the fourth quarter 
deteriorated significantly and trading in the early part of 
2009 has not yet recovered. However, the Group is well 
financed and the investments made in 2008 will further 
enhance the growth drivers in our Specialty Products 
business. The severe global economic downturn and 
accelerated customer destocking make our performance 
in 2009 difficult to predict, but we expect to continue to 
make progress over the medium term.

Business review
Group Chief Executive’s overview
David Dutro
2008 was a year of significant accomplishments for Elementis, 
characterised by a strong financial performance and solid 
execution of our strategic initiatives. We continued to 
make good progress, with operating profit
2
, free cash flow, 
operating margin

 and earnings per share

 (‘EPS’), all 
demonstrating a positive trend. The Specialty Products 
business posted its best year ever in terms of financial 
performance. This record performance was even more 
notable given the recessionary pressure that became 
apparent in the second half, and particularly in the final 
quarter, of the year. At the core of Specialty Products’ 
ability to deliver these results is an unrelenting commitment 
to provide technically superior products and application 
support that helps our customers be more successful.
Our acquisition of Deuchem, an Asia Pacific based specialty 
additives company, is consistent with our strategic objective 
of growing the Specialty Products business. Deuchem has 
an excellent reputation in the market, driven by their superior 
technical service and product development capabilities. 
Deuchem’s complementary product portfolio, customer 
service culture and the opportunity to leverage combined 
technologies globally, make it an excellent fit. In addition 
we acquired the Yuhong organoclay business, which is 
located in China. The Yuhong acquisition provides valuable 
capacity and supply chain benefits and a competitive cost 
model, again making Yuhong a strong addition to the Specialty 
Products business. The combined resources and infrastructure 
of Elementis, Deuchem and Yuhong represent an enviable 
platform to support and drive our Asia Pacific growth.

business review
The Elementis Chromium business had a strong year, 
capitalising on the commodity boom and exceptional 
supply/ demand dynamics. The business also made excellent 
progress in 2008 relative to its strategic initiative of expanding 
the number of viable key raw material suppliers. One of the 
key strategic objectives for the Chromium business is to 
reduce its sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations, thereby improving 
the quality of the Group’s earnings. A significant percentage 
of the UK business earnings comes from supplying intermediate 
products to our US facilities. Over the last three years, 
incremental capacity expansions in our US business, through 
improvements in plant efficiencies and debottlenecking, have 
led to that business being less reliant on products from the 
UK, except in exceptional supply demand conditions such 
as those experienced in 2008. In addition, the evolution of 
the markets served by the UK business, which produces less 
differentiated products than our US business and is subject 
to growing competition from Asian producers, means that 
we are less confident of producing sustainable earnings 
and cash flow from this part of the business going forward. 
As a result, we have initiated a strategic review of the 
Chromium business which could lead to the closure of 
our Eaglescliffe, UK manufacturing facility, and we 
expect to make a final decision during the first half of 2009. 
Our desired outcome is a Chromium business that is better 
suited to deliver optimal performance, given the likely 
lower level of market demand going forward, with facilities 
capable of manufacturing products that deliver superior 
benefits to the customer base. 
I am proud of Elementis’ accomplishments in 2008 which 
are a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication 
of our global team and its performance driven culture. 
We expect the 2009 economic environment to be challenging 
and we are taking appropriate action on costs to mitigate 
the potential impact on earnings, particularly in the first half 
of the year. We will continue our pursuit of high performance 
and strive to take our Specialty Products business to the 
next level of market leadership. In an environment of 
economic uncertainty our market position is a distinct 
advantage and it is our goal to be positioned to fully exploit 
the eventual economic recovery. I would like to thank our 
shareholders and customers for their continued confidence 
and support.

The acquisition of Deuchem will significantly expand Elementis’ 
presence in Asia Pacific and provide a platform for the Specialty 
Products business to accelerate growth in the region.
’’
‘‘
Elementis Specialty Products
Elementis Specialty Products is a leading manufacturer 
of rheology control additives that are used to enhance the 
performance of our customers’ products. Best in class 
technical support and customer service are critical core 
competencies of the business and provide the platform 
to deliver added value in the coatings, oilfield exploration, 
construction and personal care markets. The strategy 
of the business is to grow in rheology products and 
complementary additives through new product innovation, 
expansion into new geographies and bolt on acquisitions. 
In 2008 the business made an important step forward in 
this strategy by acquiring the Deuchem additives and 
Yuhong organoclay businesses in Taiwan and China. 
Deuchem is a leading supplier of additives and resins to 
the coating and related industries, with three sales offices 
in Taiwan and eleven sales offices in China, together with 
manufacturing and technical facilities near Taipei and in 
Shanghai. The acquisition of Deuchem will significantly 
expand Elementis’ presence in Asia Pacific and provide a 
platform for the Specialty Products business to accelerate 
growth in the region. Growth in the combined businesses 
will be driven by the sale of Deuchem’s product portfolio 
to the Elementis global customer base, as well as the 
opportunity to sell Elementis products through the well 
developed Deuchem sales and technical support network 
in Taiwan and China. The Yuhong organoclay business 
will increase Elementis’ organoclay production in China 
from 3,000 tonnes to over 10,000 tonnes, eliminating the 
more costly practice of exporting organoclays from the 
United States to Asia Pacific. At the same time, it provides 
additional capacity to serve the faster growing Chinese 
market, utilising the newly acquired Deuchem sales network.
Sales in 2008 were £181.5 million compared to £141.6 million 
in the previous year, including £19.9 million of sales in the 
second half of the year from the newly acquired Deuchem. 
Excluding this and currency effects, sales increased by 
4 per cent. The business continued to experience good 
underlying growth in Asia Pacific, where volumes were 
higher by more than 10 per cent, and this offset softer 
markets in Europe and North America, particularly in the 
coatings and construction sectors. Sales to the oilfield 
market showed strong volume growth in 2008, particularly in 
North America, due to robust drilling activity throughout 
most of the year, and consumer sales showed positive 
growth in all of the major geographies.
Operating profit was £29.1 million in 2008, including £0.2 million 
from Deuchem, which incurred £0.9 million of one time 
integration costs in the second half of the year. Excluding 
Deuchem and currency movements, operating profit was 
6 per cent higher than in the previous year, demonstrating 
good progress despite the general economic slow down 
that took place in the final quarter. Operating margin, 
excluding currency effects and Deuchem, was 21 per cent 
in 2008, compared to 20 per cent in the previous year . Some 
inflation in raw materials was evident during the year, but 
was relatively modest because most raw materials used in 
the business are not directly linked to the general 
commodity cycle, which caused major increases in other 
businesses.
Elementis Surfactants
Elementis Surfactants is a specialty surfactant manufacturer 
offering innovative products to markets such as oilfield 
chemicals, pulp and paper and household products. 
Its strategy is to focus on higher margin markets such 
as agrochemicals, feed, plastic and resins and reduce 
activity in high volume commodity applications. At the 
same time the business seeks to continually reduce 
operating costs by more efficient utilisation of its 
manufacturing facility in the Netherlands, which it 
shares with the Specialty Products business.
In 2008 sales increased by 10 per cent to £51.1 million 
(2007: £46.3 million), due to currency movements where 
the average Euro rate against Sterling strengthened by 
13 per cent.

Business commentary Elementis plc

business review
Operating profit for the year was £0.5 million compared to 
£0.9 million in 2007. Volumes were 12 per cent lower than the 
previous year as management continued their programme of 
moving out of lower margin products, which was exacerbated 
by the general slow down towards the end of the year. 
Otherwise operating profit was sustained through improved 
pricing, in response to increases in raw material costs, and 
continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency.
Elementis Chromium
Elementis Chromium is the world’s largest supplier of 
chrome chemicals, which are used in a variety of end 
markets including metal alloys, pigments, metal finishing, 
leather tanning and foundry applications. The business 
operates within the Group from a separate legal entity 
structure and has no interactions with other Group businesses 
other than at the administrative level. Its strategy is to 
provide high quality products to its customers utilising low 
cost, sustainable manufacturing facilities to produce mostly 
higher margin products such as chromic acid and chrome 
oxide. Global supply/demand balances are a significant 
driver of margins in the chromium chemical market and 
Elementis Chromium seeks to produce stable earnings by 
serving higher value markets and by utilising its flexible 
manufacturing base to adjust to changes in demand. 
For the first nine months of 2008 the business experienced 
particularly favourable market dynamics due to strong 
economic activity and changes in Chinese tax regulations. 
In addition, temporary plant closures in China during the 
Beijing Olympics that had the effect of reducing exports of 
chrome chemicals from that country, further benefited the 
business. As a result, selling prices rose faster than input 
costs which, when combined with high plant operating rates, 
significantly improved operating margins compared to those 
experienced in the previous year. Sales volumes showed a 
significant decline in the fourth quarter and the business 
brought forward planned maintenance shutdowns to avoid 
building excessive amounts of inventory at the end of the year . 
Market dynamics are likely to be less favourable in 2009, 
particularly for our UK facility in Eaglescliffe which produces 
less differentiated products than our US facilities, is more 
exposed to Chinese competition and whose profitability 
relies heavily on supplying intermediate products to the US 
business. As a consequence, the business is evaluating the 
closure of the facility in 2009.
Sales were £168.6 million in 2008 compared to £115.9 million 
in the previous year, an increase of 45 per cent or 39 per cent 
at constant currency. Volumes increased by one per cent 
over the previous year. Volumes in the second half of the 
year were lower than in the first half, which had improved 
by 7 per cent compared to the same period in 2007, reflecting 
the fourth quarter slow down. During the year the business 
continued to focus on higher margin products such as 
chromic acid and chrome oxide, while the geographical 
split of sales remained relatively stable with slightly lower 
volumes in North America and Europe and higher volumes 
in Asia Pacific.
Operating profit was £27.7 million for the year compared to 
£14.2 million in the previous year, an increase of 95 per cent. 
Currency had only a marginal impact on operating profit 
due to the Group’s hedging programme. Favourable market 
conditions led to operating margins improving to 16 per cent 
compared to 12 per cent in the previous year as selling prices 
were increased in an environment of rising raw material and 
energy costs. Some key raw material and energy costs increased 
by as much as 60 to 80 per cent. Following a review of the 
future outlook for the UK facility, the business has decided 
to record an impairment charge of £20.5 million against 
the facility in 2008. Additional one time charges relating 
to severance payments and site closure, estimated to be 
£14-28 million, would be incurred in 2009 should the decision 
be made to close the facility. Most of these charges would 
be incurred in cash over a 2-3 year period, with cash spending 
in 2009 likely to be less than £5 million due to related reductions 
in working capital.

Group results
Group revenue from continuing operations was £400.5 million 
in 2008, compared to £299.8 million in the previous year. 
Excluding currency effects and acquisitions this represents 
an increase of 17 per cent with both Specialty Products and 
Chromium showing increases, while sales in Surfactants were 
lower for the reasons outlined in the Business commentary. 
Overall volumes were lower by approximately 2 per cent 
compared to the previous year due to lower sales in 
Surfactants, while volumes in Specialty Products and 
Chromium were flat to marginally higher . From a geographical 
viewpoint, sales volumes were generally higher than the 
previous year in Asia Pacific and the rest of the world, and 
lower in North America and Europe. In the first half of 2008 
volumes were approximately 1 per cent higher than the 
corresponding period in 2007, and volumes in the second 
half were approximately 3 per cent lower than the same 
period last year, reflecting the general slow down in 
economic activity that took place towards the end of 2008.
Group operating profit from continuing operations, before 
exceptional items, was £52.0 million in 2008, an increase of 
36 per cent over the previous year, or 42 per cent excluding the 
impact of currency and acquisitions. Specialty Products and 
Chromium both showed an improvement in operating profit, 
while Surfactants was essentially flat. Currency movements 
reduced operating profit by approximately 4 per cent in 2008 
and the major currency movements affecting the Group in 
the year were the strengthening of both the US Dollar and 
the Euro against Sterling. Such movements would normally 
have a positive impact on the Group’s earnings, but this impact 
was significantly reduced in 2008 by the Group’s currency 
hedging programme, which essentially defers these benefits 
until the following year. In 2008 the Group recorded a net 
cost on its currency hedging transactions of £9.0 million 
(2007: £2.9 million gain). After taking account of the impairment 
charge in Chromium, Group operating profit from continuing 
operations was £31.5 million (2007: £40.5 million).
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, before 
exceptional items, was 9.1 pence compared to 7.2 pence in 
the previous year due mainly to the improvements in operating 
profit described above. Reported earnings per share was 
4.5 pence (2007: 10.8 pence) on a fully diluted basis due to 
the impairment charge noted above.

Central costs
Central costs are costs that are not identifiable as expenses 
of a particular business, and are comprised of expenditures 
of the Board of Directors and the corporate office.
Exceptional items
Following a review of the evolving trends in the markets 
served by Chromium’s UK manufacturing facility and its 
competitive cost position in those markets, management have 
concluded that the expected earnings and cash flow from this 
facility are likely to be significantly reduced going forward and 
is therefore evaluating its potential closure. As a result, an 
exceptional charge of £20.5 million has been recorded in 2008 
representing an impairment to the asset value of the facility.
Provisions
At the end of 2008 the Group held provisions of £21.8 million 
(2007: £16.5 million) of which £20.0 million (2007: £14.0 million) 
related to environmental issues. Environmental provisions 
increased by £3.7 million in the year, excluding currency 
effects, due to £2.1 million of additional planned spending 
in Chromium and, out of the total environmental provisions, 
approximately £8.3 million relates to continuing operations 
and the balance relates to sites no longer directly controlled 
by the Group. The overall level of provisions held had been 
reviewed by external consultants during the year.

     (3.5) (4.3)
Interest on continuing operations decreased by £0.8 million 
in 2008 to £3.5 million. Net interest costs were lower by 
£3.4 million at £2.6 million due to lower average borrowings, 
following the sale of Pigments in August 2007, and generally 
lower interest rates in the United States. The majority of 
the Group’s borrowings are denominated in US Dollars. 
Finance expense on pension schemes was £0.1 million 
compared to income of £2.3 million in the previous year, 
largely due to an increase in the discount rate used to 
assess the value and cost of pension liabilities.

Tax charges amounted to £8.2 million in the year  
(2007: £8.9 million). Tax on continuing operations before 
exceptional items was £8.2 million (2007: £1.8 million), 
which represents 16.9 per cent (2007: 5.3 per cent) of profit 
before taxation. The rate is higher than the previous year, 
due mainly to the full recognition of US tax losses in 2007. 
There was no tax charge associated with exceptional items 
because those charges relate to UK operations where the 
Group has unutilised losses.
Earnings per share
Note 9 to the financial statements sets out a number 
of calculations of earnings per share. To better 
understand the underlying performance of the Group, 
earnings per share reported under IFRS is adjusted for 
items classified as exceptional and for discontinued 
operations. Diluted earnings per share from continuing 
and discontinued operations, before exceptional items, 
increased by 14 per cent to 9.1 pence (2007: 8.0 pence).
Diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued 
operations reported under IFRS (sometimes referred to as 
‘reported earnings per share’ in other parts of this report) 
was 4.5 pence (2007: 10.8 pence). Exceptional items in 
2008 reduced reported earnings per share by 4.6 pence 
(2007: increase of 2.8 pence).

*  EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, exceptional items, depreciation  
and amortisation
EBITDA increased by 18 per cent to £64.4 million in the 
year, due to the improvement in operating profit. Cash flow 
from working capital was an outflow of £4.5 million, which 
was lower than the amount implied by the increase in sales 
due to overall improvements in working capital levels. 
The percentage of working capital to sales, adjusted for 
currency movements, was 19.6 per cent compared to 
21.9 per cent in the previous year. Debtor days improved 
by three days to 48 days. Inventory days increased by 
13 days to 91 days due to a rapid slow down in demand 
towards the end of 2008, but this was offset by an 
improvement in creditor days of 11 days to 78 days. 
All measures of working capital days have been adjusted 
for currency movements and acquisitions and disposals. 
Cash flow from working capital was a small inflow in 2007 
due to the unwinding of strategic inventory levels during 
that year. Capital expenditure was £3.9 million higher than 
the previous year due to additional manufacturing and 
infrastructure spending in Specialty Products to support 
growth. Pension deficit contributions were lower than the 
previous year by £3.5 million, due to lower contribution 
requirements to US plans. 
Free cash flow, defined as cash flow available to finance 
returns to shareholders, repay debt or make new 
investments, increased by £10.2 million to £36.6 million.
Currency fluctuations had a significant impact on net 
borrowings in the year, because the majority of the 
Group’s debt is denominated in US Dollars which 
strengthened against Sterling by almost 30 per cent 
during 2008. Net debt increased by £47.7 million in the 
year, of which £25.2 million was due to currency and the 
balance was due to acquisition spending and dividend 
payments less free cash flow. In 2007, proceeds from 
the sale of the Pigments business contributed to a 
reduction in debt in that year of £84.4 million.

The Group operates several pension plans in different 
countries and a retirement medical scheme in the 
United States. The largest of these is the UK defined 
benefit pension scheme (‘UK scheme’) which had assets 
of £349.1 million at the end of 2008. The deficit in this 
scheme, under IAS 19, was £12.7 million at the end of 
2008 which is almost the same as at the end of the 
previous year. Gross liabilities under the scheme reduced 
by £31.8 million during the year, principally due to an 
increase in corporate bond yields, a decrease in market 
inflation expectations and benefit payments made in the 
year. The scheme assets reduced by a similar amount 
(£31.7 million) due to a negative return of 4 per cent and 
net benefit payments of £16.2 million, after taking account 
of contributions paid in the year. 
The next triennial valuation and funding discussions 
for the UK scheme will be as of 30 September 2008 and 
the Company will be discussing this with the trustees 
of the scheme during 2009. Financial markets have been 
extremely volatile in recent months and it is likely that 
the deficit valuation to be agreed with the trustees will 
be significantly higher than the deficit shown in the Group 
accounts under IAS 19. In particular, the triennial funding 
valuation uses a discount rate based on a prudent estimate 
of the expected return on the scheme’s assets, whereas 
IAS 19 uses a discount rate based on high quality corporate 
bond yields. In previous years the discount rates under 
these two approaches have been broadly similar, but during 
2008 changes in corporate bond yields increased the gap 
between the two rates, which has placed a relatively lower 
assessed value on the scheme’s liabilities under IAS 19. 
Also, in the months leading up to the triennial valuation 
date of 30 September 2008, financial market expectations 
for future price inflation was higher than it was towards 
the end of the 2008, further reducing the IAS 19 valuation 
relative to the triennial funding valuation.
The previous triennial valuation was carried out as of 
30 September 2005, at which time the Company and 
trustees agreed upon a deficit value of £49.5 million 
and the Company agreed to make deficit contributions 
of £6.2 million per annum until September 2015. Under 
current pension regulations the Company is required 
to enter into an updated funding arrangement with the 
trustees by the end of 2009. In doing so the Company will 
focus on the long term structural changes in the deficit 
since 2005, to arrive at future contributions that are 
reasonably affordable.
The US pension plan is smaller than the UK scheme, with 
assets of £45.0 million. The deficit for the plan increased by 
£27.0 million largely due to a 37 per cent loss on the assets 
in the year due to weak equity markets. This loss is greater 
than for the UK scheme because the US plan has a larger 
percentage of its assets in equities. Exchange rate 
movements also increased the Sterling value of the deficit 
by £7.0 million. 
The other schemes are smaller than the UK and US pension 
plans and showed only modest changes in deficit values.
Currency fluctuations had a significant impact on net borrowings 
in the year, because the majority of the Group’s debt is denominated 
in US Dollars which strengthened against Sterling by almost 
30 per cent during 2008.

The Group’s key performance indicators are a standard 
set of measures against which each business reports 
on a monthly basis. Incentive plans include targets against 
the annual operating plan for operating profit and operating 
cash flow. 
1. Operating profit / operating margin
Operating profit is the profit derived from the normal 
operations of the business. Operating margin is the ratio 
of operating profit or loss, before exceptional items, to sales. 
The Group achieved an operating profit from continuing 
operations before exceptional items of £52.0 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £38.1 million). 
This is an increase of 36 per cent on the previous year. 
The Group’s operating margin from continuing businesses 
was 13.0 per cent compared to 12.7 per cent in 2007.
2. t rade working capital to sales ratio
The trade working capital to sales ratio is defined as trade 
working capital divided by sales, expressed as a percentage. 
Trade working capital comprises inventories, trade and other 
receivables and trade and other payables. It specifically 
excludes prepayments, capital or interest related receivables 
or payables, working capital related to acquisitions made in 
the year, changes due to currency movements and items 
classified as other receivables and other payables. The Group’s 
trade working capital to sales ratio at 31 December 2008 
was 19.6 per cent (2007: 21.9 per cent). 
3. return on operating capital employed
The return on operating capital employed is defined 
as operating profit before exceptional items divided by 
operating capital employed, expressed as a percentage. 
Operating capital employed comprises fixed assets 
(excluding goodwill), working capital and operating 
provisions. Operating provisions include self insurance 
and environmental provisions but exclude restructuring 
provisions and retirement benefit obligations. The Group’s 
return on operating capital employed was 31.9 per cent 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: 24.6 per cent).
4. lost time accidents
A lost time accident (‘LTA’) is any work related injury or 
illness sustained by an employee or directly employed 
contractor whilst working at the Group’s premises that 
results in greater than three days lost, excluding the day 
of accident. There were two LTAs in continuing operations 
in 2008 (2007: two). 
5. contribution margin
Contribution, which is defined as sales less all variable costs, 
divided by sales and expressed as a percentage is the definition 
of contribution margin. The Group’s contribution margin in 
2008 was 33.7 per cent (2007: 33.5 per cent). 
6. Operating cash flow
The operating cash flow is defined as the net cash flow 
from operating activities less net capital expenditure but 
excluding income taxes paid or received, interest paid or 
received, pension contributions net of current service cost 
and exceptional items. In 2008 the operating cash flow was 
£49.2 million (2007: £47.0 million).

business review
The Group has a process that identifies certain risks that 
could affect the business operations and hence the financial 
results and/or value of Elementis. These risks are reviewed by 
the Board annually and further information about this process 
is given in the statement on internal control on page 28.
In 2008 the Group continued to invest time and resource across 
a range of risk management strategies. These included 
actions to reduce the severity and likelihood of some risks, 
and working closely with the Group’s insurance broker and 
major insurer to transfer other risks. However, despite 
best efforts, it is recognised that there remains the 
possibility that an identified risk may turn into a reality, or 
that a previously unidentified risk manifests itself, causing 
loss to the Company. As reported last year, to cover this 
eventuality the Group has developed and rolled-out a 
Business Continuity Plan (‘BCP’) which is designed to help 
ensure that the business can continue to operate in the 
event of a major incident or crisis. The BCP is embedded 
throughout the organisation and is periodically tested, 
audited and subject to continual improvement.
commercial risk
The current economic climate represents the main risk 
and uncertainty facing the Group’s businesses but its 
geographical spread of customers and its breadth of product 
applications will help to reduce the Group’s exposure to 
local economic downturns.
The principal drivers of our businesses are well understood 
by management and one of these is that a significant increase 
in raw material prices and energy costs can be detrimental 
to the Group’s financial result. With regard to raw materials, 
the Group aims to continually improve efficiencies of use 
and, where possible, to explore using alternative sources of 
raw materials. Supply chain trends are monitored and where 
appropriate long term contracts are secured with existing 
suppliers. Alternative sources of supply are also identified 
to minimise the effect of any disruption from supplier 
failure. The Company also maintains a strategic stock of 
raw materials to mitigate against the effect of any short 
term disruption to supply. Fixed price contracts are used 
to provide greater certainty on energy costs.
Operational and hazard risk
The Group is highly dependent on IT systems for managing 
its businesses and has an on-going review programme in 
place to ensure that systems are maintained adequately 
and any repairs or upgrades are made as necessary. 
Elementis is confident that it has a high level of resilience 
in its IT systems and infrastructure, and that IT management 
has adopted good industry practices for protecting against 
malicious attacks. There remains, however, the threat of 
disruption to voice and data infrastructure, which is a risk 
common to many organisations.
Health, safety, environmental (‘HSE’) and property damage 
risks are managed conscientiously and to a high standard, 
as our HSE performance statistics show within the Corporate 
social responsibility report, but it is still possible that an 
accident may occur at a manufacturing facility, with risk of 
harm to people or the environment. To reduce this risk the 
Company has an established incident reporting and investigation 
system including near miss reporting. Lessons are learned 
from root cause analysis and specific corrective actions are 
backed by annual improvement plans on a site and global 
basis. These are backed up by regular equipment and site 
audits to mitigate against loss arising from faulty equipment 
or processes.
Some of the Group’s manufacturing facilities are located in 
parts of the world where natural hazards such as hurricanes, 
tornadoes, earthquakes and floods are a predictable risk. 
Good design and management of all facilities is backed by 
close collaboration with our property insurers. This provides 
a good level of confidence that property is protected from 
damage and consequent business interruption. Nevertheless 
accidents can happen and Elementis has insurance to 
protect against catastrophic loss. 
The Group has taken steps to be prepared to initiate effective 
business continuity to reassure shareholders, customers 
and other stakeholders that, in the unlikely event of a major 
incident or crisis, Elementis would remain viable in business. 
One of the priorities following the acquisitions made last year 
was the rolling-out of Group HSE procedures and the BCP to 
the newly acquired businesses, which is progressing well.
financial risk
Elementis maintains a comprehensive insurance programme 
with limits and deductibles that are set to optimise the total 
cost of risk borne by the Group, and works closely with 
underwriters and the Group’s insurance brokers to ensure 
that appropriate cover is in place. The management of risk 
is undertaken through focused risk reduction measures, 
attention to limits of cover, claims management, programme 
structure and insurance premiums. 
As with all businesses there is a risk of failure of financial 
controls. Elementis uses an external controls assurance 
provider to perform an internal audit function and conduct 
a comprehensive programme of internal audits across the 
Group. In addition to the due diligence that was carried out 
prior to making our two acquisitions last year, our internal 
auditors were asked to undertake a targeted review of the 
new businesses to provide an early assessment of their level 
of internal control. Significant issues and corrective actions 
from the work of the internal audit service are reported to 
site and group management for review and follow-up, and 
the Audit Committee reviews all internal audit reports 
twice a year.

regulatory and legal risk
As a manufacturer of specialty chemicals, Elementis is 
subject to regulations governing the chemicals, processes 
and equipment used. The trend globally is for increasingly 
stringent environmental performance and protection of 
health. Elementis is committed to responding to these 
challenges but there is a risk that tighter requirements may 
involve costs that reduce profitability or may even make 
production of a particular product uneconomic. For example, 
the REACH regulations which affect the manufacture and 
import of chemical products in the EU potentially subject 
manufacturers to costly registration and testing that would 
have to be borne by the Company or passed on to 
customers. Elementis has active REACH management 
programmes in place, with appropriate reporting to the 
Board, and further information is given in the Corporate 
social responsibility report.
Other risks faced by the Company include governance and 
compliance risk. Lack of Board oversight and processes 
or ineffective management teams can lead to significant 
financial loss or loss of strategic direction. These risks are 
mitigated by regular Board meetings with a comprehensive 
agenda, regular evaluations of Board and management 
team members and regular Board reviews of strategy, 
business plans and compliance programmes. 
Breach of anti-trust, HSE or other laws or regulations from 
historical or ongoing operations can lead to a major financial 
loss or public censure or both, thereby damaging the 
creditworthiness and or reputation of the Company; the 
latter can damage the Company’s long and short term 
market value. These risks are mitigated by our risk 
management programmes, including: web-based compliance 
training for employees; regular HSE compliance audits, 
supported by external advisers and the internal audit 
service; and insurance. 
In terms of the key legal risks, there is a risk of material 
toxic tort and environmental claims from historical and 
ongoing operations. Despite the insurance in place there 
is always the possibility of an underinsured or uninsured 
claim and in the extreme an insured limit might be exceeded. 
However, Elementis has a robust programme in place to 
actively manage and defend against legal action or claims 
relating to its operations, products and manufacturing 
facilities. The programme is led by the Group General 
Counsel, who is supported by an in-house team and 
professional advisers. Litigation reports are reviewed 
periodically by the Board.
Treasury policies and objectives
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures 
approved and monitored by the Board. The Group operates 
a central treasury function which manages and monitors 
external and internal funding requirements and the following 
treasury risks:
 credit risk;
 liquidity risk; and
 market risk.
These risks and the Group’s policies to manage them are 
set out in note 22 to the financial statements.

Corporate social responsibility report
Business conduct and ethics
Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
including health, safety and environmental (‘HSE’) laws 
and regulations, and effective management of HSE and 
other ethical issues, are viewed by the Board as critical 
to the successful long term performance of Elementis.
It is the policy of Elementis to promote honest, ethical and 
lawful conduct by all employees, officers and directors of 
the Group, and the Board has adopted and disseminated 
throughout the Group the Elementis Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics (the ‘Code’) and an Anti-corruption 
Policy (the ‘Anti-corruption Policy’), to help employees 
understand the Group’s standards of ethical business 
practices and to stimulate awareness of ethical and legal 
issues that may be encountered in carrying out their 
responsibilities. In addition, Group businesses are expected 
to require independent contractors, consultants, agents 
and sales representatives who represent the Group to 
agree to the same high standards as the Group’s employees 
while working on Group business. 
The Code requires all employees to comply with applicable 
laws, governmental rules and regulations, including making 
full, accurate and timely disclosures in the periodic reports 
required to be filed by the Group with regulators and in other 
public communications made by the Group. The Anti-corruption 
Policy prohibits the giving of anything of value to any person 
in government or state-owned companies, a political party 
or persons holding public office, including candidates, or 
performing public duties in order to obtain or retain business 
or secure an improper advantage with respect to any aspect 
of the Group’s business. 
Employees are required to adhere strictly to the Code and 
to promptly report (to a responsible supervisor, the Group 
General Counsel or other appropriate internal authority) any 
violations of the Code or the Anti-corruption Policy. In order 
to help employees comply with the Code and Anti-corruption 
Policy, clear guidance is given on matters such as competition 
law, bribery, political donations, the giving and receiving of 
gifts, conflicts of interests and Group whistleblowing procedures. 
As well as policies and guidance, the Group recognises 
the importance of providing training. Web-based, modular 
training courses, designed in conjunction with the Integrity 
Interactive Corporation, are offered to employees across 
the Group. Some of these courses are mandatory for all 
employees, such as training on the Code, and others are 
only mandatory depending on the job role or position. 
These courses include topics such as ‘Mutual respect in the 
workplace’, ‘Human rights’, ‘Environmental stewardship’, 
‘Anti-trust’, ‘Privacy and data protection’ and ‘Financial 
integrity’. About 770 employees were enrolled onto courses 
during 2008. On-site training, for example on health and 
safety, is also provided. 
The Group General Counsel is responsible for the Code, 
Anti-corruption Policy and all matters related to business 
conduct and ethics, and legal and regulatory compliance.
HSE leadership
The Group Chief Executive takes leadership of HSE matters 
at Board level with direct lines of reporting from the operational 
facilities. This includes formal monthly reports on HSE 
performance and rapid notification of HSE incidents wherever 
they occur throughout the world. A manufacturing council, 
comprising senior manufacturing and HSE managers, reviews 
performance monthly, sets standards and 
initiates improvements. 
The Board of Elementis reviews HSE performance 
at its meetings.
Elementis policy on HSE
Elementis plc conducts business globally with the highest 
concern for the health and safety of our employees, 
contractors, customers, neighbours and general public 
and for the environment in which we operate.
Elementis plc seeks to identify and eliminate occupational 
health hazards, is committed to providing a safe work place 
for all employees and strives for zero injuries as part of our 
continual improvement process.
Elementis plc operates facilities to minimise impact on the 
environment. We view compliance with all applicable legal 
requirements and other codes of practice as our minimum 
standard. Our sustainable development strategy requires 
that we work proactively to reduce emissions, minimise 
waste from our processes, conserve valuable natural 
resources and ensure responsible product stewardship 
up and down the supply chain.
Elementis plc recognises the importance of communication 
with all interested parties and is committed to open dialogue 
with our neighbours, contractors, customers and the general 
public about our operations.
The Board and senior management of Elementis plc are 
committed to this policy and continually monitor performance 
to ensure its implementation.
HSE commitment
Elementis is committed to preventing harm to people and 
the environment in a sustainable way. Good performance in 
protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, 
customers, neighbours and the general public, and for the 
environment in which we operate, allows the Group to focus 
on developing, manufacturing and selling its products 
without the cost, in both human and financial terms, 
of accidents and incidents. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008

Working towards an injury-free work environment
Our principal measure of performance is recordable incidents. 
Recordable incidents are workplace injuries and illnesses 
that require medical treatment beyond first aid. An important 
sub-set of these is lost time accidents (‘LTAs’), which forms 
another performance measure. Given the low frequency of 
LTAs we use recordable incidents as our standard measure.
In 2008, as a result of effective design of working practices, 
strong management and safe behaviours, we were able to 
limit recordable incidents to just nine globally. This includes 
the performance of the two acquisitions made in July for the 
period in which they were under our ownership. 
The Total Recordable Incident Rate for the year was 
0.73 per 200,000 hours worked (2007: 0.65). Given the low 
number of incidents the slight increase is not considered 
statistically significant. Based on American Chemistry 
Council statistics, our rate of less than 1.00 recordable 
incidents per 200,000 hours worked continues to rank with 
companies that are generally viewed as ‘best in industry’.
The chart below illustrates our performance and how far 
we have come. This clearly demonstrates that the Elementis 
culture has the right discipline and focus on safety as we 
continue to work towards an injury-free workplace.
Using the UK Health & Safety Executive’s definition of LTA
4
, 
two of the recordable incidents were classed as LTAs in 2008 
(2007: two). Over the years the rate has reduced to 0.24 LTAs 
per 100,000 hours worked.
Safety goal
Our goal remains zero recordable incidents, with continual 
improvement in the health and safety of our employees 
leading to year on year improvement in safety performance. 
Commitment to the environment
As stated in our HSE policy we are committed to minimising 
the impact of our facilities on the environment. We believe 
that we have made good progress in achieving a sustained 
low level of environmental incidents. 
As well as complying with environmental reporting 
requirements, Elementis records and categorises incidents 
according to the seriousness of the impact for monitoring 
purposes, so that continual improvements can be made. 
Tier 1 incidents have no impact on the environment, such as 
minor spills that can be confined and require no regulatory 
reporting. Tier 2 incidents have a minor impact and Tier 3 
have some impact on the environment.
In 2008 the on-going businesses in Elementis had one Tier 3 
incident (2007: one) which involved a financial penalty for 
discharging what the local sanitation board considered to be 
untreated process effluent at our Charleston facility. There 
were no Tier 2 incidents (2007: one). We record and monitor 
all Tier 1 incidents but do not report these as their principal 
purpose is to allow our HSE professionals to investigate and 
learn from them in order that improvements can be made 
and to reduce the likelihood of future Tier 2 and 3 incidents.

Environmental performance
Emissions to air, discharges to water and waste disposal are 
regulated by external authorities and controlled carefully 
within Elementis. The table below shows our performance 
in some of these areas. It should be noted that the 2008 data 
contains data from the Deuchem sites in China and Taiwan 
and the Yuhong joint venture in China acquired during 2008. 
The table also shows our water and energy usage over the 
past three years, although this excludes the two acquisitions 
as no comparable data was available as at the time of writing.
emissions to air
Elementis continues to seek to reduce, wherever it can, its 
emissions of carbon dioxide (‘CO2’), a ‘greenhouse gas‘, which 
facilitates global warming and leads to other consequences 
of climate change. CO2 emissions are, in part, a function 
of production output – our production output has changed 
over the years both in terms of total volume and changes 
in products (or product mix). Furthermore, as is standard 
practice in the chemical industry, some emission and discharge 
values may be based on samples rather than continuous 
monitoring. During the year, internal audit reviewed the 
data reported by a sample of sites and found that they were 
produced on a consistent and accurate basis.
The Group’s operations also result in the emission of 
sulphur and nitrogen oxide, which can cause acid rain, and 
volatile organic compounds, which can damage soil and 
ground water or combine with nitrogen oxide to cause smog. 
The volume of these emissions are controlled to comply with 
regulatory permits and, as the volumes are not considered 
to be significant, they are no longer reported here. 
discharges to water
Maintaining the water quality of the areas in which we operate 
is a regulatory issue and vital to protect the ecosystems and 
communities in which we operate. The Group’s production 
activity does create some by-products that are discharged 
to water, such as chemical and biological oxygen demand, 
and these are regulated by external authorities and 
carefully managed by Elementis. The volume of these 
discharges are not considered to be siginificant and are 
no longer reported here. 
Any emissions to air or discharges to water above regulatory 
permitted levels will continue to be reported each year under 
environmental incidents. 
water consumption
With the exception of the Hectorite mine in California, 
the Company does not operate in areas of extreme water 
shortage. Nevertheless, water is a valuable resource and 
the Company recognises the global need to conserve water. 
Water consumption is minimised where possible by treatment 
and recycling. 
energy consumption
Conserving energy is important for sustainable development. 
Energy is an expensive resource and its efficient use also has 
a significant effect on the cost of production. As the Group 
uses a range of fuel sources, these have been converted into 
gigajoules (‘GJ’) to provide consistent energy units. Reduction 
in production output in the last quarter of 2008 reduced energy 
consumption but adversely affected the specific consumption 
per tonne. Just under 80 per cent of consumption is 
accounted for in the production of chromium chemicals.
solid waste
The Company is committed to minimising the quantity of all 
types of waste. The quantity of hazardous waste resulting 
from operations in Elementis has reduced significantly over 
the last decade. The low level that remains is highly controlled 
and subject to licensed disposal. Non-hazardous waste is 
minimised and recycled as far as possible. Non-hazardous 
waste is predominantly the inert residue from the chromate 
kiln operations, which is deposited in our own licenced 
landfill sites adjacent to the manufacturing facilities. 
Alternative or recycled uses have been explored but to date 
there is no technically viable commercial option to landfill.
The Group encourages the re-using, reduction and recycling 
of general office waste and recycling schemes are in place 
at various office locations. The amounts of general office 
waste is not reported separately from non-hazardous waste 
as the volumes are not considered to be significant.

Environmental performance continued
environmental target
Our target is to comply with all environmental regulations 
and permits, with zero environmental incidents classed 
as Elementis Tiers 2 and 3. Beyond that we will strive for 
continual improvement in standards to reduce our impact 
on the environment.
HSE hazards and risks
Elementis is committed to identifying hazards and reducing 
risk to people and the environment. 
New equipment and plant are subject to HSE review 
including where appropriate hazard and operability studies 
(HAZOP). A formal modification control system is employed 
to ensure that changes to plant are approved with due 
consideration of risk as well as financial cost. 
The Company has a set of policies to cover life critical 
activities such as working at heights and in confined 
spaces. Many sites are certified to external standards 
such as ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and OSHA VPP.
A well established mandatory incident reporting system 
records HSE incidents (including near-misses) worldwide 
throughout Elementis. A structured investigation process 
is then adopted to establish root causes and implement 
effective corrective actions. Learning for these incidents 
is then shared across the Company to help prevent similar 
incidents occurring elsewhere and, in the case of repeat 
occurrences, to identify trends for further action. 
Behavioural safety programmes and a mandatory scheme of 
routine plant inspections by management ensures that 
working practices and plant conditions are maintained in 
good order. 
Major hazards and risks (including those from natural 
perils) are identified and included in the Company’s risk 
management process (referred to in the Principal risks 
and uncertainties section of the Business review). 
Continual improvement in HSE 
Each site has an annual plan showing HSE objectives that 
should have a positive impact on safety. These plans are 
drawn up in conjunction with the manufacturing council who 
then monitors performance and provides guidance to 
achieve the desired results. Additionally, the Audit Committee 
approved the inclusion of HSE reporting within the scope of 
internal audit work for 2008. Eight sites were reviewed for 
HSE compliance with Group policies and procedures by 
internal audit and no significant issues were raised.
Social responsibility
The Group Chief Executive has Board level responsibility for 
social and community matters, although day to day responsibility 
is delegated to the business managing directors. 
Elementis recognises the international standards for human 
rights and strives to ensure equality of opportunity and fair 
rewards for expertise and knowledge at all its locations 
globally. Details of our employment policies and information 
about employee communication are summarised in the 
Directors’ report on page 22.
The Company undertakes regular customer satisfaction 
surveys and also has a customer service policy with key 
account management operated to ensure that the views 
of our customers can be taken on board with regard to 
HSE matters. The Group is open to collaborating with 
customers to develop new products and is currently 
undertaking collaborative research to develop ‘greener’ 
alternatives for use in the products we manufacture. 
This kind of research is still at a very early stage but it 
demonstrates our commitment to reduce the impact of 
our operations on the environment. 
Our global procurement team is primarily responsible 
for engaging with suppliers and an employee training 
programme is in place which includes courses on Mutual 
Respect, Environmental Awareness in Manufacturing and 
Environmental Stewardship. Over 500 employees have 
completed at least one of these courses in 2008.

Product stewardship
Elementis recognises its responsibility to ensure that its 
products are safe for intended use, transport and the 
environment throughout the product life cycle. Safe use 
is guided by long experience of many of our products in 
conjunction with third party studies and regulatory 
requirements. Information is provided via technical 
bulletins, safety data sheets and labelling – supported by 
discussion with our customers and suppliers, and 
participation in studies by industry associations. 
We continuously adopt a consistent and coordinated approach 
to regulatory matters concerning our products at global, 
national and regional levels which complement industry 
voluntary efforts. Where new regulations are required, we 
believe they should be based on established scientific risk 
assessment and risk management principles. They should 
be predictable, flexible and capable of responsibly addressing 
society’s economic, environmental and safety requirements.
The Group is fully engaged in the new European REACH 
programme and met the 2008 requirements. We pre-registered 
more than 700 substances in order to cover products 
manufactured in Europe, imported products and required 
global raw materials. To support our global customers and 
markets, we implemented a structure to enable us to provide 
‘Only Representative’ services under REACH to cover imports 
into Europe by Group entities and key customers, and we 
created a framework to cover ‘re-imports’ into Europe. 
The Product Stewardship team is involved in many consortia 
coordinating the REACH registration of our most important 
product categories. We will continue to actively support 
consortia and organisations such as CEFIC (European 
Chemical Industry Council) and SIEF (Substance Information 
Exchange Forum) in the future. In addition to complying 
with the REACH regulatory requirements, Elementis plans 
to strategically maintain an efficient supply chain and 
protect our critical global businesses and customers.
Community involvement
Elementis works with local communities to provide 
information on its activities and be a responsible neighbour. 
The Company provides focused support for children and 
disadvantaged groups, and encourages employees to be 
active in their communities through volunteer work 
or fundraising. 
Including donations made in the UK, which are disclosed 
on page 24, the Group made charitable donations worth 
more than £15,400 in 2008 (2007: £12,500) to over 34 
(2007: 30) different organisations supporting various 
causes in and around the locality of our offices and plants 
in the US and UK. Organisations and groups supported 
last year include local youth and sports clubs, schools, 
arts groups, hospice and other welfare related groups, 
and medical research and health related charities.
The Company also operated a payroll giving programme in 
the UK and, for over ten years, the Eaglescliffe operations in 
Stockton-on-Tees have leased at peppercorn rent 116 acres 
of land to a local ecology and conservation study group 
which is used by schools to conduct environmental studies 
and as a calming learning environment for children with 
emotional and behavioural difficulties. Some of our employees 
act voluntarily as officers of the Group. The conservation 
group has in recent years set up partnerships with two local 
schools who use the site as Forest School classrooms where 
children can learn about ecology and the natural environment. 
In addition to the amounts disclosed above, our Delden 
manufacturing facility in The Netherlands sponsored a 
number of events organised by local community groups 
to raise money or awareness for certain causes, which 
included disability groups, the emergency services and 
welfare appeals for ex-servicemen and women. The total 
amount sponsored was €1,000 which excludes time given 
to employees to volunteer. 
In China, employees in our Changxing plant and Shanghai 
sales office donated more than RMB50,000 from their 
pay last year to the Red Cross Organization of China 
in response to the earthquake disaster in the Sichuan 
Province. Deuchem contributed RMB100,000 to the same 
emergency response fund.
Elementis works with local communities to provide information 
on its activities and be a responsible neighbour. The Company 
provides focused support for children and disadvantaged groups, 
and encourages employees to be active in their communities 
through volunteer work or fundraising.

Report and financial statements
The directors submit their report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Principal activities, business review 
and future development 
For the purposes of this report, the expression ‘Company’ 
or ‘Elementis’ means Elementis plc and the expression 
‘Group’ means the Company and its subsidiaries.
The main activities of the Group are the manufacture and sale 
of specialty chemicals. The Business review on pages 4 to 19, 
which forms a part of this report, contains a fair review of, 
and likely future trends and factors that might affect, the 
development, performance and position of the Group. A review 
of principal risks and uncertainties is set out on pages 13 and 14 
and policies on financial risk can be found in note 22 to 
the financial statements on page 58. The Corporate social 
responsibility report on pages 15 to 19 summarises the 
Group’s approach to health and safety, the environment, 
social responsibility and community matters.
The Group’s corporate headquarters are in London, UK 
and its operational headquarters are based in Hightstown, 
New Jersey, USA. Each division of the Group is managed 
on a global basis with operations at over 30 locations in 
eight countries. 
The Group undertakes, on a continuing basis, research and 
development activities for new products and to improve 
existing products.
Results
The Group profit for the year attributable to equity holders 
of the parent amounted to £19.8 million (2007: £48.0 million).
Dividend
Details about the final dividend for the year are disclosed in 
the Chairman’s statement on page 2.
Directors
The present directors of the Company are Robert Beeston, 
Ian Brindle, Andrew Christie, David Dutro, Chris Girling, 
Kevin Matthews and Brian Taylorson. With the exception of 
Andrew Christie, who was appointed on 11 August 2008, all 
these directors served on the Board throughout the financial 
year. Past directors include Ken Minton who retired as a 
director at the end of the 2008 Annual General Meeting on 
24 April 2008 and Matthew Peacock who left the Board on 
31 January 2008. More information about the directors is 
provided in the Corporate governance report.
The interests of directors in the share capital of the 
Company are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), Ian Brindle, 
Andrew Christie and Chris Girling will retire in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association and offer 
themselves for election or re‑election by shareholders. None 
of these directors has a service contract with the Company. 
All non‑executive directors, with the exception of Andrew 
Christie who joined the Board in August 2008, took part in a 
performance evaluation and their performance continues to 
be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles. 
The Board recommends the election of Andrew Christie and 
the re‑election of Ian Brindle and Chris Girling. Biographical 
information on these three directors, as well as on the other 
directors, is shown on page 21.
Employment policies
The Group Chief Executive is the Board member responsible 
for employee matters and he is assisted by a Vice‑President 
of Global Human Resources. The Group employs HR specialists 
throughout its worldwide locations to advise on all HR 
matters including training and development, and various HR 
performance indicators are maintained in order to monitor 
and evaluate the effectiveness of employment policies.
Elementis values the diverse backgrounds of all its people 
and works to create an open atmosphere of trust, honesty 
and respect. Harassment or discrimination of any kind – 
including that involving race, colour, religion, gender, age, 
national origin, citizenship, mental or physical disabilities, 
sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other similarly 
protected status – is unacceptable. This principle applies 
to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, 
placement, transfer, promotion, layoff, recall, termination 
and other terms and conditions of employment. The Group 
is committed to providing equal employment opportunities 
for all Elementis people and all applicants for employment, 
based on individual qualifications and without regard to the 
factors mentioned above. It is Group policy to comply with 
all applicable laws governing employment practices and 
not to discriminate on the basis of any unlawful criteria, 
and its practices include the prohibition on the use of child 
or forced labour. Employment policies are fair and equitable 
and consistent with the skills and abilities of the employee 
and the needs of the business. Elementis respects the rights 
of its employees to join a trade union and, out of its global 
workforce, just under one third of all employees are 
represented by a trade union or collective agreement.
In terms of how our employment policies are applied to 
employees who have or acquire a disability, the Group’s 
policy is, wherever practicable, to provide continuing 
employment under normal terms and conditions and to 
provide training, career development and promotion to 
disabled employees wherever appropriate.
The Board expects the Group to conduct its operations 
based on sound ethical practices which are open and free 
from discrimination and harassment. Further information 
about the Group’s policy on business conduct and ethics 
is set out in the Corporate social responsibility report. 
Employee communications and involvement
It is Group policy to communicate with all employees on 
major matters to encourage them to take a wider interest 
in the affairs of their employing company and the Group 
and to make them aware of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Company’s performance. This is done 
in a variety of ways including informal consultations, 
bulletins and briefing sessions. There are well established 
procedures, including regular meetings with recognised 
unions, to ensure that the views of employees are taken into 
account in making decisions likely to affect their interests. 
Managers throughout the Group have a responsibility to 
Directors’ report CorporA te GovernAnCe
Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008

keep their staff informed of developments and matters 
of interest. The Company operates savings‑related share 
option schemes allowing UK and US employees an 
opportunity to become shareholders, details of which are 
set out in note 25 to the financial statements on page 69.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future performance and development are 
set out in the Business review on pages 4 to 19. The financial 
position of the Group and description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties are set out above in the Finance report on 
pages 8 to 14. Note 22 details the Group’s exposure to credit, 
liquidity and market risk and its mechanisms for dealing 
with these risks.
The Group’s primary source of funding is a syndicated 
£150 million revolving credit facility which is not due for 
renewal before July 2011. At the year end, the Group’s net 
debt was £63.9 million. Compliance with covenants is reported 
half‑yearly to the syndicate of banks and involves tests 
for net debt: EBITDA ratio, interest cover and net worth. 
No breaches in covenants were reported during the year. 
Additionally, the Group uses various short and medium term 
forecasts to monitor anticipated future compliance and, 
in the current volatile economic conditions, have further 
modified the modelling to include worst case scenario 
planning in order to stress test the assumptions and identify 
the headroom on the covenant tests. In addition, management 
has considered the various mitigating actions that could 
be taken to reduce the impact of a prolonged downturn in 
trading. Such measures include reductions in fixed costs, 
a reduction in capital expenditure and reductions in those 
items of working capital within management’s control.
After evaluating the covenant compliance modelling and the 
ongoing trading of the businesses, including the potential 
closure of operations in the UK Chromium business, the 
directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue to operate for the 
foreseeable future as going concerns. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements. 
Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares, 
as set out in note 39 to the financial statements on page 78. 
All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid 
up and rank equally in all respects. The rights attached to 
them, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, 
are set out in the Company’s articles of association (‘the 
articles’). Other than those specific provisions set out in the 
articles, there are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them. 
From time to time the Elementis Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (‘Trust’) holds shares in the Company for the purposes 
of various share incentive plans and the rights attaching to 
them are exercised by independent trustees, who may take 
into account any recommendation by the Company. As at 
31 December 2008 the Trust held 4,736,829 ordinary shares 
of 5 pence each in the Company. A dividend waiver is in 
place in respect of all shares held by the Trust. 
Directors, articles and purchase of shares
Rules about the appointment and replacement of directors 
are set out in the articles. Changes to the articles must be 
approved by shareholders passing a special resolution. 
The directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK 
legislation and by the articles. The Board has the power 
conferred on it by shareholders to purchase its own shares 
and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming 
AGM within the limits set out in the notice of that meeting.
Significant agreements – change of control
Other than as set out in this paragraph, there are no 
significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of change 
of control of the Company. The Company is a guarantor 
under the Group’s £150 million revolving credit facility which 
runs until July 2011. Under the terms of that facility, in the 
event of a change of control, any lender among the facility 
syndicate, of which there are eight with commitments 
ranging from £10 million to £27 million, may withdraw from 
the facility and that lender’s participation in any loans drawn 
down are required to be repaid. 
Under David Dutro’s service contract with the Company, 
compensation is payable to him equivalent to one year’s 
basic salary if he terminates his contract upon a change of 
control provided that the Company has not first obtained a 
written agreement to be bound by his service contract from 
any successor in a change of control. There is no specific 
change of control provision in Brian Taylorson’s service 
contract with the Company but the provisions on early 
termination set out on page 31 of the Directors’ remuneration 
report apply and compensation equivalent to one year’s 
basic salary and benefits would be payable if less than 
12 months’ notice of termination by the Company is given. 
Significant relationships
The Group has in place a number of supply contracts for key 
raw materials that are essential to the business. In Specialty 
Products, supply contracts are for clays, quaternary amines 
and other chemical intermediates. The suppliers of these 
contracts are important and, although we have sought to 
develop a strategic long term relationship with them, we 
have taken steps to maintain a sufficiently broad base of 
suppliers to mitigate any supply chain risks. Specialty 
Products also owns and operates a hectorite clay mine 
in California which reduces our reliance on third party 
suppliers for raw materials. The Surfactants business 
sources a number of products from a reasonably wide 
base of third party suppliers for use in the manufacturing 
of its products. These include supplies for ethylene oxide, 
propylene oxide, nonylphenol ethoxylate and fatty alcohols. 
The Chromium division’s key raw materials are chrome ore, 
soda ash and sulphuric acid. Chrome ore is sourced from 
a number of South African mining companies, while soda 
ash is sourced from suppliers in the UK and US. Sulphuric 
acid is sourced from suppliers in the US. The business is 
continually looking for new sources of supplies to broaden 
its base of suppliers. All businesses purchase energy in the 
form of natural gas, fuel oil or electricity. It is the Group’s 
practice to enter into agreements with suppliers to lock 
in the price of approximately 70 per cent of its energy costs 
for each year. Information about individual suppliers is not 
disclosed as the Board considers that disclosure would be 
seriously prejudicial to the Group. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008

Significant relationships continued
As its businesses are reasonably diverse in terms of the 
customers and sectors they serve, the Group is not 
dependent on any particular customer and therefore no 
further information is given. The Group supplies some of its 
products through approved distributors, who are able to 
provide or access technical support services, and has a joint 
venture in China at an organoclay plant and, whilst these 
relationships are an important part of our business, the 
Board does not consider any individual relationship to be 
essential to the Group. The Group values all of its employees 
and, although some perform roles that are more important 
to the business than others, such as technical roles which 
might be more difficult or would take longer to replace, the 
Board does not consider that the Group’s success is 
materially dependent on any single individual. However, the 
Board has reviewed its management succession plans and, 
following the review of remuneration structures by the 
Remuneration Committee, is satisfied that the Company’s 
incentive arrangements are appropriate to attract, retain 
and motivate key people within the organisation.
Substantial shareholders
As at 24 February 2009 the Company had been notified of 
the following interests in 3 per cent or more of its issued 
ordinary capital: 
      Percentage of 
     Ordinary issued ordinary 
     shares share capital

Auditors
A resolution to re‑appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of 
the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM to 
be held on 16 April 2009.
Each director in office at the date of this Directors’ report 
confirms that (a) so far as he is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and (b) he has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Political and charitable donations 
During the year the Group donated £2,240 for charitable 
purposes in the UK (2007: £5,150). The Company made no 
political donations during the year (2007: £nil).
Policy on payment of suppliers
The Company’s and the Group’s policies concerning the 
payment to suppliers is to agree terms of payment at 
the start of business with each supplier and to adhere to 
these, subject to satisfactory performance by the suppliers. 
The Company and the Group do not follow any code or statement 
on payment practice. Trade creditors for the Group at 
31 December 2008 represented 78 days (2007: 67 days) of 
annual purchases, adjusted for currency and acquisitions 
and disposals. The Company has no trade creditors.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
The Company maintains liability insurance for the directors 
and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries. During the 
year, the directors received an ongoing indemnity from the 
Company, against any liability or loss that may arise out of 
or in connection with the execution of their powers, duties 
and responsibilities as directors of the Company or of any 
subsidiary, as permitted under the Companies Act 2006. 
Directors’ conflict of interest
During the year Brian Taylorson was authorised by the 
Board to continue to act as a Trustee of the Group’s UK 
defined benefit pension scheme (‘UK pension scheme’) 
notwithstanding that this role could give rise to a situation 
in which there is a conflict of interest. The Board considers 
that it is appropriate for the Trustees of the UK pension 
scheme to benefit from the financial expertise of the 
Finance Director and that his contribution at Trustees’ 
meetings demonstrates the Board’s commitment to 
supporting the UK pension scheme. The Board’s conflict 
authorisation is subject to annual review and, under the 
terms of the conflict resolution, reciprocal provisions have 
been put in place with a view to safeguarding information 
that is confidential to the Group as well as to the Trustees. 
Were a conflict of interest to arise, Brian Taylorson is required 
to excuse himself from reading the relevant papers and 
absent himself from participating in relevant discussions. 
No other director was in receipt of a conflict authorisation 
from the Board during the year.
Post balance sheet events
As set out in the Chairman’s statement and Business review, 
the Board is evaluating the potential closure of the UK 
Chromium facility and the impact of this is as set out on 
page 7. 
Annual General Meeting
The twelfth Annual General Meeting of the Company will 
be held on 16 April 2009. The Notice of Meeting is included 
in a separate document sent to shareholders.

CorporA te GovernAnCe
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group and Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group financial statements are required by law and 
IFRS, as adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the Group. The Companies Act 
1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
parent company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
  for the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU;
  for the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company financial 
statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Business review, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate 
governance statement that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors, all of whom are shown on page 20, confirm 
that to the best of their knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
they face.

Corporate governance report
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. 
The Company has throughout the year ended 31 December 2008 
applied fully all the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code 
of Corporate Governance (June 2008) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the ‘Combined Code’).
The Board
Composition
The Board currently consists of a non‑executive Chairman, 
Group Chief Executive, Finance Director and four 
non‑executive directors. The directors and biographical 
information about them are shown on pages 20 and 21. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and clearly defined. Non‑executive directors are appointed 
for an initial term of three years, and all directors are 
required under the Articles to retire and offer themselves 
for re‑election at least every three years.
Matthew Peacock left the Board at the end of January 2008 
and Ken Minton retired at the conclusion of the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 24 April 2008. Ian Brindle was 
appointed Senior Independent Director in place of Ken Minton. 
The Nomination Committee appointed The Miles Partnership 
to assist with the recruitment of Andrew Christie as an 
additional non‑executive director. The directors consider 
that the structure and composition of the Board following 
Andrew Christie’s appointment is appropriate to take the 
Company through to the next stage of its development 
and there are no further plans for the time being to 
increase the number of directors on the Board. 
Board independence
The Board considers all the non‑executive directors to 
be independent. The Board is satisfied that each director 
exercises independent judgement and believes no individual 
or group dominates decision making. 
Board operation
The Board operates within a framework of controls used to 
minimise risks and has a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision. These include strategic and annual 
operating plans, the approval of financial statements, 
acquisitions and disposals, risk management and compliance 
programmes including insurance arrangements, major 
non‑recurring projects and major capital expenditures. 
The Board regularly reviews management performance 
and sets values and standards to ensure that its obligations 
to shareholders and others are understood and met. It also 
delegates specific responsibilities with written terms of 
reference to the Board Committees described on the 
next page. 
Information of an appropriate quality is issued in a timely 
manner to assist the Board in performing its duties. 
New directors receive appropriate induction tailored to their 
needs. This includes visits to manufacturing facilities and 
meetings with senior management to assist them in building 
an understanding of how the Group operates and the issues 
that it faces. New directors are advised of their legal and 
other duties and other obligations as directors of a listed 
company. All members of the Board have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary and may 
take independent professional advice as appropriate at 
the expense of the Company. 
At least one meeting of the Board each year is held at one of 
the Group’s overseas locations and directors are encouraged 
to undertake such activities and training as is appropriate or 
may be required or desirable in order to carry out their duties. 
Last year, the Board had one of its meetings in Delden, 
The Netherlands and the meeting was followed by a tour 
of the manufacturing facility there which is shared by Specialty 
Products and Surfactants. Inspecting such operating 
facilities and interacting with staff help non‑executive 
directors to understand better the risks and opportunities 
faced by the business, including environmental, social and 
governance risks. 
Board performance evaluation
The Board is supportive of the principles and provisions of 
the Combined Code on Board performance evaluation and 
towards the end of last year carried out an evaluation of its 
performance, including that of its committees and individual 
directors using comprehensive assessment questionnaires. 
The results of the questionnaires were reviewed by the 
Board, which believes that the performance of non‑executive 
directors continues to be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to their role. 
During the year the Senior Independent Director chaired 
a meeting of the directors to review the performance of the 
Chairman without him being present, and concluded that the 
Chairman was fully effective in his role. The non‑executive 
directors, including the Chairman, also met during the year 
without the executive directors present to discuss their 
performance and succession planning.
Communication with shareholders
The Board has developed a comprehensive programme to 
ensure that effective communication with shareholders, 
analysts and the financial press is maintained throughout 
the year. Through the annual and interim reports, results 
and other announcements, as well as through presentations 
to institutional shareholders and the dissemination of 
information via the Group’s website at www.elementis.com, 
the Board seeks to present the Company’s strategy and 
performance in an objective and balanced manner.
Shareholders attending the AGM are invited to ask questions 
during the meeting and also to meet the directors after the 
formal business of the meeting has concluded. The 
chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are 
also available to answer questions from any shareholder at 
the meeting. Full details of proxy votes cast on each 
resolution are made available to shareholders at the 
meeting and are made available on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.
The Board receives regular reports on any meetings held 
with shareholders or analysts, and the Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director are also available for contact 
by shareholders at any time.  CorporA te GovernAnCe

Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, all with defined terms 
of reference, modelled closely on those set out in the 
Combined Code, which are available from the Company 
Secretary or can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.elementis.com. 
Audit Committee
The chairman and members of the Audit Committee 
(the ‘Committee’) during 2008 and their attendance 
records are shown in the table above. 
The Committee has two members with ‘recent and relevant 
financial experience’ as recommended by the Combined 
Code. Chris Girling is a chartered accountant and was until 
April 2007 group finance director of Carillion plc which is a 
FTSE 250 listed company. Ian Brindle’s experience is based 
on his career with PricewaterhouseCoopers and his previous 
roles at the Accounting Standards Board and the Financial 
Reporting Review Panel.
A description of the remit and work of the Audit Committee
The Committee has delegated authority from the Board for:
  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and 
reviewing significant accounting policies, judgements 
and estimates contained within them;
  reviewing the effectiveness of internal control and risk 
management systems, including control over financial 
reporting; 
  reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function, 
including of the risk management programme; 
  reviewing the Group’s policies and practices concerning 
business conduct, ethics and integrity and on 
whistleblowing; and 
  overseeing all aspects of the relationship with the 
external auditors, including their appointment, the audit 
process, the supply of non audit services and monitoring 
their effectiveness and independence. 
The Audit Committee met four times during 2008. Findings 
and recommendations at each of its meetings are given 
to the Board. The Committee met to review the annual 
and interim reports and financial statements and also to 
receive half yearly reports from the internal audit providers, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’), as well as representations 
from management. During the year it reviewed the effectiveness 
of the internal and external audit activities through meetings 
and interviews with management and key finance staff, approved 
the scope of work of and fees for both internal and external 
auditors, and concluded that, owing to the complexity and 
international nature of the Group’s businesses, the internal 
audit function was best served by continuing to outsource to 
PwC, given their global expertise and resources. The Committee 
also reviewed the Group’s risk management programme as 
part of the full Board’s review of risk management at 
meetings held in October and December. 
The Committee also keeps under review the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditors (‘KPMG’) and 
the nature and extent of the non audit services which they 
provide. The Company’s policy is that any appointment of the 
external auditors to undertake non audit work is subject to 
the approval of the Audit Committee unless it falls below the 
threshold, in which case the Finance Director has delegated 
authority from the Committee to approve such appointments. 
The threshold is that any individual non audit engagement 
fee is no greater than 15 per cent of the annual Group audit 
fee and the total cost of non audit engagements in the same 
financial year do not exceed 50 per cent of the annual Group 
audit fee. The external auditors were appointed during the 
year to undertake tax work on behalf of the Group, provide 
pensions advisory services and undertake other Group and 
capital reorganisation related project work. It was concluded 
that their knowledge of the Group’s business processes and 
controls made them best placed to undertake this work 
cost‑effectively on the Group’s behalf. The Committee 
considers that, notwithstanding these non audit services 
they provided during the year, the external auditors’ 
objectivity was not impaired. In coming to its decision

Corporate governance report
A description of the remit and work of the 
Audit Committee continued
to recommend the reappointment of the external auditors, 
the Committee considered and discussed many factors 
including the following: KPMG’s independence and quality 
control procedures; risk of KPMG withdrawing from the 
audit market; the fact that the 2008 financial statements 
were the fifth set of full year accounts to be audited by 
KPMG; the length of time it takes for external auditors 
to develop an adequate understanding of the Group’s 
businesses and the fact that KPMG had agreed to rotate 
its Senior Audit Partner in 2009; and the extent of non audit 
services provided by KPMG. 
The Committee reviewed its policy on whistleblowing during 
the year as well as reports on its operation. In addition to 
having internal procedures for reporting any suspected cases 
of wrongdoing, the Group has appointed an independent 
third party through whom issues may be raised and toll‑free 
‘AlertLine’ numbers are provided in all the jurisdictions 
where it operates. Management reports all incidents that 
have been raised to the Audit Committee together with the 
outcome of the investigation and steps taken to ensure 
lessons are learned to prevent their recurrence. Treasury, 
banking and currency hedging policies were also reviewed 
and updated during the year. 
Nomination Committee
The chairman and members of the Nomination Committee 
(the ‘Committee’) and their attendance records are shown 
on page 27. The Committee is responsible for:
  reviewing the size and composition of the Board, together 
with the skills, knowledge and experience of its members 
and make recommendations for change as necessary;
  carrying out an annual performance evaluation of the 
Board and its committees and members; and
  succession planning for the Board and leadership team.
The Committee met five times last year to discuss changes 
to the Board and its committees, including the appointment 
of Andrew Christie, review the results of the Board performance 
evaluation (‘BPE’) exercise and consider succession planning 
matters. Two of these meetings were attended by both 
executive directors. The Committee considers that the 
appointment of Andrew Christie, with his investment 
banking background and experience of working in Asia 
Pacific, complements the existing skills and experience on 
the Board. There are no plans to recruit further directors. 
There were no issues of significant concern raised in the 
BPE exercise. As part of the review process on succession 
planning, the Remuneration Committee was asked to 
undertake an in‑depth review of the existing remuneration 
structures of senior executives with a view to ensuring they 
are appropriately motivated and retaining their services for 
the longer term. The outcome of that review is explained 
in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Remuneration Committee
Details about the Remuneration Committee are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 30 to 36.
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing 
the effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only be 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
mis‑statement or loss.
The Board is of the view that an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced 
by the Group was in place throughout the financial year 
under review and up to the date that this Annual Report was 
approved. This process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Turnbull’ 
and ‘Smith’ guidance, as amended, on internal control.  CorporA te GovernAnCe
Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008

The key features of the Group’s internal control system are:
Control environment
A key factor in the Group’s approach to internal control 
is the recognition of the need for risk awareness and the 
ownership of risk management by executives at all levels. 
The Group has policies and procedures that set out 
the responsibilities of divisional management, including 
authority levels, reporting disciplines and responsibility for risk 
management and internal control. Certain activities, including 
treasury, taxation, insurance, pension and legal matters are 
controlled centrally with reports reviewed by the Board as 
appropriate. Site level policies and procedures are set by divisional 
management as appropriate to the needs of each business unit. 
risk identification and review
Key identified risks, both financial and non financial, are 
reviewed by the Board as well as by divisional management 
on an ongoing basis, which is supported by the work of the 
Audit Committee and the internal audit service, which is 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’). A formal 
annual review of risks and controls is carried out by both the 
management team and the Board, and includes 
presentations from senior managers. 
The management team, which comprises the executive 
directors, divisional managing directors and functional 
business leaders, meets on a regular basis to review each 
division’s performance, strategy and risk management. 
Their work is supported by a central risk management unit 
whose terms of reference include supporting corporate 
governance requirements, recommending business risk 
strategy and developing policies and procedures for risk 
management and internal controls. PwC’s work covers the 
monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls and the 
design of processes to test the effectiveness of controls. 
At operating level, all divisions are required to have processes 
to identify risks and, so far as possible, take action to reduce 
those risks, and annual compliance statements on internal 
control are certified by each operating division.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive Groupwide system of financial 
reporting. Figures reported include profit, cash flows, capital 
expenditure, balance sheet and relevant performance 
indicators. Each operating division prepares an annual 
operating plan which is approved by the Board. Thereafter a 
formal re‑forecasting exercise is undertaken three times a 
year. Actual monthly results are monitored against budget, 
forecasts and the previous year’s results. Any significant 
variances are investigated and acted upon as appropriate.
Investment appraisal
There are clearly defined investment guidelines for capital 
expenditure. All investment expenditure is subject to formal 
authorisation procedures, with major proposals being 
considered by the Board. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee plays a critical role within the Company’s 
system of internal control and risk management and a full 
description of its work is given on pages 27 and 28.

Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) was 
chaired by Ken Minton until he retired in April last year 
when Kevin Matthews was appointed chairman in his place. 
The Committee determines the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the executive directors, and recommends 
and monitors the structure and level of remuneration for 
senior executives.
The Committee met six times last year and its members and 
their attendance records are shown on page 27. Members of 
the Committee have no personal financial interest other than 
as shareholders in the matters to be decided and no day‑to‑day 
involvement in the running of the business of the Group.
Advisers to the Committee
The Vice‑President of Global Human Resources is the internal 
adviser to the Committee and provides information and advice 
to facilitate discussion and decision making on remuneration 
matters. He also provides the Company and its subsidiaries 
with services which include the setting of employment policies, 
recruitment of senior managers and overall responsibility 
for all major issues involving human resources.
Towards the end of last year, the Committee appointed 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’), after a tender, as its 
external advisers to carry out a benchmarking exercise on 
senior executive remuneration and review existing remuneration 
structures. This review was undertaken both in response to 
the current financial market environment and in connection 
with the Nomination Committee’s work on succession 
planning. HNBS also undertook some project related work 
on behalf of the Company last year but otherwise have no 
other connection with the Company.
Annual General Meeting
A resolution to approve this report will be tabled at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). The chairman of the 
Committee will be available to answer questions from 
shareholders on the decisions of the Committee. 
Remuneration policy and practice
The policy of the Committee for the current and subsequent 
years is to set basic salaries at a level which is competitive 
with that of comparable businesses enabling the Company 
to attract and retain people with relevant ability, experience 
and skills. To ensure that executive directors align their 
interests to those of shareholders a substantial proportion 
of the overall remuneration package is linked to individual 
and corporate performance through participation in short 
term and long term incentive schemes. The mix between 
fixed and variable pay was reviewed by HNBS which they 
confirmed as being broadly in line with market practice. 
The Committee does not consider corporate performance 
on environmental, social and corporate governance issues 
when setting the remuneration of executive directors. 
The safety performance of our businesses is accorded high 
importance and the Committee considers that management 
should aspire to achieving high standards in both safety and 
environmental performance without the need for incentives. 
It is also not appropriate to remunerate executive directors 
on the basis of corporate governance performance as corporate 
governance standards are set by the Board as a whole. 
2008 was an excellent year for the Group in terms of both 
strategic and financial performance. The acquisitions of 
Deuchem and Yuhong have significantly expanded our 
presence in Asia Pacific and increased the opportunities 
for further growth in Specialty Products, which will lead 
to increased shareholder value over the medium term. 
The Group’s financial performance has been very strong 
last year and this includes working capital and cash flow 
management. Accordingly, the Committee considers that 
the level of management bonuses for 2008 is appropriate 
since it is strongly linked to performance.
With regard to 2009, the Committee is mindful of the uncertainty 
surrounding the economy and aware of investor concerns in 
relation to executive salary increases, bonuses and bonus 
targets. As a result, the Committee decided to maintain the 
basic salaries of the executive directors at their 2008 level 
in 2009 and, in order to minimise the impact on cash flow 
whilst acting as a useful retention tool, agreed to pay one 
third of any bonus payments in 2009 in the form of deferred 
shares. Further details are explained later in this report.
Salaries, fees and benefits
Salaries for executive directors are determined by 
the Committee and are reviewed annually by it, taking 
into account individual performance over the previous 
12 months, external benchmark salary data and pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. The basic 
salaries of the executive directors and business managing 
directors have been kept at their 2008 level in 2009. 
Benefits relate to the provision of a car, life assurance 
and medical cover. Additionally, as is standard in the 
US, David Dutro receives benefits covering dental costs, 
accidental death and disablement, and long term disability. 
Information about pension benefits and share incentive 
schemes is provided further below.
Fees for non‑executive directors are determined by the 
Board, having regard to fees paid to non‑executive directors 
in other UK quoted companies, the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role. No share options are held by 
non‑executive directors and individuals cannot vote on their 
own remuneration.
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that salaried executive directors 
should have service contracts with the Company that contain 
a termination notice period not exceeding 12 months, as is 
the case with the service agreements of David Dutro and 
Brian Taylorson.
Termination payments in relation to departing executive 
directors are not agreed in advance and are determined 
in accordance with the directors’ contractual rights. It is 
the Committee’s policy to ensure that a director’s duty to 
mitigate his loss is taken into account in the calculation 
of any termination payments.
The total amount that would be payable to David Dutro for 
early termination by the Company of his service agreement 
is between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate of 
(i) his basic annual salary and (ii) any bonus which he may 
be eligible to receive. CorporA te GovernAnCe
Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008
31
The total amount that would be payable to Brian Taylorson 
for early termination by the Company of his service agreement 
is also between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate 
of (i) his basic annual salary, (ii) the sums that would have 
become payable to him or on his behalf, had 12 months’ 
notice of termination been given, by way of pension accruals 
and any pension cash salary supplement, (iii) the cost of 
providing private medical insurance for him, his spouse and 
children aged under 21 for the 12 months following termination, 
and (iv) his monthly car allowance for a 12 month period.
The non‑executive directors during the year held 
engagement letters with the Company as follows:
    Date of  Date of 
Name    appointment re‑appointment Date of expiry
R Beeston   21/09/06 n/a 20/09/09
I Brindle   06/06/05 06/06/08 05/06/11
A Christie   11/08/08 n/a 10/08/11
C Girling   29/04/05 29/04/08 28/04/11
K Matthews   16/02/05 16/02/08 15/02/11
K Minton   06/06/05 n/a retired
M Peacock   06/06/05 n/a resigned
Each letter provides that the director’s appointment can be 
terminated by the Company on six months’ notice on any 
grounds without claim for compensation. The appointments 
of Kevin Matthews, Ian Brindle and Chris Girling were 
renewed for a second three‑year term last year. Kevin 
Matthews was re‑elected at the 2008 AGM and both Ian 
Brindle and Chris Girling will be subject to re‑election by 
shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
Short term incentive arrangements 
The 2008 Annual Bonus Scheme for David Dutro and 
Brian Taylorson was based on the achievement of earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) performance hurdles contained in the 
operating plan, at threshold, target and upper levels. 
The threshold level was set at 2007 EPS (at which point 
a bonus of 7.50 per cent of basic salary could be earned). 
At the target level, the bonus provided for a value of 
70 per cent of basic salary at the time the payment is 
made, and at upper level a further 30 per cent of basic 
salary can be earned. 
There is an additional element in which both executive directors 
can share, together with five other senior executives, up to 
a maximum amount for achieving EPS over and above the 
upper level, which for the executive directors was equivalent 
to 45 per cent of their average basic annual salary. The EPS 
goal for this additional element was set at 15 per cent above 
the EPS at target level.
As a result of satisfying all elements in the 2008 bonus 
scheme, David Dutro and Brian Taylorson earned total 
bonuses equivalent to 141 per cent and 150 per cent 
respectively of their basic salary. The total amount of bonus 
payments made are shown in the Directors’ remuneration 
table on page 34.
Following the review by HNBS, and after due consideration 
by the Committee, a number of modifications have been 
made to the 2009 Annual Bonus Scheme. The maximum 
amount of bonus will be 150 per cent of basic salary and 
EPS conditions have been set at threshold, target and upper 
levels; there is no longer any additional bonus element for 
EPS performance above the upper level. At the threshold 
level, a bonus equivalent to 6.25 per cent of basic salary can 
be earned, rising to 100 per cent of salary for achieving 
target performance and 150 per cent for achieving the upper 
target. This new linear scale is more straight forward and 
transparent than the previous one and the EPS condition at 
target level in 2009 is virtually the same in absolute terms 
and equivalent in level of difficulty to the EPS condition at 
upper level under the 2008 plan. The upper target in 2009 
is the same in absolute terms and equivalent in level of 
difficulty as the target and level of performance in last 
year’s additional bonus element.
A new element introduced is that for all bonus payments 
under the 2009 bonus scheme, two thirds will be paid in cash 
and one third will be in the form of deferred shares under a 
new 2009 Deferred Share Bonus Plan adopted by the Board, 
to vest after two years. The number of shares granted will 
be based on the market value of a share at the date of the 
share awards which is when the bonus payments are made 
and all shares that vest will be met from existing shares 
held in an Employee Share Ownership Trust. The Committee 
believes that these arrangements provide an appropriate 
incentive to the management team and provides a further 
element of retention, both of which it considers to be 
important in the current environment. The bonus scheme 
for other senior executives, such as the business managing 
directors, follows a similar design and structure, except that 
the performance conditions include divisional performance 
in addition to corporate EPS.
The following are key features of the new 2009 Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan: the maximum number of shares that 
may be awarded to each participant in any one year is 
restricted to shares with a total value equal to 50 per cent of 
basic salary of the participant; shares vest two years after 
the date of award; participants must remain in the employment 
of a nominated participating company that is a member 
of the Group up to the date the awards vest; ‘good leaver’ 
provisions mean that awards held by participants who retire 
early on the grounds of ill health, are made redundant under 
employment legislation or cease to be employed within the 
Group because of the transfer of a business, will vest on the 
date of such cessation of employment and before the normal 
two year vesting period; there is no financial performance 
condition attaching to the awards; participants will receive 
awards for nil consideration; in a change of control, the 
shares will vest immediately or, with the acquiring company’s 
consent, lapse provided that they are replaced by new awards 
in that acquiring company; participants have no rights to 
dividends or voting rights until such time as the shares 
have vested and are registered in their names; awards are 
non assignable or transferable; and the awards may be 
adjusted if there is a variation of capital. As this new plan 
does not constitute a long term incentive plan and does not 
involve the issuing of new shares, shareholders have not 
been asked to approve it.  Elementis plc

Directors’ remuneration report
1998 Executive share option schemes
The 1998 approved and unapproved executive share option 
schemes (the ‘1998 schemes’) are discretionary option 
schemes under which senior management below Board 
level were granted options to purchase shares in the Company. 
The price at which options may be exercised is the average 
market price over the five working days preceding the grant 
and there is no discount. Options are capable of exercise 
after three years and within 10 years of the date of grant; 
those granted since 1995 are subject to earnings per share 
performance targets. The 1998 schemes have now expired 
and no further options will be granted. However, subject 
to the rules of the schemes, certain awards continue to 
remain exercisable.
2003 Executive share option schemes
The 2003 approved and unapproved schemes (the ‘2003 
schemes’) replaced the 1998 schemes. The key features 
of the 2003 schemes are as follows: options are granted with 
an exercise price per share based on the Company’s share 
price immediately before the date of grant; the value of 
options valued at the date of grant will not normally exceed 
1.5 times basic salary in any financial year; performance 
conditions attached to the exercise of options granted between 
2003 and 2007 to executive directors and other senior managers 
were based partly on the Company’s EPS growth relative 
to inflation and partly on the Company’s total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’) relative to the comparator companies listed 
below; and the performance conditions attached to the 
options granted to executives in 2008 were based on EPS 
targets only.
The comparator companies for the purposes of grants made 
between 2003 to 2007 were as follows:
FTSE All Share Chemicals  Croda International Plc 
Porvair plc 
Yule Catto & Co plc
FTSE Eurotop 300 Chemicals  Akzo Nobel NV 
Ciba Specialty Chemicals  
DSM NV
S&P 500 Chemicals  Dow Chemical Company 
 Rohm & Haas Company
Switzerland: Specialty Chemicals Lonza Group AG
S&P 400 Specialty Chemicals  Ferro Corp 
HB Fuller Co 
Minerals Technologies Inc 
Arch Chemicals Inc 
Quaker Chemical Corp
France:  Chemicals Rhodia SA
The following targets applied to options granted to executive 
directors and other senior managers prior to 2008:
Proportion of   Performance 
option grant   criteria to 
exercisable as   be met for 
multiplier of  EPS/TSR options to be 
base salary  split exercisable
0.0 to 0.7 50% EPS Annual average EPS 
   growth of 4% + RPI 
  50% TSR TSR at median
0.71 to 1.5  50% EPS Annual average EPS 
    growth of between 
     4.1% + RPI and 10% + RPI  
    (straight line vesting) 
   50% TSR TSR at median to upper  
    quartile (straight line vesting)
The EPS performance condition and TSR condition apply 
separately to options granted under the 2003 schemes. 
The performance conditions attaching to options granted 
from 2006 onwards are tested at the time the options vest 
and lapse immediately if they are not satisfied.
The executive directors and two business managing 
directors received awards under the LTIP instead of 
executive options in 2008. The remaining senior executives 
and other managers who were granted executive options 
last year had the following performance conditions attaching 
to their options: 50 per cent of the award would vest if 
annual average EPS of 4 per cent plus RPI is achieved and 
the other 50 per cent would also vest if annual average EPS 
of 5 per cent plus RPI is achieved, with straight line vesting 
in between 4 and 5 per cent for the second 50 per cent 
component. The Committee concluded that the TSR 
measure was no longer appropriate for this group of 
managers and considered that the new EPS targets were 
sufficiently challenging yet ensured these managers 
remained appropriately incentivised.
2008 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Following last year’s AGM, the following LTIP awards were 
made: David Dutro 25 per cent of the LTIP pool, Brian Taylorson 
20 per cent of LTIP pool, Greg McClatchy, Managing Director 
of Specialty Products and Surfactants, 20 per cent and 
Eric Haaijer, Managing Director of Chromium, 12 per cent, 
leaving 23 per cent of the LTIP pool unawarded. The value 
of the LTIP pool (in £’millions) is calculated by taking 
2.15 per cent of the increase in the value of the Company 
(measured by share price growth over the three year 
performance period plus all dvidends paid or declared 
during that period) less 9.3 per cent per annum (being the 
cost of equity) which is the minimum growth threshold. 
The LTIP awards are in respect of shares in the Company 
equal to the value of each participant’s share of the LTIP 
pool. These awards were granted on 28 April 2008 when 
the market value of a share was 66.5 pence. The awards vest 
after three years from the date of grant and are subject to 
the cost of equity performance condition described above.  33

Like many other companies, the Committee undertook 
an in‑depth review of all senior executive remuneration 
structures in response to the general deterioration of 
the economy in 2008. After taking into consideration the 
independent advice of HNBS, it concluded that no modification 
is required for the time being to the existing LTIP awards. 
The Committee remains convinced that the LTIP in its 
current format is the right approach for incentivising senior 
executives over the long term, in terms of performance and 
reward, aligning their interests with those of shareholders 
while providing an appropriate retention tool.
During its review, the Committee decided that the rules 
of the LTIP contained sufficient flexibility and therefore 
no changes are being proposed to shareholders. The rules 
contain a provision, that was added on the advice of many 
of the major shareholders who were consulted, which allows 
the Committee to extend the performance period by one 
or more years if it considers that the share price has been 
affected by external factors which it considers to be 
exceptional, provided that the performance threshold is 
increased for each additional year the performance period 
is extended by. The Committee believes that a more appropriate 
time for considering any proposal to extend the performance 
period would be in early 2010, when the LTIP will have run 
for a longer period and the Board will have better visibility 
on the economy and, therefore, be more able to determine 
whether or not the share price reflects the underlying value 
of the Company. Finally, reviewing the LTIP awards in 2010 
would also give shareholders more notice of the Committee’s 
plans in advance of when the LTIP awards are due for testing 
in April 2011.
As stated in the circular explaining the LTIP to shareholders 
at last year’s AGM, the awards made in 2008 were one‑off 
awards and therefore the two executive directors and the 
two business managing directors, who received LTIP awards 
last year, will not be receiving in 2009 any grants of either 
share options under the 2003 Executive share option 
schemes, described above, or further share awards under 
the LTIP. If, following its review of the LTIP next year, the 
Committee proposes to make further LTIP awards, it will 
seek prior shareholder approval.
Share ownership guidelines
Shareholding guidelines introduced previously required 
executive directors to build up a stake in the Company over 
a period of time that is equal in value to one times their basic 
annual salaries. Brian Taylorson, who has been Finance Director 
since 2002, is considered to have met this requirement. 
David Dutro, who was appointed to the Board as Group Chief 
Executive in January 2007, is also expected to build up a 
shareholding equal to his annual basic salary. The 2008 
LTIP awards contained a requirement that a proportion 
of the awards which vest must be retained as shares 
by the executive directors in order to build up the required 
shareholding under the Share ownership guidelines. 
Savings‑related share option schemes
Following the 2008 AGM, a new UK savings‑related share 
option scheme (‘2008 UK SAYE scheme’) was adopted under 
which all eligible UK employees, including executive directors, 
can enter into savings contracts with a bank or building 
society for a period of three or five years and use the 
proceeds from their savings accounts to acquire shares in 
the Company on the exercise of their options. The option 
price at which options may be exercised is the average 
market price over the five working days preceding the 
invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent. 
Options granted to executive directors under the 
2008 UK SAYE scheme are not subject to performance 
conditions, as it is a HM Revenue & Customs’ approved 
all‑employee scheme, which does not allow for the imposition 
of performance conditions on the exercise of options. A similar 
scheme was also adopted last year for the benefit of US based 
employees, including executive directors, and the savings 
period is typically 24 months, with an option price discounted 
by a maximum of 15 per cent (‘2008 US share‑based scheme’).
The 2008 UK SAYE and US share‑based schemes replaced 
previous schemes, which expired last year, that contained 
substantially the same provisions as these two new 
schemes. However, subject to the rules of the schemes, 
certain awards continue to remain exercisable.
Total shareholder return performance
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder 
return for the five years ending 31 December 2008, relative 
to the FTSE 250 Index.
This graph looks at the value, to the end of 2008, of £100 
invested in Elementis on 31 December 2003 compared with 
that of £100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index.
The Company is a member of the FTSE 250 Index and 
accordingly this is considered to be the most appropriate 
broad equity market index for the purpose of measuring 
the Company’s relative performance.

next page. His basic salary in 2009 will also remain at the previous year’s level. 
5  The Company has released Brian Taylorson to serve on the Board of Fiberweb plc and fees of £32,000 (2007: £32,000) 
were paid to him during the year.
6  Andrew Christie was appointed on 11 August 2008 so the fee shown above is pro rated.
Retirement benefits
David Dutro, as a US salaried executive director, participated in the Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan (‘ECRRP’) 
for US employees until the plan was closed to future accruals in May 2006. The ECRRP is a cash balance retirement plan, 
which falls under the category of defined benefit pension plans in the US. As the plan is closed to future accruals, participants’ 
account balances are no longer credited with contributions, however, interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 
30 year bond rate. David Dutro’s accrued benefits under this plan are shown in the table on the next page. The normal 
pensionable retirement age for David Dutro under the ECRRP is 65.
The ECRRP was replaced by a US 401(k) Plan, which is similar to a money purchase scheme, and a Non‑Qualified Deferred 
Compensation Plan. Employer contributions in respect of David Dutro under these plans in 2008 were £35,070 (2007: £13,751) 
in total. The amount paid can vary from year to year as it is based on matching employee contributions up to about 5.5 per cent 
of their total remuneration each year.
Brian Taylorson, as a UK salaried executive director, participates in the Company’s HM Revenue & Customs’ approved 
funded occupational pension scheme, and he is subject to the former HM Revenue & Customs’ earnings cap on the amount 
of salary which may be treated as pensionable. 
The main benefits under this scheme to him as a UK salaried executive director, who contributes a percentage of his salary 
to the scheme each year, are: an accrual rate of 1/30 for each year of pensionable service; life assurance cover of four times 
pensionable salary; and  pensions to spouse and dependent children payable on death.
The normal pensionable retirement age for Brian Taylorson is 60. 35

Transfer values for David Dutro and Brian Taylorson in the table above have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice 
in accordance with the UK Institute of Actuaries’ guidance note GN11. The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits 
discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the year, whereas the increase 
in transfer value less directors’ contributions discloses the absolute change in transfer value and includes the change in 
value of the accrued benefits resulting from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the start of the year as well as 
the additional value earned in the year. 
Non‑executive directors are not entitled to retirement benefits.
Directors’ shareholdings
As at 31 December 2008 the interests of the persons who were then directors in the issued shares of the Company 
(excluding any interests under the Group’s employee share schemes) were:

David Dutro retained 25,078 shares that were transferred to him on 26 June 2008 when the market value of a share was 
76.75 pence. The shares had been awarded to him in 2005 under the 2004 Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (‘DSBS’). Under 
the Annual Bonus Scheme in operation at the time, certain senior employees were entitled to receive part of their annual 
bonus payments in the form of deferred shares. There are no outstanding awards under the 2004 DSBS which is no longer 
in use, although, in conjunction with the 2009 Annual Bonus Scheme, as explained above, a new 2009 Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan has been adopted by the Board. 
Andrew Christie was appointed on 11 August 2008. At that date he had no interest in the issued shares of the Company. 
As at 24 February 2009 the Trustee of the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’) held 4,736,829 (2007: 2,676,914) 
shares and, as executive directors, David Dutro and Brian Taylorson, as potential beneficiaries under the ESOT, are deemed 
to have an interest in any shares that become held in the ESOT.
As at 24 February 2009 no person who was then a director had any interest in any derivative or other financial instrument 
relating to the Company’s shares and, so far as the Company is aware, none of their connected persons had such an 
interest. Between 31 December 2008 and 24 February 2009 there was no change in the relevant interests of any such 
directors nor, so far as the Company is aware, in the relevant interests of any of their connected persons. 36

InDepenDent AuDItor’S report
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Elementis plc
We have audited the Group and Company financial statements 
(‘the financial statements’) of Elementis plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense and the related 
notes. These financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing 
the Company financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and 
UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 25.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the Directors’ report 
is consistent with the financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ report includes that information 
presented in the Business review that is cross referred 
from the principal activities, business review and future 
development section of the Directors’ report. In addition 
we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not 
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate governance statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we 
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether 
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks 
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
financial statements. We consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent mis‑statements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
are free from material mis‑statement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and 
of its profit for the year then ended; 
  the Group’s financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and article 4 of the IAS regulations;
  the parent company financial statements give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2008; 
  the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985; and
  the information given in the Directors’ report is 
consistent with the financial statements.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2008
1 Accounting policies
Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the 
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRS’). The Company 
has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with the UK GAAP. These are presented on 
pages 75 to 78.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial 
instruments and financial instruments held for trading or available for sale are stated at their fair value. Non‑current assets 
held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of financial 
statements requires the application of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
revenues and costs and related disclosures at the balance sheet date. The accounting policies set out below have been 
consistently applied across group companies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting policies Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgements or estimates and 
potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions. It is considered that the Group’s 
critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. The development of the estimates and disclosures related 
to each of these matters has been discussed by the Audit Committee.
(a)  Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre‑tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
  A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and 
the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. In accordance with the Group’s environmental 
policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised 
when the land is contaminated. Provisions for environmental issues are judgemental by their nature and more difficult to 
estimate when they relate to sites no longer directly controlled by the Group. Elementis has taken a consistent approach 
to estimating environmental provisions.
(b)  Pension and other post‑retirement benefits In respect of the Group’s defined benefit schemes, the Group’s net obligation 
in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present 
value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date 
on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. Pension and 
post‑retirement liabilities are calculated by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The expected 
increase in the present value of scheme liabilities and the long term expected return on assets based on the fair value of 
the scheme assets at the start of the period, are included in the income statement under finance income. Any difference 
between the expected return on assets and that achieved is recognised in the statement of recognised income and 
expense together with the difference from experience or assumption changes. The Group recognises all such actuarial 
gains and losses in the period in which they occur through the statement of recognised income and expense. The Group 
also operates a small number of defined contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the year are 
recognised as incurred. Due to the size of the pension scheme assets and liabilities, relatively small changes in the 
assumptions can have a significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability 
recorded in the balance sheet.
(c)  Intangible assets
  (i) Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the 
purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since the transition date, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of net identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed 
cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP. Goodwill is allocated to cash‑generating units and 
tested annually for impairment. Changes to the assumptions used in impairment testing could have a material impact 
on the financial position of the Group and of the result for the year.
  (ii) Research and development Expenditure on research is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Expenditure on development where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of 
materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated amortisation. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
  (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost or when arising in a business combination, 
estimated fair value, less accumulated amortisation. 43

  (iv) Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. On this basis there is no amortisation of intangible assets relating to 
brand. Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised 
from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 Patents and trademarks 10 – 20 years
 Other intangible assets   1 – 5 years
(d)   Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Due to the 
requirement to measure the effectiveness of hedging instruments, changes in market conditions can result in the 
recognition of unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments in the income statement.
  Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. The fair value of forward exchange 
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. 
  Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows 
of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on 
the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
  Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value of 
a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in 
fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost) and any 
gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement (even if those gains would 
normally be recognised directly in reserves).
(e)  Exceptional items The Group presents certain items separately as ‘exceptional’. These are items, which in management’s 
judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size and incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding 
of the financial information. The determination of which items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires 
a significant degree of judgement.
(f)  Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided 
for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor 
taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
  The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation 
of current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of 
different accounting and tax treatments. The Group operates in a number of countries in the world and is subject to 
many tax jurisdictions and rules. As a consequence the Group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often 
complex and can require several years to conclude. Management’s judgement is required to determine the total provision 
for income tax. Amounts are accrued based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law and likelihood 
of settlement. However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the position and in such events an adjustment would 
be required in the subsequent period which could have a material impact. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable 
that the tax positions are sustainable. Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to 
assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement 
through negotiation. This evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income. 44

Critical accounting policies continued
(g)  Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Freehold land is not depreciated. Leasehold property is depreciated over the period of the lease. 
Freehold buildings, plant and machinery, vehicles, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives on a straight line basis. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are assessed at the reporting 
date. No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until the asset is brought into use. 
 Estimates of useful lives of these assets are:
 Buildings    10 – 50 years
 Plant and machinery    2 – 20 years
 Vehicles     2 – 10 years
 Fixtures, fittings and equipment  3 – 20 years
  The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within it will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured 
reliably. The costs of the day‑to‑day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement 
as incurred.
  Management regularly considers whether there are any indications of impairment to carrying values of property, plant 
and equipment. Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow projections. Significant judgement 
is applied to the assumptions underlying these projections which include estimated discount rates, growth rates, future 
selling prices and direct costs. Changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the financial position of 
the Group and on the result for the year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries for the period. A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its 
activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during a period are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, the Company has not restated business combinations that took place 
prior to the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004. As a consequence the Scheme of Arrangement entered into in 1998 
whereby the Company acquired Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override to account for the transaction 
as a merger has not been restated under IFRS.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates 
and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated 
in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the post‑acquisition total recognised 
gains and losses and the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis. Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds 
its investment in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued 
except to the extent that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation. 
Foreign currency 
(a)  Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised in the income statement. Non‑monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(b)  Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues 
and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange ruling for the relevant period. As allowed 
by IAS 21, exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations 
and of related hedges are taken to the translation reserve. They are recognised in the income statement upon disposal 
of the foreign operation. The Group hedges a portion of the translation exposure of its overseas net assets through 
US Dollar and Euro borrowings. From 1 January 2005, the Group has elected to apply net investment hedge accounting for 
these transactions where possible. Where hedging is applied, the effective portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used 
to hedge a net investment is recognised in equity. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.  45

leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset 
are treated as finance leases. An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and depreciated over the 
shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Future instalments net of finance charges are included within borrowings. 
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge, which is allocated to each period to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and reduction of the outstanding 
liability. Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Cost, which is based on a weighted average, includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured 
inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to manufacture, based on 
normal operating capacity.
t rade receivables Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are stated at their nominal amount which is the original 
invoiced amount less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the 
ageing of receivables and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deem them 
no longer to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal to the fair value at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction 
costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the borrowings using the effective 
interest rate method.
t rade payables Trade payables are non interest bearing borrowings and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
carried at amortised cost.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction 
from equity. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly 
attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are 
presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Impairment The carrying amount of non‑current assets other than deferred tax is compared to the asset’s recoverable 
amount at each balance sheet date where there is an indication of impairment. For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite 
useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance 
sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash‑generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash‑generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash‑generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a 
pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
revenue Revenue is based on the fair value of consideration received from the sale of goods and services. It excludes sales 
between Group undertakings, VAT and similar sales based taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the 
income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
Investment income and finance costs Investment income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the 
fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using 
the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, 
dividends on preference shares classified as liabilities, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial 
assets at fair value taken to the income statement. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the 
effective interest method. 46

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2008
1 Accounting policies continued
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a 
binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised 
as an employee expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only 
due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
own shares held by employee Share ownership t rust (eSot) Transactions of the Group‑sponsored ESOT are included in the 
consolidated financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from government and other bodies are shown as creditors in the 
balance sheet. Such grants are released to the profit and loss account over the same period for which the relevant assets 
are depreciated.
non‑current assets held for sale and discontinued operations A non‑current asset or a group of assets containing 
a non‑current asset (a disposal group), is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within one year. 
On initial classification as held for sale, non‑current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains 
and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed 
of or has been abandoned, or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
t ermination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, 
without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement 
date. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary 
redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are 
not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial 
statements, but that become mandatory for the Group’s 2009 financial statements are as follows:
IFRS 8 Operating segments This requires segment disclosure based on the components of an entity that management 
monitors in making operating decisions, rather than disclosure of business and geographical segments. It is not anticipated 
that the introduction of this standard will materially impact the Group’s current disclosure since the segments used for 
operational review are the same as those currently disclosed for the business segments.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction This sets out the 
extent to which a pension scheme surplus can be recognised as an asset of the Company and also considers how a pension 
balance sheet asset or liability could be affected by statutory or contractual minimum funding requirements. Management 
does not believe that the adoption of this standard will impact the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – A revised presentation  
Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs  
The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of these interpretations on the 2009 financial statements. 47

Following the implementation of adopted IFRS, the Group has decided to continue its separate presentation of certain items 
as exceptional. These are items which, in management’s judgement, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size 
or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
The £20.5 million impairment charge relates to a re‑assessment of the value in use of property, plant and equipment in the 
UK Chromium business following a review of its prospects. In calculating the value in use, a pre‑tax discount rate of 9.2 per cent 
was used. In previous years the UK Chromium business had been considered to be part of the same cash generating unit 
as the US Chromium business. However, changing economic conditions have resulted in the UK business becoming far 
more exposed to foreign competition in its markets than is the case for the US business, where the logistical benefits of 
being a domestic producer are more significant. The UK business is a relatively high cost producer compared to others 
in its key markets and together with the continued evolution of Chinese exports indicates that the business will become 
unprofitable for the foreseeable future, thus prompting the need for an impairment review of the assets used in production. 50

The tax charge on profit before exceptional items from continuing operations represents an effective tax rate on profit before 
exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 16.9 per cent (2007: 5.3 per cent). The rate is lower than the standard 
UK corporation tax due to the amortisation of goodwill in the US for tax purposes and the utilisation of UK tax losses. As a 
Group involved in overseas operations, the amount of profitability in each jurisdiction, transfer pricing legislation and local 
tax rate changes, will affect future tax charges.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products 
and Elementis Surfactants.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs 
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre‑tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The discount rate used in 2008 was 9.2 per cent (2007: 7.7 per cent). 
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past 
practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for 
the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seventeen years based on an estimated growth rate 
of 2.5 per cent. The rate does not exceed the average long‑term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly of value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the 
Deuchem acquisition. The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of 10 years.  54

At 31 December 2008 the full amount of ACT previously written‑off, available for offset against future UK profits, was £25.8 million 
(2007: £25.8 million). 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Where this is not the case, 
deferred tax assets have not been recognised. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. 
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. 
There are no significant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.

Notes to the financial statements

22 Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
 credit risk:
 liquidity risk: and
 market risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and 
systems are reviewed reguarly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies 
and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and 
ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer . The demographics 
of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less 
of an influence on credit risk. No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue and geographically 
there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms 
and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references. 
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval 
from the Board. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a 
prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant 
exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been 
incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics 
for similar assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have 
a credit rating of at least A1 from Standard & Poor’s and A from Moody’s. Given these high credit ratings, management 
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when 
due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation. The Group’s funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum 
forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period. At the year end the Group had £70.4 million (2007: £125.4 million) 
of undrawn committed facilities, which expire after more than one year but within 3 years.
market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and 
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order 
to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other 
than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the Euro and the US Dollar . The Group hedges approximately 
70 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency. The Group uses 
forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. 59
Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2008
FInAnCIAl St AtementS FInAnCIAl St AtementS
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations 
of the Group, primarily US Dollar, but also Euro and GBP. This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered 
into. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net 
exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address 
short‑term imbalances. The Group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US Dollar denominated drawdowns 
under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of subsidiary’s net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required 
interest profile. The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Group’s borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
other market price risk 
Equity price risk arises from available‑for‑sale equity securities held within the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations. 
Management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations. 
The primary goal of the Group’s investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet partially the 
Group’s unfunded benefit obligations; management is assisted by external advisors in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sale requirements; 
such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as 
the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests, and the level of 
dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Group’s savings related share option schemes. 
At present, employees hold 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares, or 3.0 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or 
are exercised. 
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings 
and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s target is to achieve a return on shareholders’ 
equity of between 10 and 15 per cent; in 2008 the return was 11.2 per cent (2007: 26.6 per cent). In comparison the weighted 
average interest expense on interest‑bearing borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputed interest) was 3.5 per cent 
(2007: 6.2 per cent).

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial 
instruments reflected in the table above.
Derivatives
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not 
available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current 
forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk‑free interest (based on government bonds).
Non‑derivatives financial liabilities 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate 
of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market 
rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the 
reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows:
           2008 2007 
           per cent per cent
Derivatives          3.7 4.4
Borrowings          2.0–7.2 5.8 64

Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year   2.1 1.7
At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non‑cancellable operating leases, which fall due 
as follows:
           2008 2007 
           £million £million

           4.4 4.2
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery. 
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
24 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has a number of contributory and non‑contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits 
for the majority of employees and executive directors. The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the 
defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employee’s final remuneration 
or the employee’s average remuneration during a period of years before retirement. The assets of these schemes are held 
in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet. In addition the Group 
operates an unfunded post‑retirement medical benefit (‘PRMB’) scheme in the US. The entitlement to these benefits is 
usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period. 
There was a charge in respect of post‑retirement health care and pensions in the year of £2.1 million (2007: £2.1 million 
credit), of which £0.8 million (2007: £0.8 million credit) related to overseas schemes.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2005 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2008 for the 
US and Netherlands schemes. The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2008 for inclusion within 
this Annual Report. The trustees of the UK scheme are required to act in the best interest of the funds’ beneficiaries. 
The appointment of trustees to the UK scheme is determined by the trust scheme’s documentation. The Group has a 
policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the UK scheme members. Investigations have been carried 
out during the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s major schemes. The investigations concluded 
that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for improvements in mortality rates. The assumed 
life expectancies on retirement are:

Inflation         3.00 3.50 1.50
The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 6.25 per cent (2007: 6.25 per cent) per annum and 
a health care cost trend of 10.0 per cent (2007: 10.0 per cent) and 11.0 per cent (2007: 11.0 per cent) per annum for claims 
pre age 65 and post age 65 respectively reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2014 (2007: 4.5 per cent). Actuarial valuations 
of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have not been updated for IAS19 purposes because of the costs involved 
and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.

25 Share based payments
The Company has several share option schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
The 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which senior management below Board level are 
granted options to purchase shares in the Company. The option price is the average market price over the five working days 
preceding the grant and there is no discount. Options are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years of the 
date of the grant; those granted since 1995 are subject to earnings per share performance targets.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which executive directors and senior managers 
below Board level are granted options to purchase shares in the Company. The option price is the market price of a share on 
the dealing day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied. Options are capable 
of exercise after three years, subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets being met, and 
within ten years of the date of the grant.
The 1998 and 2008 UK Savings‑Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which UK employees can enter into 
savings contracts with a building society or a bank for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings 
accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The option price is the average market price 
over the five working days preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent. The 1998 scheme expired 
last year, although options are still outstanding under that scheme, and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
The 2000 and 2008 US Savings‑Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which US employees can enter into 
savings contracts with a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase 
shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The option price is the market price on the date of the grant, 
discounted by 15 per cent. The 2000 scheme expired last year, although options are still outstanding under that scheme, 
and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model. The fair value per option granted during the year and the 
assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:
           2008 2007
Fair value per option (pence)         23.9 29.0
Weighted average share price at grant (pence)       59.1 58.0
Weighted average exercise price (pence)       57.5 56.6
Expected volatility (per cent)         35.0 38.0
Risk free rate (per cent)         4.5 5.4
Expected dividend yield (per cent)        3.6 2.7
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 
five years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The Group recognised total expenses of 
£0.8 million (2007: £0.9 million) related to equity‑settled share based payment transactions during the year.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the executive and savings related share option schemes.
The Company also adopted a long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) in 2008 and awards were made to four senior executives. 
Details of these awards are set out on page 32 of the Directors’ remuneration report. The LTIP awards were valued using 
the binomial method and an IFRS 2 expense of £0.3 million was recognised last year, which is included in the total expenses 
recognised in 2008 disclosed above. 70

30 Acquisitions
On 1 July 2008 the Group acquired all the shares of Deuchem Co., Ltd, a Taiwan based company, for a cash consideration of 
£38.5 million. Deuchem is a leading supplier of additives and resins to the coating and related industries, with manufacturing and 
technical facilities in Taiwan and China.
On 8 July 2008 the Group set up a new business with Anji County Yu Hong Clay Chemicals Co., Ltd for the production of 
organoclays in China. The Group holds 80 per cent of the shares in this new business entity, which is treated as a subsidiary. 
Cash consideration paid was £2.6 million.
The acquisitions had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

Cash acquired           (10.1)
Net cash outflow            32.1
The consideration for the acquisitions, which included professional fees and incidental expenses of £1.1 million, has been 
allocated against identified net assets with the remaining balance recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognised on acquisition 
reflects both the capabilities of the acquired entities’ personnel and the synergistic opportunities going forward, neither of 
which can be allocated to an identifiable intangible asset.
Acquisitions made during 2008 contributed £20.2 million to the Group’s revenue, £0.5 million to the operating profit before 
intangible amortisation and £0.1 million to the operating profit after amortisation.
The estimated contribution of Deuchem to the results of the Group had the acquisition been made on 1 January 2008, and 
assuming that the fair value adjustments that arose on acquisition would have been the same at the earlier date, is as follows:
            2008 
            £million
Revenue           45.4
Operating profit before intangible amortisation        (0.2)

32 Contingent liabilities
In May 2008, the Group received a request for information in connection with an EU Commission competition law investigation 
relating to certain heat stabiliser products. As far as the directors are aware, the Company and its affiliates no longer 
manufacture products for use as heat stabiliser products that are the subject of the Commission’s investigation and have 
not done so since 1998, when the Company disposed of its 50 per cent joint venture interest in Akcros Chemicals to Akzo 
Nobel, the other 50 per cent shareholder in the joint venture. Elementis is co‑operating fully with the Commission’s 
investigation.
It is possible that the Company may incur liabilities and related costs as a result of the investigation, the extent of which, 
if any, cannot be quantified now. Under the EU Commission’s fining guidelines, a fine could amount up to 30 per cent of 
the turnover generated with the products concerned multiplied by the number of years during which a cartel was deemed 
to exist with an absolute upper limit of 10 per cent of group‑wide turnover. 75

33 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material 
in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under 
the historical cost accounting rules. Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to present its profit and loss account. As the Company’s voting rights are controlled within the Group headed 
by Elementis plc, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed 
transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group (or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties).
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments 
Investments in Group undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost, or if lower, directors’ valuation.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these 
criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
pensions and other post‑retirement benefits
The Company participates in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities 
in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and as required by FRS 17, it has treated the scheme as if it were a 
defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions 
payable for the year.
t axation
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except as 
otherwise required by FRS 19. Advance corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried 
forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors as appropriate.
Share based payments
The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold 
for vesting. 
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that 
they meet the following two conditions:
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company; and
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non‑derivative that 
includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will 
be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that the definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument 
so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for 
called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges. 
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds, are dealt 
with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds. 77

38 Retirement benefit obligations
The Company is a member of a multi‑employer pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. Because 
the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as 
permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’, the scheme has been accounted for as if the scheme was a defined contribution 
scheme. The net deficit in the scheme at 31 December 2008 was £12.7 million (2007: £12.8 million).
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 September 2005 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 December 2008 
by a qualified actuary. The contribution for the year was £0.1 million (2007: £0.2 million). 78

We choose to operate in select markets away from 
commoditised areas of the electronics market where we 
can add value through our innovation and the bespoke 
nature of the products and systems we provide.
For Performance Material’s customers, the electronics 
environment is becoming more challenging due to more 
integrated circuits in smaller and thinner devices requiring 
increasingly innovative solutions to protect and package 
devices. Laird is able to respond to customers’ needs to  
help secure device functionality, applying both EMI 
shielding and thermal solutions to protect devices from  
RF interference and heat.
Aligned to our strategy to capture new vertical markets 
in Wireless Systems, we are developing multi-function 
solutions with more value-add. Customers are willing to 
pay a premium for a comprehensive solution involving 
hardware and software diagnostics supported by repair 
and maintenance after sales service.

amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible 
assets, goodwill and US capitalised development costs, the gain or loss on disposal 
of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments and 
acquisition transaction costs. The narrative is based on underlying operating profit, 
profit before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide a 
more consistent measure of operating performance
(ii) The weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share was 
266.0m in 2013 and 265.6m in 2012

Our products
Our products
Part of our strategy is to ensure our strategic differentiation 
(of innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed) is valued by our 
customers. Through the businesses collaborating together we 
can offer a more comprehensive range of solutions to customers 
and ensure we maintain our competitive position.
Customers recognise our precision engineering  
capability across the whole of our business
Our divisions share economies 
of scale in our R&D and supply chain
Emi
Electronic devices give off 
electromagnetic emissions as a 
by-product of electrical or magnetic 
activity that can interfere with 
the operation of other devices. 
EMI shielding products isolate 
sensitive apparatus from these 
electromagnetic fields. 
Thermal management
Electronic applications generate 
heat that can adversely affect a 
device’s performance. Our thermal 
management materials and active 
cooling solutions provide a way to 
manage and actively control heat in 
a variety of electronic applications.
Signal i ntegrity
Our ferrite-based product family 
preserves high quality signal integrity 
by removing and filtering unwanted 
or harmful electromagnetic 
‘noise’ generated by active 
components such as oscillators 
and microprocessors, as well as 
EMI escaping from any electronic 
product through DC (direct current) 
power lines.
Telematics/m2m
We design and manufacture 
industry-leading smart antennae 
solutions, combining advanced, 
low-profile antennae with wireless 
radios, Input/Output (IO) circuitry 
and firmware to enable applications 
from asset tracking to pay-as-you-
drive insurance and from fleet 
management to theft recovery.
Wireless Automation and Control
The high-reliability wireless remote 
control systems that we design and 
supply, serve the railroad, mining, 
and industrial markets globally. 
These remote control systems 
are specifically designed for any 
equipment where the operator can 
remotely operate heavy machinery 
from a safer location. We also 
provide fully hosted networked 
applications software that enables 
customers to monitor their remote 
controlled assets in real-time.
i nfrastructure Antennae
We provide high performance 
indoor and outdoor antennae 
solutions. In-building wireless 
antennae are particularly applicable 
in environments where aesthetics 
and wide angle coverage are 
necessary for successful wireless 
deployment. Their small size 
allows them to be hidden almost 
anywhere, providing an invisible 
solution for most applications.

The business model provides a framework in which we:
 – Focus on capturing and creating value by delivering 
innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed, doing so in an 
environmentally respectful way, benefiting the communities 
in which we operate and creating an environment in which 
our employees can demonstrate their individual technical 
expertise whilst collaborating for greater success
 – Invest in innovative new processes and technologies and bring 
new products to market to realise sustainable growth over the 
longer-term (as shown in the X axis of the Business Model)
 – Drive growth by executing on market entry strategies in new 
geographies, adjacent market segments and new market 
segments (as shown in the Y axis of the Business Model), 
facilitated by collaboration across our business units (as seen 
operating in the centre of our Business Model)
 – Explore inorganic as well as organic solutions to determine  
the most effective and timely solutions to execute our 
strategy (as shown in the top right of the Business Model)
Business units are the entrepreneurial engines of growth, 
staying close to customers in developing, selling and making 
our products. The role of the Company as a whole is to afford 
these fast moving and adaptable businesses the systems and 
benefits of a large organisation. Company functions like finance, 
information technology, human resources and risk management 
provide expertise, shared services, policy and oversight to the 
business units.

Our commitment to 
innovation is reflected  
in our investment in R&D.
A consistent level of high 
quality engineering and 
manufacturing processes 
ensures we deliver quality 
product on time, staying 
ahead of our competition.
Fast response through the 
design cycle and speed 
of delivery matters to our 
customers.
Innovation Speed Reliable Fulfilment
Our value to customers (mindshare)
Customers know they can rely on 
our design teams to develop smart 
technology from product conception 
through to manufacture. Our engineers 
work closely with customers as design 
partners, to deliver them bespoke solutions.
Customers value the design freedom 
Laird’s products and service can provide. 
We have Business Design Centres, close 
to our customers.
We have extensive manufacturing 
facilities around the globe and are 
located close to our customers for  
just-in-time supply.
We have precision tooling and state  
of the art automation incorporated 
into our production processes.
By having on-site testing and required 
industry accreditation, we provide 
assurances for customers across a 
number of different markets – it 
provides peace of mind to allow them 
to focus on their own business.
We have the ability to turn around 
prototypes within 24 hours and have 
quick response times for design 
iterations. This competitive advantage 
is highly valued by our customers.
Automation and a large skilled local 
workforce allows us to fulfil customers’ 
needs reliably and to meet their 
timescales.
Speed is of the essence throughout  
the whole product cycle from design  
to production, through to delivery.

How we do business continued
See organisational structure changes 
on page 16 
Laird exhibited at the T elematics 
Detroit 2013 exhibition and 
demonstrated the breadth of solutions 
that could be provided to customers.
The effective application of our business model will drive revenue 
growth, allowing us to take share in a market which is itself growing. 
Tangible progress has been made in 2013:
 – Adherence to new product roadmaps in 2013 was much improved, reducing 
the product development cycle and will be a contributor to revenue growth  
in 2014. 
 – Working collaboratively across our business units in Performance Materials, 
selling more products and solutions to existing customers, has brought 
results. One notable success in the Performance Materials division has been 
in the gaming market segment. In Wireless Systems, collaboration across 
business units has not only been in our routes to market, but also in new 
product development. Examples include combining radio modules (from 
our Telematics/M2M business unit) and antennae (from our Infrastructure 
Antennae Systems business) to develop the innovative Dolphin product range – 
ideal for applications in high density environments such as sporting stadia.
 – Collaboration across the two divisions is leading to the expansion of our 
Telematics/M2M’s global footprint by partnering with the Performance 
Materials division in planning to utilise its manufacturing plants in Europe 
and Mexico.
 – Geographic expansion is underway in Vietnam and Korea to service 
Performance Material’s customers and reflects our strategic development  
of new markets and geographies.
 – Our customer engagement strategy has been redefined and is driving 
collaboration as well as changes in our channels to market and market 
entry strategies.
How are we structured?
Within our Performance Materials division, customers’ product launches are 
becoming larger and more frequent. This requires constant innovation, the ability 
to ramp up quickly whilst meeting exacting quality standards (reliable fulfilment) 
and the need to respond with speed throughout the design and fulfilment 
process, all of which are valued by customers. 
Our Wireless Systems division products and solutions tend to have longer design 
cycles. Key markets include automotive, industrial and medical, in which early 
design engagement and innovation is critical. To service these markets reliable 
fulfilment is essential; they are renowned for demanding high quality, defect-free 
products delivered on time.
Each divisional strategy is aligned to the overall Group strategic objectives.  
Both divisions have clearly defined target markets that they work to penetrate. 
All business units across both divisions benefit from economies of scale, 
standardisation of processes and process improvements brought by Laird’s 
company-wide IT, HR and Finance Shared Service Centres. 
Corporate Centres of Excellence support business units, including risk and quality 
assurance, trade compliance and training, all fundamental to delivering superior 
reliable fulfilment which differentiates Laird from its competitors.
Leadership teams for Technology, Operations, Sales and Supply Chain were 
established at the beginning of 2013 and were operational throughout the 
year. The Leadership teams bring together key senior managers from across 
the business units in both divisions to drive collaboration and innovation and 
implement best practice across the Group.

Where we sit in our customers’ value chain
Our customers engage with us for design and innovation and rely on us for 
reliable fulfilment and speed of response throughout the design to delivery cycle. 
Our design engineers engage with customers at every stage of the design 
process, creating value by providing technology and innovation, and are able to 
respond with speed to the many design iterations throughout the design cycle. 
The Performance Materials division aims to own the electronics environment 
creating design freedom for its customers. The products we supply are a small 
proportion of a customer’s bill of materials, but integral to the design and reliable 
function of the customer’s end product. 
The Wireless Systems division provides connectivity and enables smart systems. 
As the ‘Internet of Things’ and M2M (machine-to-machine) communication 
becomes ever more prevalent in people’s lives, customers demand 
communication systems that will not be disrupted. There is a broad product 
range from single antenna to multi-band, integrated antenna solutions or 
software aided diagnostics and after-sales service and support. Our customers 
value the reassurance Laird brings, that their products will be connected reliably, 
and operate effectively in harsh operating environments that have competing 
signals and challenging radio frequency transmissions. 
How we create and capture value through our differentiation 
The differentiation our customers are willing to pay for – innovation, reliable 
fulfilment and speed – means our customers know what they can expect from 
Laird as a technical design partner. It sets us apart from the competition, 
improves our ability to capture customer mindshare and helps protect the Laird 
brand. 
What are the key relationships that allow our Business model 
to be successful? 
The success of our business is dependent on winning and retaining customer 
mindshare and being a trusted design partner. We engage with our customers’ 
development engineers and also with their supply chain. 
Many customers share with us their early product designs and highly confidential 
detail about their next generation models. They need a trusted partner to provide 
innovative solutions with the ability to turn around design iterations at speed. 
Customers may outsource production to contract manufacturers. Although we 
may be a specified supplier we must ensure we stay close to their designated 
assembler and deliver on reliable fulfilment and retain our allotted share of 
business.
Reliable fulfilment means we don’t let our customers down. From the initial 
design phase through to manufacture and delivery, they trust us to deliver  
reliably on time. We ensure we have the capacity in place to ramp production  
and support product launches and are able to meet the seasonal peaks.
Our development engineers use their expertise to design bespoke products 
for our customers. Through improved adherence to technology and product 
roadmaps in 2013, our engineers have ensured that resources are focused on 
developing what the customer needs and delivering when they need it.
Our sales teams and field engineers understand what customers want and  
can offer them the solution that is most efficient to their own businesses. 
Our operational managers have the responsibility of ensuring our plants  
deliver the right levels of high quality when needed.

See ‘Our People’ in the CSR report 
on pages 35 to 38 for more 
information on career development 
and performance rewards
See the KPIs that measure our progress 
on pages 19 and 20
How we do business continued
Our focus in 2013 has been on greater collaboration across the whole 
organisation and this is delivering results with collaborative design innovation 
and the exchange of ideas and technical forums between engineers taking 
place much more frequently. This enhanced teamwork marks a cultural change 
throughout Laird.
Relationships with our own suppliers are also paramount. In September we 
hosted our first ever Global Supplier Conference, held in Shanghai, giving them 
the opportunity to learn about our strategic objectives and how they can support 
us in achieving reliable fulfilment. We require them to maintain the highest 
quality standards and rely on them as trusted partners in our own supply chain.
We maintain conservative levels of gearing and our customers value our strong 
financial position. 
What risk relates to our business? 
As a global manufacturing business, there are risks that could impact our business 
as shown in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties table on pages 52 to 53. 
Retaining the knowledge and experience of our employees is key to keeping 
ahead of the competition. Our people are passionate about what they do. 
Managing clear career development and keeping remuneration programmes 
competitive are essential (see CSR and remuneration report).
Through appropriate planning and risk management, we avoid business 
continuity issues arising that have the potential to disrupt our production. 
A significant proportion of our operational footprint is in China which is subject 
to relatively high wage and salary inflation. We mitigate this pressure on the cost 
base through continuous improvement in operational efficiency and automation 
processes. 
We depend on a variety of raw materials in our own supply chain and have 
appropriate risk mitigation strategies in place to deal with sourcing. Any delay or 
failure to receive the materials we require could impact our reliability as a supplier. 
Sustaining strong relationships with key suppliers and multi sourcing helps 
manage the risk in our supply chain.
A relatively small proportion of revenue is in Chinese Renminbi compared to a 
relatively large proportion of the cost base, which could continue to appreciate 
and have an adverse impact on margins. We mitigate the short term impact by 
taking out forward foreign exchange contracts and take into account the medium 
and longer term impacts in the pricing of new products.
How do the strategy and kPi s relate to our Business model? 
Our strategy of identifying the right growth markets in which to diversify our 
customer base, and grow our business by market segment and geography,  
can be measured by KPIs for new contract and customer wins and ultimately  
revenue growth. 
The business model provides a framework in which to map out strategic routes 
but also measures our progress against the overall strategy and allows for 
feedback on our operational performance. Non-financial KPIs allow performance 
to be monitored as to whether the whole business is being run effectively and 
in accordance with the strategy while respecting the local communities in which 
we operate.
Our financial strength of our business allows us to carry out our day-to-day 
operations, invest for the future and monitor the overall returns that our strategy 
is delivering across our business. This can be seen in our financial KPIs such as 
R&D expenditure, profit generation and return on capital employed.

Results
There was little change in underlying profits year on year, but 
after a softer first half we delivered a much stronger second half 
of the year and exited 2013 with good momentum. 
Board changes
We have made further changes to refresh the Laird Board in 
2013.
Jack Boyer joined the Board in May. After serving nine years as a 
non-executive director, Tony Reading retired in August. Tony was 
succeeded by Jack as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 
Following Tony’s departure, Paula Bell was appointed Senior 
Independent Director. I would like to thank Tony for his service.
In November we also announced that I would be stepping down 
as Chairman at the Annual General Meeting in May this year 
and will be succeeded by Dr Martin Read. Martin will join the 
Laird Board on 28 February and I am very much looking forward 
to working with him for the remaining few months to ensure  
a smooth handover.
I have served as Chairman for over ten years –a period of 
considerable change at Laird. More recently I have overseen 
the transition of the Laird Board, including the appointment of 
David Lockwood as Chief Executive in 2012. I have no doubt 
under David’s leadership that I am leaving the Company in 
good hands and it is an exciting time for all of our stakeholders. 
I would like to give personal thanks to everyone I have worked 
with over the years as Chairman and as a non-executive director 
prior to that.
Dividends
The Board has declared a 2013 final year dividend of 7.9p 
per share (2012, 6.6p), resulting in a total full year dividend of 
12.0p (2012, 10.0p), in line with the Board’s recommendation 
made in 2011.
The Board’s future dividend policy is to increase returns to 
shareholders over time, while taking account of both the 
underlying profitability and cash requirements of the business.
Outlook 
Trading in 2014 has started as expected. As in 2013, we expect 
revenue to be second half weighted. Executing well on our 
strategy underpins our confidence for growth in the year.

Strategic progress 
In 2013 we have made much strategic progress throughout the 
whole organisation. Under the leadership of David Lockwood, 
Laird teams have been focusing on the technology development 
and innovation they can provide to our customers, delivered 
through best in class manufacturing and through consistent 
levels of speed in delivery. This progress is reflective of the way 
the whole company has acknowledged, and been motivated 
by, our strategy to create and capture value to our customers 
through our strategic differentiation in target identified growth 
markets, together with technology development through 
increased investment in R&D. 
Our governance programme ensures operational activity is 
reviewed and measured to help chart our progress as a business, 
whilst staying focused on our strategic objectives. See the 
Corporate Governance section on page 56 for more information.
Employees
Our employees are Laird’s best assets. As I have travelled round 
the business this year I have consistently seen how committed 
they are to developing innovation opportunities for new 
products. They have also been encouraged by working together 
more collaboratively under the ‘One Laird’ brand to deliver 
solutions to our customers, whilst continuing to provide the high 
levels of service for which Laird is known. 
There have been a number of strategic changes to Laird’s 
culture this year, such as increased collaboration between 
business units. To manage these changes, whilst staying 
committed to our customers, is testament to our employees’ 
dedication and is what will help us bring further good results  
and I would like to thank everyone for their efforts throughout 
the year.

Chief Executive’ s review
“ 2013 ended with a strong second half. 
2014 has commenced with year on year 
growth consistent with our constant currency 
expectations for the full year. 
The good progress we have made has been 
grounded in the investments executing 
our strategy and delivering strategic 
differentiation. This has deepened our 
relationships with existing customers and 
allowed us to win new customers and 
develop new markets. It is this strategic 
progress that underpins our confidence for 
2014 and beyond. 
2014 will see more benefits from innovation, 
particularly in Wireless Systems, delivered 
in the second half. This includes the 
commencement of already secured 
contracts for next generation M2M products. 
Our investment in manufacturing capacity 
in new territories, such as Vietnam, supports 
Performance Materials growth in the second 
half. As a result, as in 2013, we expect 2014 
to be second half weighted.”

Achievements against our strategic objectives  
in 2013
 – We have defined our strategic differentiation: innovation, 
reliable fulfilment and speed, with the business now focused 
on these capabilities in day-to-day operations (see case 
studies on pages 21 to 27)
 – We are diversifying our customer base, within and between 
market segments
 – We sell into global market segments with attractive growth 
prospects (see pages 28 and 29 for an independent view on 
market trends)
 – We have increased investment to drive sustained innovation 
(see Financial review on page 46)
 – We are expanding our geographic reach (see map on pages  
6 and 7)
 – Strategic decisions are systematically and consistently aligned 
to our Business Model for organic and inorganic growth 
through product and market expansion (see Business Model 
on page 8)
Differentiation
At the end of 2012 we set out in our Business Review 
presentation how we create and capture value through our 
strategic differentiation of innovation, reliable fulfilment and 
speed. A key initiative in 2013 has been to communicate this 
mission to our stakeholders. Our employees are focused on 
delivering our differentiation and understand it will drive market 
share and profitable growth. Our customers in turn, recognise 
our differentiation and that is how and why we are winning new 
business. 
Diversification of customer base 
Sector and customer diversification will even out the seasonal 
fluctuations in revenue which tend to be driven by the demands 
of the consumer market and will, over the longer-term, drive 
higher capacity utilisation and greater efficiency. 
We have focused on penetrating new market segments and 
geographies as well as selling more products (collaborative 
selling across our businesses) to existing customers, with 
tangible evidence of the successful execution of this strategy 
noted in our Operating review on pages 41 to 45.
Geographic reach
We said we would focus on China, Korea and Northern Europe. 
We have made clear progress in China with industrial and 
automotive customers and won new long-term automotive 
contracts with leading German automotive OEMs.
In December 2012 we said that our market entry strategy 
to significantly penetrate the Korean market would take at 
least a year to deliver, as we needed to assess and review 
our options and invest resources in stepping up our strategic 
account engagement. In January 2014, it was announced that 
a new plant in Vietnam would be established, which will work 
in conjunction with a Business Design Centre in Korea. This 
initiative is expected to contribute to revenue growth in 2014 
and the expansion of our geographic footprint will create further 
opportunities with new and existing customers (see our 2014 
strategic objectives on page 17).
Sustained innovation
Our increased level of R&D investment has brought new contract 
wins as customers continue to reward us for the innovation we 
provide. Notable examples include contracts with automotive 
and telecom customers for whom we have provided innovative 
solutions for technically challenging products, as well as 
continuing to be a design partner with smartphone customers 
on next generation models. 
The positive impact from increased R&D in our Performance 
Materials division, which has relatively short product lifecycles, 
helped drive differentiation in 2013 and is expected to 
contribute to new business wins in 2014. For the Wireless 
Systems division, product cycle and qualification periods are 
longer. For both divisions, the adherence to product roadmaps 
is much improved, bringing new products to markets at a 
faster pace. 
Business Model alignment
The Business Model has been clearly defined and provides the 
framework for our business leaders to execute our strategy. 
Further explanation of how the Business Model is aligned to  
our strategy is set out on page 12. 
Enhanced governance framework
Another strategic focus in 2013 has been to enhance our 
governance and risk mitigation framework. Governance as well 
as culture, leadership, strategy and operating model, comprise 
the five foundational pillars that align the leadership within our 
business. This is illustrated on page 16.

Our culture
The organisation has become more collaborative and operates 
under the ‘One Laird’ approach.
Culture Statement
‘ We work as a global team of talented individuals to  
make a difference to our employees, business partners,  
and our world.
We have an unwavering commitment to being honest and 
ethical in all situations and treating each other with dignity 
and respect.
We create an open and engaging environment that 
thrives on high energy, adaptability and delivering on our 
commitments.
Laird is a great place with great opportunities for personal 
and professional growth for those who work hard, are willing 
to learn and deliver results.’
In order to facilitate the Company’s new direction and to 
empower leaders within our organisation, a Leadership team 
was formed which is comprised of the most senior managers 
across Laird. The team meets three times per year, provides a 
key forum for networking and collaboration and is a driving force 
in implementing the strategy and embracing the new culture. 
The Leadership team also forms part of the Management team 
which meets annually and comprises the top 200 managers. 
This team reaches deeper into the organisation to embed the 
culture, to cascade the strategy and provide guidance and 
leadership to the whole organisation. 
Events in 2013 included:
 – A Management Conference held in January in California,  
our first ever Global Supplier Conference held in September  
in Shanghai and conferences for the Leadership team held  
in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Chief Executive’s review continued
See further information as to the composition of our Board on 
pages 54 and 55 and within our Diversity section of the CSR 
report on page 37.
In the second half of 2013, we appointed a Chief Strategy & 
Technology Officer. His appointment provides further strategic 
direction at business unit level. He has already made an impact 
by reviewing strategic route maps and ensuring that the 
decisions taken define our value to customers and are aligned  
to overall Company strategy.

Continued focus in 2014
Strategic outlook summary
in early 2014 we announced our expansion  
in new territories within Asia. 
Penetrating the Korean market was one of our 
strategic priorities for 2013, allowing us to diversify 
our customer base and serve Korean customers 
with local operations. Such proximity underpins 
our ability to manufacture reliably and our speed 
of delivery. A new manufacturing facility has been 
established near Hanoi, Vietnam and further 
manufacturing support will be provided from our 
existing site in Shenzhen, China.
In order to engage with customers as design 
partners on innovation we are also expanding  
our Business Design Centre in Seoul.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Laird’s growth will come from a number of key drivers:
 – From being in attractive end markets – through clear 
market entry strategies and by progressing our customer 
diversification 
 – Having a disciplined approach to investment decisions
 – Maximising market positions through our strategic 
differentiation 
 – Working collaboratively to sell a comprehensive solution to 
existing customers, and executing well
 – Continuing to build strong relationships with our key 
customers
 – Ensuring continued adherence to product and technology 
roadmaps and being focused on innovation
 – Continued investment for sustainable growth that is customer 
informed and market led

A core part of our strategic progress in 2013 has been 
from our employees demonstrating the strategic 
differentiation we can provide to our customers,  
who in turn realise the value that can be created. 
By combining and delivering on all three parts of our 
differentiation, we stay ahead of the competition and 
capture the mindshare of our customers who value 
our capabilities.
The following case studies look at different aspects 
of our differentiation and where we have worked with 
customers, delivering the desired results for them and 
for Laird.

Innovation
Our Thermal business has developed next 
generation Polymer Chain Reaction (PCR) 
thermal cyclers for use in medical markets. 
The PCR thermal cyclers use thin-film 
embedded thermoelectric modules which 
are small in size but have fast response times. 
They are used in laboratory settings to control 
the temperature of the metal block in which 
plastic vials holding the PCR mixtures are 
inserted. The Laird thermal cycler can produce 
up to 25 degree Celsius per second in contrast 
to temperature ramp rates of only 5 degrees 
Celsius per second in standard PCR cyclers.
PCR thermal cyclers allow for DNA 
amplification in healthcare and forensic 
markets, which means millions of copies of a 
specific DNA sequence can be produced, and 
can help with the detection and diagnosis of 
infectious diseases.
The speed at which testing can now happen 
using Laird’s cooling technology allows real-
time testing of samples in the field rather than 
having to transport samples to a lab – and 
the customer knows they will be delivered 
accurately and reliably.
Innovation with such products opens up 
opportunities in a growing marketplace where 
we can really demonstrate our differentiation, 
which has resulted in orders being secured to 
commence in 2014.

Reliable fulfilment
Reliable fulfilment
We reliably deliver quality 
product on time, time after time
The automotive industry has multiple design 
and specification requirements which suppliers 
must be able to fulfil reliably. Each OEM and 
vehicle model demands different variations 
of a finished solution – whether it is product 
style or colour hues for painted antennae. Laird 
can deliver more than 40 different variations 
aligned to customer product specification. 
Laird has reliably delivered a large range of 
antennae solutions to major automotive OEMs 
for a number of years and manufactures 
globally at Laird sites. Each regional site 
manages the product variations locally and this 
is where customers value the service Laird can 
provide. They know that each variation will be 
delivered to the same quality standards.
The assurance customers get from Laird is on-
time delivery (100% in 2013) and a world class 
low rate of defective parts per million shipped; 
meaning they get what they want on time, 
time after time.
A case study highlighting how reliable fulfilment within our strategic 
differentiation ensures customers consistently receive high quality 
product solutions to the standards they require following the initial 
design engagement (innovation) phase.

Speed
Speed
One of Laird’s strategic 
differentiators is the speed in 
which we service customers, from 
design through to delivery
When Laird engaged on this Performance 
Materials microwave absorber project with a 
leading automotive customer, samples were 
delivered within 20 business days meeting 
expectations for both timing and quality.  
By using a two step injection moulding process 
in production, it also meant floor space and 
labour costs could be reduced.
This customer values Laird for its product 
knowledge in this space and for the speed  
and quality of its service offering.
The speed element of our strategic differentiation proved 
a winning formula when combined with our innovation 
and reliable fulfilment in this case study.

been related to a narrow series of 
applications, primarily smartphones, 
tablet PCs, and automotive electronics. 
The best segments will be tied 
to either high function portable 
electronics (smartphones, tablets, 
Ultrabooks, linked infrastructure 
equipment, automotive systems) 
or green energy (LEDs, PVs, energy 
efficient transportation, and smart grid).
Smartphones
The strong recent growth in smartphones has transformed 
the mobile phone sector, if not the electronics industry. 
Although smartphones have been marketed for more than 
fifteen years, the current era began with the introduction of 
the original iPhone in 2007, followed quickly by Android and 
most recently Windows Mobile devices. Smartphones now 
dominate the overall mobile phone market from both revenue 
and profit perspectives and represented 15% of the overall 
electronics industry revenue in 2013. Smartphones are also 
responsible for driving innovation throughout the electronics 
supply chain. Although smartphones are approaching 
saturation in selected markets and lower cost models will 
reduce average selling prices, smartphones will still deliver 
over 8% average annual revenue growth over the next  
four years.

Computing
Like the mobile phone market, the computing sector has been 
transformed by the emergence of high-function portable 
systems, in this case tablets and, to a lesser extent, Ultrabooks. 
Although only introduced in 2010, tablets have grown to exceed 
40% of the overall computing market in 2013 on a unit basis, 
with shipments of tablets now exceeding that of notebook PCs. 
By 2017, these new high-function portable PCs will represent 
more than 50% of the overall PC market, with the conventional 
desktop and notebook markets flat to declining. The transition 
to tablets is limiting the growth of the overall PC market (2.9% 
CAAGR) owing to their more modest ASP.
Computing and communications infrastructure 
Computing and communications infrastructure equipment has 
been one of the most notable beneficiaries of the strong growth 
in high-function connected devices. The growth in tablets and 
smartphones has created an insatiable need for servers and 
storage (i.e. the Cloud), increased bandwidth, and enhanced 
wireless connectivity (e.g. LTE build-out). The rise of an 
interconnected populace dependent on ubiquitous high-speed 
connectivity is a long-term trend that will shape the electronics 
supply chain for the foreseeable future. The only significant 
dampener on the growth of infrastructure equipment is the 
increased capacity of such equipment, which modestly blunts 
revenue growth.
Consumer electronics
The consumer electronics sector, at least using a traditional 
definition (e.g. TVs, audio equipment, digital cameras, DVD 
players and game systems) remains one of the lagging 
segments of the electronics industry. The relative weakness of 
this market has two roots: the stagnation of driving applications 
and the loss of traditional markets. The development of cost-
effective, large format HDTVs boosted the consumer segment 
during the early years of the 21st century, but this boost has 
now ended owing to continued price erosion and relative market 
saturation. Although there is hope that large format OLEDs or 
UHD will provide a needed spark, these systems are not likely 
to have an impact at least during the next five years. The other 
issue that has impacted the traditional consumer segment is 
the growth of the smartphone and tablet, which has annexed 
functionality formerly offered by standalone systems (e.g. 
digital cameras). As a result of these factors, the consumer 
segment will struggle to grow faster than global GDP (expected 
2.9% CAAGR).
Transportation
Although transportation electronics had long been a lagging 
sector of the electronics industry, this segment has been a 
relative bright spot during recent years. This recent strength 
has several roots. The first and most important is the increase 
in vehicle production driven by demand in the developed world 
as well as in China, India, and the rest of Asia. Transportation 
electronics has also benefited from the increase in electronic 
content per vehicle, much of this driven by increased regulations 
(e.g. emissions, fuel efficiency, or safety focused). As a result 
of these factors, automotive electronics should deliver annual 
growth of more than 7% over the next four years – one of the 
stronger segments of the electronics industry.
i ndustrial
Industrial electronics has long been a catch-all, including 
systems not counted elsewhere, and possessing few large 
defining systems. Over the past two years, the industrial 
segment declined modestly owing primarily to severe price 
erosion within the photovoltaics sector. Despite the recent 
history, the industrial segment is projected to be one of the 
stronger segments of the electronics industry with growth 
forecasted to average 7% on an annual basis. This growth 
is the result of both recovery in the photovoltaics market, as 
well as other green-energy-focused developments (e.g. LED 
lighting, advanced motor controllers, smart-grid build-out, 
and wind power).
medical
The medical electronics market is diverse, including capital 
equipment purchased by medical groups (e.g. MRI, ultrasound), 
devices marketed directly to consumers (e.g. blood glucose 
monitors, thermometers), and devices prescribed by health 
professionals for consumers (e.g. pacemakers, hearing aids, 
glucose pumps). Medical electronics growth is supported by 
a number of factors, including graying populations in the 
developed world, rising standards of care in developing nations, 
the increasing role of electronics in medicine, and the rise in 
chronic diseases such as diabetes. Growth is however limited by 
an increasing focus on cost containment, most notably within 
the important US market. This focus on cost most impacts 
capital equipment. In total, the medical sector is forecasted to 
deliver 4.6% average annual growth over the next several years, 
with the best segments related to portable monitoring and 
therapy (cost-effective solutions to global demographic trends).

Corporate social responsibility
 Growing our business 
sustainably
CSR is embedded into our strategy and 
business model:
 – Innovation is key to our business and we are accelerating  
the integration of sustainability into product development 
and manufacturing processes. 
 – As we look to penetrate new markets we aim to support 
those communities in which we work by investing locally. 
 – We want our company culture to be reflected in our 
operations as we recognise that the success of our business 
relies on the skill and dedication of our employees.
 – We promote sustainability throughout our supply chain. 
Our operations depend on strong relationships with our 
suppliers and we work with them to ensure materials are 
sourced sustainably.
 – Transparency and trust are key competitive strengths 
for Laird and are aligned to our mission statement. We can 
maintain high standards of business conduct by working 
openly and demonstrating our sustainability to stakeholders.
We work with our customers, suppliers and employees to 
determine the issues that are material to our business by a 
continuous process of review, consultation and assessment. 
We look to mitigate risk and improve our operating efficiencies 
by being a responsible organisation. The outputs of aligning 
our corporate social responsibility throughout our business 
are fourfold: sustained growth, lower environmental impact, 
stronger communities and ultimately, robust stakeholder 
relationships. This report focuses on:
 – Our stakeholders – we can continue to be a trusted partner 
to all of our stakeholders by being transparent about our 
corporate social responsibility and demonstrating that we 
are a well governed organisation that addresses both the 
immediate and longer-term issues.
 – Our environment – we control our environmental impacts 
by working hard to ensure our sites are safe and that natural 
resources are used carefully. We can create cost efficiencies by 
reducing waste which in turn reduces costs and helps improve 
our operating margins.
 – Our people – we aim to attract and retain the best people 
by creating a rewarding place to work which offers great 
opportunities. We aim to build a pool of talent in order to 
deliver our company-wide strategy.
 – Our community involvement – we support the communities 
in which we work by considering the impact of what we do 
and fulfilling our commitments to them to ensure we maintain 
our licence to operate and our respect for human rights
The strategic ambitions we have at Laird are supported by our Corporate Social 
Responsibility programme as we look to build relationships with the communities 
in which we work, ensure our stakeholders’ requirements are met and above all 
continue to build employee pride in our company. 
“ To achieve our business goals we need to 
look after the communities, people and 
environment which support our operations, 
so we can continue delivering value to all our 
stakeholders.”

to assist a further four schools, one in the USA, one in 
Malaysia and two in China. The number of suppliers we 
worked alongside to improve the schools increased from  
4 in 2012 to 18 in 2013
Our stakeholders
We want to deliver value to all our stakeholders –investors, 
employees, customers, suppliers and communities – and adapt 
our organisation so that it is one they can trust and invest in. 
We recognise the need to balance our social and environmental 
impacts in a manner that best serves their needs. 
We ensure there is a two-way dialogue and that ideas are shared 
across the business so our sites can develop their own priorities, 
reflective of the strategy, but directed for their own local needs. 
We participate in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project and 
are included within the FTSE4Good Index to help demonstrate 
our drive to continually better ourselves and contribute to the 
development of responsible business practice. 
Carbon Disclosure Project 
In order to continue building good relationships with our 
customers and suppliers, we strive to be as transparent as 
possible. We participate in the annual Information Request 
by the Carbon Disclosure Project to demonstrate the steps 
we are taking to improve energy efficiency and resource use 
across our operations. Our 2013 submission received the 
highest score we have received to date and it continues to 
improve year on year. Laird achieved a Carbon Disclosure 
score of 76 (2012, 59), the CDP average score for 2013 was 
49. This is categorised as a ‘high’ score
1
. Laird achieved a 
Carbon Performance score within band ‘C’ (2012, D), in line 
with the average score of participants. This is summarised 
as ‘Some activity on climate change with varied levels of 
integration of those initiatives into strategy.’
FTSE4Good
We have been a member of the FTSE4Good Index 
Series since 2004 with an overall Environmental, Social 
and Governance rating of 3.3 out of 5. This index has 
been designed to objectively measure the performance 
of companies that meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards. Our stakeholders can use this 
index to make investment decisions, as a benchmarking 
tool or purely for research purposes. We can also use this 
as a reference by which we can assess the progress and 
achievement of our evolving corporate social responsibility 
programme. The FTSE4Good inclusion criteria are updated 
on a regular basis and continuous improvement is required 
to merit ongoing inclusion in the index which is reviewed 
semi-annually in March and September. The criteria are also 
regularly assessed by Ethical Investment Research Services 
(EIRIS), an independent research organisation.

Corporate social responsibility continued
The Operations Leadership team has undertaken several 
initiatives in 2013 that are improving our manufacturing 
processes worldwide. In addition, the team has increased the 
Lean-Six Sigma deployment efforts in all of our business units’ 
operations which have resulted in significant manpower savings, 
space savings, scrap reductions and lead time reductions across 
all targeted production lines.
During the year we continued to see measurable gains in 
our manufacturing processes, product quality and customer 
satisfaction ratings alongside cost reductions through our Lean 
Six Sigma/CIP programme, which delivered approximately 
£7.6m in savings.
The Operations Leadership team utilises Laird’s well established 
Continuous Improvement Process (CIP) programme to drive 
its improvement objectives worldwide. The CIP programme 
contributes to improvements in overall business processes by 
ensuring our plants deliver high quality product and increasing 
operational efficiency and responsiveness to customers. 
This in turn positively benefits our profitability and customer 
satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is measured through 
formal customer surveys and customer centric internal KPIs. 
Information is reviewed by the businesses and support teams 
and through continued assessment and actions, we strive to 
continually improve customer satisfaction and ensure lessons 
learned are fed back into the product development and 
deployment processes.
Customer satisfaction continued to improve during 2013 with 
survey results indicating a further increase in our overall ‘quality’ 
rating. Over the past seven years Laird has consistently been 
rated better than the competition for ‘quality’ in customer 
surveys, and 2013 increased the gap between Laird and peer 
competitors’ ratings by an additional 16% year on year. 
Furthermore our focus on reducing the number of customer 
complaints through our CIP programme has resulted in an 11 % 
reduction in the customer complaint rate year on year.
Building strategic partnerships with our suppliers 
We have built up strong relationships with our suppliers over 
many years and they are critical in helping us achieve our 
strategic objectives and delivering on our differentiation. They 
also play a significant role in our CSR programme supporting our 
efforts with the schools projects outlined on pages 39 and 40. 
Our aim is to procure the best value goods and services from 
suppliers that meet our standards and deliver the services that 
our customers demand. We expect our suppliers to comply with 
all appropriate legislation and conform to high ethical, social 
and environmental standards in line with the EICC Code of 
Conduct, including the highest standards for health and safety. 
We have a robust procedure for supplier selection and 
qualification and review our suppliers quarterly through our 
periodic supplier evaluation tool which was implemented in 
2013 and uses a quality score and evaluation report to monitor 
performance. 
We are continuing our efforts globally to localise raw material 
supplies. Local suppliers are preferred to reflect our continued 
drive to support the communities in which we operate,  
Governance

Risk and Governance Group
The governance structure of our CSR programme provides 
clear lines of responsibility from the operational level to the 
Board. The strategy is developed and overseen by the Risk 
and Governance Group (RGG) which took over from the Risk 
Management Group and Risk Management Committee in 2013. 
It reports regularly to the Board and is comprised of the Chief 
Risk Officer, Company Secretary (who also fulfils the role of 
Community Policy Officer) and the Executive Committee (Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Presidents of the Performance 
Materials and Wireless Systems divisions, Chief Strategy and 
Technology Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief 
Information Officer). The RGG works alongside functional heads 
in each business unit to develop their own CSR priorities within 
the strategy established for the Company. The Community 
Policy Officer works alongside the Chief Executive and the Board 
to liaise with the businesses and decide on charitable donations 
and community projects that will be supported during the year. 
Delivering to our customers 
An Operations Leadership team was established during the year 
to support the development of worldwide innovative operations 
solutions that are critical to enhancing Laird’s competitive 
position and enabling our strategic differentiation. The team 
is chaired by the vice president of quality and continuous 
improvement and membership is comprised of the vice 
president of operations from every business unit as well as senior 
IT representatives. This team facilitates interaction between 
different parts of the business in order to collaborate and 
leverage expertise to solve operational challenges more rapidly. 
We aim to ensure we consistently deliver to our customers by 
assessing the safety, quality, service and cost of our operations 
and deliver our solutions at speed which requires flexible operations. 
Our Business Model helps provide the framework to allow us to 
have appropriate planning and risk management in place so  
we can mitigate the risks that have the potential to disrupt  
our business.
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p30-45_v7.indd   32 07/03/2014   19:14 33 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
as well as for efficiencies in production costs. Lead times are also 
reduced and transportation costs and effects are minimised. 
We aim to source non conflict minerals by ensuring our supply 
base is risk managed and selected suppliers are sent an EICC 
survey form to obtain a declaration as to the conflict mineral 
free status of their supply chain. The responses are collated into 
a company level report that is sent to customers who request 
them. As a supplier we are also audited by our customers.
Localised sourcing
We often produce tooling in one geographic region and 
transport the tools into manufacturing sites. However, we 
are increasing efforts to localise this process as part of our 
supply chain sustainability initiatives. In 2013 we localised 
the tooling for 24% of the hard tools produced for one of our 
EMI products. Another key success was localising our board 
level shield (BLS) carrier tape supplier from North America to 
Europe from which to service our Liberec site in the  
Czech Republic
Our environment
We work with our customers and suppliers to ensure we run 
responsible and efficient operations and look after the welfare 
of our employees.
As all manufacturing processes and resources have some 
impact on the environment, we strive to seek ways to optimise 
our operations to ensure the efficient use of energy and 
the minimisation of waste. Our goal is to continually deliver 
improvements to address these areas and create cost savings for 
the business.
Through the development of some of our products we 
also aim to help our customers reduce their impact on the 
environment. Our thermal business, for example, produces 
thermally conductive circuit boards for LED lights which help to 
remove excess heat, improving their performance and lifetime. 
Our power supply assemblies are able to utilise temperature 
differentials to generate power for sensor systems, eliminating 
the need to run expensive electrical wiring and often harvesting 
waste heat as an additional power source. Furthermore, every 
EMI gasket and tape product released in 2013 was halogen 
free, in line with the International Electrochemical Commission’s 
(IEC) standard.
Sustainability initiatives 
Our manufacturing sites are expected to develop sustainability 
plans to reduce their energy, waste and water usage, for example:
 – The installation of new electric kilns with larger capacity at 
our facility in Shunde, China, which reduced the run time 
number of kilns required for the manufacturing process. The 
anticipated energy savings for this upgrade is 1,188,000 kWh 
electricity annually. This facility was also able to change the 
granulation process for powder production from a wet process 
to a dry process eliminating the need for oven-drying. The 
anticipated energy saving for this change is 342,000 kWh 
electricity annually. 
 – The facility in Shenzhen, China installed more efficient fuel 
injection nozzles into the waste gas treatment system for the 
adhesives coating line. This improved fuel efficiency by 43% 
and reduced diesel consumption by 49,474 litres annually. The 
site also installed frequency converters on its air compressors, 
reducing electricity consumption by 190,080 kWh annually.
 – In Tianjin, China the site reorganised its power supply in 
order to save 198,824 kWh of electricity annually. The site 
also designed enhanced product lines for one of our thermal 
materials, Tflex, which better suited the customer’s specific 
size requirements. The change resulted in a 30% reduction in 
waste product and a 20% reduction in raw materials.
Smaller conservation projects in 2013 included:
 – The implementation of a system at our site in Geel, Belgium 
which is designed to catch and utilise rainwater for cleaning 
the plant floors to conserve the use of tap water. At the  
same site 40% of the electricity consumed is generated by  
a photovoltaic power installation.
 – At our Holly, USA site a partnership was formed with a local 
recycling centre to recycle scrap wooden pallets into compost 
for use by the local community. 
 – In Schaumburg, USA, the plant implemented an electronic 
purchase order signature process, reducing overall paper 
consumption at their facility by 33% from the previous year.
 – Our plant in Liberec, Czech Republic installed new lubrication 
systems for the stamping presses resulting in a 50% reduction 
of annual oil consumption compared with 2012.
We also focus on a sustainable supply chain and global efforts 
are being made to localise raw material supplies, manufacturing 
operations and significantly reduce the number of product 
and material shipments that are expedited by air, by using 
consolidated ocean shipments. In 2013 the Performance 
Materials division continued to increase the amount of ocean 
shipments to 69%, up from 56% in 2012. 
Measuring our progress
We have non-financial KPIs which provide an ongoing 
benchmark of the effectiveness of our CSR programme (see 
page 20).
CO

 emissions
Throughout 2013 we monitored energy usage and carbon 
emissions in our largest seven sites with an activity-based 
reduction target of 5% relative to total hours worked. We have 
adopted a standard for our methodology of reporting based 
on our geographic locations and both current and previous 
year emissions have been restated to reflect this. We derive 
our Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) by using an emissions 
calculator within the EICC Carbon Reporting System tool that 
converts actual site-level energy usage data into tonnes CO

Waste management
We have an ongoing programme to examine how we can 
further minimise the generation of waste in order to protect 
the environment and reduce costs. A slight increase in waste 
generation relative to sales revenue and manufacturing 
operations was seen in 2013, however the overall activity ratio of 
waste to landfill per £1m of sales decreased 2.5% to 1.17 tonnes 
from 1.20 tonnes in 2012.

Water usage
In 2013 we have seen a greater importance placed on reporting 
our water usage across our sites. In 2013 we monitored and 
measured a total of 403,520 cubic meters of water usage across 
our facilities. 90% of water usage is from our seven largest 
Asia-Pacific facilities (361,033 cubic meters). Currently we have 
a water treatment and recycling process in a number of plants. 
For example, in our Shenzhen facility in China, contaminated 
rinse water is captured from plating operations and treated to 
sort solids and metals. It is then pumped through a series of 
specialised filters to purify the contaminated wastewater to an 
acceptable level to return to the plating lines for re-use. 
Having also established a reliable baseline for measuring our 
water consumption we are looking for opportunities to extend 
this process across other sites. As we set goals and initiatives 
for 2014 we plan to utilise this data to expand our water 
conservation efforts.
Occupational health and safety
Protecting the occupational health and safety of all our 
employees remains a priority. We commit significant time and 
resource to monitoring and assessing processes capable of 
causing injury. We conduct regular safety audits, and workplace 
safety training is delivered to all operations teams. During 
2013 global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) tools were 
developed and implemented by the Laird Operations Leadership 
team in order to improve the identification and evaluation of 
potential safety risks across Laird’s worldwide operations. The 
site safety audit tool and job hazard analysis tool provides 
a standardised process by which sites can be systematically 
inspected to identify hazards and the appropriate controls 
implemented to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries. 
Worldwide employee headcount for our operations increased 
while the number of reportable injuries decreased from 24 to 
23 in 2013. The rate of reportable injuries, per 100 employees 
annualised, increased slightly based on an approximate 7.3% 
decrease in hours worked from the previous year. The number of 
minor injuries increased from 23 to 51, reflecting the increased 
recording of minor incidents as we expand our safety awareness 
efforts and encourage all employees to log any injuries.  
An objective set in 2013 was to reduce the number of hand  
and finger injuries caused by moving machinery and we saw  
a reduction of 15% by the end of the year.

Greenhouse Gas Protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool for 
government and business leaders to recognise, quantify, and manage greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or 
controlled by the entity such as fossil fuels burned on site and other direct sources. 
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions resulting from the generation of 
electricity, heating and cooling, or steam generated off site but purchased by 
the entity.

2013 Workplace safety initiatives
During 2013 new health and safety initiatives were 
developed and implemented: 
 – At our Shenzhen site our thermal operations introduced an 
automatic process for tin dipping, eliminating the need for 
manual high temperature tin dipping and reducing injury 
risk to employees.
 – To improve working conditions for the employees at 
our Shanghai EMI site in Xinzhuang, sound absorbing 
material was installed on the ceiling in the metal stamping 
workshop to reduce noise levels by 6.5 decibels. The 
site also replaced their degreasing equipment with a 
next generation model, significantly reducing the level 
of atmospheric pollution and greatly reducing hygiene 
hazards to employees. As a result of continued efforts to 
achieving high EHS standards, the facility received the 
‘Advanced Unit of Safe Production’ award issued by the 
Shanghai Xinzhuang Industrial Park municipal government.
Process safety management
To reduce risks associated with all of our chemical processes, 
we are continuing to effectively address RoHS (Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances) and customer-required restricted 
substance management. This is achieved through proactive 
contact with our suppliers and continued periodic sampling of 
materials deemed to be ‘high risk’ through established internal 
protocols at our CNAS-A2LA certified
4
, high precision RoHS 
laboratory in Shenzhen, China. 
In 2013 over 7,700 samples were tested for RoHS restricted 
substances in our laboratories in Shenzhen and Kunshan.  
Our decision to conduct in-house testing resulted in net savings 
of approximately £0.4m.
We also continue to actively address customer enquiries for 
REACH compliance data for our products, and develop our 
supply chain to ensure we continue to meet all REACH legal 
compliance obligations and supply products into the EU without 
disruption.
It is a strategic corporate directive that all Laird manufacturing 
sites deemed to have an environmental impact and EHS risk 
should implement certified integrated management systems  
to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards.
Thirteen facilities currently hold active Integrated Management 
Systems (IMS) certification status to ISO 14001/OHSAS 
18001 standards and three facilities hold active ISO 14001 
certification. All of these facilities successfully completed 
certification, re-certification or surveillance audits during the 
year. Newly certified locations in 2013 include Gothenburg, 
Sweden obtaining ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 and Chongqing, 
China who obtained ISO 14001.
Our people
We believe that our people help determine the future of our 
business; they are the ones who reflect Laird’s values, run our 
operations and ensure we maintain Laird’s good relationships 
with our stakeholders. 
Management approach
Our business principles, Global Code of Conduct and core 
company values have helped create a distinctive ‘One Laird’ 
culture. To help reinforce this we ensure all employees take the 
Employee Code of Conduct assessment. 
We recognise that we need to attract high quality people whilst 
retaining the skill and knowledge already present to give us a 
competitive advantage in the market and continue to lead the 
way in product development. To do this we need to:
 – Maintain the right leadership culture
 – Support our employees in their personal and professional 
growth
 – Have an unwavering commitment to being honest and ethical
 – Provide a safe, stimulating work environment
 – Offer competitive remuneration 
Recognising and rewarding performance 
We offer competitive remuneration packages in each of the 
markets within which we operate which is benchmarked against 
our peers. We have in place comprehensive performance-based 
reward systems with the aim of attracting and retaining the best 
people. We also have awards schemes which celebrate those 
employees who put our values into practice. 
It is important to our success that the structure and level of our 
remuneration and rewards are consistent across the Company. 
A profit sharing plan was set up during the year with its purpose 
being to share a portion of the Company profits with employees 
in the Company. The plan is based on sharing a percentage 
of profits, above approved targets. The plan is self-funding 
and the aim is to align the entire organisation in achieving the 
Company’s goals and objectives and sharing as a team, the 
rewards of these efforts.

Corporate social responsibility continued
Supporting employee development 
We place great importance on our company-wide performance 
management process which aligns individual objectives with 
the Company’s strategy. There is regular consultation between 
managers and employees to help support career development 
and reinforce the link between business goals, an employee’s 
contribution and his/her remuneration. We have established 
a ‘Total Rewards Strategy’ scheme which includes ‘Career 
Ladders’ and ‘Career Aspiration’ tools on each employee’s 
online portal to help guide their career development decisions.
We believe in investing in our employee development and offer 
various training schemes which are aligned to enhance the 
relevant skills required in each respective field. Our corporate 
training focuses on culture and compliance and leadership 
development, whilst other types of training fall under the 
specific operational areas. We strive to make learning as 
accessible as possible and during 2013 we have created  
over 20 e-learning modules on our products and processes. 
During 2013 we provided 36 hours of training per employee,  
an increase of 17 hours from the previous year. 
Promoting the health and welfare of our employees is 
a priority for Laird in order to protect our people, boost 
morale and enhance productivity. During 2013 we ran a 
variety of wellness activities across our US sites including 
marathons, hikes, bike rides, self-defence classes, onsite 
biometric evaluations and flu vaccinations and wellness 
fairs. Employees also raised money for the American Heart 
Association, American Breast Cancer Society and the 
Movember charity through some of these activities.

Manchester, New Hampshire
Supporting our employees across the world is fundamental 
to building the Laird culture and as English is not the first 
language for a large percentage of our workforce, we offer 
English language courses as well as presentation skills training 
and quality system training to provide those employees with 
the skills they need to succeed. At our Shenzhen, China facility 
we have installed a new staff house and canteen to improve 
the working environment for our employees.

Building strong leadership
We see strong leadership and managerial capabilities as central 
to achieving our business objectives and sustained success in the 
technology sector. We want to cultivate a talented management 
team which possesses the right leadership culture for our 
company and proactively look to identify ambitious employees 
with the correct skills as future leaders. 
We will be launching a leadership curriculum in 2014 which  
has been developed in the year to help our managers achieve 
their potential. This curriculum aims to refine leadership skills 
and drive innovation and collaboration across the business.  
It has been developed in partnership with SkillPath Corporate 
Strategies, who provide a strategic and innovative approach 
to on-site training and development specifically tailored for 
Laird. The programme is designed with three development tiers 
from junior level to executive level, focusing on skills such as 
strategic planning. Several university based programmes will 
be used alongside internal training such as the Management 
of Managers Programme at the University of Michigan.

Leadership meetings are also organised several times a year 
to help foster relationships across the business and ensure our 
leaders are aligned to Laird’s strategic ambitions and future 
goals, as explained in the Chief Executive’s review.

Creating a diverse workplace 
Creating an equal, fair and diverse workplace has always been 
a priority for Laird. 
At Laird, diversity comprises differences in ethnicity, language, 
gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, 
experience and education. We operate an Equal Opportunities 
and Human Rights policy and consider this to be our 
commitment to our employees feeling respected, valued and 
able to fulfil their potential. It is Laird’s policy to recruit the most 
capable person available for each position and applicants are 
selected solely on the basis of their qualifications and suitability 
for the role.
As detailed in the Nomination Committee section of the 
Corporate Governance Report, it is the Company’s aim to have 
the appropriate level of diversity to reflect the diverse nature of 
the Company’s operations. This includes gender diversity and 
the following outlines the gender profile of the organisation. We 
believe that a balanced workforce will ultimately help us achieve 
our strategic goals. A breakdown showing the number of persons 
of each sex who were directors of the Company is shown within 
the Board of Directors on pages 54 and 55.

Business ethics
Laird has an unwavering commitment to high standards of 
business ethics. We place a high priority on compliance with all 
legislative and regulatory requirements and on the maintenance 
of high ethical standards, within each of the territories and 
jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Our Global Code 
of Conduct, which is available on our website and reviewed 
annually, incorporates policies and guidelines relating to human 
rights, equal opportunity, ethics, compliance, anti-harassment, 
conflicts of interest and regulatory compliance.

Our community involvement
Laird understands that maintaining a good relationship between 
its business and the broader society in which it operates is 
fundamental to long-term business growth.
Innovation through art
In 2013 Laird ran a competition with Arts & Business, who 
develop public and private partnerships with the arts, in order 
to find and select an artist from a local art school to provide 
some art for its London office.
The artist selected, JeeHee Park – a South Korean artist 
from Slade Art School – has had her work exhibited in Korea, 
Germany, the USA, Iceland and London. 
Six pieces of artwork were installed throughout the office 
(including the aluminium mounted print featured on the 
back cover of this report) with the prevalent theme of her 
work being an abstract depiction of the journey from past to 
present, demonstrating Laird’s dedication to global creativity 
and its ambitions for growth and innovation.
Charitable donations and community involvement 
A budget is agreed each year by the Board of Laird PLC for 
charitable donations and community projects. The Chief 
Executive and Community Policy Officer work alongside others 
in the Company to agree the projects for the year.
During the year Laird donated £30,925 (2012: £16,450), 
including Laird’s share of the school assistance programme,  
to charities worldwide.

In 2013 Laird was pleased to help fund a student placement 
at DEMAND: Design and Manufacture for Disability – a charity 
dedicated to solving the challenges and overcoming the 
frustrations of living and working that people with disability 
face every day. DEMAND’s student placement scheme aims to 
positively influence the design thinking of tomorrow. Working 
closely with their experienced designers and craftspeople, 
young designers are given invaluable, hands-on experience 
of solving real problems for real people and take with them 
a design philosophy which has inclusivity at its heart. 
One of the student projects in 2013 was a page turner for a 
Kindle, which was created for a lady with Multiple Sclerosis 
who loves to read but is no longer able to turn the pages.

Supporting local communities 
We want to support local communities in improving education. 
In impoverished areas around the world overcrowded 
classrooms, poor facilities, lack of equipment and poorly 
maintained buildings cause high drop-out rates at school. 
According to UNESCO, one extra year of schooling can increase 
an individual’s earnings by up to 10%. With this in mind, and 
Laird’s focus on education, we approached some of our suppliers 
to work together with us to assist various schools. 
In 2012 Laird and four of its suppliers worked together to assist 
the ZhiChao Public Primary School in Ledong Li Autonomous 
County, which we reported on last year. In November 2013 
Laird’s Chairman, Nigel Keen and Barry Shen, General Manager 
of Shanghai Telematics, visited the school to hand out more 
books and school bags. In 2013, the programme was expanded 
to four schools in three countries and Laird’s Supply Chain team 
worked with 18 of its suppliers to help a further four schools, 
including the He-Dog school in South Dakota, USA, a school 
in SRJK(C) Permatang Tinggi in Malaysia and two schools in 
China, mentioned below.
In the USA, we worked with our suppliers to help a school on 
the Lakota Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. In addition to 
providing bags, sports equipment and stationery, funding has 
been allocated to build a basketball court for the pupils.
One of the schools supported in 2013 was the Long-Tan Village 
Public Primary School in Chongqing, China. The school was 
founded in the 1980s and has over 104 students between 
the ages of three and 13. The condition of the school had 
deteriorated over time and to accommodate the increased 
student population, the school used old tables and chairs from 
other schools. We donated new desks and chairs and bunk beds 
for the children at the nursery who are too young to travel to 
school on a daily basis.

Supporting local communities continued
Another school which we assisted was the Meng Hua Public 
Primary School in Longsheng Guilin, China, founded in the 
1960s. Through our combined efforts with our suppliers, 
we helped to repair the ceilings and roof and repainted the 
classrooms and exterior of the school. The windows and doors 
were replaced and the cement in the playground was repaired. 
Laird and its suppliers donated new tables and laptops for the 
teachers and new refrigerators for the canteen. 
In September 2013, David Lockwood, Chief Executive, Barry 
Shen, General Manager, Shanghai Telematics and Wei Siong 
Tan, Supply Chain Leadership Chairman visited the school to 
meet the pupils and see the improvements that had  
been made.
Also during 2013, our employees participated in a range of 
locally based activities, including volunteering, sponsored walks 
and bike rides, gift programmes, cake sales, local nature reserve 
conservancy efforts, and the support of educational projects.

016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p30-45_v7.indd   40 07/03/2014   19:14 The Performance Materials division has the ambition to ‘own 
the electronic environment’. At the heart of all the sectors the 
division serves are printed circuit boards (PCBs) that require 
controlled and stable conditions to deliver the intelligence 
that the modern world requires. The division has a unique 
portfolio of capabilities that can provide the necessary 
solutions to maintain these stable conditions and which 
enable it to work in collaboration with its customers to create 
design options the customer could not have foreseen if it 
were acting alone. 
The Wireless Systems division ‘enables wireless 
communication’. The customers of this division operate 
in sectors requiring high performance and high reliability. 
Equally importantly those customers are restricted by 
crowded and challenging radio frequency (transmission and 
interference) (RF) environments. Whether through antenna 
systems, wireless modules or machine to machine (M2M) 
solutions, the division is trusted by the major OEMs it 
serves to ensure the customer’s total system will be 
securely connected.

The division designs and supplies an extensive range of 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials, 
thermal management solutions and signal integrity 
products (SIP), providing critical protection for a wide 
range of electronic devices, allowing them to function 
and connect effectively. These products isolate and 
protect sensitive electronic components and systems 
from the electronic emissions from other components, 
and filter and remove electromagnetic ‘noise’ and 
improve a device’s performance through the efficient 
management of heat.
By product line, the majority of the divisional revenues (66%) in 
2013 were from EMI shielding materials, with 24% from thermal 
management solutions and 10% from signal integrity products. 
By market segment, 24% of the division’s revenues were from 
sales of EMI shielding materials to the handset (smartphone) 
market, 17% were from shielding and thermal solutions used 
in the IT market and 18% from the telecoms market, with the 
balance from the automotive, consumer, industrial, medical and 
military markets.
Divisional revenues increased by 6% in 2013 to £342.8m (2012, 
£324.7m). Organic revenue growth was 8% lower in the first half 
but grew 3% overall for the full year (2012, 1 %). 
Underlying operating profit in the division increased 5% in the 
year to £51.5m (2012, £48.9m), and operating margin was 
15.0% in 2013, similar to 2012.
The Performance Materials division has continued to penetrate 
new markets and has expanded its offering to existing 
customers. A notable success in 2013, delivering a significant 
uplift in revenues, was business with a gaming console  
customer which involved products from all three of the  
division’s business units.

EMI
Revenue in the Company’s EMI shielding business was down 
1 % year on year, but strong sales in the second half of the year 
with demand for electromagnetic shielding components for 
smartphones and gaming consoles were a significant driver  
of the second-half uplift.
Revenues for smartphones in 2013 increased with Laird’s largest 
customer and progress was also made in this segment with a 
leading Asian OEM. 
In the tablet market, the maturity of design, and the preference 
for consumers to favour smaller tablet devices, as well as a 
broadening of our customers’ supply base to mitigate dependency 
on any one supplier, has resulted in lower Laird content.
The significant uplift in revenue which occurred in the second 
half of the year, was as anticipated, as customers launched 
major new products. Our ability to flex our production facilities 
– one of the core tenets of reliable fulfilment – served us well 
as we were able to fulfil a substantial increase in demand 
from major customers by providing a fast ramp up for the  
pre-launch build. 
We have continued to penetrate further the automotive market 
supplying shielding for audio systems used within vehicles, as 
well as developing innovative high frequency absorbers which 
reduce the interference found within automotive and telecom 
applications.
The telecom market has shown initial signs of expansion during 
the year from which we expect to see the ongoing benefit from 
increased demand for both EMI and Thermal solutions.
Thermal
The Thermal businesses’ key market segments include Telecoms, 
IT and Medical, where we have attracted new customers. 
Revenue in the Thermal business was up 11 % year on year 
driven by sales of our thermal interface materials product for 
the IT and telecoms markets. Demand for these products has 
grown in the year with a significant contributor being revenue 
from consumer gaming consoles and from market share gains 
on both gap filler and insulator products.
In our active thermoelectric cooling business, the market has 
begun to show signs of renewed investment with orders received 
by North American customers, driven by the build-out for LTE/4G 
networks. The recently announced link-up of network providers 
with smartphone providers to widen network coverage in Asia is 
also expected to be a positive driver of growth for our thermal 
solutions in 2014.
In February 2013, we announced the acquisition of Nextreme 
Thermal Solutions. The highly innovative thin-film, high precision 
cooling it provides is in ultra small form with faster activation 
rates than conventional cooling solutions. We have expanded 
the scale of this business and secured contracts in the medical 
markets – both of which will bring future benefits, albeit at a 
slower rate of progress than originally anticipated.
Signal Integrity Products
The SIP product line serves customers in the IT, automotive, 
telecom and consumer markets. Revenue from this business 
increased by 24% year on year.
Through new product launches and in collaborating with 
other Performance Materials business units, this business 
has significantly improved its revenue stream this year. It has 
broadened its customer base, sold more into the automotive 
markets, achieved higher revenues in the printer segment and 
has benefited from a good share of business on the gaming 
console launch referred to above.
The continuing demands for electronic devices to be faster, 
thinner and lighter and yet have more features and increased 
power, remain key drivers for Laird. Our engineering teams 
continue to focus on innovative solutions which can protect and 
package our customers’ next generation products and during 
2013 we have emphasised our focus on markets where we 
can add value to our customers as they continue their product 
evolution. Our ability to rapidly ramp up production is also being 
recognised by new and existing customers who want reliability 
in delivery and this, combined with our design capabilities, will 
allow us to capture new opportunities for growth.

modules and software-enabled wireless control 
systems, used in a broad range of markets including 
wireless infrastructure, automotive, asset management, 
transportation, industrial, mining, datacom, medical 
and retail markets. 
By product line, Telematics/M2M accounted for 59% of divisional 
revenues in 2013, with 22% from Wireless Automation and Control 
Solutions, and 19% from Infrastructure Antennae Solutions.
By market segment, 61 % of the division’s revenues were 
from the transportation market, 16% were from industrial 
applications and 19% from the IT/telecom sector, with the 
balance coming from other markets such as consumer.
Divisional revenues fell by 1 % in 2013 to £194.2m (2012, 
£195.5m). Revenue on an organic basis was 6% lower at the half 
year and 3% lower for the full year (2012, 1 % lower). This result 
was due to the absence of a significant rebound in industrial and 
public safety markets. 
The division’s underlying operating profit decreased 12% in the 
year to £22.7m (2012, £25.8m). Operating margin decreased to 
11.7% from 13.2% in 2012. 
With 61 % of its revenues in the automotive and transportation 
markets, product life cycles in this division are, on average, 
longer than Performance Materials and visibility is greater. 
As within Performance Materials, there have been significant 
efforts to offer comprehensive solutions to customers combining 
different product lines which will help drive sustainable growth.

Telematics/M2M
Revenues in the Telematics/M2M business were 2% higher year 
on year. The underlying growth in telematics has been driven by 
demand in the automotive markets and has more than offset 
the effect of exiting lower margin M2M tracking products. 
A significant automotive M2M contract won in a prior year,  
will commence in 2014, and is expected to be a driver of future 
revenue growth in North America. During the year, the new 
business won with major European OEMs will grow our market 
share in that region when the products are launched in 2015 
and beyond. We have also won business with a Chinese OEM, 
a market where the penetration of our products is low but  
where there is great market opportunity.
The M2M side of the business has had lower revenue during 
the year as Bluetooth models were phased out ahead of new 
generation launches with upgraded firmware and software 
and with multiple features. This product range refresh has now 
been completed and is expected to deliver revenue growth in 
2014. We have elected to move away from more commoditised 
markets and focus on technology development where we can 
provide differentiated solutions to customers.
We have continued to build our presence in the medical device 
market, partnering with leading customers and completing  
the development of a new range of modules which will launch  
in 2014.
Wireless Automation and Control Solutions
Revenue was 1 % lower in the Wireless Automation and Control 
Solutions business due to some softness in the industrial 
markets and the continued deferral of spending on rail 
replacement programmes. After-market services revenues 
have partially offset reduced new system sales and we saw 
a pick-up in rail revenues towards the end of the year. For our 
rail customers we provide replacement equipment to improve 
safety and efficiency that allows personnel to operate rail 
locomotives remotely. The business has started to work closely 
with Telematics/M2M, leveraging off its software and firmware 
skillset to develop and upgrade the wireless asset management 
monitoring service offering. 
During the year, progress has been made in penetrating the 
Asian market with new customer contracts secured.
Infrastructure Antennae
Revenue from the Infrastructure Antennae Systems business 
was 13% lower as a result of weaker demand from the industrial 
and public safety markets where sequestration measures in the 
USA have had a significant impact on spending. 
We have also experienced lower demand from significant 
customers in the telecoms market for some wireless internet 
services. This is a market that remains volatile.
Demand in the second half of the year has been driven by 
a return to spending by non-governmental infrastructure 
markets and robust sales for our WLAN products to an existing 
networking customer. A collaboration project to offer innovative 
combined infrastructure antennae with our M2M radio modules 
has resulted in a new product family being developed which has 
been well received by customers. We have remained focused 
on new product development in this business with launches for 
indoor wireless antennae and further development on multiple 
in-multiple out (MIMO) panels for wireless local area networks 
for high data capacity environments.
Ubiquitous connectivity and the ‘Internet of Things’ continues 
to require smart systems to serve a range of markets from 
industrial to automotive. Laird has proved itself to be a supplier 
of choice to facilitate infotainment systems in vehicles and 
provide for wireless connectivity in public infrastructure and 
medical markets. These markets are increasingly looking to 
wirelessly enabled devices to aid productivity and increase safety. 
The value-add solutions – which combine software diagnostics 
with hardware – and control systems Laird provides, can be 
offered as a complementary extension of our core wireless 
module applications. This allows us to provide technology for 
networks through point-to-point connectivity – which broadens 
the opportunities available to us. 
In the Wireless Systems division we have started an 
initiative called Blue Ocean which allows the brightest 
engineers within Laird to collaborate and share their 
design ideas. This collaboration has resulted in the 
development of a product called Dolphin, which is a 
wireless bridge to be used for high speed, long range 
data communications between mission-critical assets 
in harsh environments. 
Dolphin combines an antenna system and radio 
module from our Telematics/M2M business with a 
weatherproof case from our Infrastructure Antennae 
business leveraging core Laird technical competencies 
to address new and growing markets.

Segments
Laird has two segments; Performance Materials and Wireless Systems. 
Revenue 
Revenue increased by 3% to £537.0m for the full year in 2013 from £520.2m in 2012. In US$, the increase was 2%.
In US$, Performance Materials revenues were 4% higher and Wireless Systems revenues were 2% lower. The table below shows 
revenue for each segment in US$ together with the incremental revenue contribution from acquisitions made part way through 
2012 and in 2013.

Total for 2013 536.2 303.6 839.8
Revenue on an organic basis was 1 % higher in 2013 over 2012. Revenue on an organic basis is defined as the increase or decrease in 
revenue, year on year, with the base revenue for the prior year including revenue from the newly acquired companies as if Laird had 
owned those acquired companies for the same period in the prior year. 
Segmental revenue is also disclosed in note 3. 
Revenue from the largest customer, including revenue invoiced indirectly through its suppliers, amounted to 18% of revenue (2012, 
19%). The top five customers accounted for 34% of revenue (including revenue invoiced indirectly through their suppliers) in 2013 
(2012, 36%).

Underlying operating profit/operating margin
The table that follows shows underlying operating profit for the business segments in US$ for 2013 and the comparative data for 
2012. The net operating margin was 12.5% (2012, 13.1 %).

Operating profit 105.0 107.9
R&D expenditure has risen to 8.9% of revenue against 7.0% in 2012. Much of the increase in R&D is in Wireless Systems which 
typically has design cycles beyond one year and longer product lives than Performance Materials. A proportion of this investment 
has been capitalised and typically will be amortised over a three to four year period and matched against the revenue benefit.
Two companies were acquired part way through 2012 and Nextreme was acquired in 2013. $5.0m of the R&D increase ($3.1m net 
of capitalised development) and $3.0m of the indirect overhead increase is due to the full year impact of the 2012 acquisitions and 
a part year of the 2013 acquisition. 
The bar chart below is a high level profit bridge of the change in underlying operating profit from 2012 and 2013. The impact of 
acquisitions has been broken out in order to provide a better understanding of the changes in the base business.

Underlying operating profit/operating margin continued
The increase in gross margin of $8.4m arises from the increase in revenue on an organic basis together with an increase in average 
gross margins. The margin increase has been more than offset by the $5.9m increased investment in net R&D (gross R&D less net 
capitalised development), the $3.8m increase in indirect overheads and the net loss from the incremental contribution of $1.6m 
from acquisitions.
Profit
Profit before tax from continuing operations was £43.2m (2012, £45.1m). Profit for the year after taxation and after discontinued 
operations was £30.8m (2012, £46.5m).
Underlying profit
Underlying profit before tax in the year was £60.1m (2012, £60.7m). Underlying profit is defined as profit before tax, exceptional 
items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and US capitalised development costs, the gain or loss on sale of 
businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs, as set out in note 14. 
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs in the period amounted to £4.6m for continuing operations (2012, £2.1m). Exceptional costs were reduced 
by a £4.7m reduction to the assessment of the earnout that could be payable for the Nextreme acquisition. £5.0m of the 
exceptional cost was due to the buyout by the Telematics business of its existing manufacturing representative agreement to 
allow a more direct approach to market. The cash outlay for the buyout does not occur until 2014 and later. Much of the balance 
of the expenditure relates to changes in senior personnel, to align senior management with the new culture and further allow 
implementation of the strategy. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs, excluding a profit on the fair valuing of financial instruments of £1.3m (2012, £0.4m) were £7.1m, compared to £7.4m 
in 2012. 
Taxation 
The underlying tax charge on total underlying profit before tax is equivalent to an average tax rate of 17.5% (2012, 16.5%). Due to 
the proportion of profit generated in China, the average tax rate is expected to increase in 2014 and be in the range 18% to 19%. 
Profits in the USA continue to be sheltered by amortised goodwill deductions resulting from acquisitions and profits in the Czech 
Republic are sheltered by incentives. Laird’s tax payable largely arises in China and Germany. An analysis of the total tax charge  
is given in note 11.
Underlying earnings 
Continuing underlying earnings per share were 18.6p (2012, 19.1p). Underlying earnings are based on underlying profit less 
underlying tax and exclude deferred tax on acquired intangible assets, goodwill and US capitalised development costs.  
The average number of shares in issue throughout 2013 was 266.0m (2012, 265.6m).

Cash conversion (operating cash flow as a proportion of operating profit) for continuing operations in 2013 was 65% against 109% 
in 2012. The rate in 2012 was unusually high due to a £7.5m working capital inflow, whereas a small outflow would have been 
expected. As expected this reversed early in 2013 and therefore had an adverse impact on 2013 cash conversion. For the two years 
consecutively together, cash conversion was just under 90% consistent with the healthy level of cash generation which Laird targets. 
Treasury policies
Laird has a centralised Treasury function, the objectives of which are to monitor and manage the financial risks of the Group and 
to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet the requirements of the business. Group Treasury is not intended to be a profit 
centre and operates within a framework of policies and procedures.
Laird’s Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, 
principally forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. All hedging is carried out centrally and speculative trading  
is specifically prohibited by Group Treasury policy.
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   49 07/03/2014   19:16 50 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Interest rate risk
Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as it holds borrowings on both a fixed and floating basis. Laird’s policy for this risk is to optimise 
the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage Laird’s finance costs.
Credit and counterparty risk
Laird’s policy on counterparty risk management is to place cash deposits and other financial instruments with its relationship banks, 
all of which also provide credit facilities to Laird. The level of exposure to each bank is continually monitored. As at 31 December 
2013 all cash and short-term deposits had a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign exchange management
Laird aims to minimise its exposures to US$ transactional currency exposures by matching local currency income with local currency 
costs. Laird aims to forward cover at least 75% of the unmatched cash flows on a quarterly basis.
Foreign currency borrowings are used partially to hedge the currencies of the Group’s principal assets and cash flows. Where foreign 
currency borrowings are in the same currency as investment in overseas assets they are treated as a hedge of the net investment.
Net borrowings and debt facilities
Net borrowings were £109.5m (2012, £106.8m). 
A cornerstone of our financial planning is to ensure that the Group maintains committed loan finance which provides sufficient 
headroom above expected borrowing requirements and has a significant proportion with terms that exceed one year. Laird has 
£235m (2012, £235m) of bilateral revolving credit facilities which do not expire until April 2016. 
In addition, Laird has in issue $140.0m (£84.5m) of US$ Private Placement notes which have remaining terms of just under one year 
(2014, $97.0m), and three years (2016, $43.0m).
Covenants
A key consideration for financial planning is to maintain sufficient headroom between borrowings and the ceiling set by the 
covenants. Laird’s bank facilities and US Private Placement loan notes contain two principal financial covenants; net debt/EBITDA 
(earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and interest cover.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, net borrowings were 1.3 times EBITDA, 37% of the maximum permitted of 3.5 times. 
Interest cover was 10.2 times against the minimum requirement of 3.0 times. Thus, there was considerable financial headroom. 
The expected headroom is routinely estimated against the covenants and the sensitivity to a number of alternative scenarios is 
tested to ensure ongoing compliance. The Group does not anticipate approaching its covenant limits in the foreseeable future. 
Financial review continued
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   50 07/03/2014   19:16 51 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Currencies in 2013
Local currency exposures are balanced where possible but the Group operates a global business and this creates currency 
imbalances where operating and procurement costs may not be able to be matched with revenues in local currencies. 
In 2013, circa 75% of revenues were negotiated in US$. With circa 45% of the cost base in US$, there is a large US$ surplus. 
Approximately 10% of revenues are negotiated in both Renminbi and Euros. 
In most currencies (other than US$ and Euro), costs exceed revenues, the most significant being the Renminbi (RMB) which accounts 
for approximately 34% of Laird’s cost base. This imbalance can lead to an adverse impact, in so far as the strengthening of the RMB 
may not be fully recovered in US$ selling prices.
In addition, there is a translation impact in converting profits into the Group’s reporting currency (Sterling); each US$0.01 
appreciation against Sterling approximates to an annual increase in operating profit of £0.4m. In 2013, on average through the  
year the US$ was stronger against Sterling than in 2012 and this increased profits on translation by £0.5m.
The majority of the Group’s assets are held overseas and these are hedged in part by foreign currency loans. 
Pensions 
There are 29 employees who are active members of defined benefit plans and approximately 1,600 deferred and current pensioners. 
There is an overall defined benefit pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 (Revised 2011) of £3.7m at 31 December 2013 which is more 
than accounted for by the unfunded schemes of £6.4m as the funded schemes are in surplus. At 31 December 2012, there was an 
overall deficit of £1.5m.
The principal driver of the year-on-year change in the deficit was an increase in the inflation assumption from 3.15% in 2012 to 
3.6% in 2013, which contributed to the increase in the estimate of liabilities. 
Shareholders’ funds 
Shareholders’ funds at the 2013 year end were £436.1m (2012, £440.9m). The reconciliation is set out in the Group statement  
of changes in equity.
Return on capital employed 
Return on capital employed (underlying profit before interest and tax as a proportion of average shareholders’ funds plus net 
borrowings during the year) was 12.0% in 2013 compared to 12.4% in 2012.

Strategic and markets
Competition and market 
conditions
Laird operates in market sectors which are characterised 
by a high level of competition between suppliers 
and which are driven by rapid technological change. 
Changes in market dynamics could have a material 
adverse effect on Laird’s financial condition and 
prospects.
Laird’s competitive position may suffer were it unable to 
maintain customer mindshare in delivering technological 
innovation in a highly competitive environment. 
Laird’s products and solutions include technologies 
in which it holds intellectual property rights which 
may be subject to infringement, counterfeiting or 
misappropriation. Claims could be asserted against 
Laird that it has infringed intellectual property owned by 
others and such claims might require Laird to incur legal 
costs or face legal restrictions on selling certain products. 
The loss of a major contract or erosion of business with 
a key customer, whether through competitive action or 
any change in strategy or ordering requirements from 
customers, could have a material adverse effect on 
Laird’s financial condition and prospects.
Maturing products in large markets could lead to 
competitive erosion of margins and profits.
A highly competitive market environment and structure 
can drive pressures for imbalanced contractual terms 
which could lead to significant penalties and costs if 
breached.
 – Protecting our position by maintaining and extending 
a broad customer base and monitoring the market to 
support a swift response to market changes
 – Developing the business into new and attractive 
growth markets in line with strategic objectives
 – Maintaining a competitive manufacturing base
 – Differentiating Laird with customers through our 
focus on innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed 
to achieve customer mindshare, and where overall 
margin objectives can be maintained
 – Contract review and negotiation through in-house 
legal team and external advisers
 – Maintaining a robust intellectual property protection 
programme and moving to products with a higher IP 
protected content
 – Using a range of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, 
non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements to 
protect intellectual property rights
 – Developing the skills, experience and performance  
of employees and their relationships with customers
 – Introducing innovative new products in a timely 
manner to meet customer needs 
Macro economic and  
political factors
During an economic downturn or delayed recovery, 
customers may cancel, reduce or postpone anticipated 
orders, or apply pressure to prices and margins, any 
of which may result in lasting changes in terms of 
trade pricing policies, delivery capabilities and market 
expectations.
Wider political factors, including regional tensions and 
protectionist pressures, may impact on operations or 
markets.
 – Monitoring of economic and political indicators
 – Close control and reduction of costs
 – Operational contingency plans
Acquisitions Laird has made and is likely to make further strategic 
acquisitions of complementary businesses, assets and 
companies with the intention of accelerating growth 
and strengthening and developing its market. If such 
acquisitions cannot be successfully integrated and the 
risks managed, Laird’s business, financial condition and 
the results of its operations may be adversely affected.
Laird may also set up operations in new markets and/
or geographies which could fail to meet business case 
expectations leading to lost investment or reduced 
profits.
 – Adherence to a robust M & A/Integration process 
tailored to meet overall business and acquisition 
objectives
 – Undertaking due diligence using specialist external 
partners
 – Training and staff retention measures for qualified 
engineers or other technically qualified personnel  
or customers
 – Obtaining warranties and indemnities from vendors 
where possible
Risk management
 Principal risks and uncertainties
Laird faces the normal business risks including the retention and 
protection of our people and continuity of our operations, however, 
the following summarises the principal risks which are more distinct 
because of our market, industry and global footprint.
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   52 07/03/2014   19:16 53 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risk description Potential impact Mitigating activities
Brand management While the ‘One Laird’ (cultural transition) programme 
is key to the delivery of strategic goals, it may also 
bring associated risk during the transition process from 
existing brands within Laird, or new acquisitions, which 
may have strong customer recognition. Planned revenue 
could be impacted if brand loyalty is not successfully 
transferred.
 – Proactive customer communication and relationship 
management
 – Robust and consistent marketing
 – Brand strategy prioritisation within acquisition 
integration plans
Operations
China operational 
concentration
 – Labour costs
 – Ch a ng i ng r e g u l a t o r y , 
political and industrial 
environment
Laird faces continued pressure on Chinese labour costs, 
particularly with reference to base pay and increasing 
social costs. The result of these pressures may lead to 
reduced profits or other adverse effects on the business.
Laird may encounter difficulty in managing operations 
due to unfavourable political or economic factors or 
unexpected legal or regulatory changes. If the effects 
of this instability disrupt Laird’s operations in this region, 
Laird’s operating results may be adversely affected.
 – Processes improvements to increase productivity
 – Increased automation
 – Developing options for relocation of certain 
manufacturing operations processes to Western 
China and other areas 
 – Maintaining professional relationships with 
authorities 
Supply chain and raw 
materials
Laird’s ability to deliver according to market demands 
largely depends on obtaining timely and adequate 
supplies of components and raw materials. 
Failure in the supply chain could interrupt Laird’s product 
supply, limit sales and increase costs. 
The raw materials used include commodities such as 
copper, beryllium copper, steel, aluminium, silver and zinc 
– all of which may be subject to price volatility. This may 
impact Laird’s operating profits.
 – Supplier quality control, vetting and review
 – Developing multi-supplier options where possible
 – Supply chain business contingency plans
 – Processes for raw material stock management
 – Relationship management with key suppliers
Product risks Laird’s reputation and brand value may be adversely 
affected due to real or alleged failures in its products 
and solutions.
 – Product and operations quality control processes
 – Contractual controls to limit liability where possible
 – Proactive customer relationship management 
Operational continuity One or more of Laird’s main factories or sites may 
suffer major disruption such as pandemic, fire, flooding, 
regulatory action, loss of IT systems or similar which 
may have an adverse effect on Laird’s activities, 
especially where multiple manufacturing processes are 
co-located. Any of the above may prevent Laird from 
fully performing its contractual obligations, potentially 
resulting in reputational damage and lost revenue  
and profits.
 – Risk management and recovery plans in place at site 
and business unit level
 – Business continuity incident management processes
 – IT security and back-up procedures
 – Flexing production between sites
 – Use of expert partners to continuously improve site 
risk management controls
Finance
Currency exposures Laird is subject to various financial and fiscal risks by 
virtue of its global operations and customer base.
 – Matching local currency income with local currency 
costs
 – Use of financial instruments to assist in the 
management of foreign exchange and interest rate 
risk, principally forward exchange contracts and 
interest rate swaps
Corporate responsibility
Regulatory compliance In common with all global businesses, we face 
complex and differing regulatory rules in all areas 
of our operations and markets, including ethical, 
environmental, health and safety, trade compliance, 
employment and tax regulations. A serious breach by 
Laird could have an adverse effect upon Laird’s business 
and the results of its operations may be adversely 
affected.
 – Implementation of regulatory and trade compliance 
policies and procedures
 – Compliance training to provide oversight and 
assurance on compliance risks
 – Professional compliance expertise within corporate 
functions compliance to oversee key compliance risks
 – Compliance monitoring and testing programmes

Corporate governance report
Statement of Compliance
The Board considered that during the year ended 31 December 
2013, the Company was in compliance with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The Audit 
Committee has noted the changes to the Code, in the context 
of tendering for the external audit contract every 10 years. The 
Report of the Audit Committee on pages 60 to 63 outlines the 
Company’s intention with regard to this provision in more detail.
The UK Corporate Governance Code is available from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/
corporate/ukcgcode.cfm
The Role of the Board
The Board is appointed by the shareholders who are the 
owners of the Company. The Board’s principal responsibility 
is to act in the best interests of the shareholders as set out in 
the Companies Act 2006. The Board establishes the aims and 
objectives for the Company, sets the strategic direction and 
plans, and the operating budgets which are proposed by the 
Chief Executive, and monitors performance against them.
The Board is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and 
monitoring the key risks faced by the Company, for exercising 
proper and appropriate corporate governance, for establishing 
and ensuring the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
and for reviewing management performance. Through the Chief 
Executive, the Board has regard to the necessary financial and 
human resources required to meet the Company’s objectives. 
There is a clear written division of responsibility between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive, which has been agreed by 
the Board.
Matters reserved for the Board
There is a schedule of key operational matters reserved for 
Board approval, including:
 – significant long-term obligations such as capital investments, 
acquisitions and divestments above certain levels; 
 – the raising of new capital; and 
 – the entering into of loan agreements.
The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the 
Company to the Chief Executive. The Board delegates certain 
other responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination 
and Administration Committees which are described below.  
The Board determines the constitution of these Committees.
Composition of the Board
The composition of the Board, as outlined on pages 54 and 
55, includes an appropriate mix of the skills and experience 
appropriate for the requirements of the business. Further 
information relating to appointments to the Board and the 
Board’s policy on diversity, including gender, is included in the 
Nomination Committee section of this report on page 59.
The Chairman, Nigel Keen, was appointed to the Board as an 
independent non-executive director in 1993. Nigel Keen fulfilled 
the criteria for independence as set out in the Code at the time 
of his appointment. It was announced on 21 November 2013 
that Nigel Keen will be retiring as Chairman at the conclusion  
of the Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2014. Further details 
are included in the Directors’ Report on pages 64 to 66.
Paula Bell succeeded Tony Reading as the Senior Independent 
Director when he retired on 31 August 2013. The principal 
role of the Senior Independent Director is to be available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman or  
Chief Executive. 
Operation of the Board
The Board meets at least eight times a year. A schedule of 
meetings and principal matters to be discussed is normally set 
out at least 12 months in advance. The Board makes periodic 
visits to the Company’s operations. This year the Board visited 
some of the Company’s facilities in Germany and Sweden. 
Additionally, the heads of the business units and other senior 
executives holding functional responsibilities periodically present 
at Board Meetings. 
The Board held nine meetings in 2013. There were five Audit 
Committee Meetings, six Remuneration Committee Meetings 
and seven Nomination Committee Meetings, reflecting the 
ongoing work to refresh the Board, during the year. Details of 
attendance at Board and Committee meetings are given in the 
table below, and are discussed in more detail in the separate 
Committee sections of this report. Whenever a director is unable 
to attend a meeting, the director, if possible, consults with the 
Chairman prior to the meeting and is briefed by the Chairman 
after the meeting.

Independence
The Board comprises a non-executive Chairman, four other 
non-executive directors and two executive directors. The 
Code requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should be independent non-executive directors. 
This requirement continues to be met. All of the non-executive 
directors are considered by the Board to be independent 
of management and in character and judgement, and are 
therefore free from any business or other relationship that could 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Normally the Chairman and the non-executive directors meet 
at least twice a year without the executive directors present and 
the Senior Independent Director meets at least annually with 
the non-executive directors without the Chairman present.
Re-election of directors
All of the directors stand for annual re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting. Biographical details of the directors are 
included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and on pages 
54 and 55. Further information on Board changes during the 
year is given in the Nomination Committee section of this report 
and in the Directors’ report on pages 64 to 66.
Time commitment
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available from the Company on request and will  
be on display at the Annual General Meeting. 
A schedule of meetings and principal matters to be discussed 
is normally set out at least 12 months in advance, enabling the 
Board to assess the expected time commitment. Furthermore, 
the letters of appointment include an approximate estimate 
of time required per annum to cover meeting attendance, 
preparation for meetings and overseas visits. The Board is 
satisfied that each director is able to devote sufficient time  
to fulfil their duties.
Board evaluation
In early 2014 the Board completed an internally managed Board 
self-evaluation of itself and its Committees. The evaluation, 
conducted annually, considered a range of factors including:
 – The balance of skills and experience
 – Relations between executive and non-executive directors
 – The timeliness of information provided to the Board
The Chairman led the evaluation process through questionnaires 
submitted to the directors for completion and one to one 
discussions held with each director. The Chairman also chooses 
a topic for detailed consideration each year and reviews the 
responses with each director. The Chairman also led discussions 
considering the Board’s procedures and effectiveness. The 
performance of individual directors was considered by the 
Chairman in discussion with other non-executive directors. 
The non-executive directors considered the performance of 
the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive 
directors. The Chairman considered the performance of the 
executive directors which was also discussed with the non-
executive directors. Internal evaluations were also conducted  
by the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees,  
who considered their own performance and reported to the 
Board thereon.
The evaluation process concluded that, in overall terms, the 
Board and its Committees had performed well and that whilst 
there are areas to be addressed, these are not considered an 
impediment to the proper functioning of the Board. 
As reported last year, Korn/Ferry, an independent third party, 
was appointed in 2011 to review the Board’s evaluation process. 
They conducted individual interviews with each director and the 
Company Secretary to understand the workings of the Board 
and created a Leadership Roadmap. The Code recommends 
that the Board evaluation should be externally facilitated at 
least every three years and, due to the forthcoming change  
in Chairman, this will be done at the end of 2014.
Induction and training
New directors are provided with an induction process when they 
take on the role and existing directors are provided with training 
as necessary. This can take the form of reports and briefings 
from external advisers and senior employees, attendance at 
seminars and conferences and bespoke training. During the 
year the Board received updates from independent advisers on 
changes to reporting requirements and the September 2012 UK 
Corporate Governance Code. In addition, as part of the Annual 
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   57 07/03/2014   19:16 58 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Performance Review, each director is asked about training needs 
so that this can be factored into forthcoming programmes.
Information and support
It is important that the Board should be supplied with 
information in a timely manner, in a form and of a quality 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. Minutes of 
meetings are circulated to the relevant Committee members 
prior to each Board meeting. Prior to Board meetings, all 
directors receive Board papers which include detailed financial 
information, a strategic report from the Chief Executive and an 
operational overview from the Chief Financial Officer. Directors 
may also take independent professional advice where necessary 
at the Company’s expense and have access to the services of 
the Company Secretary.
Communications with shareholders
The Company is committed to increasing shareholder value and 
ensures it communicates its prospects and achievements to 
shareholders in a timely manner and within the limits imposed 
by the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange. Regular 
communication with shareholders takes place through the 
Annual Report and Accounts, the Final and Interim Results 
presentation materials and other press releases of business 
significance throughout the year. Significant matters relating to 
the trading or development of the business are communicated 
to the market by way of announcements through a regulatory 
information service. These announcements also appear on 
the Company’s website, along with other press releases, 
presentations, webcasts, informative videos and business  
case studies.
The Head of Investor Relations, working closely with the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer on a day-to-day 
basis, has full responsibility for devising and implementing the 
Company’s investor communications plan to service its current 
and prospective shareholders and provide information to 
financial analysts.
Written and verbal reports are presented to the Board at each 
meeting on ongoing Investor Relations activity and reports from 
the investor community are fed back on a regular basis.
During 2013, there was continued focus on engaging with Laird’s 
institutional shareholders and private client brokers to ensure the 
Company’s prospects and developments were understood and 
to emphasise the strategic progress that has been achieved (see 
the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 53).
Throughout the year, the Company participated in 90 
shareholder and prospective shareholder meetings in the UK 
and Europe, with activity mainly centred around key reporting 
dates, the March Full Year Results announcement, July interims 
announcement and the May and October Interim Management 
Statement dates. Whilst a programme of coordinated activity 
is followed throughout the year, where appropriate we also 
respond to ad hoc requests for meetings. The majority of 
the meetings were attended by a combination of the Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Officer and/or the Head of Investor 
Relations. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are 
also available for meetings with shareholders in the event that 
there are any concerns which cannot be addressed through 
management, or in connection with any significant change to 
the Company’s strategy, remuneration policy or governance 
arrangements.
Wherever possible the Chairman and non-executive directors 
attend all results presentations and they welcome the Annual 
General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate with both 
private investors and institutional shareholders. Shareholders are 
invited to ask questions and are given the opportunity to meet 
the directors informally after the meeting. The Chairman gives 
a formal report on the Company’s progress at the meeting and 
a copy of his statement is issued to a regulatory information 
service and published on the Company’s website. All of the 
directors attended the Annual General Meeting in 2013 and 
the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees 
were available to answer questions relating to their areas of 
responsibility. The number of proxy votes cast for, against and 
withheld on the resolutions are reported to the meeting and 
following the meeting are published on the Company’s website. 
Internal control
Laird PLC is a holding company registered in the UK with 
businesses primarily located overseas. These businesses are 
organised as subsidiary companies where the management 
of these companies are appointed to manage within the 
framework established by the Laird Board, as well as complying 
with local statutory and regulatory requirements. Overall 
responsibility for Laird’s systems of internal control including 
financial, operational and compliance controls, and reviewing 
their effectiveness lies with the Laird Board, which ensures that 
a review is carried out at least annually to assess the adequacy 
of those systems. Primary responsibility for systems of internal 
control rests with the managers of the subsidiaries. Laird 
executive directors are responsible for implementing Group 
policy and for monitoring the businesses and performance of 
operating companies and units and reporting to the Board 
thereon. Financial information is reviewed at business unit 
and divisional level as well as by Laird’s Finance Department 
which reviews the consolidation and financial statements to 
ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reflected. 
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group is in place and complies 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the guidance 
of the Turnbull Committee on internal control and is regularly 
reviewed by the Board. This process has been in place for the full 
financial year and up to the date the accounts were approved 
by the Board. The systems of internal control are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives as well as safeguarding the Group’s assets. 
These systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Group operating rules are issued periodically to the managers 
of subsidiaries setting out their responsibilities and delegated 
authorities. These rules require approval for specific transactions 
and call for accurate and relevant financial information to 
be delivered on a timely basis. The ability to identify risk is 
Corporate governance report continued
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   58 07/03/2014   19:16 59 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
enhanced by the timely reporting of management information 
and the short lines of communication with operating managers.
Business units submit their budgets annually to divisional 
management and to Laird’s executive directors. In addition, 
through a risk and controls assessment process, they are required 
to identify the key risk and control issues that their businesses 
face and set out the strategies they will employ to manage 
them. The issues raised by the business units are reviewed 
by the Board as part of the annual risk review process. A risk 
management update, reporting emergent risks and any changes 
to the risk environment, is presented at all Board meetings.  
This process is supplemented by papers submitted to the Board 
by the executive directors throughout the year and by meetings 
from time to time between the Board and the management of 
the subsidiaries, some of which take place at the premises of the 
operating companies. The Chief Executive presents the Group’s 
business objectives which are approved by the Board, and the 
Board also addresses those risks which affect Laird as a whole. 
The Board instigates further reports and investigations as it 
considers necessary.
Oversight of the management of risk and governance is 
effected through the Risk and Governance Group. The Risk 
and Governance Group is chaired by the Chief Executive and 
includes the Divisional Presidents, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the 
Chief Strategy & Technology Officer, the Company Secretary 
and the Chief Information Officer. The Risk and Governance 
Group, which was established at the start of the year to replace 
the two previous risk bodies (the Risk Management Group and 
Risk Management Committee), met four times in 2013, including 
an ad-hoc meeting to review risk management plans for a key 
fast-track new country venture. Meetings will be held at least 
quarterly with additional ad-hoc meetings for specific risk issues 
or projects as required. Outcomes, actions and issues from all 
meetings are reported to the Board as part of the Operations 
Report at each meeting.
Committees of the Board
The written Terms of Reference of the Committees are available 
on the Company’s website, from the Company on request and 
will be on display at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman 
of each Committee reports to the Board, as appropriate, and the 
minutes of all Committee meetings are circulated to the Board.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman and at 
least two non-executive directors. It is chaired by Nigel Keen 
and currently comprises Paula Bell and Sir Christopher Hum. 
The Nomination Committee met seven times during the year. 
Due to the focus on succession planning throughout the year, 
particularly the importance of selecting a new Chairman, all  
of the directors attended the majority of the meetings.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for leading the 
process for board appointments and recommending candidates 
to the Board. In consultation with the Chief Executive, the 
Nomination Committee regularly reviews the structure, size 
and composition (including the balance of skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and diversity) required of the Board. 
This process also involves an assessment of the existing skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge on the Board. At least 
annually, the Nomination Committee reviews the performance 
of the Chief Executive.
The Nomination Committee used Korn/Ferry, to assist with the 
Committee’s search for a new Chairman and non-executive 
director, having previously appointed Korn/Ferry in 2011 to assist 
with the Committee’s work on refreshing the Board. Apart from 
Korn/Ferry’s work assisting with the recruitment of other senior 
executives within the Group, Korn/Ferry has no other connection 
with the Company.
The Board supports the recommendations of the Davies 
Report entitled ‘Women on Boards’ and recognises the benefits 
of having diversity across all areas of the Group. It is the 
Company’s aim to have the appropriate level of diversity in 
the boardroom to reflect the diverse nature of the Company’s 
operations whilst remaining committed to ensuring that 
appointments are ultimately made on merit against agreed 
selection criteria. Korn/Ferry has undertaken to ensure that 
at least 30% of candidates for their long list are women, 
unless they can explicitly justify why this is not the case. This 
undertaking supports the Committee’s policy of considering 
diversity generally when making appointments to the Board, 
taking into account relevant skills, experience, knowledge, 
gender and ethnicity. More information on the Company’s 
gender profile is included in the Corporate Social Responsibility 
report on page 37. 
Appointments to the Board
On 21 November 2013, the Company announced that Nigel 
Keen will be retiring as Chairman at the conclusion of the  
Annual General Meeting, to be held on 2 May 2014, and that  
he will be succeeded by Dr Martin Read CBE, who will become  
a non-executive director on 28 February 2014 to ensure a 
smooth transition. 
The process for selecting a new Chairman involved the 
preparation of a detailed specification, which outlined the 
expected time commitment. The selection for the new 
Chairman was led by Paula Bell, the Senior Independent 
Director, working closely with the Chief Executive. A shortlist 
of candidates was identified and these candidates then 
had individual interviews with each of the directors. A final 
Committee Meeting attended by all Board directors was held  
to make a final decision/recommendation to the Board. 
The Leadership Road Map, formulated in 2011, has helped the 
Nomination Committee set out a strategic Board development 
plan and to identify key competencies and requirements for 
the Board. This plan was used as the basis for searching for 
a new non-executive director to become Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and in May 2013 the Company 
announced that Jack Boyer had been appointed as a new 
non-executive director and that Tony Reading would be retiring 
from the Board on 31 August 2013 after nine years’ service. Jack 
Boyer joined the Board with effect from 7 May 2013 and took 
over as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 1 August 
2013. In addition, it was announced that Paula Bell would 
succeed Tony Reading as Senior Independent Director on  
his retirement.

 Report of the Audit Committ ee 
Chairman’ s overview
As a Committee we are keen to constantly evolve our focus on financial risks that face 
the business as operations continue to grow globally, whilst ensuring robust reporting is 
underpinned by appropriate and effective processes, controls and assurance. The Committee 
recognises the requirement to keep primary areas of judgement under review and report 
accordingly and is committed to fulfilling its responsibilities in this regard. 
The Committee engages with the business effectively and assesses the adequacy of the 
internal financial control environment. During the year, the business has developed its 
financial operations with the implementation of shared service centres in Europe, North 
America and Asia which has further strengthened the already robust financial processes. The 
Committee has reviewed the progress and delivery to plan and has also received assurance 
from external professional advisors.
The Committee advises the Board as to whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. At the 
beginning of each financial year, the Committee agrees the annual agenda of activities 
identifying key areas of focus and emerging topics.

Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the internal audit function 
and the external auditor and the internal financial control 
environment and the processes in place to monitor this.
Responsibilities
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are documented 
and agreed by the Board. The key terms are outlined below 
and the full terms of reference are available in the corporate 
governance section of the Company’s website http://www.
laird-plc.com/laird/about-laird/corporate-governance/board-
committees 
 – Reviewing the financial results announcements and financial 
statements and any significant financial reporting issues and 
judgements which they may contain;
 – Advising the Board on whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy;
 – Ensuring compliance with applicable accounting standards 
and reviewing the appropriateness of accounting policies  
and practices in place;
 – Assessing the adequacy of the internal financial control 
environment and the processes in place to monitor this, 
including reviewing the performance of the internal  
audit team;
 – Overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, 
reviewing their performance and advising the Board on their 
appointment and remuneration;
 – Ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place for individuals 
to raise issues with the Board where a breach of conduct or 
compliance, including any financial reporting irregularity, is 
suspected;
 – Reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls to guard against and detect fraud and to consider  
the Company’s response to any such occurrence.
Membership
The Audit Committee members are all independent non-
executive directors. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
is Paula Bell and the other members of the Audit Committee 
during the year were Sir Christopher Hum, Professor Michael 
Kelly, Jack Boyer and Tony Reading. Tony Reading retired on  
31 August 2013 and Jack Boyer became a member of the  
Audit Committee on 7 May 2013. The Board ensures that at 
least one member of the Audit Committee has recent and 
relevant financial experience. Paula Bell, the Chairman of the 
Committee is the Group Finance Director for John Menzies plc 
and Jack Boyer is a non-executive director on the Board  
of Mitie Group PLC and is a member of their Audit Committee. 
Furthermore, the Board is satisfied that the Audit Committee as 
a whole has sufficient financial, international and commercial 
experience to enable it to carry out its duties. 
Meetings
The Audit Committee, met five times during the year. The 
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Risk Officer and the external auditor are given 
notice of all meetings and may be invited to attend and speak 
at any meeting. The external auditor has the opportunity to 
meet with the Audit Committee without any executive directors 
present whenever necessary and the Audit Committee ensures 
that this happens at least once a year in order to discuss any 
issues or concerns from either party. Additionally, the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee has regular contact with the external 
audit partner outside of Committee meetings. During the year 
the Audit Committee held two meetings with EY LLP, without 
management being present, in order to receive feedback 
from them on matters such as the quality of interaction with 
management. 
The Audit Committee has authority to seek any information it 
requires from any officer or employee of the Company or any 
of its subsidiary undertakings. It believes that it has received 
sufficient, reliable and timely information from management 
to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities during the year. The Audit 
Committee can take such independent professional advice as  
it considers necessary. 
Main activities during the year
The Committee has assisted the Board in carrying out its 
responsibilities in relation to financial reporting requirements 
and the assessment of internal financial control. It has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the internal audit function and their work 
and has managed the relationship with the external auditor. 
The Committee, which comprises all non-executive directors, 
normally meets prior to Board meetings and before half year 
and full year announcements and the two Interim Management 
Statements. At least twice a year the Committee receives and 
reviews reports from the Chief Risk Officer on internal financial 
control. 
Following the publication of the revised version of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board requested that the 
Committee advise them on whether they believe that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
During 2013, the finance function has been going through 
a major programme of change and transition from a 
disaggregated model to a regional shared services model. The 
objective for the Audit Committee has been to ensure that high 
levels of assurance have been maintained during this major 
transition. The Committee has been overseeing the assurance 
process to target priorities in a new control model for the shared 
services environment.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website and sets out its responsibilities and procedures. 
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v15.indd   61 07/03/2014   19:16 62 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is to review the half year and annual financial 
statements. The review is carried out with both management 
and the external auditor, and focus areas include evaluating 
whether:
 – The annual report and financial accounts represent a fair, 
balanced and understandable view of information for 
shareholders;
 – Material areas of significant judgement have been given due 
consideration by management and reviewed with external 
auditors;
 – The quality and acceptability of accounting policies and 
practices;
 – Clarity of disclosures and compliance to financial reporting 
standards and relevant financial and governance reporting 
requirements; 
 – Any correspondence from regulators in relation to financial 
reporting.
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee 
in relation to the 2013 Accounts, and how these were addressed, 
were:
Goodwill impairment testing
The review for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
is based on cash flow projections to calculate a value in use 
for each division. These projections are based on forecasts 
which have been prepared by each division. The achievability 
of the forecasts is a risk, given the inherent uncertainty within 
any financial projection. The Committee addresses this risk 
by reviewing the assumptions used for each division and the 
financial models used to assess value in use are reviewed as part 
of the audit.
Taxation
Provisioning for potential current tax liabilities and the level 
of deferred tax asset recognition in relation to accumulated 
tax losses are underpinned by a range of judgements. The 
Committee addresses these issues through a range of reports 
from the taxation department and senior management and a 
process of challenging the appropriateness of management’s 
views including the degree to which these are supported by 
professional advice from external legal and other advisory firms. 
This is also an area of higher audit risk and accordingly the 
Committee received detailed verbal and written reporting from 
EY LLP on these matters.
Exceptional items
The Committee also reviewed the nature and classification of 
some costs as exceptional in the year and its compliance with 
the Group’s accounting policy.
External auditor
Appointment and independence 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the appointment and 
terms of engagement of EY LLP, the external auditor, including 
the proposed fee structure. 
The Audit Committee has noted the changes to the Code, 
the recent findings of the Competition Commission and 
the Guidance for Audit committees issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council, in the context of tendering for the external 
audit contract every ten years. EY LLP were appointed as 
external auditor in 1989 and their appointment has been 
subject to annual reviews. Following the introduction of the 
audit tendering provisions in the Code, the intention is that 
a competitive audit tender will take place in 2015 to coincide 
with the five year rotation of the audit partner, with a view to 
any change being implemented in 2016, following the 2015 
audit. There are no contractual obligations which restrict the 
Committee’s recommendation to the Board of statutory auditor.
The Audit Committee has reviewed EY LLP’s key policies for 
maintaining objectivity and independence, including the policy 
for the rotation of audit partners which requires a new lead audit 
partner to be appointed every five years. In accordance with 
this policy, there was a change in lead audit partner in 2011. 
The Audit Committee also reviewed the policy on employment 
of former employees of the external auditor and confirmed it 
remained effective. 
The Audit Committee recommended to the Board the re-
election of EY LLP as the external auditor. 
Effectiveness
The Audit Committee considers and reviews the effectiveness 
of the external audit on an annual basis, reporting its findings 
to the Board as part of its recommendation. This process 
is supported by the completion of questionnaires by the 
Committee which include consideration of the audit partner, 
the approach, communication and reporting. The results of the 
questionnaires are reported to and discussed by the Committee. 
The Committee also considered the scope and planning of the 
external financial audit and assessed the effectiveness of the 
audit process, including a report on the audit firm’s own internal 
quality control procedures. Additionally, the Committee received 
and reviewed the Financial Reporting Council’s Annual Audit 
Quality Inspections Report. After taking into account the above 
factors, the Committee concluded that the external auditor 
remains effective. 
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee recommends for Board approval a policy 
for non-audit services to be performed by the auditor. This policy 
prohibits the use of the external audit firm for certain specified 
matters and the hiring of its former employees, without prior 
approval from the Audit Committee Chairman. The auditor 
will not be engaged to provide Internal Audit services, systems 
implementations or valuations as such services would be 
deemed to conflict with their independence.

The ratio of fees for non-audit work to audit services was 1:1 in 
2013. There are often sound commercial and practical reasons, 
including confidentiality, for using EY LLP to provide non-audit 
services. Non-audit fees paid to EY LLP have been falling steadily 
as Laird has sought to bring down non-audit fees paid to the 
external auditor and has used other providers for tax planning 
advice and acquisition due diligence. Tax compliance fees have 
been unusually high as EY LLP has been advising Laird over a 
number of years on a Bilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement, 
a major tax compliance project involving the Chinese and US 
tax authorities. These fees which amounted to £0.4m in 2013 
are expected to reduce significantly after 2014. Excluding these 
fees the ratio of non-audit fees to audit was 1:0.6. Furthermore 
some tax compliance work, which is performed by EY LLP, will be 
eliminated. Details of fees for non-audit work are set out in  
note 6 on pages 105 to 106.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function. The 
Audit Committee considers the scope and planning of internal 
financial audits and reviews the internal audit process for 
identifying and managing financial risk and the findings of those 
audits. Deloitte LLP, who provide global internal audit services 
under the direction of the Chief Risk Officer, attended one Audit 
Committee meeting during the year. The Chief Risk Officer 
briefed the Audit Committee three times on key internal audit 
matters and findings of internal audit investigations and had the 
opportunity at each meeting to meet with the Audit Committee 
without any executive directors present and he met separately 
with the Chairman of the Audit Committee on six further 
occasions during the year. These meetings included three pre-
meeting briefings and three interim updates.
Internal financial control
As noted above, the Audit Committee reviews the Group and 
Company’s financial statements. It also has responsibility for 
reviewing the process for identifying and managing financial 
risk, for reviewing the internal financial controls and considers 
the scope and planning of internal and external audits. It reviews 
reports on internal financial control including reports by the 
Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and the results 
from internal financial audits. As part of its audit, the external 
auditor, to the extent it considers necessary to support its audit 
opinion, reviews and tests the systems of internal control and 
the data contained in the Accounts, including an independent 
and objective review of the approach of management to the 
reporting of the operating results and financial condition.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s procedure for 
handling allegations from whistleblowers as set out in the 
Company’s Global Code of Conduct (which is on the Company’s 
website) and any whistleblowing events are brought to its 
attention. A whistleblowing service, which offers a relevant 
language service in all countries in which Laird operates, is 
made available to all employees through an independent 
telephone and internet provider. Employees have the right to 
remain anonymous. A monthly report on any calls received is 
sent to senior management. Investigation of all whistleblower 
communications is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer with 
findings reported to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Jack Boyer and 
currently comprises the Chairman and all the other non-
executive directors, who are all considered to be independent. 
It met six times in 2013 and is responsible for recommending 
to the Board the Company’s general policy on remuneration 
and in particular to determine the remuneration and benefits 
of the executive directors, the grant of all options and award of 
shares under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. In 
accordance with the Terms of Reference of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Chairman of the Board is not the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee, 
excluding the Chairman, determines the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the terms of his appointment.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, when 
requested by the Chairman of the Committee, attends a portion 
of the meeting. Normally, the Chief Executive is consulted 
on general policy matters and matters concerning the other 
executive directors and employees. Further details on the 
Remuneration Committee are to be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 87.
Administration Committee
The Administration Committee of the Board consists of any 
two or more directors and deals with items of a routine and 
administrative nature.
Share capital
Information on the Company’s share capital is set out on page 
64 of the Directors’ Report and in note 29 on page 127.

The Directors are pleased to present their Annual Report and 
Accounts to shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2013.
In accordance with the new requirements introduced by The 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013, which became effective on 1 October 2013, 
the directors have included certain information required for

include the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, 
Performance, Operating Review, Financial Review, Corporate 
Social Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group Financial 
Statements and should be read in conjunction with this report 
and this information is, accordingly, incorporated into this report 
by reference. 
A review of the development and performance of Laird during 
the year, its position at the year end, and the outlook and 
strategy of the Group is given in the Chairman’s statement 
on page 13, the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 18, 
Performance on pages 2 and 3, the Financial Review on pages 
46 to 51, the Operating Review on pages 41 to 45 and note 14  
to the financial statements. 
The Company has chosen, in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 section 414C(11) to include the disclosure of likely 
future developments in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 53.
Information on environmental matters and disclosures relating 
to diversity, gender and human rights are contained in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 30 to 40. These 
pages, the Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) and the Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties contained therein, are incorporated into 
this report by reference. Definitions of the KPIs and the Group’s 
performance against them are given on pages 19 and 20. The 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties are set out on pages 52 and 53. 
Details of the Company’s policy on addressing such risks, along 
with information on the Laird Risk Management Framework, 
including the role of the Risk and Governance Group can be 
found in the Corporate Governance report on pages 56 to 63.
Results and dividends
Underlying profit before tax was £60.1m (2012, £60.7m) and 
is analysed in note 14 on page 111. Profit for the year after 
taxation was £30.8m (2012, £46.5m). The recommended final 
dividend is 7.9p per ordinary share, to be paid on 4 July 2014 to 
ordinary shareholders registered as members of the Company at 
the close of business on 6 June 2014, making a total dividend for 
the year of 12.0p per ordinary share. 
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on Friday 2 May 2014. Details 
of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting which is provided to all shareholders.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. No 
amendments to the Articles are being proposed at the AGM.
Significant contracts
Laird has arrangements with a number of major customers and 
suppliers whereby regional or global terms of supply are agreed. 
However, these arrangements do not amount to contractual 
obligations to purchase and supply as these are covered by 
individual purchase orders.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of share and the rights 
attached to each share are identical. Details of the rights and 
obligations attaching to the shares are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association which are available on the Company’s 
website. The Company may refuse to register any transfer of 
any share which is not a fully paid share. At a general meeting of 
the Company, every member has one vote on a show of hands 
and on a poll one vote for each share held. Details of the voting 
procedure, including deadlines for exercising voting rights, are 
set out in the Notice of Meeting for the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting. 
At 31 December 2013 the issued share capital of the Company 
was 267,656,570 ordinary shares of 28.125p each. Details of the 
share capital and options outstanding as at 31 December 2013 
are shown in note 29 on page 127.
At the 2013 Annual General Meeting, shareholders agreed to 
the renewal of the directors’ power to allot shares, or grant 
rights for or to convert any security into shares, in the Company; 
the disapplication of pre-emption rights and authorised the 
Company to make purchases of up to 10% of its ordinary 
shares on the London Stock Exchange. As at 27 February 2014, 
no shares have been purchased pursuant to this authority. 
Shareholders will be requested to renew these authorities at 
the 2014 Annual General Meeting and details are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Directors
Election and Re-election of directors
The directors as shown on pages 54 and 55 were all directors 
throughout the year to 31 December 2013, with the exception 
of Jack Boyer who joined the Board on 7 May 2013 and Tony 
Reading who retired as a director on 31 August 2013. The 
Company announced on 21 November 2013 that Nigel Keen 
will be retiring as Chairman to be succeeded by Dr Martin Read 
at the Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2014. Dr Martin Read 
has been appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 
28 February 2014 and his appointment as Chairman will take 
effect from the Annual General Meeting to be held on 2 May 2014. 
All of the directors of the Company will offer themselves for 
election or re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. The 
Company’s Articles of Association (which require shareholder 
approval for any amendments), set out the powers of the 
directors and the regulations for their appointment and removal. 
None of the non-executive directors offering themselves for 
election or re-election has a service contract with the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries. Biographical details and reasons for 
reappointment for the non-executive directors are given in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ report
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p46-66_v16.indd   64 11/03/2014   18:06 65 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ Interests
In the year to 31 December 2013, no director had a material 
interest in any third party contract of significance with the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Directors’ shareholdings 
at 31 December 2013 are shown within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 83.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies, 
subject to the provisions of the Company’s Articles of 
Association, to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of 
interest, where appropriate. The authorisation shall be effective 
only if the matter is agreed to without the vote of the director 
who is subject to such conflict having been counted. The 
authority for directors to act in situations of conflict and the 
rules governing their duties in such situations are set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association. A register of conflicts 
or potential conflicts of interest has been prepared and it is 
available at every Board Meeting. 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance was purchased and 
maintained by the Company during the year.
Directors’ Indemnities
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
indemnified the directors in respect of proceedings brought by 
third parties and such indemnification was in place throughout 
the year.
Between 2005 and 2008, five of Laird’s final salary pension 
schemes were merged. The trustees of the schemes, including 
Nigel Keen who is Chairman of the trustees of the surviving 
scheme, received an indemnity from the Company against any 
claim or other liability arising out of or in connection with the 
pension schemes and their agreement to the merger.
Change of control arrangements
Two employees of the Company have long-standing 
agreements which provide for compensation, in addition to the 
contractual notice period, of up to a maximum of two years’ 
base salary for loss of employment which occurs as a result of a 
takeover offer or scheme. This additional compensation reduces 
pro rata to zero over the two years following the date of change 
of control. Four other employees of the Group have agreements 
which provide compensation of up to a maximum of one year’s 
base salary for loss of employment which occurs as a result of a 
takeover offer or scheme, in addition to their contractual notice 
period. This additional compensation is fixed at one year’s base 
salary during the first six months following the date of change  
of control and reduces pro-rata to zero over the next 12 months.  
No director benefits from these arrangements.
On a change of control, the Company’s bilateral revolving credit 
facilities may be cancelled by the lenders by giving not less than 
30 days notice to the Company. Under the terms of the US 
Dollar Private Placement, within 60 days of a change of control, 
the Company must notify all Noteholders and offer to repay all 
outstanding amounts. The Noteholders then have a period of 
30 days to either accept the offer of repayment or continue with 
the Notes.
Employment policy
Laird conducts business in multiple geographic locations and is 
committed to complying with the relevant legal requirements 
in each of those regions. Business unit management are 
responsible for implementing and communicating the Laird 
Equal Employment and Human Rights Policy Statement within 
their own business unit. Various methods are used throughout 
Laird as appropriate in each location for tracking morale, 
motivation, retention rates and training, which are reported 
regularly to local management teams. During the year Laird 
employed an average of 8,665 employees (2012, 9,145).
Laird is committed to providing equal opportunities in terms of 
recruitment, training and career development for all employees, 
including those with disabilities. 
A copy of Laird’s Equal Employment and Human Rights Policy 
Statement is available on the Company’s website.
Employee participation
The Board recognises that the success of the business relies 
on the skill and dedication of its workforce and therefore 
encourages two-way communication with its employees. 
Operating subsidiaries encourage consultation at local level 
and performance and development reviews reinforce the link 
between business goals, an employee’s contribution and his/her 
remuneration. Laird communicates regularly with its employees, 
including through the provision of information on key events 
within Laird, charity and community involvement and employee 
achievements. 
In recognition that Laird’s business and its activities impact a 
wide community of stakeholders including investors, customers, 
employees, suppliers and local communities, the Board reviews 
the significance of social, environmental and ethical matters 
which may affect Laird. Further details on all these matters are 
available in the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 
30 to 40.
Health and safety at work
Laird is committed to providing a safe working environment for 
its employees and continuous improvement is sought by the 
setting of objectives and targets based on relevant national 
and international health and safety standards and monitoring 
performance against these. In addition Laird maintains a 
proactive communications strategy amongst all employees to 
promote and develop good health and safety practices. Further 
information is shown in the Corporate Social Responsibility 
report on pages 30 to 40.

Research and development
Investing in research and development programmes delivers 
product innovation and manufacturing improvements within 
Laird. Expenditure in 2013 on research and development, 
amounted to £47.6m (2012, £37.4m), of which £11.6m has 
been capitalised (2012, £8.5m). Laird continues to develop 
its technology capabilities, with research and development 
expenditure during the year running at 8.9% of sales (2012, 
6.9%). This is in line with our strategic objective to increase R&D 
expenditure in the year and focus on innovation.
Going concern
As set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on 
page 88, the Accounts have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. A statement on going concern relating to a business 
requires judgement at a point in time about future events 
which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. The directors 
have considered the ability of Laird to maintain committed 
loan finance, meet existing debt covenants and the impact of 
foreign currency exposures, as discussed in the Financial Review 
on pages 46 to 51. The directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Accounts.
Financial instruments
An analysis of debt is given in note 22 to the financial 
statements. An analysis of financial instruments at carrying 
value and fair value is given in note 28 to the financial 
statements. Financial instruments and related disclosures, 
together with a discussion of financial risk management 
objectives and exposures to credit and liquidity risk, are in 
accordance with IFRS 7.
It is the Company’s objective to manage its financial risk so as 
to minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial markets 
on the Group’s reported profitability and cash flows. The 
policies for managing each of the Group’s main financial risk 
areas are referred to in the Financial Review report on page 50 
and in more detail within note 14 to the financial statements. 
Additionally, the Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 
52 and 53 deal with currency exposure risk and the mitigating 
activities adopted.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no post balance sheet events.
Auditor
It is recommended that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed as 
auditor.
Shareholders
At 31 December 2013 there were 3,669 shareholders.
Substantial equity interests
The Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules (‘DTRs’) issued by 
the Financial Conduct Authority require notifications relating 
to control over exercising voting rights attached to shares. 
Categories of notifiable interests include direct interests 
(holdings of shares with voting rights attached), indirect 
interests (those with access to voting rights) and financial 
instruments (which give the holder the formal entitlement to 
acquire shares with voting rights attached). Notification must 
be made of each category, and also the aggregate of combined 
holdings, which exceed or fall below the notifiable threshold.  
The requirements of the DTRs specify that, save in certain 
limited circumstances, notifications of holdings of 3% or over 
have to be made when a full percentage point increase or decrease 
occurs. The Company has only one class of shares, and does not 
hold treasury shares, so the total number of voting rights under 
the DTRs is equivalent to the number of shares in issue.
As at 26 February 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this document) the Company had received 
the notifications of control of 3% or more over the Company’s 
total voting rights and capital in issue as set out below:

Disclosure of information to the Auditor
As at the date of this report, as far as each director is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware. Each director has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

Annual statement
Dear Shareholder
Following my appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee in August 2013, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2013 which has been 
prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the 
Board.
Over the past year, we have made significant progress in 
positioning the business for future sustainable growth, through 
defining our strategic differentiation of innovation, reliable 
fulfilment and speed and focusing on these capabilities in day-
to-day operations.
The main aim of our remuneration policy is to attract, retain and 
motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience 
needed to manage and grow the international complexity of 
Laird’s operations and to incentivise and reward the delivery  
of outstanding business results. 
The Committee believes that it has developed a remuneration 
structure that will continue to support and motivate our senior 
team, whilst aligning them both to the Company’s strategic 
objectives and the interests of our shareholders. As such, no 
major changes were made in 2013, other than the introduction 
of a new long term incentive plan which replaced two existing 
plans which expired in 2013. Key shareholders were consulted 
on the new plan, which should provide alignment of executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders over the long-term, and on 
the performance conditions for share awards granted during 
the year. The plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 3 May 2013.
In order to ensure alignment with Laird’s strategic objectives, 
it is the intention of the Committee to conduct a review of 
our executive remuneration policy in 2014 and, if appropriate, 
propose amendments to ensure that we continue to provide a 
suitable remuneration framework for the business.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
base salaries of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
and determined that they would be increased by 5.9% and 
2.7% respectively. The Committee also agreed that the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer should receive an annual 
performance bonus in respect of 2013 of 60% and 50% of base 
salary respectively (see pages 80 to 81). Details of the  
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p67-88_v16.indd   67 11/03/2014   18:07 68 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
This section of the Remuneration Report contains details of the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy that will govern the 
Company’s future remuneration payments. The policy will normally apply for three years although, as noted on page 67, it is the 
intention of the Committee to conduct a review of remuneration policy during 2014 which may necessitate a change to the policy  
in 2015.
The policy described in this part, subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 2 May 2014, will apply from that 
date. The policy part will be displayed on the Company’s website, in the Investor Relations section, immediately after the 2014 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee has established the policy on the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman. The 
Board has established the policy on the remuneration of the other non-executive directors. 
The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates. Therefore there is 
a mixture of fixed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between annual bonuses, with a range 
of different measures, and longer term share incentives, which use more than one performance target. 
Future policy table
Executive directors 
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for executive directors:
Objective and link 
to the strategy
Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures  
and assessment
Base salary
Core element of 
remuneration, set 
at a level which is 
sufficiently competitive 
to recruit and retain 
management of the 
appropriate calibre and 
experience to achieve 
the Company’s business 
strategy.
Salaries are reviewed annually, and 
any changes normally take effect 
from 1 July.
When determining the salary of the 
executives the Committee takes into 
consideration:
 – the levels of base salary for 
similar positions with comparable 
status, responsibility and skills, in 
organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity, in particular 
the median salary levels of those 
comparable companies within the 
FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts) and the FTSE All Share 
Technology Sector;
 – the performance of the individual 
executive director;
 – the individual executive director’s 
experience and responsibilities; and
 – pay and conditions throughout the 
Company.
No recovery provisions apply to base 
salary.
Annual rate for each executive director 
is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2014 on page 85.
The previous column sets out the factors 
that will be taken into consideration in 
determining the salary.
Any increase in salary for the executive 
directors will be benchmarked against 
the salary levels of the comparator 
groups set out in the previous column.
Individuals who are recruited or 
promoted to the Board may, on occasion, 
have their salaries set below the 
targeted policy level until they become 
established in their role. In such cases 
subsequent increases in salary may be 
higher than the average until the target 
positioning is achieved.

Performance targets will be set by 
the Committee annually based on 
a range of financial and strategic 
measures, including but not limited 
to:
 – underlying profit before tax;
 – working capital metrics;
 – the achievement of criteria 
designed to assess and drive 
performance against a number 
of key, measurable strategic 
objectives for the Company, 
including those relating to 
environmental, health and  
safety issues;
The Committee has the discretion 
to adjust targets or performance 
conditions for any exceptional events 
that may occur during the year.
As well as determining the measures 
and targets, the Committee will 
also determine the weighting of the 
various measures to ensure that they 
support the business strategy and 
objectives for the relevant year.
Further details on the measures for 
2014 are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on page 85.

Long-term incentives
Incentivises the 
achievement of 
long-term financial 
performance and 
sustainable returns to 
shareholders in a way 
that aligns the interests 
of executives and 
shareholders. 
Under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (2013 LTIP) the Committee may 
award annual grants of: 
 – Conditional Awards or Nil-Cost 
Options (Nil-Cost Awards); and
 – Market Value Options.
A claw back facility is in operation 
under which, if the Committee 
reasonably determines, all or part of 
an unvested or unexercised award 
will be forfeited and will lapse in the 
event of exceptional circumstances 
occurring, including (but not limited 
to) a material misstatement of 
the Company’s financial results or 
engagement in misconduct.
Maximum grant of Nil-Cost Awards is 
100% of base salary.
Maximum grant of Market Value Options 
is 100% of base salary or 200% of base 
salary if the Committee determines 
that special circumstances (such as 
recruitment or promotion to a key 
management position) apply.
Vesting is dependent on service and 
performance measures.
Service and performance measures 
must be met over a three-year 
performance period.
Performance measures for Nil-Cost 
Awards:
 – Total Shareholder Return relative 
to FTSE 250 companies (excluding 
Financial Services companies and 
Investment Trusts);
 – 25% vesting for median 
performance and 100% vesting for 
upper quartile performance; and
 – Underpinning requirement that 
the Committee must be satisfied 
that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s 
underlying financial performance. 
Performance measures for Market 
Value Options:
 – Average Annual Growth in 
Continuing Earnings Per Share; and
 – 25% vesting for threshold 
performance and 100% vesting 
for maximum performance.
Pension
To aid retention and 
to provide competitive 
levels of retirement 
benefit.
The Company has a UK Group 
contributory Defined Benefit Scheme 
which is closed to new members and 
provides either a contribution to a 
personal pension scheme or cash 
allowance in lieu of pension benefits.
Jonathan Silver ceased to accrue 
further pension benefits under the 
defined benefit pension scheme with 
effect from 6 April 2006. However, 
his benefits accrued at that date 
remain linked to any growth in his 
pensionable pay.
No recovery provisions apply to 
pension.
David Lockwood receives a contribution 
to a personal pension scheme or cash 
allowance in lieu of pension benefits 
equal to 25% of his base salary.
In light of the Company’s previous 
commitment to Jonathan Silver, he 
receives a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension benefits equal to 40% of his 
salary in lieu of future pension accrual 
under the defined benefit pension 
scheme. 
The maximum contribution or pension 
cash allowance provided by the 
Company is 40% of salary.
The maximum pension contribution or 
payment in lieu of pension for a new 
appointment will be 25% of base salary.

Shareholding policy
To ensure that 
executive directors’ 
interests are aligned 
with those of 
shareholders over a 
longer time horizon.
Executive directors are expected to 
retain, as shares, all of the after-tax 
profit on the gains made on the 
vesting of share awards and the 
exercise of share options, until they 
have acquired the necessary shares 
to meet their requirement.

Notes to the future policy table
Performance measures and targets
The short and long-term incentives have a number of different financial performance measures which the Committee believes 
provide a direct link to the Company’s performance. The Annual Performance Incentive Scheme contains specific strategic and 
operational objectives which provide a direct link to the Company’s strategy, whilst the long-term performance incentive targets 
of TSR and EPS are considered to be appropriate measures for aligning the interests of the executive directors with those of 
shareholders. The Committee is of the opinion that, given the commercial sensitivity of Laird’s operations, disclosing precise targets 
for the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholders’ interests. Except in circumstances where 
elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the 
performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the 
Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees of Laird are entitled to base salary, and a range of different benefits including pension and annual bonus depending 
on country, seniority and also sometimes legacy arrangements. The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority 
and responsibility of the role. Long-term incentive awards are generally only available to the executive directors and the 55 senior 
employees who comprise the Leadership Team. Long-term incentive awards may also be granted to other key employees at the 
discretion of the Committee.
Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy
There have been no changes to the operation, maximum opportunity or performance measures in relation to salary, pension and 
other benefits during the year.
From 2014, the 25% for exceptional performance in the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme has been re-allocated to specific 
targets but the maximum payable under the Scheme remains capped at 100%. 
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p67-88_v16.indd   71 11/03/2014   18:07 72 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
During the year Laird introduced the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan to replace the existing plans that expired during the year. 
Although the replacement plan is identical in almost all areas, changes include a 5% in 10 years’ dilution limit; a reduced threshold 
for vesting at 25% (previously 30%) and the introduction of clawback provisions for awards before they vest. The new plan was 
approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Non-executive directors
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for non-executive directors:
Objective and link 
to the strategy
Operation Maximum potential value Performance measures  
and assessment
Fees
Core element of 
remuneration, set 
at a level sufficient 
to attract and retain 
individuals with 
appropriate knowledge 
and experience in 
organisations of 
broadly similar size  
and complexity.
The Board as a whole is responsible 
for setting the remuneration of the 
non-executive directors, other than 
the Chairman whose remuneration 
is determined by the Committee and 
recommended to the Board.
Fee levels are sufficient to attract 
individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience.
Non-executive directors are paid 
a base fee and additional fees 
for chairmanship of Committees. 
In exceptional circumstances, fees 
may also be paid for additional time 
spent on the Company’s business 
outside of the normal duties. 
Reviewed annually with any changes 
generally effective from 1 January.
Any increases in fees will be 
determined based on time 
commitment and take into 
consideration level of responsibility 
and fees paid in other companies of 
comparable size and complexity.
Non-executive directors do not 
receive any variable remuneration 
element or receive any other 
benefits, other than being covered 
for disability benefits under the 
Company’s insurance whilst travelling 
on Company business. 
Current fees are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 79.
Increases in fees will be in line with 
the median fee levels of comparable 
companies within the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) and the 
FTSE All Share Technology Sector.
N/A
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the 
appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following 
the same principles as for the executive directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table. 
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and will 
have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made 
on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but 
there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. 
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of  
the ongoing remuneration of the employee. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following year’s Annual Report  
on Remuneration.

The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
Element Policy
Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors including 
market practice, the individual’s experience and responsibilities and other pay 
structures within Laird and will be consistent with the salary policy for existing 
executive directors.
The executive director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with Laird’s 
benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension An executive director will be able to receive either a contribution to a personal 
pension scheme or cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with Laird’s 
policy as set out in the remuneration policy table. 
Annual bonus An executive director will be eligible to participate in the Annual Performance 
Incentive Scheme as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable in the 
remuneration policy table at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion.
Long-term incentives An executive director will be eligible to participate in the Laird PLC 2013 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under scheme 
rules at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion.
Maximum variable remuneration The maximum annual variable remuneration that an executive director can receive 
is normally limited to 300% of salary (annual incentive scheme and nil cost awards 
and market value awards under the LTIP). In exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment or promotion, an additional 100% of base salary may be awarded as 
market-value options under the 2013 LTIP (see policy table).
Share buy-outs/replacement awards The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall 
they are no more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards 
due to be forfeited. 
Any previous outstanding share awards which the executive holds will be valued 
using a recognised valuation methodology by an independent party and share 
awards that are of broadly equivalent economic value may be awarded in Laird 
shares.
To ensure effective retention of the executive upon recruitment, the new award will 
be subject to performance measures and vesting will be a new three year period. 
Relocation policies In instances where the new executive is relocated from one work location to 
another, the Company will provide compensation to reflect the cost of relocation 
for the executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away 
from their country of domicile in accordance with its normal relocation package  
for employees.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis but  
will take into consideration any cost of living differences; housing allowance;  
and schooling in accordance with the Company’s normal relocation package  
for employees.

Service contracts and payment for loss of office 
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. Notice periods 
will not be greater than 12 months. 
Director
Date of contract/ 
letter of appointment Unexpired term
Notice period by

Sir Christopher Hum 4 December 2006 Rolling (with no fixed expiry date) N/A
Professor Michael Kelly 21 June 2006 Rolling (with no fixed expiry date) N/A
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review 
after an initial three year term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the 
Company whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee 
reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of an executive director’s office or employment.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Company’s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of 
executive directors and any discretion available to the Committee. 
Element Approach Committee discretion
Base salary benefits  
and pension
There will be no compensation for normal resignation or in the 
event of termination by the Company due to misconduct. 
In other circumstances, executive directors will be entitled to 
receive payment in lieu of notice.
Payment in lieu of notice to David Lockwood will be equivalent 
to the salary payments that he would have received if still 
employed by the Company for a maximum of a 12 month 
period. This is payable in a lump sum or in instalments which 
would be subject to mitigation.
Payment in lieu of notice to Jonathan Silver will be equivalent to 
the salary payments and benefits and pension provisions that 
he would have received if still employed by the Company for a 
maximum of a 12 month period. 
The terms and conditions of Jonathan Silver’s service contract 
require an additional guaranteed payment of 25% of base 
salary in lieu of bonus for the period of notice where notice is 
served by the Company. This is an historic contractual provision 
agreed prior to 27 June 2012 and is not part of the Committee’s 
ongoing policy (see recruitment policy).

Element Approach Committee discretion
Annual bonus Where an executive director’s employment is terminated after 
the end of a performance year but before the payment is 
made, the executive may be eligible for an annual incentive 
award for that performance year subject to an assessment 
based on performance achieved over the period. No award will 
be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated during 
a performance year, a pro-rata annual incentive award for the 
period worked in that performance year may be payable at 
the Committee’s discretion subject to an assessment based 
on performance achieved over the period and provided the 
individual is a “good leaver”. 
The good leaver definition is the same as for the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan set out below.
The Committee has discretion to determine whether 
an individual is a good leaver and therefore whether 
a pro-rated bonus will be payable for the year of 
cessation.
Long-term incentive The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards 
is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as 
approved by shareholders.
Laird PLC 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
On termination of employment before the expiry of the 
performance period, all unvested awards will lapse, unless the 
following circumstances apply:
 – death;
 – ill-health, injury or disability;
 – retirement;
 – the company employing the participant ceasing to be a 
member of the Group;
 – transfer of the business or part of the business to which  
the participant’s employment relates to a person who is  
not a member of the Group; or 
 – any other reason and the Committee in its discretion  
so permits.
If an individual leaves under a circumstance described above, 
the performance period will be deemed to have ended on the 
date of cessation and the number of shares will be pro-rated to 
reflect time period and performance to cessation. 
Laird PLC 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Committee has absolute discretion to 
determine at grant what the vesting date should 
be and also to determine that the reason for 
termination is classified in a manner described in the 
previous column.
The Committee also has discretion to waive 
any performance measures or other conditions 
associated with the award, and to determine that 
the award is capable of vesting in full without pro-
rating for performance and time.
It should be noted that it is the Committee’s policy 
only to apply such discretions if the circumstances at 
the time are, in its opinion, sufficiently exceptional, 
and to provide a full explanation to shareholders 
where discretion is exercised.
Further the Committee does not currently intend to 
waive any performance conditions and its normal 
practice will be to pro-rate for performance and time. 
Laird PLC 2003 Executive Share Option Plan
On termination of employment before the performance 
measurement date, all unvested awards will lapse, unless the 
following circumstances apply:
 – death;
 – ill-health, injury or disability;
 – retirement;
 – the company employing the participant ceasing to be a 
member of the Group;
 – transfer of the business or part of the business to which the 
participant’s employment relates to a person who is not a 
member of the Group; or 
 – any other reason and the Committee in its discretion so 
permits.
If an individual leaves under a circumstance described above, 
the performance period will be deemed to have ended on the 
date of cessation and the number of shares will be pro-rated 
to reflect performance to cessation.

Element Approach Committee discretion
Laird PLC 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan
On termination of employment before the performance 
measurement date, all unvested awards will lapse, unless the 
following circumstances apply:
 – death;
 – ill-health, injury or disability;
 – redundancy; 
 – retirement (with the agreement of the Company);
 – the company employing the participant ceasing to be a 
member of the Group; 
 – transfer of the business or part of the business to which the 
participant’s employment relates to a person who is not a 
member of the Group; or 
 – any reason, permitted by the Committee in its absolute 
discretion in any particular case except where termination 
is for dishonesty, fraud, misconduct or other circumstances 
justifying summary dismissal.
If an individual leaves under a circumstance described above, 
the executive will continue to hold the award which will vest 
on the normal vesting date based on the achievement of 
performance targets. The award will be pro-rated to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period which has elapsed at the 
time of cessation. 
Laird PLC 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Committee has absolute discretion to 
determine that the reason for termination is 
classified in a manner described in the previous 
column.
The Committee can determine that the number of 
shares that vest is a higher or lower number than 
calculated, provided that this number does not 
exceed the total number of shares subject to the 
award.
The Committee has the discretion to determine 
that the end of the performance period is the 
date of cessation, whether and to what extent 
the performance measures have been satisfied or 
waived, whether to pro-rate the number of vested 
shares to reflect the performance period completed 
and whether to accelerate the vesting date to 
the date on which the Committee makes its final 
determination of the number of shares which vest. 
It should be noted that it is the Committee’s policy 
only to apply its discretion if the circumstances at 
the time are, in its opinion, sufficiently exceptional, 
and to provide a full explanation to shareholders 
where discretion is exercised.
Further the Committee does not currently intend to 
waive any performance conditions and its normal 
practice will be to pro-rate for time.
Change of control The treatment of long-term incentive awards is governed 
by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved by 
shareholders.
Laird PLC 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary 
winding-up of the Company, awards may be exercised for a 
limited period following the relevant event.
The performance period will be deemed to have ended on 
the date of the relevant event and awards will be pro-rated to 
reflect the time period and performance up to the date of the 
relevant event.
 
 
Laird PLC 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In exceptional circumstances only, the Committee 
may consider whether to disapply full pro-rating for 
time and performance. It is the Committee’s policy 
in normal circumstances to measure performance 
at the date of the relevant event and pro-rate the 
number of shares to the amount of the performance 
period completed on the occurrence of the event.
Laird PLC 2003 Executive Share Option Plan
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary 
winding-up of the Company, awards may be exercised for a 
limited period following the relevant event.
Laird PLC 2003 Executive Share Option Plan
The Committee has discretion, where it deems it 
impracticable for the performance period to end on 
the date of the relevant event, to determine that the 
performance period should end on an earlier date.
The performance period will be deemed to have ended on 
the date of the relevant event and awards will be pro-rated to 
reflect the performance up to the date of the relevant event.
In exceptional circumstances only, the Committee 
may consider whether to disapply full pro-rating for

 – to determine that an award should vest or 
become exercisable on a date earlier than the 
date of the relevant event; and
 – if the Committee considers that a transaction 
such as a demerger or delisting might affect 
the current or future value of an award, to allow 
awards to vest or become exercisable for a period.
In exceptional circumstances only, the Committee 
may consider whether to disapply full pro-rating for

100% and 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and Chief Finanacial Officer respectively for market value options and 100% of salary nil-cost awards for both 
executive directors.

A level of 62.5% vesting for ‘on-target’ performance reflects the mid-point of the performance range.

Market Value Options are valued with the same model that is used to determine the share-based compensation cost included in the Company’s consolidated statement  
of income. 
5 
In accordance with the Regulations, no allowance has been made for share price appreciation.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company in developing policy
In setting the remuneration policy for directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird are taken into account, including 
any base salary increases awarded. The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level  
tiers below the executive directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company.  
No comparison metrics were used.
However, with 80% of employees in Asia, 13% of employees in North America and 7% in Europe, only broad trends are considered. 
In 2013 salary increases for management level employees ranged from zero to 20% depending on several factors, including the 
region where they work and individual performance. Although the Remuneration Committee takes into account the pay and 
conditions of other employees, the Company did not consult with employees when drawing up the policy report.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy 
and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee commits to 
consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its remuneration policy.
At last year’s AGM, the Company received approval for the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan which received a vote in favour from 
shareholders of 98.15%. In December 2012, the Company wrote to its key shareholders as well as shareholder advisory bodies 
setting out the main terms of the new share plan and the Committee carefully considered all the responses received in determining 
the final terms.

The value of long-term incentives is calculated using the closing mid-market share price on the later of the date the performance conditions are met or the minimum period 
for holding is met. On 19.4.13, 211,551 LTIPs (nil-cost awards) awarded on 19.4.10 met their performance condition (81.85% of the original award). The relevant share price 
was 201.6p, giving a value of £426,486.81. On 2.8.13, 90,429 market-value share options awarded on 2.8.10, with an exercise price of 124.9p, became exercisable (67 .2% of 
the original award). The share price on 2.8.13 was 204.0p giving a net value of £71,529.34.

Executive Chairman between 26 November 2011 and 13 August 2012. Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act 
as Chairman of the Company. Nigel Keen also acts as Chairman of the trustees of a Laird pension scheme for which he receives no additional remuneration. Nigel Keen’s fees 
for his services, for which he must account to Imperialise Limited, are £190,000 p.a. Following the resignation of the Chief Executive due to ill health on 25 November 2011, 
Nigel Keen acted as Executive Chairman and his fees were increased to a rate of £609,000 p.a. for a temporary period until David Lockwood was appointed Chief Executive. 
Imperialise is responsible for Nigel Keen’s National Insurance (“NI”) and was paid a sum equivalent to the NI on those fees of £26,220 (2012: £62,155), for which it accounts 
to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) whereas for the other non-executive directors, who are paid through Laird’s payroll, NI is paid directly to HMRC.

Outcome of the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme for the year ended 31 December 2013
In determining the awards for 2013, the Committee took into account that Laird’s share price rose 31 % versus the FTSE All 
Share which rose by only 14% during the year; and the Company had made excellent progress on implementing a strategic 
planning process aimed at driving the business objectives over a three year period. The performance targets, actual performance 
achievement and resulting bonus payments are summarised below. No part of the bonus was deferred.

20 Eight strategic objectives were set for 
the year. These included introducing a 
focused Group KPI for new product 
introduction; taking appropriate 
measures to stabilise the effects of 
increases in direct costs in China; 
health, safety and environmental 
targets; embedding acquisitions and 
exploiting synergies within the 
businesses to drive organic growth. 
The other strategic objectives are 
considered commercially sensitive.
0% of salary is payable for achieving 
none of the targets and 20% is 
payable for achieving all the targets.
Six of the strategic 
objectives were 
achieved; one was 
partially achieved 
and one was not 
met. The objective 
which was not met 
was the 
improvement in 
health and safety 
targets. The number 
of minor injuries 
was slightly worse 
than in 2012 and 
the reportable 
injuries were the 
same.

Details of performance measures are as set out below:
Nil-cost awards will vest based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance, on a ranked basis relative to the 
FTSE 250 (excluding companies in the financial service sector and investment trusts) measured over a three year period as follows:

In addition, a nil-cost award will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance. 
Market value options will vest based on the average annual growth in the Company’s Earnings Per Share over a three year period  
in line with the following performance schedule:
Average annual growth in  
continuing earnings per share
Level of market value option vesting
13 % p.a.
Between 8% p.a. and 13 % p.a.
8% p.a.
Full vesting
Pro-rata between 25 % and full vesting
Threshold 25 % vesting
Earnings per share is calculated with reference to underlying earnings per share before exceptional items, the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses, the 
impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments and acquisition transaction costs as stated in the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Payments to past directors
No payments to past directors were made during the year, other than regular pension payments under the unfunded retirement 
benefits scheme (UURB) to former directors, as previously disclosed.
Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office were made during the year.
Outside appointments
The Board believes that there can be significant benefits, to both the Company and the individual, from executive directors 
accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside the Group. The Board takes into account the likely time commitment for 
such appointments prior to approving them. During the year, Jonathan Silver was entitled to retain fees of £23,000 from INVESCO 
Income Growth Trust plc.

The original award of 258,462 shares met 81.85% of the performance condition and therefore 211,551 shares vested on 19.4.13. On 9.5.13, 91,551 shares were sold at 203p 
and the balance was retained.
Dilution limits
The Company operates its share schemes within the Association of British Insurers (ABI) Guidelines on dilution. No share award may 
be granted if, as a result, the aggregate number of shares issued or transferred from treasury during the previous ten years under 
all employee share schemes established by the Company would exceed ten per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company on that date or, in the case of all discretionary employee share schemes, five per cent.
The Company took the opportunity with the new long-term incentive plan introduced in 2013 to reduce the latter dilution figure  
to five per cent from ten per cent under the previous schemes which expired during the year.

Performance graph and table
The graph below shows the Company’s performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return (TSR), compared with the performance 
of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE All Share Technology Hardware & Equipment Sector. The Company

base and business activities.

Percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration
Laird is a global company with fewer than 50 UK employees and four of its most senior executives are not UK employees. Due to the 
multinational nature of the Company’s workforce and the fact that 80% of employees are based in Asia, the pay structure operated 
in respect of the vast majority of its employees is significantly different from that applicable to the Chief Executive, who is UK-
based. Therefore, the Committee’s view is that the most meaningful comparison of the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s 
remuneration is considered to be the eleven senior executives below Board level. Seven of these are US employees, three are British 
and one is Swedish. The table below compares the percentage increase in the Chief Executive’s pay (including salary and fees, 
taxable benefits and annual bonus) with that of the chosen comparator group.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy for 2014 
Executive directors
The remuneration policy and its implementation for the forthcoming financial year is summarised below:
Salary
The salaries for the executive directors, which were last increased with effect from 1 July 2013, are £450,000 p.a. for the Chief 
Executive and £345,000 p.a. for the Chief Financial Officer. The salaries of the executive directors will be reviewed as at 1 July 2014. 
When reviewing those salaries, the Committee will take into account the employment conditions and salary increases awarded to 
employees throughout the Company, which will be determined in April 2014 and the levels of base salary for similar positions with 
comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the salary levels of 
those comparable companies within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE All Share Technology Hardware & 
Equipment Sector.
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme 2014
Details of the maximum and target bonus potentials along with the performance measures and their respective weightings for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 for both executive directors are set out below:
Bonus opportunity Performance measure weighting (% award)
Target ( % of salary) Maximum ( % of salary) Underlying profit before tax Working capital metrics Strategic objectives
65% 100% 70% 10% 20%
An additional 10% of salary may be payable if the underlying PBT for 2014 is 110% of the target. However, if this stretch target is 
achieved, and the working capital metrics and strategic objectives are achieved in full, the overall maximum that can be awarded 
cannot exceed 100% of base salary.
The main change to the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in 2014 is the removal of the 25% weighting for exceptional 
performance. The Committee considers disclosing precise targets of profit, working capital and strategic objectives, which are 
commercially sensitive, for the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual

targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods where possible without 
compromising confidential matters so that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.

The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided,  
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Role of the Committee and activities
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for executive directors and the senior 
management and for setting the remuneration packages for each executive director. The Committee also has oversight of  
the remuneration policy and packages for other senior members of staff.
Directors’ remuneration report continued

The written Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company on request.
The Committee held six meetings during the year. Its activities during 2013 included approving the 2012 Annual Performance 
bonus; approving the framework for the 2013 Annual Performance Incentive scheme; determining if performance conditions for 
LTIPs and Options had been met; reviewing the Committee’s Terms of Reference; approving the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for approval by the Board; reviewing the base salaries of the executive directors and other senior executives; finalising the terms for 
the new share scheme to be put to shareholders at the AGM; agreeing market-value and nil-cost option awards for the executive 
directors and conditional awards for other senior executives following approval of the new share plan at the AGM; and reviewing 
Shareholder Guidelines on Remuneration. One of the meetings was an ad hoc meeting which was held to discuss and approve the 
treatment of a leaver under the rules of the share schemes.
Advisors to the Committee
In September 2013, a competitive tender overseen by the Chairman of the Committee with input from the Chief Executive, 
Chairman of the Board and the Company Secretary was conducted. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) replaced Deloitte LLP as 
independent advisors to the Committee. Both PwC and Deloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as 
such, voluntarily operate under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. On this basis, the 
Committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.
PwC also provided the Company with tax advisory work and Deloitte provided internal audit services to Laird PLC during the year. 
The Committee reviewed the nature of the services provided and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the 
provision of these services. 
The Committee also sought the views of the Chief Executive, David Lockwood, during the year. The Chief Executive is given notice of 
all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends part of the meetings. The Chief Executive may request 
that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general 
policy matters and matters concerning the other executive director and employees. 
The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £32,500. Fees paid to Deloitte in 2013 
were £69,300 which included work on the new long-term incentive plan approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM. Fees were 
determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.

The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditor’s statement of their responsibilities on pages 89 to 
91, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and the Auditor in relation  
to the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial 
statements on a going concern basis, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and 
then apply them consistently;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS as adopted by the EU is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 – state that the Group has complied with IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time, the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. They are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
(i)  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and result of the Group taken as a whole; 
(ii) the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and
(iii) the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p67-88_v15.indd   88 07/03/2014   19:27 89 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
We have audited the Group financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the Group income 
statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group statement of changes in equity, the Group statement of financial 
position, the Group cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 88, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Group financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
Group financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2013 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit;  
and directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
 – revenue recognition across the Group’s global operations including the risk of management override;
 – tax transfer pricing exposure relating to the Group’s key operational locations;
 – the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets; and
 – the classification of exceptional items
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our  
audit and on the Group financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the Group financial statements are free from  
material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the Group financial statements, would be changed or influenced. We also determine a level  
of performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
Independent auditor’ s report 
to the members of Laird PLC 
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p89-156_v6.indd   89 07/03/2014   19:37 90 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Independent auditor’s report continued
to the members of Laird PLC
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material 
for the financial statements as a whole. We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.3m, which is approximately 5 % (2012, 5 % ) of 
adjusted profit before tax, and below 1 % (2012, 1 % ) of equity. We used adjusted pre-tax profits excluding exceptional costs. This provided 
a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall 
performance materiality for the Group should be 75 % of materiality, namely £1.7m. Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure  
that total detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our materiality of £2.3m for the financial statements as whole. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all adjusted and unadjusted audit differences in excess 
of £1 15,000 (2012, £120,000). We also agreed to report differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we selected 16 components which 
represent the principal business units within the Group’s two reportable segments and account for 75 % (83 % ) of the Group’s revenue and 
68% (68% ) of the Group’s profit before tax. Five of these components were subject to a full audit, eight were subject to audits of specific 
account balances and three were subject to review procedures. For the remaining components, we performed other procedures to confirm 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
The audit work at the components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which was lower than 
Group materiality.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
or his designate visits each of the five full scope locations at least once a year. This year, the Group audit team visited all five of the full scope 
locations in the USA, Czech Republic and China. For all full scope entities in addition to the location visit, the Group audit team reviewed key 
working papers and participated in the component team’s planning including the component team’s discussion of fraud and error.
Our response to the risks of material misstatement included the following procedures:
 – we performed testing around the timing of revenue recognition, reviewed a sample of new sales agreements to understand the 
contractual terms and checked these were reported appropriately, as well as assessing whether the revenue recognition policies adopted 
complied with IFRS. We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to identify and test the risk of fraud arising 
from management override of controls; 
 – we challenged the status of the Group’s applications for transfer pricing agreements between its key locations and the accounting 
implications for the financial statements, as well as assessing the tax disclosures for compliance with IFRS;
 – we challenged management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, including specifically the 
growth rates, discount rates, perpetuity rates, cash flow projections and sensitivities used; and
 – we assessed the Group’s material exceptional items to check that these items met the definition of exceptional as specified by IFRS,  
as well as reviewing the related exceptional items disclosures.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements; and
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
016933_LAIRD_AR_13_p89-156_v7.indd   90 11/03/2014   18:08 91 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group financial statements; or 
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or 
 – is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 – returns adequate for our audit have not been received from sites not visited by us, or
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and return, or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 66, in relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 and on  
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 
2014 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Board’s behalf by D C Lockwood and J C Silver. Laird PLC is a public limited 
company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use  
in the European Union (IFRS) and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2. 
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have 
been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions. The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all 
values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during 
the reporting periods. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or 
actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the measurement of defined benefit pension 
assets and obligations and the measurement of income and deferred taxes. The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an 
annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. 
This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate (see note 1 7). Measurement of defined benefit pension 
obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates and the selection of a suitable discount 
rate (see note 35). The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgements are applied in deciding the level of 
provisions for income taxes. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to 
provisions held in the period the determination is made. 
The directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. The directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings (‘the Group’). The financial statements of the subsidiaries are 
prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate. Intra-group balances and 
transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group 
ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group. 
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly attributable to the combination were capitalised. The identifiable assets and liabilities 
of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised 
as goodwill.

2 Accounting policies continued
Currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency. The functional currency is the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency of the Group is Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets  
and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using weighted average rates of 
exchange for the period. Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas 
subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as 
movements in equity. All other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. On disposal of a foreign 
operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the 
income statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net 
invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue  
can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Retirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position 
and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and 
interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, 
which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior periods 
(to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. The assets of defined benefit plans are 
recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate 
bond rate. 
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit 
available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
The Group applied IAS 19 (Revised 201 1) retrospectively in the current period in accordance with the transitional provisions set out in the 
revised standard. IAS 19 (Revised 201 1) changes, amongst other things, the accounting for defined benefit plans. 
The interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a net-interest amount under 
IAS 19 (Revised 201 1), which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset at the start of each  
annual reporting period.
IAS 19 (Revised 201 1) also requires more extensive disclosures. These have been provided in note 35.
IAS 19 (Revised 201 1) has been applied retrospectively, with following permitted exceptions: 
The carrying amounts of other assets have not been adjusted for changes in employee benefit costs that were included before 
1 January 2012.
Sensitivity disclosures for the defined benefit obligation for comparative period (year ended 31 December 2012) have not been provided.

Share based payments
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) shares awarded 
is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the LTIP , MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. The fair value of share options granted is 
estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
share options were granted. Non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the 
fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for 
grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or 
settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from 
goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives. Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as 
intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and 
technological feasibility, have been met. Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the 
product launch date, which is typically around four years. Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally 
generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication  
of impairment arise. Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration 
given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

2 Accounting policies continued
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on  
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 – where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
 – deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is 
recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability  
of the Company.
Interest
Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated  
on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years or less
Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less
Computer equipment 5 years or less
Motor vehicles 4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.

Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. This is determined 
for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups 
of assets. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income 
statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease. 
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value. Each asset is depreciated 
over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect 
of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables. The interest element of the rental 
obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting
Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker to 
assess the performance of each segment.
Exceptional items
These items are presented within the relevant income statement category. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a 
better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which are considered to be material and one-off in nature, and 
therefore may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional, include the restructuring of businesses, the transaction costs of acquiring 
new businesses, gains or losses on the reassessment of estimated contingent consideration on acquired businesses, the integration of new 
businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets 
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are recognised on the 
trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for 
impairment. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying 
amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as 
irrecoverable. Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are 
recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments. These assets are carried  
in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:
 – the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
 – the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the asset.

2 Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being 
taken through the income statement.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses 
arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance 
expense. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated 
with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the 
fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity 
profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. In accordance  
with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 these are Level 2 derivative financial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the 
hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured 
throughout its duration. Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective, and periodically throughout 
their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Cash flow hedges
These are used to hedge potential changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion 
of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit 
or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when 
a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement 
or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount  
is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges
These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign operations. The portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective 
portion recognised in the income statement. 
Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is 
required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price. 
As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group reassessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as 
non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are 
provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined. Fair value hierarchy is provided in 
note 28.

Treasury shares
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’) are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘treasury shares’ 
and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on  
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three 
months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable 
costs and certain overhead expenses (principally administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions
These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money 
is material.

13 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year divided by the daily average of the number of 
shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the same profit but with the number of shares increased to reflect 
the daily average effect of relevant share options granted but not yet exercised where performance conditions have been met and shares 
contingently issuable.

17 Intangible assets continued
Capitalised development costs
Internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure in 2013 typically have a finite expected 
useful life of around four years. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis. All amortisation charges for the 
year have been charged against operating profits. The total amount of research and development activity incurred during 2013 is £47 .6m 
(2012, £37 .4m) of which £1 1.6m (2012, £8.5m) was capitalised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36. No impairment to goodwill 
was identified.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units (CGUs):
 – Performance Materials division
 – Wireless Systems division 
Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of £237 .4m at the year end (2012, £227 .6m). Wireless Systems had a goodwill balance of 
£187 .7m at the year end (2012, £190.7m). All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
The key assumptions were:
 – a pre-tax discount rate of 1 1.6 % (2012, 1 1.6 % ). 
 – revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge. 
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2014 to perpetuity. 
The forecast cash flows for 2014 and 201 5 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2014 budget. 
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 2016–2018, have been based on external market estimates for PCs, tablets, 
smartphones, transportation and telecoms but after reflecting management’s views of average selling prices, product penetration trends 
and their impact on the size of the addressable market. Cash flows for 2018 onwards for both divisions have been increased by 3 % per 
annum (2012, 3 % per annum).
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying value of 
the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required. Performance Materials has the greatest amount of headroom and 
Wireless Systems the least. Revenues would have to be some 15 % less than forecast for each period before some form of impairment  
would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets
Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. 
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets:
Brand names – 5 years 
Trade secrets – 8 to 15 years 
Trade marks and names – 5 to 15 years 
Patents – the remaining duration of the 1 7-year legal right 
Licence – the remaining duration of the 20-year legal right 
Customer relationships – 10 to 20 years
The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer 
to continue business with the Group for any finite period. Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an 
indefinite life.

Acquisition of businesses in 2013
On 12 February 2013, Nextreme Thermal Solutions Inc., a US based developer of thin-film thermoelectric technologies, was acquired for 
a total consideration of £12.2m which included estimated contingent consideration payable of £12.0m if certain revenue targets are met 
over a four year period from 2014 onwards. The maximum contingent consideration payable is £38.3m ($60m) if £95.8m ($150m) of 
revenue is achieved. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair 
values. The fair values are provisional. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.

The Group has acquired a 100% interest in the acquisition noted above. Revenue for the entity acquired was £0.2m following acquisition. 
Loss before tax, on both an underlying and an IFRS basis, was £(1.7)m following acquisition. If the acquisition had been held for the full 
year, revenues would have been unchanged at £537 .0m and the profit before tax would have been £0.5m lower at £42.7m. Included in the 
£12.4m of goodwill recognised above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature, 
including the expected value of synergies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
The estimate of contingent consideration has been reduced to £6.9m as at 31 December 2013 after a reassessment of likely revenues 
over the four year measurement period from 2014 onwards. The reduction in estimated contingent consideration of £4.7m (at an average 
exchange rate against the US Dollar) has been credited to the income statement.

Acquisition of businesses in 2012
On 1 March 2012, Summit Data Communications Inc, a designer and supplier of wireless modules which provide secure and reliable wireless 
connectivity in industrial and medical markets, was acquired for a total consideration of £14.0m. On acquisition there was maximum 
potential contingent consideration of £5. 1m. As at the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration has been estimated 
at £nil. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.

Notes
(a) There are no borrowings secured on the assets of subsidiary undertakings (2012, £nil). 
(b)  US Private Placement loans, arising from private placements of debt with US insurance companies, comprise $140m (2012, $140m) 
repayable between 2014 and 2016 at an average fixed rate of interest of 5.64 %.
(c)  The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £235m which were underwritten in excess of two years. Drawings by 
Group companies under these facilities were £76.4m (2012, £89.3m). Although these drawings are repayable within one year they are 
classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities. 
(d)  Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility, using the effective 
interest rate method.

Deferred tax assets have been established in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will 
be recovered.
Unrecognised tax losses
Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of £1 7 .5m (2012, £1 7 .5m) where it is unlikely that future relief would be 
available at the balance sheet date. Of these losses, £2.8m (2012, £4.2m) have expiry dates between 2014 and 2024 and £14.7m (2012, 
£13.3m) are available indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been established on capital losses of £5.4m (2012, £6.0m) where it is unlikely 
that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary 
differences of £30.6m (2012, £24.5m) where their use is restricted indefinitely. 
Temporary differences associated with Group investments
Deferred tax of £1.3m (2012, £1.3m) has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is likely there will be 
income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends. No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences 
of £16.9m (2012, £21.5m) relating to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal 
of these temporary differences and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 
2013 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result  
in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. 
Factors affecting future tax charges
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21 % effective 1 April 2014 and 20% effective 1 April 2015. Disclosure of deferred tax has been 
adjusted to reflect the enactment of the revised rates but with no significant impact on these financial statements. These changes had been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are included in these financial statements.

Warranty claims are in respect of potential liabilities arising from the disposal of businesses.
Other provisions consist primarily of amounts provided in respect of events arising from trade and various other provisions that do not fit into 
distinct categories. The timing of cash outflows for warranty claims and other provisions are by their nature uncertain and dependent upon 
the outcome of related events. The best estimates are shown in the table above.

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures. The forward contracts have a principal value 
of £105.0m (2012, £70.0m) and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi. These contracts have not been designated 
as cash flow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2013 of £1.3m (2012, £0.4m decrease) has been taken to the income statement. 
These are Level 2 derivative financial instruments and there has been no movement between levels during the year.

Contingent consideration 
The consideration to acquire Nextreme Thermal Solutions Inc. (see note 18) included estimated contingent consideration of £12.0m based 
on future revenue targets being met.

Initial fair value of the contingent consideration on acquisition 12.0
Fair value adjustment (note 7) (4.7)
Exchange adjustment (0.4)
Non-current liability for contingent consideration as at 31 December 2013 6.9
The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are revenue projections for Nextreme from 2014 to 201 7 , a potential earnout payment 
based on a multiple of 0.4 times revenue and a discount rate applied as at 31 December 2013 being a 4.5 year UK government bond yield.
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, an increase of 10% in revenue projections would 
result in an increase in contingent consideration of £0.7m and a decrease of 1 % in the discount rate would result in an increase in contingent 
consideration of £0.2m.
This liability for contingent consideration is a Level 3 derivative financial instrument under IFRS 7 .
Interest rate and currency profile
The Group’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps and similar 
instruments are used to manage interest costs. At 31 December 2013 approximately 52% of debt is at fixed rate. This position is reviewed on 
a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax 
(through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity. The interest rates considered are Sterling, Euro 
and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised  
at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.

Credit risk
The Group’s customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with 
customers who themselves have significant market shares. Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material 
in the overall Group context. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the subsidiary. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi. The Group policy is to match  
out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other 
variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency 
contracts) and the Group’s equity (due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges).

Net investment hedging
Included in borrowings are US $200.8m (£121.3m) and EUR €34.5m (£28.7m) of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the 
net investments in the US and Europe subsidiaries. This is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on these 
investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation  
of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over and above its day-to-day 
borrowing requirements. 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows:

Loan covenants
The principal covenants in the Group’s committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net borrowings are 
based on UK GAAP and are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (‘EBITA ’) to be not less than 3.0 times 
interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA ’).
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2013.
Fair value of financial instruments
The US Private Placement loans with a book value of £84.5m (2012, £86. 1m) have an estimated fair value of £88.8m (2012, £93.4m) which 
has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2013.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

30 Share based payments
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 87 , sets out the general terms and conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), 
the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan and the vesting requirements for the 2012 LTIP and share 
option grants. 
Performance conditions for awards made in 2011 under the LTIP and Option Plan 
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 201 1 would vest: achievement of a TSR target and an underlying 
EPS target. For LTIP awards made in 201 1, 75 % is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25 % is based on achievement of the EPS 
target. For awards under the Option Plan, 75 % is based on EPS and 25 % on TSR. The EPS and TSR conditions are as follows:
TSR condition
For 201 1, a list of 20 companies was selected as the comparator group to be used for these purposes:
Ampenol Invensys Sanmina TT Electronics
AVX Meggitt Senior TTM Technologies
Bodycote Molex Smiths Group Ultra Electronics
CSR Morgan Crucible Spectris Vishay Intertechnology
E2V Technologies Oxford Instruments Spirent Communications Wolfson Microelectronics
The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award (75 % of the award under the LTIP; 25 % of the award under the Option Plan) is 
dependent on Laird’s relative TSR performance over three years against this group of companies, as follows:
Total shareholder return 
performance level
Amount of award vesting for TSR measure
%
Upper quartile
Median to upper quartile
Below median
Full vesting
Pro-rata between 30% and full vesting
Nil
EPS condition
The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award (75 % of the award under the Option Plan; 25 % of the award under the LTIP) is 
dependent on Laird’s EPS performance for the 2013 financial year, as follows:
Level of vesting in 2014 for EPS Measure Applicable performance target:
2013 earnings per share (EPS)
Threshold 30% vesting
Full vesting
18.3p
22.4p
There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between 18.3p and 22.4p.
The performance conditions for these awards have been measured, for details of the outcome please see page 83, the Directors’ 
Remunerations Report.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2012 under the LTIP and Option Plan 
Performance conditions are measured over a single three-year period and there is no provision for re-testing therefore the awards lapse  
if the performance targets are not met.
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 2012 would vest: achievement of a total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) target and an underlying earnings per share (‘EPS’) target. For LTIP awards made in 2012, 75 % is based on achievement of the 
TSR target and 25 % is based on achievement of the EPS target. For awards under the Option Plan, 75 % is based on EPS and 25 % on TSR. 
The EPS and TSR conditions are set out below.

average annual growth in continuing earnings 
per share
Threshold 30% vesting
Full vesting
RPI + 5 % p.a
RPI + 10% p.a
There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between the above two targets.
Shares awarded under the Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP) vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, 
provided the employee is still employed by the Group. There are vesting conditions attached to the MTIP awards which specify profit and EPS 
targets for the years to December 2012 and 2013. 
Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, provided 
the employee is still employed by the Group. 
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.4m was recognised in the year (2012, £1.6m) before employer’s national 
insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and the share options granted.

The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market performance conditions set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
The weighted average fair value (in pence) of LTIP , MTIP , RSP and share options granted during the year was as follows:

The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. 
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. Expected volatility 
reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome. 
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
31 Reserves
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. 
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
Treasury shares
The investment in Laird shares as held by the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’), as described below, are treated as treasury 
shares for accounting purposes. 
The Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’)
The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC for the benefit of current and former employees. These shares may be used to satisfy 
options and awards. The Trust, which is financed by a loan of £4.4m from the Company, held 1,242,253 ordinary shares at 31 December 
2013 (2012, 2, 197 ,410) . Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustee,  
in accordance with its fiduciary duties. The shares held by the Trust had a total market value at that date of £3.4m (2012, £4.5m).

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
29 employees (2012, 31) are members of four different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 (2012, 1,600) 
deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were £0.3m (2012, £0.3m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2013, at their market value, is estimated at £103.3m (2012, £102.7m) and 
the liabilities estimated at £104.4m (201 1, £100.5m). 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on 
the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions. 
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is £3.7m (2012, £1.5m liability). 
Description of the schemes 
UK 
In the UK the Group supports the Laird Pension Scheme which is a funded arrangement providing defined benefits on a final salary basis. 
The Group also operates an unapproved arrangement which provides unfunded defined benefits on a final salary basis to certain members 
who were previously subject to the HMRC pension schemes earnings cap. Both of the UK arrangements are closed to new entrants. 
The Laird Pension Scheme makes up approximately 96 % of the defined benefit liabilities of the Group. 
The Laird Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the trustee on behalf of the members in 
accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The scheme is subject to the scheme-specific funding 
requirements as outlined in UK legislation. The most recent scheme specific funding valuation was at 1 January 2012. 
The Laird Pension Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest 25 % in return-seeking assets and 75 % in bonds and annuities. This strategy 
reflects the scheme’s liability profile whilst aiming to minimise long-term costs by maximising return. The scheme’s assets are held separately 
from those of the Group. 
Belgium 
In Belgium the Group operates the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan which is a funded, insured lump sum defined benefit scheme and the 
Emerson and Cuming Pre-Pension Plan which is an unfunded plan where the employer pays a monthly indemnity until the retirement date 
on top of the unemployment allowances paid by the social security. 
Germany 
In Germany the Group operates the Cattron-Theimeg Europe GmbH & Co. KG Pension Plan. This is a funded defined benefit scheme 
currently providing pension benefits to seven pensioners (2012, seven).
Sweden
Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta. 
This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Group’s proportional 
share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme. Consequently, 
Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Group’s proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme. As a result the 
scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the non UK plans reflect their local environments. IAS 19 requires  
that the discount rate is set according to the level of market yields on either corporate or government bonds in the relevant markets.

* Reclassified during the year
As a result of the introduction of IAS 19 (201 1), the expected return on assets is based on the discount rate and not the return on the 
underlying portfolio of investments.
The mortality assumption used at the 2013 year end (and 2012 year end) is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier for 
executives and directors and 1 10% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of birth. Allowance is made for improvements 
in line with CMI (201 1) projections with a 1.5 % p.a. long term trend from 2002. The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 
2013 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these 
mortality tables:
Other members Executive and director members
Age Males Females Males Females
65 22.1 24.3 23.8 26.0
65 in 15 years 23.6 26.1 25.4 27.7
For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation 
of 3.6 % p.a. (201 2, 3. 1 5 % ), salary increases of 4.6 %–5.6 % p.a. (201 2, 4. 1 5 %–5. 1 5 % ) and a discount rate for liabilities of 4.4 % p.a. (201 2, 4.4 % ).

During 2012 the Group acquired Microwave Materials Group NV, which has a defined benefit scheme in Belgium. The scheme has 24 
active members.
Expected cash flows 
Over the year to 31 December 2014 the Group is expected to contribute 32.3 % of pensionable salaries in respect of Ordinary Section 
members, 58.2% of pensionable salaries in respect of Director’s Section members and 53.3 % of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive 
Section members of the Laird Pension Scheme. In addition, the Group will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service 
premiums and other administration expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme. The Group is expected to make contributions of 
approximately £0. 1m to the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan and £0. 1m to the Swedish scheme insured with Alecta. 
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to the defined benefit schemes will be £0.3m in 2014.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 1 7 years.

Key risks
The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. Many of the 
assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be higher (or lower) than disclosed. 
In general, the risk to the Group is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution requirements are not 
borne out in practice and the cost to the Group is higher than expected. 
More specifically, some of the significant risks are detailed below: 
 – Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, whereas the schemes hold  
a mixture of investments; if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deficit. 
 – Inflation risk: The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. 
 – Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities. This will be only partially offset by  
an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes. 
Sensitivity analysis
The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the figures shown on the balance sheet. The table below shows the 
approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5 % Increase by £7.5m
Inflation
Decrease by 0.5 %
Increase by 0.5 %
Decrease by £6.0m
Increase by £6.5m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65
0.25 % reduction in the long term trend of  
1.5% to 1.25% Decrease by £1.0m
Methods and assumptions used in sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses shown above have been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using a consistent 
methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities. The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the nearest £0.5m. 
The sensitivity analyses to price inflation include the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inflation and Consumer Price Inflation, as well 
as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures (revaluation of deferred pensions and increases to pensions in payment). 
For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences between RPI/CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there 
are any caps or floors on the pension increases, in which case these have been applied.

The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the independent auditor set out on page 140, is made with 
a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditor in relation to the accounts.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company for the financial year.
The directors consider that in compiling the accounts on pages 141 to 152, which have been prepared on a going concern basis, the 
Company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and 
estimates and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the 
financial position of the Company which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company  
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. They are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate  
and financial information included on the Company’s website.

Independent auditor’ s report 
to the members of Laird PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the parent 
company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 139, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the parent company financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the parent company financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on the parent company financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The accounts of Laird PLC are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments and accounting for pensions under FRS 1 7 . 
This is in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. As consolidated financial information for financial instruments and financial 
risk management has been disclosed under IFRS 7 in the Group accounts, the parent is exempt from FRS 29 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. The disclosures in respect of the Company are included in the Group accounts. Pensions are disclosed in accordance with FRS 1 7 . 
The financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about the Group. The Company has 
taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ and has not produced a cash flow statement.
Profit and loss
As permitted by the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, principally as follows:
Computer equipment 5 years or less
Motor vehicles 4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or loss in the year. 
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or 
curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year. The expected return on the assets of the schemes during the year 
based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the year and the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes are included 
within other finance (charges)/income. Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the 
statement of recognised gains and losses in the year together with differences from changes in assumptions. The deficit on defined benefit 
pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as the pension liability. The accounts include pension schemes where 
the parent company is the principal employer.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability  
of the Company.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more 
tax subject to the following:
(a)   Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists  
at the balance sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
(b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there  
is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
(c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is 
regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are 
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

1 Accounting policies continued
Financial assets 
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money 
is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to 
recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. The Company assesses at 
each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and 
loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition is at 
amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and 
losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and 
finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated 
with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair 
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity 
profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and 
loss account. 
Share based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss account relates to equity 
settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) shares awarded 
is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the LTIP , MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. The fair value of share options granted is 
estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
share options were granted. Non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
For grants that ultimately do not vest, charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards where vesting 
is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, 
provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments  
that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a 
corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or 
settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.

10 Pension schemes
The Company operates two defined benefit schemes.
Five employees (2012, seven) are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,500 (2012, 1,500) 
deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were £0.2m (2012, £0.3m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2013 at their market value is estimated at £101.4m (2012, £100.9m)  
and the liabilities estimated at £100.4m (2012, £96.5m). 
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension liability under FRS 1 7 at 
31 December were as follows:

Present value of scheme liabilities (100.4) (96.5)
Funded status 1.0 4.4
Disallowed assets (7.4) (10.7)
Deficit in the schemes (6.4) (6.3)
The expected long-term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 3.4 % p.a. (2012, 3.3 % ) and those for equities at 7 .4 % p.a. (2012, 
7 .2% ). The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long-term real rates of return from the main 
asset classes. For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed. 
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long-term from 
a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the 2013 year end (and 2012 year end) is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier for 
executives and directors and 1 10% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of birth. Allowance is made for improvements 
in line with CMI (201 1) projections with a 1.5 % p.a. long-term trend from 2002. The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 
2013 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these 
mortality tables:
Other members Executive and director members
Age Males Females Males Females
65 22.1 24.3 23.8 26.0
65 in 15 years 23.6 26.1 25.4 27.7
For FRS 1 7 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation 
of 3.6 % p.a. (2012, 3. 15 % ), salary increases of 4.6 %–5.6 % p.a. (2012, 4. 15 %–5. 15 % ) and a discount rate for liabilities of 4.4 % p.a.  
(2012, 4.4 % ).

14 Share based payments
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 87 , sets out the general terms and conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), 
the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan and the vesting requirements for the 2012 LTIP and share 
option grants. 
Performance conditions for awards made in 2011 under the LTIP and Option Plan 
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 201 1 would vest: achievement of a TSR target and an underlying 
EPS target. For LTIP awards made in 201 1, 75 % is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25 % is based on achievement of the EPS 
target. For awards under the Option Plan, 75 % is based on EPS and 25 % on TSR. The EPS and TSR conditions are as follows:
TSR condition
For 201 1 a list of 20 companies was selected as the comparator group to be used for these purposes:
Ampenol Invensys Sanmina TT Electronics
AVX Meggitt Senior TTM Technologies
Bodycote Molex Smiths Group Ultra Electronics
CSR Morgan Crucible Spectris Vishay Intertechnology
E2V Technologies Oxford Instruments Spirent Communications Wolfson Microelectronics
The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award (75 % of the award under the LTIP; 25 % of the award under the Option Plan) is 
dependent on Laird’s relative TSR performance over three years against this group of companies, as follows:
Total shareholder return 
performance level
Amount of award vesting for TSR Measure 
%
Upper quartile 
Median to upper quartile 
Below median
Full vesting 
Pro rata between 30% and full vesting 
Nil
The performance conditions for these awards have been measured, for details of the outcome please see page 83, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
EPS condition
The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award (75 % of the award under the Option Plan; 25 % of the award under the LTIP) is 
dependent on Laird’s EPS performance for the 2013 financial year, as follows:
Level of vesting in 2014 for EPS measure Applicable performance target: 
2013 earnings per share (EPS)
Threshold 30% vesting 
Full vesting
18.3p 
22.4p
There is pro rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between 18.3p and 22.4p.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2012 under the LTIP and Option Plan 
Performance conditions are measured over a single three-year period and there is no provision for re-testing therefore the awards lapse if the 
performance targets are not met.
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 2012 would vest: achievement of a total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) target and an underlying earnings per share (‘EPS’) target. For LTIP awards made in 2012, 75 % is based on achievement of the 
TSR target and 25 % is based on achievement of the EPS target. For awards under the Option Plan, 75 % is based on EPS and 25 % on TSR. 
The EPS and TSR conditions are set out below.

TSR condition
For 2012, the same list of 20 companies used in the 201 1 awards was selected as the comparator group to be used for these purposes.
The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award (75 % of the award under the LTIP; 25 % of the award under the Option Plan)

average annual growth in continuing earnings  
per share
Threshold 30% vesting 
Full vesting
RPI + 5 % p.a 
RPI + 10% p.a
There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between the above two targets.
Shares awarded under the Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP), vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, 
provided the employee is still employed by the Group. There are vesting conditions attached to the MTIP awards which specify profit and EPS 
targets for the years to December 2012 and 2013. 
Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, provided 
the employee is still employed by the Group. 
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.4m was recognised in the year (2012, £1.6m) before employer’s national 
insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and the share options granted.

All options in the table above were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as noted above. The weighted average share price at the date  
of exercise in 2013 was 224p (2012, 207p), no options were exercised in 201 1. For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2013,  
the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.0 years (2012, 5. 1 years). 
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration report.

account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market performance conditions set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
The weighted average fair value (in pence) of LTIP , MTIP , RSP and share options granted during the year was as follows:
2013 2012
LTIP 111 150
MTIP 192 160
RSP 185 160
Share options 63 69
The following table lists the inputs to the valuation models for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013.

Weighted average share price (p) 209.3 187.7 210.6 217.6
The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. 
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. Expected volatility 
reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome. 
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
15 Auditor’s remuneration
The Company paid £31,000 (2012, £30,000) to its auditor in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the Company.
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP and its associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts  
of Laird PLC because Group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

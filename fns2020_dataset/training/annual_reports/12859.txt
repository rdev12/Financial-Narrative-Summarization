Dear shareholder
I write this report having completed my first full year as Chairman 
of QinetiQ. I am pleased to report that, against a backdrop of 
challenging markets, QinetiQ’s performance in the last financial 
year was impressive. 
These results were delivered in significant part because we took 
charge of our destiny and implemented a 24 month self-help 
programme to restore the business to strength and build value  
for the future. Our markets on both sides of the Atlantic were  
under significant budgetary pressures as our customers responded 
to their need to reduce national deficits. Given, however, the 
increased global risks and threats, our key markets of defence  
and security remain a priority for governments. We have made 
rapid progress in reshaping our business. This, together, with the 
reduction and refinancing of our debt contributed to a more  
agile and competitive QinetiQ.
Results
Group revenues were £1,702.6m (2010: £1,625.4m) and underlying 
operating profit
*
 increased to £145.4m (2010: £120.3m), up 21%, 
resulting in an underlying profit before tax
*
 for the Group of 
£114.6m, up 34% on the previous year (2010: £85.7m). The rigorous 
Group-wide focus on debt reduction resulted in a strong underlying 
operating cash conversion
*
 of 183% (2010: 145%) as underlying 
cash flow from operations
*
 increased to £265.8m (2010: £174.3m). 
Closing net debt at 31 March 2011 was £260.9m (2010: £457.4m),  
an improvement of £196.5m. Full year underlying earnings per 
share
*
 were 14.2p (2010: 11.1p). 
Dividend
In May 2010, the Board recommended a suspension of dividend 
payments during the first 12 months of the Group’s programme  
to restore QinetiQ to strength. In line with its commitment at that 
time, the Board is recommending a return to the dividend list.  
The Board is also recommending the reinstatement of a progressive 
dividend policy, which takes into account the profitability of 
QinetiQ’s businesses and underlying growth, as well as its capital 
requirements and cash flows, while maintaining an appropriate 
level of dividend cover. The final dividend will normally represent 
approximately two-thirds of the full year dividend in future periods. 
The proposed final dividend is 1.60p per share for the year ended 
31 March 2011, which will be paid on 2 September 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 5 August 2011.
Our people 
QinetiQ’s success rests on the skills and dedication of its people as 
we adapt to changing market conditions. They have played an active 
role in the Group’s progress during the year and we know they are 
deeply engaged in the self-help plan that we are implementing.  
Our teams embody a strong ethos of public service, which provides 
a vital bond with our customers in delivery of their priorities.  
May I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to our employees  
who have played such a vital role in our progress during the year.
The Board
Just as our business is evolving so is the shape of the Board. During 
the course of the year, Nick Luff and David Langstaff both left the 
Board due to growing executive management commitments outside 
of the Group. I thank them for their service to the Company and 
wish them both well for the future. In October 2010, Paul Murray 
joined as a Non-executive Director, bringing a broad range of 
experience in finance and corporate governance from a cross 
section of industries. I would like to welcome Paul to the Board  
and, on behalf of my Board colleagues, look forward to working 
with him. Admiral Ed Giambastiani will step down as a Non-
executive Director at this year’s Annual General Meeting. I would 
like to thank him for his contribution to QinetiQ over the past three 
years. We will continue to review the structure of the Board as 
QinetiQ transitions and adapts to changing markets. 
Outlook
We are making significant progress in restoring QinetiQ to strength. 
Our reshaping of the businesses, together with the reduction 
and refinancing of the debt, all contribute to a leaner and more 
agile Group. With a stronger balance sheet, we are now able to 
fund future growth and reinstate the dividend for shareholders. 
Internally, we have made significant changes which we will embed 
and extend this year, to ensure that over the medium term we 
maximise value from both QinetiQ’s inherent capabilities and 
emerging opportunities. Externally, by working closely with its US 
and UK government customers, QinetiQ will be able to align its 
unique expertise with their priorities to achieve greater value and 
efficiency. We are unlikely to see a repetition of last year’s level of 
Q-NET sales, but the Board believes that the programme underway 
to increase competitiveness will enable the Group to perform in line 
with its expectations for the current financial year in what are likely 
to remain challenging market conditions.

Chief Executive 
Officer’s review
Business review
Update on priorities
In May 2010, QinetiQ set out a 24 month self-help programme with 
three priorities: to refocus the businesses, to transform the culture 
and to strengthen the balance sheet. 
Focus
The Group’s new structure of three divisions – US Services, UK 
Services and Global Products – aligns its expertise and technology 
efficiently with customers’ needs. Each division made progress  
on implementation in the period:
• full integration of the US Services businesses is underway to 
reduce duplicated overhead, improving the ability of the division 
to compete effectively;
• the realignment of UK Services with specific customer segments 
was completed in the first half, with further refinements likely  
to reflect evolving customer requirements;
• the Global Products framework is now in place and delivering 
a common approach to development of the product portfolio; 
for example, the development of E-X-Drive® for the US Ground 
Combat Vehicle programme.
The portfolio is reviewed on an ongoing basis to address both 
performance issues and key focus areas. During the year:
•  the Group completed the disposal of the S&IS business and 
acquired Sensoptics Ltd to support development of the 
OptaSense® business;
•  existing UK synthetic training and simulation capabilities were 
brought together as one business within UK Services;
•  a common US/UK cyber platform is under development to 
globalise the Group’s cyber capabilities. 
Cultural transformation
The world-class domain expertise and innovation of QinetiQ’s 
scientists and engineers, together with its deep customer 
relationships in both the UK and US, provide the potential for 
longer-term profitable growth. Delivering this requires the right 
leadership, measurement and processes to enable empowerment 
and accountability, as well as a more flexible and competitive cost 
base. The following steps were taken to achieve this:
• more than 80% of the Group’s executive team has been 
upgraded, as well as approximately half of senior management 
in the UK and a third in the US. New performance-related 
remuneration was introduced for the UK leadership team,  
to replace legacy terms and conditions;
The Group made significant progress in the year. Its programme  
of self-help resulted in increased competitiveness and a strong 
foundation for the future. Throughout what was a difficult period 
in the markets, all our businesses have worked closely with their 
customers to ensure that QinetiQ is well-positioned to create value 
over the medium term.
Through a relentless focus on our key priorities, we rebased  
the business and put it on a strong foundation for the future.  
I am particularly pleased that we achieved a number of our goals 
ahead of schedule, principally the refinancing. This major milestone, 
completed 12 months ahead of schedule, culminated in a 
strengthened balance sheet and the confidence to reinstate the 
dividend. In addition, the Group has no debt maturity until 2016, 
providing a strong foundation to fund future growth. While we are 
making good progress, we remain focused on the next 12 months, 
to build on our progress and deliver a more agile, commercial and 
efficient business for the future. 
Trading environment 
QinetiQ’s principal markets remain challenging, with defence 
budgets on both sides of the Atlantic under pressure in light of 
government programmes to reduce fiscal deficits. 
In the US, after six months operating under a Continuing Resolution, 
President Obama signed the Defense Appropriation Bill on 15 April 
2011, which funds the Department of Defense for the remainder  
of the US Government 2011 fiscal year. Work within the US 
Government now turns to the budget for the 2012 fiscal year, 
accompanied by a review by the Department of Defense (DoD) to 
evaluate long-term spending plans. Over the medium term, budget 
reductions are expected in order to generate efficiency savings. 
Against this backdrop of fiscal austerity, customer behaviours  
are changing as they look ‘to do more with less.’ 
In the UK, it is anticipated that budgets will be reduced to meet 
the Government’s target of an 8% cumulative reduction in 
defence spending over the next four years. In December 2010, the 
Government published its Consultation Paper, ‘Equipment, Support 
and Technology for UK Defence and Security’, on the role which 
industry will play in future defence programmes and the resulting 
White Paper is scheduled for this summer. In April 2011, the 
MOD also implemented its Comprehensive Commitment Control 
Regime, which requires the approval of senior civil servants for new 
expenditure, except in key categories such as those which support 
current operations, the strategic deterrent and safety. Overall,  
the imperative for change within the MOD is likely to continue  
to restrict and delay the authorisation of new contracts.

• in February 2011, the Group signed a new five-year revolving 
credit facility, totalling £275m denominated in sterling and 
dollars, which is currently undrawn;
• in May 2011, the US$135m private placement note, due to 
mature in 2013, was repaid from surplus cash.
As a result of these actions, the Group has no debt maturity until 
2016, providing a strong foundation to fund future growth.
Ongoing priorities
Over the next 12 months, the Group’s key goal is to complete its  
24 month programme to build a leaner, more agile QinetiQ, focused 
on – and competitive in – its areas of core capability. The initiatives 
which are transforming the Group’s culture and processes must  
be sustained and embedded. Improvements in productivity will  
be extended, as will the drive to strengthen the balance sheet.  
The portfolio will continue to be aligned with customers’ needs, 
both through non-core disposals and by funding carefully selected 
areas in which QinetiQ has a clearly established position and, 
therefore, a base for value creation over the medium term.
Leo Quinn
Chief Executive Officer
27 May 2011
• common business review processes have been implemented 
across the Group to ensure transparency and the ability to 
manage outcomes and react quickly;
• two programmes – My Contribution and Fit 4 Growth – have 
been introduced. Together, these engage all employees in raising 
performance and provide a single end-to-end process, from bid 
to project delivery, driving ongoing improvements in productivity 
and value delivered to customers;
• in the UK, a more commercial way of working was needed to 
improve performance. Sales leadership was upgraded, new 
incentive plans introduced and over 3,000 employees trained 
in value-based selling, negotiation and project delivery. During 
the year, the business saw a 9% improvement in MOD customer 
satisfaction scores, while a recent employee survey showed 
higher engagement levels and a 14% rise in the leadership  
score since 2009;
• changes to UK employee terms and conditions, including revised 
redundancy arrangements, came into effect on 1 July 2010 after 
a 75% favourable vote by union members. The combination 
of introducing a new performance management system, 
restructuring the UK businesses and rationalising the technology 
portfolio, resulted in a 15% reduction in UK headcount, a 
reduction in layers of management and in overhead costs, and 
addressed areas of systemic under-utilisation with minimal loss  
of key capability. Further reductions to the UK cost base have 
been achieved through structured procurement of goods and 
services – including IT and facilities management – and the 
streamlining of UK suppliers.
Balance sheet
A key goal for the 24 month programme was to restore 
QinetiQ’s balance sheet to strength through self-help. Significant 
improvement was made in the first 12 months:
• rigorous Group-wide processes and the engagement of 
employees at all levels drove strong underlying operating cash 
conversion of 183% (2010: 145%);
• the Group’s net debt at 31 March 2011 improved to £260.9m  
(31 March 2010: £457.4m);
• the gearing ratio was reduced to 1.4x net debt: EBITDA

Maximising operational and business effectiveness
Identifying mission-critical factors, and controlling assets
Our Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, 
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) teams offer world-leading 
expertise, technical advice and practical end-to-end solutions.  
Our services resolve the most complex issues in the intelligence,  
command and control (C2) and information domains. They manage 
information gathered from different sources on the battlefield to  
improve a commander’s situational awareness and decision-making. 
Business review
Revenues declined by 7% on an organic basis at constant currency 
impacted by US Government in-sourcing around last year end as 
well as the switching of some work to small business preference 
contracts. The protracted Continuing Resolution led to a further 
lack of clarity around contract funding. This resulted in new and 
incremental orders being delayed and the cancellation of some 
re-competes with shorter term extensions awarded in their place. 
Also, during the latter part of the year, the successful Iraqi flight 
training project completed.
In this environment, bidding for existing services and larger 
programmes is very competitive necessitating a higher investment 
in business development. This, coupled with the volume impact 
on revenue, contributed to underlying operating profit
*
 falling to 
£44.3m (2010: £52.6m), delivering an underlying margin
*
 of 7.5% 
(2010: 8.4%).
As part of the programme to exit non-core capabilities, the sale 
was agreed of S&IS, an access control business, for a total cash 
consideration of US$60m before tax. The year-on-year revenue 
variance as a result of this disposal was £16m.
The strength of ongoing relationships with key customers was 
evidenced by an award to provide engineering services at the 
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, leveraging existing NASA support 
contracts at the site, as well as at the Glenn Research Center in  
Ohio and the Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The new 
service at the Kennedy Space Center began on 1 March 2011 for  
an expected base period of five years with three one-year options.
During the year, the US Services business was awarded seven new 
contracts for mission-critical services by key intelligence customers 
totalling US$25m. Building on its track record in providing training 
services to the US Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Joint communities, 
US Services was also awarded a five-year, US$36m contract to 
provide a full range of training development and delivery services 
to the Tactical C2 Engineering Division by the US Navy’s Space and 
Naval Warfare System Center Atlantic (SSC-A).
As competition intensifies, the decision to create a fully 
integrated US Services business will reduce duplicated overhead 
and deliver further efficiency savings, improving the division’s 
ability to compete effectively. Significant progress has also been 
made in developing a common US/UK cyber platform to exploit 
opportunities – principally in ‘five eyes’ markets (UK, US, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand) – generated by government commitments 
to additional cyber security funding.

Business review
Operations overview continued
Revenues declined 10% on an organic basis, principally due to 
pressure on customers’ budgets and delays in spending approvals. 
Budget uncertainties had the greatest impact on the provision of 
technical and information services, where manpower utilisation has 
a direct correlation with profitability. In addition, the prior period 
included some pass-through revenues on certain contracts which 
did not recur this year and a contribution from the Underwater 
Systems business sold in 2009. Orders in the comparator period 
were also enhanced by approximately £40m of multi-year orders 
and a £31m contract associated with the Ministry of Defence’s 
Defence Training Rationalisation (DTR) programme.
Underlying operating profit
*
 declined from £59.1m to £48.7m, 
principally due to falling revenue and hence utilisation, although 
project margins remained strong. This was exacerbated by the 
combined impact of approximately £5m in respect of higher 
pension service costs and reduced property income following a

for the full year was 8.0% (2010: 8.5%), an improvement on the 
first half margin of 7.3% as cost reductions began to take effect. 
Headcount was reduced by 662 in the year, largely as a result  
of the restructuring programme.
UK Services continues to deliver value to its customers, de-risking 
the procurement of technology for core defence programmes, 
predominantly in the UK but increasingly overseas. New 
opportunities came to fruition in Scandinavia, including a £9m 
managed services contract to operate the flight physiological  
centre for the Swedish defence administration and a £4m order  
for the Norwegian Andoya Range System. The year also saw an 
increase in funding for the Weapons Technology Centre, managed 
by QinetiQ in support of the future pipeline of complex weapons.  
At the end of the period UK Services won a £11m contract to 
provide technical and information services for a national police unit.
In response to customers’ requirements to reduce the cost of 
training, existing UK synthetic training and simulation capabilities 
have been brought together as one business. This will enable the 
leveraging of QinetiQ’s unique, technology-agnostic position to 
deliver operational and mission training for force preparation 
using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology. Reductions 
in government and agency size also provide an opportunity 
for QinetiQ, as a trusted advisor, to deliver acquisition and 
procurement support.

Providing off-the-shelf capability to address  
training challenges
Technology-agnostic, trusted and transformational
The military is faced with ever more complex 
operational situations. Against this backdrop, 
QinetiQ is offering a new approach to the 
use of synthetics to make training more agile, 
more up-to-date, more relevant, more cost 
effective and more accessible. 
We already lead in the design and delivery  
of open architecture, enabling customers  
to select the most effective combinations  
of software and hardware in a ‘Plug and  
Play’ approach to synthetics – or to select  
a bespoke solution if needed. Our unique 
skillset is capable of delivering a much wider 
range of mission training solutions across  
the simulation spectrum, from application  
for hand-held devices at one end to full 
mission simulations at the other. 
Our competitive advantage lies in our deep 
domain knowledge, our close working 
relationship with the military, our research 
into the technologies available, and our 
understanding of customer needs. 
QinetiQ’s teams are, therefore, drawn from a 
wide range of disciplines, including specialists 
in training, simulation, modelling, software 
engineering and design, systems integration, 
and human factors. QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 10
Focuses on the exploitation of  
intellectual property through the rapid 
development of concepts into proven 
products and solutions, complemented 
by contract-funded research and 
development to support the creation  
of the next generation of products for 
the international market.
Meeting the highest military standards for equipment
Lifesaving equipment making a difference
Ground forces in operational urban and rural environments are  
faced with continuous threat. Having situational awareness capabilities  
and survivability products, which enables them to operate in extreme 
situations, is a priority. QinetiQ developed SWATS in response to concerns 
about the high toll of sniper fire on military forces.
The US Army and the US Marine Corps have selected SWATS as their 
individual gunfire detection system of choice. It is quickly becoming the 
global standard for wearable gun shot detection. Weighing less than one 
pound, it is a versatile solution for combat troops around the world.
Business review
Operations overview continued
Revenues were £502.8m (2010: £303.5m), a 66% organic increase  
at constant currency. This includes a US$288m contribution from 
the new Q-NET vehicle survivability product and illustrates the 
lumpy profile of the Global Products revenue. Q-NET deliveries 
during the year were primarily for the MRAP Lite vehicle – although 
initial orders were also received for Navistar Maxxpro and the 
Stryker vehicle – and demonstrate the ability of the business 
to develop and deploy a technology in a timeframe that meets 
customers’ demands. Contributions also came from TALON
TM
 robots 
and Shoulder-Worn Acoustic Targeting System (SWATS) individual 
gunfire detection systems, with contract awards continuing in 
support of current operations, despite wider budgetary pressures 
and the Continuing Resolution.
Underlying operating profit* increased to £52.4m (2010: £8.6m)  
and an underlying margin* of 10.4% (2010: 2.8%), with a significant 
contribution from the volume of Q-NET deliveries more than 
offsetting a disappointing performance in the UK. 
In the UK, the trading environment was impacted by further 
contract delays and cancellations from the MOD. During the  
year, the UK business was reorganised, changes were made  
to the leadership team and management layers were removed.  
Total UK headcount was reduced by 346, largely as a result of the 
restructuring programme, and a business that lacked customer 
demand and funding was closed.
The OptaSense® fibre-optic sensing business continues to make 
strong progress in the energy sector with a three-year, £26.5m 
contract with Shell. Follow-on orders for security and condition 
monitoring included a project for Cairn Energy PLC to protect 
the 700km Mangala development pipeline in India. In December 
2010, the acquisition of Sensoptics Ltd was completed for an initial 
consideration of £2.3m, net of cash acquired. Sensoptics designs 
and manufactures the fibre-optic sensing hardware used  
by OptaSense®.
Towards the end of the period, the UK business received a £12m 
contract from Force Protection Europe to design, optimise and 
supply the modular armour kits for the Light Protected Patrol 
Vehicle (LPPV).
A new Global Products framework has been put in place enabling  
a common approach to developing and marketing the product 
portfolio, focused on businesses with growth strategies. The 
development of EX-Drive®, as part of a consortium bidding into  
the US Ground Combat Vehicle programme, is an early example  
of this approach.

Applying technology to new market applications
Using distributed fibre sensing to provide value enhancing 
information to multiple industries
Distributed fibre sensing is enabling our 
customers to monitor their strategic assets 
cost effectively and, in some cases,  
to measure the unmeasurable. 
Our OptaSense® business is leading 
commercial change in multiple industries 
through the application of distributed fibre 
sensing (DxS) to gather information from 
large or complex linear assets. At the heart 
of its success is its ability to convert existing 
fibre optic assets into thousands of sensors 
and then to apply advanced signal processing 
algorithms to disseminate the data in real 
time. This dual approach enables customers 
to leverage an existing fibre asset and receive 
important and timely information. This, in 
turn, enables them to make value-enhancing 
business decisions, whether these are to 
change a well completions process or  
to dispatch security to prevent theft from  
an oil pipeline. 
OptaSense® delivers value in a range of 
markets, from the oil and gas industry, through 
defence and security, to transport and many 
others. These markets require a truly global 
business focus. During this year, OptaSense® 
opened offices in Houston and Calgary, 
and delivered projects in new geographies, 
including India and Nigeria among others.  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 12

exchange rate and the impact of £29.8m in revenue contribution 
from divested businesses.
Global Products revenue increased by £199.3m (66%) largely as 
a result of the considerable demand for the new Q-NET product, 
whilst demand for the robot family of products remained strong. 
Both of these products are supporting operations in Afghanistan. 
Both UK and US services businesses suffered from pressures 
on government spending. In the UK, governmental customers’ 
spending approvals have slowed due to the uncertainty around 
priorities and budget levels. The drop in revenue within the US 
Services business reflects the volumes of government in-sourcing 
around the previous year end, exacerbated by the Continuing 
Resolution being in effect for much of the period.

The increase in underlying operating profit
*
 reflects the  
increased demand for the Q-NET product which more than  
offset a disappointing result from the UK within the Global  
Products business. 
The UK Services underlying operating margin
*
 decreased to 8.0% 
(2010: 8.5%) and the US Services underlying operating margin
*
 fell 
to 7.5% (2010: 8.4%). The reduction in underlying operating profit
*
 
and underlying operating profit margin
*
 within both UK and US 
services businesses reflects the revenue volume impacts  
mentioned above as well as increased pension service costs  
and decreased rental income in the UK, and investment in  
business development in the US. Cost savings in the UK have 
contributed to the margin increasing in the second half of  
the year (H1 UK Services margin 7.3%).
The increase in underlying operating margin
*
 from 7.4% to 8.5%  
is a result of the higher mix of revenues from product sales. 
Finance costs
Net finance costs reduced to £30.8m (2010: £34.6m). A component 
of this decrease was the net pension finance credit of £9.1m  
(2010: cost of £2.5m) from the improvement in opening market 
value of scheme assets outweighing the negative impact of a  
lower discount rate applied to scheme liabilities. A lower level  
of debt also contributed to the reduction in net finance costs.  
These impacts were partially offset by accelerated interest costs  
of £8.8m resulting from the election to make early repayment of  
a US$135m private placement debt. The early repayment  
was concluded during May 2011.
Taxation
The Group’s underlying effective tax rate
*
 was 19.0% (2010: 15.0%). 
The increase was due primarily to the additional US profits earned 
on sales of Q-NET survivability products. The Group continues  
to benefit from the availability of research and development  
relief in the UK.  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 14

The UK restructuring costs of £33.5m (2010: £44.1m) relate to  
headcount reductions announced in July and August 2010. The 
majority of the cash outflow associated with this charge occurred 
in the second half of the year. The restructuring formed part of the 
programme to restore QinetiQ to strength by ensuring the Group 
has a competitive cost base, appropriately sized for the market.  
A pension curtailment gain of £4.9m (2010: £2.0m) arose as a 
consequence of the restructuring.

A charge of £5.9m (2010: £24.0m) was taken in the year against 
the Group’s owned properties and impairment of assets. These 
properties are no longer occupied and as no external tenant has 
been found the assets are no longer generating a return.
The gain on business divestments in the year relates to the disposal 
of S&IS, a non-core security operations and access control business, 
within QinetiQ’s US Services operation.

Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 2 September 2011 to shareholders  
on the register at 5 August 2011.
Other financials
Cash flow
The Group’s cash flow from operations before restructuring  
costs but after capital expenditure was £265.8m (2010: £174.3m). 
The underlying operating cash conversion ratio
*
 was 183% (2010: 
145%), as a result of relentless focus on cash generation, assisted  
by deferred contract capital spend in the UK Services business.  
The cash outflow in the year on restructuring the UK business  
was £31.8m (2010: £35.4m). 
Acquisition expenditure, net of cash acquired, totalled £15.8m 
(2010: £45.6m), £2.3m of which was due to the acquisition of 
Sensoptics Ltd in December 2010 and the remainder was deferred 
consideration in respect of DTRI, acquired in a prior year. Proceeds 
received from the disposal of businesses totalled £38.2m  
(2010: £21.1m), largely from disposal of the S&IS business.
At 31 March 2011, net debt reduced substantially to £260.9m 
compared with £457.4m at 31 March 2010.
The Group’s borrowings remained comfortably within its  
financial covenants, with a gearing ratio
†
 of 1.4x compared to  
the covenant maximum level of 3.5x, a significant improvement 
from 2.5x last year.
The Group refinanced its existing credit facility with a new  
five-year revolving credit facility provided by the Group’s six global 
relationship banks. The new multi-currency facility, which matures 
in February 2016, includes a £118m tranche and a US$250m 
tranche and was undrawn at 31 March 2011. The Group’s cash 
performance also allowed it to make early repayment of a US$135m 
private placement debt, which was repaid during May 2011 from 
surplus cash. 
Net finance costs were impacted by an accelerated interest 
payment of £8.8m related to the early repayment of the 2013 
private placement debt.
Total committed facilities available to the Group at year end 
amounted to £625m. Following the early repayment of the 
US$135m private placement debt in May 2011, total committed 
facilities amount to £540m, with no maturity before 2016.

Underlying financial measures are presented, as the Board believes these provide  
a better representation of the Group’s long-term performance trend.
Pensions
The net pension deficit under IAS 19, after deducting deferred tax, 
was £92.2m (2010: £106.1m). The decrease in net pension deficit is 
primarily driven by the increase in market value of scheme assets, 
partially offset by the input of assumed increase in life expectancy.
The key assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the scheme are:
Assumption
31 March  
2011
31 March  
2010
Discount rate 5.6% 5.6%
Inflation 3.6% 3.6%
Salary increase 4.6% 4.6%
Life expectancy – male (currently aged 40) 90 89
Life expectancy – female (currently aged 40) 91 90
Each assumption is selected by the Group in consultation with the 
Company actuary and takes account of industry practice amongst 
comparator listed companies. The sensitivity of each of the key 
assumptions is shown in the table below.
Assumption
Change in  
assumption
Indicative effect on scheme

Inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £25m
Salary increase Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £6m
Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by £22m
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2011 was £981.1m  
(31 March 2010: £915.9m) and the present value of scheme 
liabilities was £1,105.7m (31 March 2010: £1,063.2m).
The investment principles of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme were 
revised during the year by the trustees, in consultation with QinetiQ. 
A shift from the historical weighting towards equity investments,  
to a more balanced portfolio, was considered appropriate by the 
trustees to reflect the relative age of the scheme and changes to 
the membership profile. The next triennial full actuarial valuation  
of the QinetiQ pension scheme is due to be undertaken as at  
30 June 2011.
Capital risk
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity  
funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market 
borrowings. At 31 March 2011 the Group’s total equity was £457.5m 
(2010: £473.7m). Net debt as defined by the Group was £260.9m 
(2010: £457.4m).
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the 
Directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The 
Group’s target is to maintain its gearing ratio below 2xEBITDA. 
Treasury policy
The Group treasury department works within a framework of 
policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee. As part 
of these policies and procedures, there is strict control on the use of 
financial instruments. Speculative trading in financial instruments is 
not permitted. The policies are established to manage and control 
risk in the treasury environment and to align the treasury goals, 
objectives and philosophy of the Group.
Funding and debt portfolio management
The Group seeks to obtain certainty of access to funding in the 
amounts and maturities required to support the Group’s medium  
to long-term forecast financing requirements. Group borrowings 
are arranged by the Group treasury function. 
Interest risk management
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in its interest charge 
caused by rate fluctuations. A significant portion of the Group’s 
borrowings are fixed in the short to medium term through  
fixed-rate debt. QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ report: Business review Directors’ report: Corporate governance Financial statements
17
Foreign exchange risk management
The principal exchange rate affecting the Group was the sterling  
to US dollar exchange rate.
2011 2010
£/US$ – average rate 1.56 1.59
£/US$ – closing rate 1.60 1.52
£/US$ – opening rate 1.52 1.44
The Group’s income and expenditure is largely settled in the 
functional currency of the relevant Group entity, mainly sterling 
or US dollar. The Group has a policy in place to hedge all material 
transaction exposure at the point of commitment to the underlying 
transaction. Uncommitted future transactions are not routinely 
hedged. The Group continues its practice of not hedging income 
statement translation exposure. To minimise the impact of currency 
depreciation of the net assets on its overseas subsidiaries, the 
Group seeks to borrow in the currencies of those subsidiaries, 
but only to the extent that its gearing covenant within its loan 
documentation, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to  
remain comfortably within limits.
Tax risk management
The central principle of QinetiQ’s tax strategy is to manage effective 
and cash tax rates whilst fully complying with relevant legislation. 
Tax is managed in alignment with the corporate strategy and with 
regard to QinetiQ’s core value of integrity in all business dealings. 
These principles are applied in a responsible and transparent 
manner in pursuing the Group’s tax strategy and in all dealings  
with tax authorities around the world.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a counterparty fails to perform its 
obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial 
instruments such as liquid assets, derivative assets and trade 
receivables. Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and 
acquiring derivatives from high-credit quality financial institutions. 
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits, control and approval 
procedures across the Group. The nature of the Group’s operations 
leads to concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables. 
The majority of the Group’s credit risk is with the UK and US 
Governments and is therefore considered minimal.
Insurance
The Group continually assesses the balance of risk arising from the 
operations undertaken against the insurance cover available for 
such activities and associated premiums payable for such cover. 
A prudent and consistent approach to risk retention and scope of 
cover is applied across the Group. The Group has a policy of self-
insurance, through its captive insurance company, on the first layer 
of specific risks with insurance cover above these levels placed in 
the external market with third-party insurers.
Employees
Year-end employee numbers have decreased by 14% to 11,208  
at 31 March 2011. The decline primarily reflects normal in-year 
attrition as well as departures under the restructuring programme 
in the UK and the impact of Government in-sourcing and the 
disposal of S&IS in the US.

Description
A measure of employee engagement 
on a scale of 0-1,000, based on the Best 
Companies Employee Survey. Through  
this channel, QinetiQ employees share  
their views of working at QinetiQ under  
the headings of management, leadership, 
my company, personal growth, my team, 
giving back to the community, fair deal  
and well-being. 
Description
The Group’s calculation of underlying 
operating margin
*
 is consistent with prior 
years. Underlying operating margin is 
calculated by taking the earnings before  
tax and interest as a percentage of revenue. 
Description
The ratio of our net cash flow from 
operations (excluding reorganisations), 
less outflows on the purchase of intangible 
assets, and property, plant and equipment 
to underlying operating profit
*
 excluding the 
share of post-tax results of equity accounted 
joint ventures and associates. 
Description
The Group’s gearing ratio
†
 is calculated as 
net debt divided by EBITDA, as calculated in 
accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
credit facilities, and is comfortably within 
our banking covenant limit of 3.5x. 
Comment
The survey forms part of The Sunday Times 
Best Companies to Work For, an annual 
survey run in The Sunday Times newspaper 
that ranks UK employers based on their 
employees’ feedback and allows comparison 
between QinetiQ and other UK companies. 
Comment
Underlying operating margin

Risks and uncertainties
The understanding and effective management of the risks that face QinetiQ is 
fundamental to its success and is an integral part of managing the business. 
The identification, assessment, mitigation and reporting of risks 
are processes carried out at a Group, business and project level 
and are included as part of the business performance review 
process. Risks are assessed according to the likelihood of the 
event’s occurrence and its impact, both from a financial and 
non-financial standpoint. The Group Risk Register includes an 
analysis of the potential exposures and severity of each risk (as a 
function of the likelihood and impact of the risk), the assumptions 
underlying each risk and the mitigating actions required to 
manage the risk.
The Group Risk Register is reviewed by the Executive Team on  
a monthly basis and considers:
• the authority, resources and coordination of those involved in 
the identification, assessment and management of significant 
risks faced by the organisation; 
• the response to the significant risks which have been identified 
by management and others; 
• the monitoring of reports from Group management; and 
• the maintenance of a control environment directed towards the 
proper management of risk.
The risk register is reviewed by the Board and, in addition, the risk 
owners present an update of current status and mitigating actions 
by rotation throughout the year.
A change in demand 
from reduced military 
operations in Iraq  
and Afghanistan
Current plans of both US and UK Governments 
are to reduce involvement in Afghanistan in the 
coming years. A significant shift in policy by either 
the Administration in the US or the Government 
in the UK, which results in a significant reduction 
in the number of forces personnel present in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, may have a materially adverse 
impact on the Group’s financial performance. 
QinetiQ has capitalised on increased UK and US 
Government spending on technology in support 
of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Notably, 
QinetiQ has experienced strong demand for 
Unmanned Ground Vehicles and survivability 
products across the duration of both campaigns. 
However, the focus on operational support in 
defence, on both sides of the Atlantic, has given 
rise to a decline in defence expenditure in other 
areas, such as services to improve procurement 
efficiency and innovative research. The Group 
mitigates this by maintaining a market focus  
and competitive positioning in adjacent  
markets, including defence services (which  
are not directly conflict-related); aerospace, 
security and intelligence, providing a degree  
of portfolio diversification.
A change in either US 
or UK Government 
spending on defence  
and security
The Strategic Defence and Security Review in the 
UK, and the financial burden on both UK and US 
Government budgets from the recent economic 
downturn, will lead to reduced spending in the 
markets in which the Group operates. In particular 
the UK is reducing its defence budget by 8% in 
real terms by FY2015 and, additionally, seeking to 
remove significant over-heating in its equipment 
programme. Any reduction in Government 
defence and security spending in either the UK 
or the US could have an adverse impact on the 
Group’s financial performance.
The Group is focused on a range of markets in 
defence, security and intelligence, providing a 
degree of portfolio diversification. The Group will 
continue to review trends in defence, aerospace 
and security expenditure in order to align the 
business with those trends. The UK Government is 
investing an additional £650m in cyber capability 
which offers some opportunity to the Group.

Changing in the timing 
of contracts
The amounts payable under some Government 
contracts can be significant and the timing of 
receiving orders could have a material impact  
on the Group’s performance in a given  
reporting period.
The contract and orders pipeline is regularly 
reviewed by senior operational management.
Funding of the defined 
benefit pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK. Presently there is a deficit 
between the projected liability of the scheme  
and the value of the assets held by the scheme.  
The size of the deficit may be materially affected 
by a number of factors, including inflation, 
investment returns, changes in interest rates  
and improvements in life expectancy. An increase 
in the deficit may require the Group to increase  
the cash contributions to the scheme which  
would reduce the Group’s available cash for  
other purposes.
The performance of the pension scheme is 
reviewed regularly by Group management in 
conjunction with the scheme’s independent 
trustees. External actuarial and investment advice 
is also taken on a regular basis to ensure that the 
scheme is managed in the best interests of both 
the Group and the scheme’s members. The most 
recent triennial funding valuation of the scheme, 
as at 30 June 2008, resulted in a deficit of 
£111.3m. The Group and trustees have agreed a 
ten-year recovery period to make up this deficit. 
The next funding valuation of the scheme is at  
30 June 2011.
Policies or attitudes 
may change towards 
Organisational Conflicts 
of Interest (OCI)
The Group provides services to defence customers  
that meet their needs as part of the defence 
supply chain and also as technical advisor through 
its consultancy services. The future growth of 
the business could be compromised should the 
current attitudes to policies adopted by our key 
customers change.
The Group takes proactive steps to manage any 
potential OCI and to maintain its ability to provide 
independent advice through its consulting and 
systems engineering activities. In the UK, a formal 
compliance regime operates with the MOD to 
monitor and assess potential OCI as part of the 
sales acceptance process.
Tax liabilities may 
change as a result 
of changes in tax 
legislation
QinetiQ is liable to pay tax in the countries in 
which it operates, principally in the UK and the US. 
Changes in the tax legislation in these countries 
could have an adverse impact on the level of tax 
paid on the profits generated by the Group.
External advice and consultation is sought on 
potential changes in tax legislation in both the 
UK and the US. This enables us to plan for and 
mitigate potential changes in legislation.
Fixed-price contracts Some of the Group’s revenue is derived from 
contracts which have a fixed price. There is a risk 
that the costs required for delivery of a contract 
could be higher than those agreed in the contract 
due to the performance of new or developed 
products, operational overruns or external 
factors, such as inflation. Any significant increase 
in costs which cannot be passed on to a customer 
may reduce the profitability of a contract or even 
result in a contract becoming loss-making.
The nature of much of the services provided  
under such fixed-price arrangements is often  
for a defined amount of effort or resource rather 
than firm deliverables and, as such, the risk of cost 
escalation is mitigated. The Group ensures that 
its fixed-price bids and projects are reviewed for 
early detection and management of issues which 
may result in cost overrun.
Highly-competitive 
marketplace
The aerospace, defence and security markets 
overall are highly competitive. The Group’s 
financial performance may be adversely affected 
should it not be able to compete in the markets  
in which it aims to operate.
QinetiQ seeks to focus on areas within these markets 
in which its deep customer understanding, domain 
knowledge, technical expertise and platform 
independence provide a strong proposition and  
a significant advantage in competitive bidding.
Risk Potential impact M itig a ti o n 22 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Inherent risks from 
trading in a global 
marketplace
QinetiQ operates internationally. The risks 
associated with having a large geographical 
footprint may include: regulation and 
administration changes, changes in taxation 
policy, political instability, civil unrest, and cultural 
and terms of reference differences leading to lack 
of common understanding with customers. Any 
such events could disrupt some of the Group’s 
operations and have a material impact on the 
Group’s future financial performance.
While the core activities of the Group are confined 
to the UK and the US, the Group continues to 
explore potential client relationships across the 
globe. These new relationships are assessed 
for their inherent risks using our International 
Business Opportunity Management process 
before being formally entered into.
A material element  
of the Group’s revenue 
and operating profit  
is derived from  
one contract
The Long-Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA)  
is a 25-year contract to provide a variety of 
evaluation, testing and training services to the 
MOD. The original contract was signed in 2003. 
The LTPA operates under five-year periods with 
specific programmes, targets and performance 
measures set for each period. On 3 March 
2008, the Group signed up to a second five-year 
period of the LTPA with the MOD. The first break 
point is in 2013. In the current year, the LTPA 
directly contributed 11% of the Group’s revenue 
and supported a further 6% through tasking 
services using LTPA managed facilities. The loss, 
cancellation or termination of this contract would 
have a material, adverse impact on the Group’s 
future reported performance.
The Group continues to achieve customer 
performance and satisfaction levels, and 
significantly exceeded the agreed minimum 
performance rating of 80% in 2010/2011.
Failure to comply with 
laws and regulations, 
particularly trading 
restrictions and  
export controls
The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
environment and the majority of its revenues 
are generated from sales within the UK and the 
US. The Group is subject to numerous domestic 
and international laws, including import and 
export controls, financial and fiscal laws, health 
and safety, environmental, money laundering, 
anti-bribery, etc. Failure to comply with particular 
regulations could result in a combination of 
fines, penalties, civil or criminal prosecution, 
and suspension or debarment from Government 
contracts, as well as reputational damage  
to the QinetiQ brand. Any one of these  
could have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial performance.
The Group has procedures and, where 
appropriate, training in place to ensure that it 
meets all current regulations. Local management 
continuously monitors local laws and regulations, 
and policies are in place for the appointment 
of advisors to support business development. 
Professional advice is sought when engaging in 
new territories to ensure that the Group complies 
with local and international regulations and 
requirements. In the US, the Group undertakes 
work that is deemed to be of importance to US 
national security, and arrangements are in place 
to insulate these activities from undue foreign 
influence as a result of foreign ownership. The 
Group has procedures in place to ensure that 
these arrangements remain effective and to 
respond to any changes that might occur in US 
attitudes to foreign ownership of such activities. 
The terms of reference of the Compliance 
Committee have been expanded to review the 
effectiveness of the compliance risk frameworks.
Failure of information 
technology systems 
and breaches of  
data security
The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
information technology environment. The data 
held by QinetiQ is highly confidential and needs  
to be totally secure. A failure of systems could 
impact contract delivery leading to a loss in 
The information systems are designed with 
consideration to single points of failure and 
the removal of risk through minor and major 
system failures. The business maintains business

and business units as well as technical capability 
of staff. These plans cover a range of scenarios 
which include loss of access to information 
technology systems. The plans are tested at 
appropriate intervals. Data security is assured 
through a multi-layered approach, providing a 
hardened environment including robust physical 
security arrangements, data resilience strategies 
the application of security technologies as well as 
comprehensive internal and external testing of 
potential vulnerabilities. In addition the systems 
are monitored and managed on a 24x7 basis.
Exchange rate 
movement
The Group is exposed to volatility in exchange 
rates due to the international nature of its 
operations; this includes a translational impact 
on the key financial statements as a result of the 
Group reporting its financial results in sterling.  
The Group has limited transaction exposure as  
its revenues and related costs are often borne  
in the same currency, principally US dollars  
or sterling. 
The Group actively hedges all significant 
transactional foreign exchange exposure as 
described in the notes to the financial statements 
and has adopted hedge accounting. The Group’s 
objective is to reduce medium-term volatility to 
cash flow, margins and earnings. The Group 
protects its balance sheets and reserves from 
adverse foreign exchange movements by financing 
acquisitions in North America with US dollar-
denominated borrowings, partially mitigating the 
risk as US dollar earnings are used to service and 
repay US dollar-denominated debt.
Raising external 
funding and volatility  
in interest rates
The Group relies on the proper functioning of 
the credit markets which could have an impact 
on both the availability and associated costs of 
financing. The Group is exposed to interest rate 
risk derived mainly from long-term indebtedness 
and related to borrowings which have been issued 
at floating interest rates.
The Group maintains a prudent level of committed 
funding facilities: a new five-year multi-currency 
facility totalling £275m was signed in February 
2011 provided by its relationship banks. The 
Group also uses fixed-rate debt instruments 
issued to US private placement investors with 
maturity dates up to 2019.
Realisation of value 
from intellectual 
property may  
be delayed
The funded research and development work  
that the Group undertakes for defence and other 
customers creates intellectual property that the 
Group retains and can utilise for commercial 
applications. The uncertainty that exists over new 
technologies and markets may result in delays, 
failure to realise value from intellectual property, 
or the need for a higher level of investment for 
the opportunity to be realised. The additional 
investment requirements may have to be funded 
from the Group’s own capital resources which  
may have an adverse impact on the Group’s 
financial performance.
The Group invests in the development of 
intellectual property only where it believes 
there is a realistic market opportunity for the 
technology. The performance of intellectual 
property realisation programmes is monitored 
to increase support for successful prospects and 
reduce expenditure where realisation appears 
less likely. The Group uses external experts 
and financial backers as partners in a variety of 
structures to enhance the performance of certain 
intellectual property realisation projects.
Acquisition of 
businesses
The Group has the ability to acquire other 
businesses and companies. These acquisitions  
may not perform in line with expectations,  
thereby having a detrimental impact on the  
Group’s financial performance.
The risks are mitigated through the due diligence 
and internal approvals processes. In addition, the 
usual contractual protections are included in the 
purchase agreements signed with the vendors.

A responsible and sustainable business
Leadership and management
With a wide network of domain experts across the UK, Australia and 
the US, corporate responsibility (CR) is embedded in the business, 
overseen by the Head of CR. The CR Committee, comprising the 
QinetiQ Executive Team, continues to review and support the CR 
strategy and projects. 
The Group Business Ethics Policy provides a framework for how 
the Group operates. However, regional differences in stakeholder 
requirements and law, require priorities to be fine-tuned locally. 
QinetiQ responds promptly to changing legislation by adapting local 
policies, such as health and safety, environment, business ethics 
and equality. 
Business ethics
Progress on the Business Ethics programme is now reported 
quarterly to the Compliance Committee. The Group is committed 
to the highest standards of ethical conduct and, in the forthcoming 
year, a Group-wide Code of Conduct will replace separate UK and 
US documents. All employees are required to complete regular 
training in business ethics. More in-depth training is provided for 
employees who are involved in international business. QinetiQ 
engages with third parties, such as TRACE to conduct due diligence 
associated with engaging representatives overseas. All employees 
have access to an independent whistle-blowing line. 
Sustainable procurement 
An important part of developing a sustainable and responsible 
business is managing how and what we buy to ensure best value 
for money, taking into account environmental and socio-economic 
issues. In the UK, QinetiQ is a signatory to the MOD’s Sustainable 
Procurement Charter and an active member of the MOD-Industry 
Sustainable Procurement Working Group. QinetiQ has been active 
in raising employee awareness of sustainable procurement through 
training, employee campaigns and leadership team briefings and 
through the corporate induction for UK employees. 
Engaging our people
Employee communications
Our people play a crucial role in enabling the Group to achieve 
its goals, particularly in realising the significant change embarked 
upon within the Group. Engaging employees begins with keeping 
our people informed, through a range of channels. The UK QinetiQ 
Employee Forum continues to provide a way by which employee 
engagement is enhanced. The ‘My Contribution’ programme gives 
employees a forum to voice ideas for business improvements and 
convert them quickly into projects that benefit the Company’s 
bottom line. 
Once again the UK and Australian business took part in the Best 
Companies Survey, giving employees an opportunity to share  
their views on working in QinetiQ. A 77.5% response rate was 
achieved along with a higher score than in 2010. Employee 
engagement has been a key part of QinetiQ North America’s  
(QNA) programme of bringing many separate companies together 
into one business and an engagement survey is also undertaken.
People development
The Group is an equal opportunities employer, upholds the 
principles of the UK Employment Service’s ‘Two Ticks’ symbol  
and is accredited by Investors in People. 
QinetiQ continues to support the development and employability 
of our people, from apprentices and graduates to our current 
and future leaders. The Personal Success Plan (PSP), QinetiQ’s 
performance management process, was introduced last year  
in the UK and Australia and has been successfully rolled out  
and embedded. It is a key mechanism for the identification of top 
talent, as well as addressing any employee performance issues.
Employee wellbeing
UK and Australian employees have access to an Employee Wellbeing 
Programme providing information and support on financial, legal 
and family matters and counselling. UK employees also have 
a benefits package through ‘QinetiQ Currency’. QNA provides 
an excellent package of healthcare benefits for employees, an 
Employee Assistance Programme and a purchase discount scheme.

Environmental management and conservation
The UK business continues to maintain ISO 14001:2004 
certification, confirming evidence of effective controls as part 
of Company Environmental Management Systems, which cover 
a broad range of activities. The Australian business has also 
established a small group responsible for developing environmental 
initiatives. A responsible and proactive approach is taken to the 
stewardship of the many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
that are managed in the UK. Conservation management plans in 
place where required.
Waste
As part of QinetiQ UK’s waste-management programme, data 
collection has been extended to the majority of QinetiQ sites 
and those managed on behalf of the MOD. In QNA, recycling 
programmes operate across much of the business.

Making a positive contribution to the community
Science for society 
In 2010, two UK employees visited Laos as part of QinetiQ’s 
unexploded ordnance (UXO) Science for Society Programme,  
which has been running for six years. The team uses its expertise  
to support local capability building to reduce the threat of UXO. 
Recently our QNA business provided specialist unmanned vehicle 
equipment and associated training to aid in Japan’s Fukushima 
recovery efforts. This enabled response teams to accomplish critical 
and complex recovery tasks while remaining a safe distance from 
hazardous debris and other dangerous conditions.
Education outreach 
For the fourth year running, QinetiQ UK collected an Award from 
STEMNET, a UK national body leading all Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Maths (STEM) educational outreach. Student 
placements are provided through ‘Year in Industry’ as well as 
sponsorship of degrees. 
Charity and community programmes 
Employees across the Group undertook a range of volunteering 
activities in the community. Total charitable giving from the 
business across the Group was £196,900 (see page 45).
Safe and sustainable delivery
Safety is a priority of the business. A review of our UK Health, Safety 
and Environment (HS&E) provision during 2010 highlighted the 
need to further develop our HS&E and Assurance management to 
improve leadership and focus. In August 2010, a Director of HS&E 
was appointed and two lead roles for occupational safety and for 
environment and sustainability were created. They head up a new 
and invigorated HS&E function aligned with the business and with 
a strategy focused on developing a strong HS&E and Assurance 
culture and competencies.

The Board sees high standards of corporate governance as 
essential to building value in our business and to the ongoing 
management of change. 
The Board considers that QinetiQ has promoted strong  
governance throughout the Group by applying the principles  
of the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the Combined Code). The Board  
considers that QinetiQ has complied with the provisions of the 
Combined Code throughout the last financial year. In 2010 a  
new UK Corporate Governance Code was published. This will come 
into effect over the coming financial year and bring a number of 
important changes to corporate governance practice. The Board 
welcomes these changes as a positive reflection of the evolving 
nature of good business governance. The Board is in the process  
of reviewing the new UK Code and will be taking action to ensure 
that what QinetiQ does fully reflects its principles and that we 
comply with its provisions. Some steps have already been taken  
to update our practices and policies and these are highlighted in 
the next few pages.  
The Board – governance, processes and systems 
Board objectives 
Demonstrate the highest standards of corporate governance per 
the UK code to: 
• ensure the continuing evolution and implementation of the 
Group strategy which delivers value to all stakeholders: 
customers, employees and shareholders; 
• develop challenging objectives for the business and monitor 
management performance against those goals; 
• provide a framework of effective controls to assess and manage 
risks, with clear expectations for conduct to the highest 
standards of ethics; 
• provide support and constructive challenges to the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) to promote the Group’s success; 
• demonstrate leadership in management systems around 
Health, Safety and Environment; and 
• manage succession planning for the Board and the Group’s 
executive management. 
Composition of the Board 
The Board currently has nine members: the Non-executive 
Chairman; six other Non-executive Directors; and two Executive 
Directors, namely the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO); 
with the objective of achieving a balance of Executive and Non-
executive Directors. 
Executive and Non-executive Board composition 
Mark Elliott has been the Non-executive Chairman of QinetiQ  
since 1 March 2010, having first joined the Board as a Non-
executive Director on 1 June 2009. During the year the Board 
welcomed Paul Murray, who joined as a Non-executive Director  
on 25 October 2010. The Board would like to express its thanks to 
Nick Luff and David Langstaff, both of whom stepped down during 
the year, for their dedication and valuable contributions during 
their time of service on the Board. 
The Board considers its overall size and composition to be 
appropriate, having regard in particular to the independence  
of character and integrity of all the Directors and the experience  
and skills which they bring to their duties, which prevents  
any individual or small group from dominating the Board’s 
decision-making. 
The Board considers that the skills and experience of its individual 
members, particularly in the areas of UK/US defence and security, 
the commercialisation of innovative technologies, corporate 
finance, mergers and acquisitions and risk management, have  
been fundamental in the pursuit of QinetiQ’s strategic initiatives 
(as described in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review section of this 
Annual Report) in the past year. In addition, the quoted company 
experience available to members of the Board in a variety of 
industry sectors and international markets has also been 
invaluable to the Group as it seeks to consolidate its position  
in its core markets and geographic territories.    QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 29 
Roles and responsibilities 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Executive Directors’ 
management of the Group’s operations and, in this capacity, 
determines the Group’s strategic and investment policies. The 
Board also monitors the performance of the Group’s senior 
management team and organises its business to have regular 
interaction with key members of the Group, including those based 
in North America. The Directors are responsible for overseeing the 
management of the business of the Group, and their powers are 
subject to the Articles of Association and any applicable legislation 
and regulation. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
The roles of Chairman and CEO are separate, with their 
responsibilities having been clearly articulated by the Board in 
writing. The Chairman, Mark Elliott, is responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board and ensuring that all Directors are enabled 
and encouraged to play their full part in Board activities. The CEO, 
Leo Quinn, is responsible to the Board for directing and promoting 
the profitable operation and development of the Group consistent 
with enhancing long-term stakeholder value. This includes the day-
to-day management of the Group; formulating, communicating 
and executing Group strategy; and the implementation of Board 
policies. 
Senior Independent Director 
The Senior Independent Non-executive Director is Sir David Lees. 
Sir David is also Deputy Chairman of the Board and serves as an 
additional point of contact for shareholders should they feel  
that their concerns are not being addressed through the normal 
channels. Sir David is available to fellow Non-executive Directors, 
either individually or collectively, should they wish to discuss 
matters of concern in a forum that does not include the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors or the senior management of QinetiQ. 
Independence of Non-executive Directors 
Of the current Directors of the Company, the Board considers 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, Noreen Doyle, Mark Elliott, 
Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani, Sir David Lees and Paul Murray 
to be independent of QinetiQ’s executive management and free 
from any business or other relationships that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Of the 
remaining Non-executive Directors, the Board considers that Colin 
Balmer is not independent for Combined Code purposes, on the 
basis that he was (until MOD sold its entire ordinary shareholding 
in the Company on 9 September 2008) the MOD’s nominated 
director. Based on the above, the Board considers that over  
half of its members were independent Non-executive Directors 
throughout the last financial year. 
Performance of the Board 
In accordance with the Combined Code, QinetiQ continues each 
year to evaluate the performance of the Board and its Committees. 
The Chairman used the core conclusions arising out of the prior 
year’s evaluation exercise as a reference point for a series of 
questions focused on best practice areas of corporate governance. 
This was supplemented by meetings held with the Directors at 
which the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Board members was discussed. Sir David Lees, in his capacity as the 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director, met with individual 
members of the Board to evaluate the performance of the 
Chairman. 
The evaluation process revealed that the operation of the Board 
was conducted in an open and transparent manner, with the Board 
possessing an appropriate range of skills which were well matched 
to QinetiQ’s business and having devoted increased attention to 
strategic planning, succession and risk management in the year. 
As a result of the evaluation exercise, the Board agreed to maintain 
its focus on these key issues in the coming year. As a separate 
exercise, the Chairman held meetings with the Non-executive 
Directors in the last financial year, without the Executive Directors 
present, in order to review both the operation of the Board and to 
appraise the performance of the Executive Directors. 
Directors’ induction, on-going training and information 
All newly-appointed Directors participate in an induction 
programme, which is tailored to meet their specific needs in 
relation to information on the Group. Further, a series of visits to 
Group sites giving the opportunity to meet senior management, is 
provided to new Directors for them to gain a strong understanding 
of the business. The induction programme includes an induction 
pack, which is refreshed to ensure it contains the most up-to-date 
information available on the Group. Training is also available to the 
Board on key business issues or developments in policy, regulation 
or legislation on an ‘as needed’ basis. The Company provides 
business-wide computer based training (CBT) for employees and 
the Board relating to compliance with its business ethics policies 
and practices.  Corporate governance 
Corporate governance report continued 
30 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
All Directors are encouraged to visit QinetiQ’s principal sites and  
to meet a wide cross-section of the employee base. During the  
last financial year, the Board held two of its meetings at QinetiQ’s 
facility in Washington and one of its meetings at QinetiQ’s 
Farnborough site. This provided members of the Board with a 
greater opportunity to experience and understand the operational 
dynamics and technical offerings of the US and UK business at  
first hand. 
As part of the corporate planning process, the Board has the 
opportunity to question the Sector Managing Directors and the 
Executive Directors in relation to the formulation of the corporate 
plan at Sector level and the impact of these plans on the Group 
strategy as a whole. 
The Non-executive Directors also have an opportunity to meet 
with other employees within the Group (including other members 
of the senior management team) at lunchtime/evening events, 
which are scheduled to coincide with Board meetings.  
Each of the Directors has access to the services of the Company 
Secretary, and there is also an agreed procedure for the Directors 
to seek independent advice at the Company’s expense. 
Re-election of Directors 
Rules concerning the appointment and replacement of Directors  
of the Company are contained in the Articles of Association and 
changes to these articles must be submitted to shareholders for 
approval. According to the Articles of Association, all Directors  
are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) following their appointment, and to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. However, in 
line with best practice reflected in the new UK Governance Code, 
the Company requires each serving member of the Board to be put 
forward for election or re-election on an annual basis at each AGM. 
Board meetings and attendance 
The Board has regular scheduled meetings. Nine scheduled Board 
meetings were held in the last financial year. Members of the 
Board were also invited to attend a dinner on the occasion of each 
scheduled Board meeting, to assist in the process of relationship 
building and to ensure that key strategic initiatives were 
thoroughly discussed. 
The following table shows the number of meetings of the Board 
and its committees held during the last financial year, and the 
attendance by individual Directors.

Matters reserved to the Board 
The Board operates through a comprehensive set of processes, 
which define the schedule of matters to be considered by the 
Board and its Committees during the annual business cycle, the 
level of delegated authorities (both financial and non-financial) 
available to both Executive Directors and other layers of 
management within the business, and QinetiQ’s Business  
Ethics, Risk Management, and Health, Safety and Environmental 
processes. The Board devotes one entire meeting each year to 
consider strategy and planning issues which have an impact on  
the Group, from which the five-year corporate plan is generated, 
and it is also regularly kept up to date on strategic issues 
throughout the year. The Board also has a clearly articulated set  
of matters which are specifically reserved to it for consideration, 
which include reviewing the annual budgets, raising indebtedness, 
granting security over Group assets, approving Group strategy and 
the corporate plan, approval of the annual and interim report and 
accounts, approval of significant investment, bid, acquisition and 
divestment transactions, approval of Human Resources policies 
(including pension arrangements), reviewing material litigation and 
monitoring the overall system of internal controls, including risk 
management.    
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 31 
Operation of the Board 
The Board receives written reports from the CEO and CFO each 
month, together with a separate report on investor relations, 
which is prepared in consultation with QinetiQ’s brokers, and  
a report produced by the Company Secretary on key legal and 
regulatory issues affecting the Group. The Board also considers 
reports from the Chairs of the Committees of the Board at the  
next scheduled Board meeting following the date on which each 
Committee meeting was held. 
The CEO’s monthly report addresses the key strategic initiatives 
which have had an impact on the Group since the previous 
meeting of the Board, and focuses, in particular, on the progress  
of each of the Sectors. Other key areas of focus include health, 
safety and environmental matters, employee and organisational 
issues, corporate responsibility, the status of key account 
management/customer relationship initiatives, the pipeline of 
potential bids, acquisitions, disposals and investments, and the 
post-acquisition performance of recently acquired businesses.  
The Board also receives updates from the CEO’s key functional 
reports on an ‘as needed’ basis, on issues such as Human 
Resources, Treasury, Corporate Responsibility, Real Estate, 
Security, Trade Controls and Pensions. Key issues considered by 
the Board in the past year included succession planning, which 
culminated in some changes to Board membership, strategy  
(in particular the effective operation of the UK Services, US 
Services and Global Products businesses) and the Company’s 
ongoing improvement to business processes in response to  
the key findings of the Haddon-Cave report.  
Conflicts of interest 
The Company requires Directors to disclose proposed outside 
business interests before they are entered into. This enables prior 
assessment of any conflict, or potential conflict, of interest and any 
impact on time commitment. An annual review of all external 
interests is carried out by the Board. 
Directors’ responsibilities 
Statements explaining the Directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the Group’s financial statements and the auditor’s responsibilities 
for reporting on those statements are set out on pages 48 and 49. 
Other Directors’ information 
Details of Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non- 
executive Directors’ letters of appointment are set out in the 
Report of the Remuneration Committee. Copies of Directors’ 
service contracts and letters of appointment will be available  
for inspection at the Company’s AGM. 
Other Management Committees 
Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group’s 
activities, with the exception of QinetiQ’s North American 
operations (which are managed through the Proxy Board, as 
described in the section below headed ‘Management and control 
of US subsidiaries’), is conducted through the QinetiQ Executive 
Team (QET). The QET comprises the Group CEO, Group CFO, 
Functional Directors and the Managing Directors of each of the 
three UK business Sectors. The QET meets on a monthly basis,  
and receives weekly updates on key operational issues by way  
of pre-scheduled conference calls. The activities of the QET are 
supplemented by the Proxy Board and the Executive Management 
Team in QNA. A Global Products Steering Committee was formed 
in the year to accelerate the development of the Global Products 
business, its products, and its exploitation of QinetiQ’s intellectual 
property. 
Board Committees 
The Board has established five principal committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Nominations 
Committee, the Compliance Committee and the Security 
Committee. Each operates within written terms of reference 
approved by the Board, details of which are set out in the Investor 
Relations section of QinetiQ’s website (www.QinetiQ.com).  
Each Chairman of a Board Committee reports on the key issues 
discussed, and decisions taken, at the next meeting of the Board 
following the Committee meeting in question. Details of each of 
these Committees are summarised below. Details of each 
Committee members’ attendance at Committee meetings  
are set out in the table on page 30. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Paul Murray. The Board 
considers him to have recent and relevant financial experience, 
given his former roles as Group Finance Director of Carlton 
Communications plc and LASMO plc, and through his current role 
as Audit Committee Chairman at Royal Mail Holdings plc. The 
Committee is made up of three Non-executive Directors (four until 
the resignation of David Langstaff as a Director of the company on 
18 April 2011), all of whom the Board considers to be independent. 
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s integrity in financial 
reporting and reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework. The other members are Noreen Doyle and Sir David 
Lees. The members bring extensive experience of corporate 
management in senior executive positions to the Company. 
The Audit Committee meets as necessary and at least four  
times a year. During the financial year ended 31 March 2011,  
the Committee met on five occasions. The external auditor has  
the right to request that a meeting of the Audit Committee be 
convened. During the past financial year, the Committee met  
with QinetiQ’s external auditor on two separate occasions,  
without Executive Directors present, to discuss the audit process. 
The Committee also met with the Group Internal Audit Manager 
on the same basis. 
The CEO, CFO, Group Financial Controller, Group Internal Audit 
Manager, the QNA Internal Audit Manager and a representative of 
the external auditor, normally attend Audit Committee meetings, 
except where not appropriate. 
This year the Committee’s particular focus was on QNA risks,  
issues and mitigating actions, and on the development of a more 
robust review process for the business’s self-assessment and 
certification exercise.  Corporate governance 
Corporate governance report continued 
32 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
Consideration of the audit process for the full-year and interim 
results was the principal areas of focus for the Audit Committee. 
The Committee also assessed the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function and adequacy of resourcing levels. As part of its 
review of internal controls, the Committee focused in particular  
on those matters which had failed to achieve at least a 
‘satisfactory’ audit rating in the year, and the management plans 
to address the issues raised by the Internal Audit function. 
In the context of the Group’s North American business, the 
Committee undertook two in-depth reviews of the internal 
controls environment across QNA, which included contract 
administration, cost accounting and billing. The Committee also 
reviewed the activities of the tax, insurance and treasury functions 
in detail, as well as overseeing the level of KPMG’s audit fees.  
The Committee confirms its view that it has received sufficient, 
reliable and timely information from management in the last 
financial year to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities. 
In order to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, the 
Committee ensures that any other advisory and/or consulting 
services provided by the external auditor do not conflict with their 
statutory audit responsibilities and are conducted through entirely 
separate working teams; such advisory and/or consulting services 
generally only cover regulatory reporting, tax and mergers and 
acquisitions work. Any non-audit services conducted by the auditor 
require the consent of the CFO or the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee before being initiated, with any such services 
exceeding £50,000 in value requiring the consent of the Audit 
Committee as a whole. In the last financial year, the non-audit 
activity conducted by KPMG, on behalf of QinetiQ, which exceeded 
this £50,000 threshold, related to the provision of support to the 
US Services business in relation to the acquisition of Cyveillance 
Inc. in the previous year. The Committee concluded that this 
service did not create any conflict of interest that might 
compromise the independence of KPMG audit work. 
It is also QinetiQ’s policy that no KPMG employee may be 
appointed into a senior position within the QinetiQ Group without 
the prior approval of the CFO. The cost and nature of non-audit 
work undertaken by the auditor was reviewed by the Committee 
on several occasions during the last financial year. This process 
enables the Committee to take corrective action if it believes that 
there is a risk of the auditor’s independence being undermined 
through the award of such work. 
KPMG has been the Company’s auditor since 2003. The members 
of the Audit Committee have declared themselves satisfied with 
the performance of KPMG as the Company’s auditor in the last 
financial year. A rotation of KPMG’s lead audit partner was last 
undertaken during 2008. It is anticipated that he will continue in 
this role for a maximum term of five years. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Noreen Doyle.  
The Committee sets remuneration and incentives for Executive 
Directors; approves and monitors remuneration and incentives  
for the Group. The other Committee members are Colin Balmer, 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent and Mark Elliott. The Committee 
meets as necessary although normally not less than three times a 
year. During the financial year ended 31 March 2011, the 
Remuneration Committee met on seven occasions. Although not 
members of the Committee, the CEO, the HR Director and the 
Group Reward Director normally attended meetings to provide 
information and advice to the Committee.  
During the year, the Committee received advice from its appointed 
independent advisors, Towers Watson, and from Kepler Associates. 
Towers Watson provided other consulting services during the year 
to QinetiQ but did not provide advice on executive remuneration 
matters other than to the Committee. Market data was provided 
by Towers Watson and Hewitt New Bridge Street who also 
provided advice to assist the Committee to determine whether 
performance targets had been met. 
No employee of QinetiQ is permitted to participate in discussions 
about their own remuneration. 
The Committee has reviewed the changes in the new UK 
Governance Code relating to the remuneration and rewards of  
the Company’s Executive Directors and senior management. As  
a result the Committee has taken steps to update its processes  
to ensure that: 
• the level of reward given to the Executive Directors and senior 
management is stretching and designed to promote the long-
term success of the company; and 
• remuneration incentives remain consistent with the Company’s 
risk management policies and systems. 
Executive Directors are not present when their own remuneration 
is being discussed. Further information on the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee during the last financial year are set out 
in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 36 to 44. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Sir David Lees.  
The Committee ensures that the composition of the Board and 
Committees has the optimum balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience. The other Committee members are Colin Balmer,  
Mark Elliott and Leo Quinn, and David Langstaff until his departure. 
The Committee meets as necessary and when called by its Chair. 
During the financial year ended 31 March 2011, the Committee 
met and consulted informally on a number of occasions around 
Board meetings, as required. 
The principal focus of the Committee’s activities during the 
financial year ended 31 March 2011 was to review QinetiQ’s 
succession planning processes at both the Executive and Non-
executive Director levels. 
The Committee also oversaw the appointment of one new Non- 
executive Director, which culminated in the appointment of Paul 
Murray in October 2010.

Compliance Committee 
The Compliance Committee is chaired by Sir David Lees. The 
Committee’s primary purpose is to monitor adherence to the MOD 
Compliance Regime. In addition, it keeps a watching brief over 
those areas of risk where the principal impact is not financial, 
including security, trade controls, ethics and health, safety and 
environment. The other Committee members are Colin Balmer, 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, Mark Elliott, Admiral Edmund 
P.Giambastiani Jr, Paul Murray and Leo Quinn. The Committee 
meets as necessary although normally not less than four times  
a year. During the financial year ended 31 March 2011, the 
Compliance Committee met on four occasions. This financial  
year the Committee has focused on ethics, the QNA Proxy Regime, 
Health, Safety and the Environment, Trade Controls, Security and 
trials involving human subjects that fall within the scope of the 
Helsinki Protocol. In addition, the Committee is providing oversight 
for 12 project areas established to address the recommendations 
of the Sir Robert Nelson Report completed as a result of the 
Haddon-Cave Review. These projects include specific activities 
relating to aerospace assurances and safety work in addition to the 
governance of advice services, general projects seeking to simplify 
QinetiQ’s Competency and Assurance Frameworks and the 
processes of QinetiQ’s Business Management System.  
The Committee continues to monitor the Compliance Regime, 
which is designed to give MOD customers confidence that QinetiQ 
is able to provide impartial advice during any competitive 
evaluation of a procurement where QinetiQ wishes to operate on 
both the ‘buy’ and the ‘supply’ sides. QinetiQ is required by its 
Articles of Association to implement a Compliance Regime, which 
was established on its creation out of The Defence Evaluation and 
Research Agency (DERA). Central to this Regime is the requirement 
for QinetiQ to seek permission from the MOD prior to providing 
commercial defence services to others where there is potential  
for a conflict of interest with the services that QinetiQ provides  
to the MOD. 
In designing the Compliance Regime, the MOD and QinetiQ  
sought to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of the 
procurement customers within the MOD (principally Defence 
Equipment and Support) and the need to allow QinetiQ flexibility 
to exploit research into the supply chain and pursue its planned 
commercial activities, without compromising the defence or 
security interests of the UK. The Compliance Regime is largely  
self-policing, in that it is applied by QinetiQ in respect of its 
activities without extensive intervention or oversight by the MOD. 
Since the inception of the Compliance Regime, over 97% of the 
requests to the MOD to allow QinetiQ to operate on the supply 
side of the commercial defence market have been approved. 
Oversight of the operation of the Regime is provided by the 
Compliance Committee. 
The MOD reviews the operation and effectiveness of the 
Compliance Regime, through its right to have an observer  
at the Compliance Committee meetings. 
The Board nominates two senior executives to act as Compliance 
Implementation Director and Compliance Audit Director. It 
receives a bi-annual report on the compliance areas that it 
monitors from the Internal Audit function. In respect of the 
Compliance Regime, the Committee receives a report from the 
Company’s Compliance Implementation Director which describes 
the permissions which have been sought and granted since the last 
meeting of the Committee, and the status of projects where the 
potential conflicts of interest are being managed. The Committee 
also receives, from the Compliance Audit Director, a report on the 
effectiveness of the controls that are in place to ensure that the 
Regime is operated correctly. The Committee is the forum that 
would address any issues arising out of QinetiQ’s failure to comply 
with the requirements of the Regime. The Committee reviews the 
systems that support the Compliance Regime and those that may 
have an impact on it, directing changes, if appropriate. A 
computer-based training package continues to be used to ensure 
that all relevant employees have a satisfactory knowledge of the 
operation of the Regime. For key roles, competence is 
demonstrated by passing an annual mandatory test. 
During the year, a total of eight new permissions were sought from 
the MOD under the Compliance Regime, where potential conflicts 
of interest were identified by QinetiQ. Of these eight requests, 
seven were approved and one remained outstanding at the end  
of March 2011. At the end of the year, 12 firewalls were in place. 
Since vesting in 2001, a total of 130 firewalls have operated with 
118 now closed. A firewall is a series of rules and procedures 
governing written and oral communication between employees 
contributing to products in an MOD competition with industry 
(outside the wall) and employees assessing those products for 
MOD (inside the wall). No breaches of the MOD Compliance 
Regime were noted during the year. This year, the Committee  
has continued to have oversight, through quarterly reporting,  
on Health, Safety and Environment, Trade Controls, Ethics and 
Security from the heads of those functions within the business.  
A summary of the key focus and activities of the Health, Safety  
and Environment and Ethics functions is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on page 24. 
Security Committee 
The Security Committee is chaired by Colin Balmer. The other 
Committee members are Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent,  
Sir David Lees, David Mellors, Paul Murray and Leo Quinn. The 
Committee was established in June 2009 to enable UK nationals on 
the Board to consider matters of a UK national security dimension 
which have an impact on QinetiQ’s UK business.  
Risk Management and Internal controls 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness in safeguarding 
shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets. Such a system is 
designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. QinetiQ managers are responsible for the  Corporate governance 
Corporate governance report continued 
34 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their 
areas of business, together with the design and operation of 
suitable internal controls to ensure effective mitigation. These 
risks, which are related to the achievement of business objectives, 
are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a 
variety of internal and external events, including control 
breakdowns, competition, disruption, regulatory requirements  
and natural and other catastrophes. The Board and the Audit 
Committee regularly review significant risks to the business. 
An annual process of hierarchical self-certification has been 
established within the organisation which provides a documented 
and auditable trail of accountability for the operation of the system 
of internal control. This self-certification process is informed by a 
rigorous and structured self-assessment that addresses all the 
guidance cited in the Combined Code and compliance with 
Company policy. The process provides for successive assurances  
to be given at increasingly higher levels of management and, 
finally, to the Board. The process is informed by the Internal  
Audit function, which also provides a degree of assurance as  
to the operation and validity of the system of internal control.  
The centrally provided internal audit programme is prioritised 
according to risks identified by the Company and is integrated 
across all business and functional dimensions, thereby reducing 
issues of overlap or gaps in coverage. These risks are identified 
dynamically and the Board is involved in this process as well as  
the QET and the QNA Executive Team. 
The Audit Committee reviews, on behalf of the Board, the risk 
management process and the system of internal control necessary 
to manage risks and presents its findings to the Board. Internal 
Audit independently reviews the risk identification and control 
processes implemented by management and reports to the  
Audit Committee. Where areas for improvement in the system  
of internal control are identified, the Board considers the 
recommendations made by the QET, the QNA Executive Team,  
the Audit Committee and the Compliance Committee. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the assurance process, ensuring 
that an appropriate mix of techniques is used to obtain the level  
of assurance required by the Board. It presents its findings to the 
Board on a regular basis. The Board reviewed the effectiveness  
of the system of internal control that was in operation during the 
financial year ended 31 March 2011. The Board also routinely 
challenges the management to ensure that the systems of internal 
control are constantly improving to maintain their continuing 
effectiveness. 
QinetiQ has in place internal procedures which are designed  
to comply with international best practice in relation to the 
prevention of corruption. During this year QinetiQ has undertaken 
significant activity to review and update its business processes 
relating to its ethics and anti-corruption policies and procedures, 
particularly in response to the new UK Bribery Act. This activity  
has included: 
• continuing to provide computer based training for all 
employees; 
• providing more in depth training on business ethics and risk 
management best practice for employees who are involved  
in overseas business; and 
• developing a new Group-wide Code of Conduct dealing with 
ethical best practice and compliance with the regulatory 
environments within which the Company operates.  
Compliance with anti-corruption legislation is further facilitated  
by the engagement of independent, internationally recognised 
organisations, such as TRACE, who conduct anti-corruption due 
diligence reviews of all third-party agents overseas. 
Going concern 
The Group’s activities, combined with the factors that are likely to 
affect its future development and performance, are set out in the 
CEO’s Review on pages 4 to 11. The CFO’s Review on pages 12 to 
17 sets out details on the financial position of the Group, the cash 
flows, committed borrowing facilities, liquidity and the Group’s 
policies and processes for managing both its capital and financial 
risks. Note 28 to the financial statements also provides details of 
the Group’s hedging activities, financial instruments and its 
exposure to liquidity and credit risk. 
The market conditions in which the Group operates have been, 
and are expected to continue to be, challenging as spending from 
the Group’s key customers in its primary markets in the UK and US 
remains under pressure. Despite these challenges, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well positioned to manage its overall 
business risks successfully.  
After making the appropriate enquiries, including a review of the 
latest two-year budget for cash flow and results, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Consequently, the Annual Report and Accounts have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.   
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 35 
Communication with shareholders 
The Company attaches significant importance to the effectiveness 
of its communications with shareholders. During the last financial 
year, the Company has maintained regular dialogue with 
institutional shareholders and the financial community, which  
has included presentations of the full-year and interim results, 
including investor ‘road shows’ held in the UK and US and regular 
meetings with major shareholders and industry analysts. In 
addition, each member of the Board attended the Company’s  
AGM in July 2010 and Interim Results and were available to take 
questions. The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and 
Non-executive Directors make themselves available to meet with 
shareholders as required. All shareholders and potential 
shareholders can gain access to the Annual Report, presentations 
to investors and other significant information about QinetiQ on  
the Company’s website, www.QinetiQ.com 
Holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM at 
which the Company highlights key business developments during 
the year and at which shareholders have an opportunity to ask 
questions. The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, 
Compliance and Security Committees are available at that meeting 
to answer any questions on the work of the Committees. The 
Company confirms that it will send the AGM Notice and relevant 
documentation to all shareholders at least 20 working days before 
the date of the AGM. 
For those shareholders who have elected to receive 
communications electronically, notice is given of the availability  
of documents on the Investor Relations Section of the Group’s 
website. All shareholders will be entitled to vote on the resolutions 
put to the AGM and, to ensure that all votes are counted, a poll 
will be taken on all the resolutions in the Notice of Meeting. The 
results of the votes on the resolutions will be published on the 
Group’s website.  
Responsibility for maintaining regular communications with 
shareholders rests with the Executive Team, led by the CEO, 
assisted by an investor relations function which reports to the CFO. 
The Board is informed on a regular basis of key shareholder issues, 
including share price performance, the composition of the 
shareholder register and City expectations. 
During the coming year the Company will be looking to continue  
to improve the quality of its engagement with shareholders and 
explore with investors any additional practical means by which it 
can give effect to the requirements of the Stewardship Code and 
the new UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Management and control of US subsidiaries 
QinetiQ’s principal US subsidiaries are currently required by the  
US National Industrial Security Program to maintain facility security 
clearances and to be insulated from foreign ownership, control  
or influence. To comply with these requirements, QinetiQ North 
America, Inc. (QNA) (formerly known as QinetiQ North America 
Operations, LLC) a wholly-owned subsidiary of QinetiQ in the US 
and the holding company for the substantive part of QinetiQ’s 
North American operations, and the US DoD, have entered into a 
proxy agreement that regulates the ownership, management and 
operation of these companies. Pursuant to this proxy agreement, 
QinetiQ has appointed four US citizens (Peter Marino, Riley 
Mixson, John Currier and Vince Vitto) holding requisite US security 
clearances as proxy holders to exercise the voting rights of QNA’s 
shares in the US subsidiaries. The proxy holders are also appointed 
as directors of the relevant US subsidiaries and, in addition to their 
powers as directors, have power under the proxy arrangements to 
exercise all prerogatives of share ownership of QNA. The proxy 
holders have a fiduciary duty to, and agree to perform their role in 
the best interests of shareholders, and consistent with the national 
security interests of the US. 
QinetiQ plc does not have any representation on the boards of the 
subsidiaries covered by the proxy agreement and does not have 
the right to attend board meetings. QinetiQ plc may not remove 
the proxy holders except for acts of gross negligence or wilful 
misconduct or for breach of the proxy agreement (with the 
consent of the US Defense Security Service). 
In terms of the power to govern, the proxy agreement vests certain 
powers solely with the proxy holders and certain powers solely 
with QinetiQ. For example, QinetiQ can, at its sole discretion, 
direct the proxy holders to: 
• sell or dispose, in any manner, capital assets or the business  
of QNA; 
• pledge, mortgage or encumber assets of QNA for purposes 
other than obtaining working capital or funds for capital 
improvements; 
• merge, consolidate, reorganise or dissolve QNA; and 
• file or make any petition under the federal bankruptcy laws  
or similar law or statute of any state or any foreign country. 
The proxy holders cannot carry out any of the above actions 
without the express approval of QinetiQ. Unlike minority interest 
holders with protective veto rights, QinetiQ can unilaterally require 
the above to be carried out and these are therefore considered 
significant participative features. In addition, QinetiQ can require 
the payment of dividends, and the pay down of parent company 
loans, from QNA.  Corporate governance 
Remuneration report 
36 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
The key purpose of the Remuneration 
Committee is to ensure that the 
remuneration structure supports the 
Company’s strategy and that we are able 
to attract, retain and motivate the highest 
calibre executives while rewarding the 
creation of long-term sustainable value. 
Noreen Doyle  
Chair, Remuneration Committee 
Introduction 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report  
on Directors’ remuneration for the year to 31 March 2011. 
The primary objectives of our remuneration policy remain 
unchanged: 
• attracting and retaining top talent 
• incentivising key executives and managers 
• driving superior performance in both the short and long term 
• alignment with the interests of shareholders. 
During the year, the Committee, with its advisors, developed  
a new long-term incentive plan, the Value Sharing Plan (VSP). This 
was approved by Shareholders at a General Meeting in July 2010. 
The VSP resulted from the Committee’s review of Executive 
Remuneration and increases the alignment of Executives’ interests 
and those of shareholders. The environment for the Company 
continues to be challenging and we will maintain our focus on 
providing Executive Remuneration programmes appropriate  
to the Company’s strategy.  
Following a market based review of executive salaries and 
incentive plans, a salary increase has been approved for the  
Group Chief Finance Officer (CFO) in July 2011 for the first time  
in three years. This increase will bring closer alignment to the 
market median. The Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) proposed 
that he should not be considered for a base salary increase. 
To improve market competitiveness for the senior executives,  
the on-target and maximum annual bonus opportunities for the 
CEO and CFO will be increased to 50% and 125% of base salary, 
respectively, with a corresponding increase from 30% to 40%  
for mandatory bonus deferral of any bonus awarded.  
Noreen Doyle 
Chair, Remuneration Committee

Report of the Remuneration Committee 
The following Report of the Remuneration Committee has been 
approved by the Board for submission to shareholders. 
The Report covers the remuneration of Directors and includes 
specific disclosures relating to their compensation, shares and 
other interests. The report also describes the share-based 
incentive plans available to Executive Directors and to other 
employees. This report has been prepared and, where 
appropriate, audited, in accordance with the requirements of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 and the FSA Listing Rules.

Governance  
The Committee is chaired by Noreen Doyle and all its members are 
Non-executive Directors. In the financial year 2010/2011,  
the Committee met seven times. 
During the year, the Committee received advice from its 
appointed independent advisors, Towers Watson, and from Kepler 
Associates. Towers Watson provided other consulting services 
during the year to QinetiQ but did not provide advice on executive 
remuneration matters other than to the Committee. Market data 
was provided by Towers Watson and Hewitt New Bridge Street 
who also advised on whether performance targets had been met. 
The Group Chief Executive (CEO), Group HR Director and  
Group Reward Director also provided information and advice 
to the Committee.     QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37

Directors’ remuneration policy 
The Committee aims to maintain a remuneration policy, consistent 
with the Company’s business strategy and objectives, which: 
• attracts, retains and motivates individuals of high calibre; 
• is responsive to both Company and personal  
performance; and 
• competitive within relevant employment markets. 
The remuneration policy is built on the following philosophy: 
• remuneration packages are structured to support business 
strategy and conform to current best practice; 
• appropriate rewards are given for meeting specific target 
objectives set at the beginning of each year; 
• incremental compensation is achieved for attaining stretch 
performance targets; 
• objectives are measured on metrics designed to be consistent 
with sustainable long-term business performance; and 
• to monitor pay and employment conditions elsewhere in  
the Group. 
The total remuneration levels of the Executive Directors are 
reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account: 
• performance of the executive against specific targets; 
• competitive market practice and remuneration levels; and 
• the general economic environment. 
Base salary 
Annual salary 2010/2011 2009/2010
Leo Quinn £580,000 £580,000
David Mellors £300,000 £300,000
Executive Directors’ base salaries are reviewed annually as are 
those for all other employees. There were no increases in salaries 
for the Executive Directors in 2010/2011 while the majority of 
employees within QinetiQ received salary increases. 
External remuneration consultants provide data on salary levels in 
the markets in which QinetiQ operates. For comparison purposes: 
company type, sector and size in terms of both market 
capitalisation and turnover. 
Based on this market review, a salary increase of £70,000 pa 
(23.3%) has been approved for the CFO for the coming year, 
effective 1 July 2011, to bring the CFO salary to market median, 
reflecting also personal performance, potential and competitive 
factors. The Group CEO proposed that he should not be 
considered for a base salary increase. 
Benefits  
Benefits may include a pension or contribution in lieu, car 
allowance, health insurance, life insurance and membership of  
the Group’s employee Share Incentive Plan which is open to all  
UK employees. 
The Group’s policy is to offer all UK employees membership in the 
QinetiQ Pension Scheme, as described in note 39 to the financial 
statements. Executives whose benefits are likely to exceed the 
Lifetime Allowance may opt out of the QinetiQ Pension Plan. In 
such cases, the individual will be paid a supplement in lieu of 
pension contributions.  
In 2010/2011, Leo Quinn received contributions of 25% of base 
salary in lieu of a pension. David Mellors is a member of the 
Company’s DC pension scheme and the Company contributes  
20% of base salary. In line with legislative changes, for 2011/2012, 
contributions for David Mellors will be restructured to comply with 
the new annual allowance of £50,000 and the difference paid as 
cash in lieu of pension.

Annual bonus continued 
During 2010/2011, financial targets were significantly exceeded, 
resulting in excellent cash flow and cost reduction, enabling 
substantial net debt reduction and early re-financing of the credit 
facility. Annual bonuses have been earned as indicated on page  
37 and in the Directors’ Remuneration table later in this report.  
After its review of executive salary and incentive plans, the 
Committee agreed that, for 2011/2012, the on-target and 
maximum bonus opportunities will be increased to 50% and  
125% of base salary, respectively, to bring closer alignment  
to the competitive market.  
Part of all annual cash bonuses earned are deferred and paid  
in shares, as described below. 
Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Plan  
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan aligns the interests of executives 
with shareholders and aids retention of key individuals by ensuring 
that executives are incentivised to take part of their annual bonus 
awards in shares rather than cash. 
Executive Directors have a mandatory deferral of 30% of any 
bonus earned and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their bonus 
into QinetiQ shares. Any deferred bonus will be matched based on 
EPS performance up to a maximum match of 100% of the deferred 
element. After its review of executive salary and incentive plans, 
for 2011/2012, the mandatory deferral will be increased to 40%  
of any bonus earned with a voluntary deferral up to 60%, to 
complement the changes outlined above in the annual bonus 
target opportunities. 
In order for the matching shares to vest, EPS growth, measured 
over three years, must exceed defined targets: EPS must grow by 
at least 22.5% over three years for any matching shares to vest,  
at which point deferred shares will be matched with one share for 
every four deferred. Vesting increases pro rata to EPS growth up 
to a maximum match of one share for every one deferred if EPS 
growth of 52% is achieved over three years, as illustrated below. 
Awards are in the form of matching shares delivered after three 
years, subject to the achievement of the EPS-based performance 
conditions. 
 
Where an individual participates in the DAB and also receives  
an award under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), they will not 
receive share awards which, in aggregate, exceed 150% of base 
salary for any one year. 
Long-term incentives for Executive Directors 
The objective of QinetiQ’s long-term incentive programmes  
for Executive Directors is to align their rewards with returns  
to shareholders by a focus on increasing shareholder value over 
the medium to long term. 
In addition to the DAB plan, Executive Directors are eligible for 
long-term incentives which have taken two forms: the Value 
Sharing Plan (VSP) and the Performance Share Plan (PSP). An 
Executive Director who is granted an award under the VSP may 
not also be granted an award under the PSP for the same granting 
year and vice versa.  
These are the principal means for long-term incentivisation  
of the Executive Directors and the direct reports of the CEO.  
The Committee considered various performance conditions and 
determined that the criteria set out below were appropriate to 
incentivise the long-term creation of shareholder value for 
2010/2011.  
Value Sharing Plan (VSP) 
The Value Sharing Plan was approved by shareholders in July 2010. 
It is an annual, long-term incentive plan designed to reinforce 
QinetiQ’s strategy of focusing on shareholder value creation. 
Leo Quinn, David Mellors and a limited number of senior 
executives participate in the VSP, which rewards executives with  
a pre-determined number of shares for every £1m of value 
created over and above three-year performance hurdles. 
On 29 July 2010 Leo Quinn was granted an award under which  
he will be entitled to receive 2,000 QinetiQ Group shares for  
each £1m of additional shareholder value (ASV) created (above a 
hurdle) in respect of the performance period beginning on 1 April 
2010. On the same date David Mellors was granted an award 
under which he will be entitled to receive 1,000 QinetiQ Group 
shares for each £1m of additional shareholder value created in 
respect of the same performance period.

on QinetiQ’s TSR out-performance of the FTSE 250 index 
(excluding Investment Trusts). Participants will be entitled to a 
vesting of shares under the TSR Element only if the Committee 
is satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial 
performance of the Company over the performance period. 
 
 
Example 
QinetiQ’s average market capitalisation over the three months to  
31 March 2010 was £906m. 
 
Assume that QinetiQ’s TSR over the period was 30%, the TSR for the 
FTSE250 Index is 20% and the executive receives 1,000 shares per £1m 
ASV.  
 
Additional shareholder value based on TSR is therefore: 
     QinetiQ TSR out-performance of 10% (= 30% - 20%) 
     multiplied by QinetiQ market capitalisation of £906m 
     equals ASV based on TSR of £90.6m (=10% x £906m) 
 
In this example the executive would therefore receive 27,180 shares 
based on TSR. 
 (= £90.6m x 1,000 shares per £1m x 30% of award based on TSR) 
 
 
• Profit Before Tax (PBT) - the remaining 70% of each award will 
be determined by growth above the cost of equity of 8.5% a 
year, adjusted by the dividend yield. 
 
 
Example 
QinetiQ’s average market capitalisation over the three months to  
31 March 2010 was £906m. 
 
Group adjusted PBT for the financial year ending 31 March 2010 was 
£88.2m. 
 
Market capitalisation as a (fixed) multiple of PBT for 2010 VSP awards is 
therefore 10.27 (= £906m/£88.2m). 
Assume Group adjusted PBT for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 
is £115m, and dividends to shareholders over the three-year period 
amount to £80m (including interest rolled up at 8.5% p.a.). 
 
Additional shareholder value based on PBT is therefore: 
    PBT in FY 2013 of £115m multiplied by the fixed multiple of 10.27 
    equals a value of £1,181m (= £115m x 10.27)  
    plus £80m (rolled-up dividends) equals £1,261m (= £1,181m +£80m) 
    less cost of equity hurdle of £1,157m (= £906m x (1+8.5%)
3
)
 
    
 equals ASV for PBT element of award of £104m (= £1,261m - £1,157m) 
 
In this example the executive would therefore receive 72,800 shares 
based on PBT. 
(= £104.0m x 1,000 shares per £1m x 70% of award based on PBT) 
 
For 2011/2012, reflecting the changed defence environment and 
following the good work by the executive team, the Remuneration 
Committee decided that VSP awards should be subject to an equal 
weighting of the two performance indicators to 50% TSR and 50% 
PBT. This combination provides a balanced approach between the 
internal measure (PBT) and the external measure (TSR) and 
provides an appropriate balance between shareholder and senior 
management line of sight. The award quotient for Leo Quinn and 
David Mellors has been reduced to 1,800 and 900 shares 
respectively to complement the annual bonus adjustments, 
outlined opposite. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
There were no awards of performance shares under the PSP to 
Executive Directors in 2010/2011, although awards remain 
outstanding from prior years.  
PSP awards are contingent on meeting pre-determined 
performance criteria. Individual participants’ award levels are 
determined by the Committee annually based on these criteria 
and, with due consideration of business and personal 
performance. 
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards with a value  
of up to 100% of base salary per annum and other executives  
up to 75% of base salary per annum. Awards are earned based  
on an equal weighting of relative total shareholder return  
(TSR) performance and absolute underlying earnings per share 
(EPS) growth. 
The EPS performance criterion for the PSP awards that were made 
in 2009/2010 and earlier years was the same as that applied to the 
DAB (outlined above). 
TSR performance for the purposes of PSP awards made in 
2009/2010 and earlier years is measured against the constituents 
of the following comparator group of companies:  
Babcock International plc Invensys plc 
BAE Systems plc Logica plc 
BBA Aviation plc Meggitt plc 
Bodycote  
International plc 
The Morgan Crucible  
Company plc 
Capita Group plc Rolls-Royce plc

Halma plc Victrex Group plc 
Hampson Industries PLC WS Atkins plc 
IMI plc   Corporate governance 
Remuneration report continued 
40 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) continued 
The TSR element is earned only if relative performance is at least 
at median against this comparator group over a three-year 
performance period, calculated by an independent third party.  
The graph below illustrates the TSR performance condition. 
Personal shareholding policy 
The Committee believes that a meaningful way to align Executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders is for the Executives to build 
up and retain a personal holding in QinetiQ shares.  
The CEO and CFO are required to hold shares in QinetiQ with a 
value equivalent to one times their base salary in QinetiQ shares. 
David Mellors, who joined on 20 August 2008, has been given four 
years to build up such a shareholding. Leo Quinn has already met 
the Committee’s guideline on minimum shareholding 
requirement. 
Direct reports of the CEO are required to hold the equivalent  
of 50% of their base salary in QinetiQ shares. These can be 
accumulated over a four year period following appointment. 
Directors’ terms and conditions 
Service agreements for the Executive and the Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually and amended as appropriate.

QinetiQ’s policy is that Executive Directors should have service agreements with a rolling term providing for a maximum of one year’s 
notice. Consequently, no Executive Director has a contractual notice period in excess of 12 months. In the event of early termination, 
this ensures that compensation is restricted to a maximum of 12 months’ basic salary and benefits. The Committee will generally 
consider mitigation to reduce the compensation payable to a departing Executive Director.

Non-executive Directors’ terms, conditions and fees 
The Group Chairman reviews the fees of the Non-executive 
Directors, other than his own, and makes recommendations to 
the Board. Non-executive Directors receive additional fees as 
agreed by the Board for chairing Board committees to take 
account of the additional responsibilities of the role. The 
Chairman’s fees are reviewed by the Senior Independent Non-
executive Director who makes recommendations to the Board. 
The level of fees paid by UK organisations of a similar size and 
complexity to QinetiQ is considered in setting the 
remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors. The fees are 
neither performance related nor pensionable. Non-executive 
Directors are not eligible to participate in bonus, profit sharing 
or employee share schemes.  
A review of Non-executive Director’s fees was carried out in 
July 2010, using an independent market survey, which resulted 
in no changes being made to the existing fee structures as 
shown below:  
 
2010/2011 Fees
Non-executive Chairman £225,000
Basic fee for UK Non-executive Director £40,000
Basic fee for US resident Non-executive Director 
US$100,000
 or £50,000
Additional fee for chairing a Committee £7,000
Additional fee to Deputy Chairman/Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director 
£10,000
As the Group Chairman is a US resident, the Board has agreed 
an accommodation allowance of £75,000 per annum. 
Excluding the Group Chairman, an additional fee of US$4,000 is 
payable to US-resident Non-executive Directors when they 
attend Board Meetings in the UK. With effect from 29 July 
2010, to align UK Non-executive Directors, UK resident Non-
executive Directors, are paid an additional fee of £2,500 for 
attending meetings held in the US.  
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are renewed 
on a rolling 12 month basis subject to reappointment at the 
Annual General Meeting. There are no provisions for 
compensation on early termination. 
Management of share based rewards 
The Committee also oversees arrangements for share-based 
reward in respect of managers and the wider workforce.  
Employee plans 
The Share Incentive Plan is operated in the UK and Australia in 
the form of a share purchase award with matching company 
contribution to encourage employee ownership and 
engagement in the business. 
Executive plans 
In addition to the VSP and PSP, the Company operates the 
following executive share plans: 
• QinetiQ Share Option Scheme (QSOS) – no awards were 
made during the year under QSOS but provision exists  
for annual awards up to a face value of 300% of salary. 
• Stock Award Plan – Restricted Stock Units (RSU) – RSU 
awards are used in QinetiQ North America to retain and 
motivate senior managers. The RSU awards vest in four 
equal tranches over a four-year period. Vesting of half  
of the award is subject to time-based vesting criteria and 
vesting of the other half is subject to performance criteria 
linked to organic profit growth as follows:  
% Organic operating income 
growth achieved % RSU award vesting 
<5% 0% 
5%-12.5% Between 25%-100% (linear) 
>12.5%-15% 100%-125% (linear) 
Awards are granted based on business performance, balanced 
with the need to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
employees. Executive Directors do not participate in the two 
plans shown. 
Dilution limits  
In accordance with ABI guidelines, no more than 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital will be used under all of the 
Company’s share schemes during a ten year period. The 
dilution as at 31 March 2011 was significantly below this  
10% level, and below 5% in respect of executive schemes. In 
addition, the Board intends to continue to satisfy a proportion 
of awards with purchased shares held in an employee benefit 
trust.

  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45 
Principal activity 
QinetiQ Group plc is a public limited company, listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and incorporated in England and Wales 
with registered number 4586941. 
QinetiQ Group plc is the parent company of a Group whose 
principal activities during the year were the supply of technical 
support, training, test and evaluation, and know-how to customers 
in the global defence, aerospace and security markets. Customers 
include government organisations, such as the UK MOD and the 
US DoD and a range of other government and commercial 
customers globally. 
Research and development 
One of the Group’s principal business streams is the provision  
of funded research and development (R&D) for customers. The 
Group also invests in the commercialisation of promising 
technologies across all areas of business. 
The majority of R&D-related expenditure is incurred on behalf of 
customers as part of specific funded research contracts. R&D costs 
are included in the income statement and R&D income is reflected 
within revenue. In the financial year, the Group recorded £395.0m 
(2010: £425.6m) of total R&D-related expenditure, of which 
£382.0m was customer-funded work (2010: £418.3m). 
In the year to 31 March 2011, £13.0m (2010: £7.3m) of internally 
funded R&D was charged to the income statement. £0.3m  
(2010: £0.6m) of late-stage development costs was capitalised  
and £2.2m (2010: £3.0m) of capitalised development costs was 
amortised in the year. 
Policy and practice on payment of suppliers 
The policy of the Group is to agree terms of payment prior to 
commencing trade with a supplier and to abide by those terms 
based on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices. In the 
financial year to 31 March 2011 the Group has implemented a 
policy of agreeing payment terms of not less than 60 days with 
suppliers, except in exceptional circumstances. At 31 March 2011, 
the trade creditors of the Group represented 24 days of annual 
purchases (2010: 28 days). 
Political and charitable contributions 
QinetiQ does not make political donations to parties as that term 
would be commonly recognised. The legal definition of that term 
is, however, quite broad and may have the effect of covering a 
number of normal business activities that would not commonly be 
perceived to be political donations, such as sponsorship of events. 
These may include legitimate interactions in making MPs and 
others in the political world aware of key industry issues and 
matters affecting QinetiQ, which make an important contribution 
to their understanding of QinetiQ, the markets in which it operates 
and their constituents work. During the last financial year this 
expenditure amounted to no more than £15,000 (2010: £15,000).  
Charitable donations during the year across the Group amounted 
to £196,900 (2010: £114,100). 
Share capital 
As at 31 March 2011 the Company had allotted and fully paid  
up share capital of 660,476,373 ordinary shares of 1p each with  
an aggregate nominal value of £6.6m (including shares held by 
employee share trusts) and one Special Share with an aggregate 
nominal value of £1. 
Details of the shares issued during the financial year are shown  
in note 33 on page 92. 
The rights of ordinary shareholders are set out in the Articles of 
Association. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
the Company’s reports and accounts, to attend and speak at 
General Meetings of the Company, to exercise voting rights in 
person or by appointing a proxy and to receive a dividend where 
declared or paid out of profits available for such a purpose. 
The Special Share is held by HM Government through the 
Secretary of State for Defence and it confers certain rights under 
the Articles of Association which are detailed in note 33 on page 
92. These include the right to require certain persons with a 
material interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their 
ordinary shares on the grounds of national security or conflict of 
interest. The Special Share may only be held by and transferred to 
HM Government. At any time the Special Shareholder may require 
QinetiQ to redeem the share at par and if wound up the Special 
Shareholder would be entitled to be repaid capital before other 
shareholders. Any variation of the rights attaching to the Special 
Share requires the written approval of the MOD.  Corporate governance

Change of control – significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counter parties to require prior approval, exercise termination, 
alteration or other similar rights in the event of a change of control 
of the Company or if the Company no longer remains a UK 
company: 
• The Combined Aerial Target Service contract is a 20-year 
contract awarded to QinetiQ by MOD on 14 December 2006. 
The terms of this contract require QinetiQ Limited to remain a 
UK company which is incorporated under the laws of any part 
of the UK or an overseas company registered in the UK and that 
at least 50% of the Board of Directors are UK nationals. The 
terms also contain change of control conditions and restricted 
share transfer conditions which require prior approval from HM 
Government if there is a material change in the ownership of 
QinetiQ Limited’s share capital, unless the change relates to 
shares listed on a regulated market, with material defined as 
being 10% or more of the share capital. Additionally, there are 
restrictions on transfers of shares to persons from countries 
appearing on the restricted list as issued by HM Government. 
• The Long-Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) is a 25-year 
contract which QinetiQ Limited signed on 28 February 2003  
to provide test, evaluation and training services to the MOD. 
This contract contains conditions where the prior approval of 
HM Government is required if the contractor, QinetiQ Limited, 
ceases to be a subsidiary of the QinetiQ Group, except where 
such change in control is permitted under the Shareholders 
Agreement to which MOD is a party. 
The Company is party to a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, 
with a US$250m tranche and a £118m tranche, provided by the 
Group’s six global relationship banks and expiring 4 February 2016. 
Under the terms of the facility, if there is a change of control of 
the Company, any lender may request by not less than 60 days’ 
notice to the Company, that its commitment be cancelled and all 
outstanding amounts be repaid to that lender at the expiry of such 
notice period.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements 
48 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors  
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the parent company financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are  
also responsible for preparing a Directors' report, Directors' 
remuneration report and corporate governance statement  
that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect  
of the Annual Report 
We, the Directors of the Company, confirm that to the best  
of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements of the Group have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for the 
Company under UK GAAP, in accordance with applicable  
United Kingdom law and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group; and 
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that face the Group.

statements is applicable law and UK Accounting Standards  
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
 
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might  
state to the company's members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement 
set out on page 48, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, 
and express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board's (APB's) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the APB's website at 
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm. 
Opinion on financial statements

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors' report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you  
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors' remuneration report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors' statement, set out on page 34, in relation to 
going concern; 
• the part of the corporate governance statement on pages  
28 to 35 relating to the Company's compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our 
review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on Directors' remuneration.

1. Significant accounting policies 
Accounting policies 
With the exception of the accounting policy in respect of business combinations (see below), the following accounting policies have  
been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group’s financial 
statements. The Group separately presents acquisition amortisation and specific non-recurring items in the income statement which,  
in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for the reader to obtain  
a proper understanding of the financial information. Specific non-recurring items include amounts relating to restructuring costs; 
pension curtailment gains; contingent payments on acquisition treated as remuneration; net inventory write-offs in respect of 
capitalised DTR-programme bid costs; impairment of property, plant and equipment; impairment of intangible assets; gain/(loss)  
on business combinations and divestments; unrealised impairments of investments; and tax thereon. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on 
pages 103-105. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of 
available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant financial assets and liabilities. Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The Group’s reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial 
statements are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 March 
2011. The purchase method of accounting has been adopted. Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed in the period are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost (usually on acquisition 
and disposal respectively). A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies in 
order to obtain benefits. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when determining control.  
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%-50% of the equity voting rights, 
over financial and operating policy. A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control. Associates and joint 
ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal. The Group’s investments in 
associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount. Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full 
provision is made for the Group’s share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the 
associate or joint venture.  
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group 
accounting policies. 
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.  
Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added and other sales taxes on the 
following bases: 
Service contracts 
The Group’s service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue. Revenue is recognised once the Group has obtained 
the right to consideration in exchange for its performance. This is typically when title passes or contractually agreed-upon milestones  
are reached and accepted by the customer. No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably 
estimated. Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances 
for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved. When it is probable that total contract costs will 
exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense. The Group generally does not undertake 
construction contracts. 
Goods sold 
Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.  
Royalties and intellectual property  
Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates. Intellectual property revenue can be attributed to either 
perpetual licences or limited licences. Limited licences are granted for a specified time period and revenue is recognised over the period 
of the licence. Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited time frames and are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the customer.  Financial statements

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Segmental information 
Segmental information is presented according to the Group’s management structure and markets in which the Group operates.  
A simplified structure has been implemented with effect from 1 April 2010 comprising three divisions: US Services, UK Services and 
Global Products. This enables greater clarity around markets and customers aligning the Group’s capabilities in order to leverage existing 
strengths and address weaknesses systematically. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2010 have been restated  
to reflect the reorganised structure adopted at the start of the current financial year. The segments previously reported were Europe, 
Middle East and Australasia (EMEA), QinetiQ North America (QNA) and Ventures. 
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group. Corporate expenses are allocated  
to the corresponding segments. Unallocated items comprise mainly profit on disposal of non-current assets, business divestments  
and unrealised impairment of investments, financing costs and taxation. Eliminations represent inter-company trading between the 
different segments. 
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
Research and development expenditure 
Research and development costs incurred on behalf of a customer as part of a specific project are directly chargeable to the customer  
on whose behalf the work is undertaken. Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there  
is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs  
are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project. Such capitalised costs are amortised over 
the forecast period of sales resulting from the development. All other research and development costs are expensed to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, 
the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed. 
Financing 
Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial income earned 
on funds invested. Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments 
that are recognised in the income statement are included within interest income and expense in financing. 
Taxation 
The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Current tax and deferred tax are charged  
or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited to equity in which case the relevant tax  
is charged or credited to equity. Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation 
authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets  
and liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Any change in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised on 
all deductible temporary differences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention 
to settle balances on a net basis. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for as follows: 
Business combinations on or after 1 April 2010 (IFRS 3, Business Combinations) 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3. 
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the 
acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent 
consideration and share based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent 
consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement. If a business combination relates  
in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as 
contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element, is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised  
in other expenses.   
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees,  
and other professional fees and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. 
Non-controlling interests are measured at either the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised or at fair value. The method used is determined on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 
Business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 (IFRS 3, Business Combinations (2004)) 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange,  
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Previously held identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are revalued to their fair value at the date of acquisition, being the date at which the 
Group achieves control of the acquiree. The movement in fair value is taken to the asset revaluation reserve. 
Upon initial acquisition of a non-controlling interest, the interest of minority shareholders is measured at the minority’s proportion  
of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is 
included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the 
entity sold. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, 
typically between 0-9 years. Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs  
and any third-party expenses. Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation. Intangible assets are amortised  
over their respective useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: 
Intellectual property rights 2-8 years 
Development costs Useful economic life or unit of production method subject to a minimum amortisation  
of no less than straight line method over economic life of 1-4 years 
Other 1-9 years 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible non-current  
assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: 
Freehold buildings 20-25 years 
Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease 
Plant and machinery 3-10 years 
Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years 
Computers 3-5 years 
Motor vehicles 3-5 years 
Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet  
date. In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable 
costs and interest. 
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually, and if 
appropriate, adjusted accordingly. 
Impairment of tangible, goodwill, intangible and held for sale assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If the carrying amount of any 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. In addition, goodwill is 
tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the 
respective asset or the assets in the cash generating unit are written down to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of an 
asset or a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of 
the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash generating unit calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. 
Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.  Financial statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 
58 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Investments in debt and equity securities 
Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available  
for sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses.  
When these investments are de-recognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the 
income statement. 
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date. The fair value of unquoted equity investments 
are held at fair value based upon the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the 
present value of forecast future cash flows. 
Inventories 
Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work-in-progress and manufactured finished 
goods are valued at production cost. Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production 
overheads. A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost. 
Bid costs 
Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred. In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding 
process typically involves a competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close 
with the customer. In these cases, the costs incurred after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to 
the balance sheet within work-in-progress. From the point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life of the contract. 
If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs deferred to that point 
will be expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not be achieved. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts. Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and 
other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced. Payments received on account are included in trade 
and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash. In the cash flow 
statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents. 
Current and non-current liabilities 
Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group. Interest-bearing current and non-current 
liabilities are recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Costs associated with  
the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet. Capitalised 
issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method. 
If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where 
appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual 
rights that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments 
or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments. 
Fair value hedging 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the income 
statement. The hedged item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income 
statement. 
Cash flow hedging 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. 
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains 
and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability. Gains and losses previously recognised in 
equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.   
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 
Hedging of net investment in foreign operations 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity are recognised in equity until  
the net investment is sold or disposed. Any ineffective portion is recognised directly in the income statement. 
Leased assets 
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease 
payments and fair value at the inception of the lease. Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the 
lease term. Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.  
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement. 
Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on 
the underlying transaction. 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency. On consolidation, assets and 
liabilities of overseas subsidiaries associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling  
at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and  
joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period. Exchange adjustments arising from the  
re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and 
reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. The liabilities of the Group arising from 
defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined using the projected unit credit method. Valuations for 
accounting purposes are carried out half yearly for the largest plans and on a regular basis for other plans. Actuarial advice is provided  
by external consultants. For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively. 
For defined benefit plans, the actuarial cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, interest cost, expected 
return on plan assets and past service cost. The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance income and expenses, the 
remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full immediately through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Contributions to defined contribution plans are 
charged to the Income Statement as incurred. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees. The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based 
payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. 
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse. The 
value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. The charges for both equity  
and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions. 
Share capital 
Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs. Company shares held by the employee 
benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid. They are classified as own shares within equity. Any gain or loss on the purchase,  
sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity. 
Restatement of prior periods for finalisation of fair values arising on acquisitions 
The fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. All fair value  
adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and, consequently, may result in the restatement of previously 
reported financial results.  Financial statements

Recent accounting developments 
The following EU-endorsed new, revised and amended published standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2010 and have been adopted: 
IFRS 3 (revised), Business Combinations and amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The standard 
continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with some significant changes. For example, all acquisition-related 
costs are expensed, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments 
subsequently re-measured at fair value through the income statement. There are also changes to the reporting of non-controlling 
interest. The change has been applied prospectively. 
Improvements to IFRSs 2009. The improvements include changes to finance leases and financial instrument disclosures.  
These consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the revised disclosure requirements. 
The following EU-endorsed amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting  
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2010 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Group’s financial statements: 
• Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment;  
• Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation; 
• Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement; 
• IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners; 
• IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers; and 
• Management Commentary practice statement. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, 
which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material impact on the Financial Statements 
of the Group when they become applicable in future periods: 
• IAS 24 (revised), Related Party Transactions;  
• Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, subject to EU endorsement; 
• Amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes, subject to EU endorsement; 
• Amendment to IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction; and 
• IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments. 
The impact of adopting the following new and improved published standards when they become effective in future periods, but were  
in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, is under assessment: 
• IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, subject to EU endorsement;  
• IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements; 
• IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements; 
• IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; 
• IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement; and 
• Improvements to IFRSs 2010. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies 
The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of management 
judgement required in their application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for  
the Group. The level of management judgement required includes assumptions and estimates about future events which are uncertain, 
the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from that anticipated. 
Revenue and profit recognition 
The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience 
from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour 
resources required and other factors. This process is carried out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and 
contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work. No profit is recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably 
estimated. 
Business combinations 
Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated 
value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants. Such methods require the use of 
estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.  
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. This process is reliant on the use of estimates of the future 
profitability and cash flows of its cash-generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered. The Group additionally 
reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment. Further details on the sensitivity of the carrying value  
of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 11.   
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61 
Consolidation of US subsidiaries 
As described on page 35, the Group and the US DoD have entered into a proxy agreement that regulates the ownership, management 
and operation of the Group’s 100% owned subsidiary, QinetiQ North America, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Having considered the terms  
of the proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies of QinetiQ North 
America and, therefore, consolidates the subsidiaries in the consolidated accounts. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions including return on  
plan assets, discount rates, mortality, inflation and future salary and pension increases. Management exercise their best judgement,  
in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group. Small 
changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the 
deficit or the net income statement costs. Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the retirement benefit obligation 
recognised. Further details on these assumptions are set out in note 39. 
Research and development expenditure 
Internally-funded development expenditure is capitalised when criteria are met and is written off over the forecast period of sales 
resulting from the development. Management decides upon the adequacy of future demand and potential market for such new 
products in order to justify capitalisation of internally-funded development expenditure. These can be difficult to determine when 
dealing with innovative technologies. Actual product sales may differ from these estimates. 
Tax 
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery  
of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination  
is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax 
and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.  Financial statements

The UK restructuring programme announced in May 2009 was largely completed in the last financial year and the cost of the programme was £44.1m. A subsequent 24-month 
self-help programme was announced in May 2010 to refocus the businesses, to build a more commercial performance-oriented culture and to strengthen the balance sheet.  
A charge of £33.5m has been taken in the current financial year in respect of restructuring the UK business.

The gain on business divestments in the year relates to the disposal of S&IS, a non-core security operations and access control business 
within QinetiQ’s US Services operation, to ManTech International Corporation. The total consideration net of disposal costs was £37.2m 
and resulted in a gain on disposal of £2.1m. Additional cash receipts in the year included £1.0m in respect of prior year divestments. 
Total proceeds from sale of interests in subsidiary undertakings are £38.2m (2010: £21.1m). 
The gain in respect of negative goodwill on acquisitions in the period relates to the acquisition of Sensoptics Ltd on 16 December 2010  
as described in note 13. 
The gain in respect of deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions is the result of conditions for the deferred consideration in 
respect of the Cyveillance, Inc acquisition not being met. 
The prior year gain on business divestments relates to the disposal of two businesses. On 30 September 2009 the Group disposed of the 
Underwater Systems business, a division of QinetiQ Limited, to Atlas Elektronik UK Limited for a consideration before costs of £23.5m 
which resulted in a profit on disposal of £6.9m. On 31 July 2009 the Calibration business of the Group, including ASAP Calibration Ltd, 
was sold for proceeds before costs of £0.4m and resulted in a loss on disposal of £1.8m. 
The prior year unrealised impairment of investments and associated committed costs relates to a £11.3m charge in respect of the 
impairment in the carrying value of investments held for sale.

In 2011 the Group refinanced its existing credit facility with a new five-year revolving credit facility. The un-amortised amount of the fees previously capitalised in respect  
of the pre-existing facility were written off on termination of that facility and charged to Finance expense.

The Group elected to make early repayment of US$135m of US Dollar private placement debt, which was repaid post year end in May 2011 from surplus cash. Net interest  
in 2011 was impacted by an accelerated interest charge of £8.8m in respect of the year end obligation to make this early repayment.

statutory rate are explained below:

Taxation expense/(income) 21.8 (0.2) 21.6 12.9 (15.7) (2.8)
The total tax expense in the year to 31 March 2011 includes a credit of £0.2m (2010: £15.7m) for tax on acquisition amortisation and 
specific non-recurring items. The rate on this credit is low as the majority of items do not attract tax relief in the current period. 
Factors affecting future tax charges 
The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development 
relief in the UK. The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any future tax 
legislation changes and the geographical mix of profits. At 31 March 2011, the Group had unused tax losses of £188.7m (2010: £117.1m) 
potentially available for offset against future profits.  Financial statements

10. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and 
held as own shares (see note 33). For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options. Underlying basic 
earnings per share figures are presented below, in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share as the directors consider this 
gives a more relevant indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the 
impact of specific non-recurring items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and tax thereon.

 The loss attributable to equity shareholders in the year ended 31 March 2010 resulted in no effect of dilutive securities to the weighted average number of shares.  
If there had been a profit in the year ended 31 March 2010, the effect of dilutive securities would have been to increase the diluted number of shares by 4.2m.  Financial statements

 Goodwill and deferred tax liabilities have been restated to reflect fair value changes in respect of an acquisition in the year ended 31 March 2010 (see note 13). 
Goodwill at 31 March 2011 was allocated across six cash generating units (CGUs). In the year two CGUs in the US Services business  
were amalgamated into one to reflect the way in which these businesses are managed and operated.  
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future 
growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances. The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU 
annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
Key assumptions 
The value in use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two year 
period. Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the second year of the two year plan, with a terminal 
growth rate assumption applied.  
Terminal growth rates  
The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0%-3.0% (2010: 1.5%-2.5%). Growth 
rates are formed based on management’s estimates which take into consideration the long term nature of the industry in which the 
CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer-term. 
Discount rates 
The Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for 
risks specific to the geographical location of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis. The pre-tax discount rate applied for US CGUs was 
11.8% (2010: 11.8%-12.1%) and a range from 11.1%-19.0% for UK and Australia CGUs (2010: 9.3%-16.9%).    
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 71 
Significant CGUs 
Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key variables impacting on the outcome of the 
recoverable amount.  
The US Services CGU has headroom, with current assumptions, of £73.3m. If the discount rate assumption was increased by 1% then the 
CGU would require an impairment of £16.2m. Sensitivity analysis shows that an decrease or increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate 
could result in an impairment of £5.8m or headroom of £190.1m, respectively. The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 
was £369.9m. 
The Technology Solutions CGU in the US has significant headroom. An increase in either the WACC rate or decrease in the terminal 
growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. The carrying value of goodwill for this 
CGU as at 31 March was £115.3m. 
Within UK Services the individual CGUs have significant headroom. An increase in the WACC rate or a decrease in the terminal growth 
rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. The carrying value of goodwill for these CGUs 
as at 31 March was £27.6m. 
The Technology Solutions CGU in the UK has headroom, under current assumptions, of £43.4m. If the discount rate was to increase  
by 1%, or the terminal growth rate decrease by 1%, this would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. 
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was £5.8m. 
The Australia CGU has headroom, under current assumptions, of £1.1m. If the discount rate was to increase by 1%, or the terminal 
growth rate decrease by 1%, this would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. The carrying value  
of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was £2.5m. 
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions since 31 March 2011 and the signing of the 
financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.  Financial statements

Sensoptics Limited is a designer of fibre-optic sensing hardware. Sensoptics Limited was acquired to combine its technology with 
QinetiQ’s OptaSense® signal processing capabilities. The OptaSense® solution provides cost-effective around-the-clock distributed 
acoustic monitoring over long distances. 
The intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination relate to the intellectual property embodied within the Sensoptics 
Limited existing products and products under development. 
Total expected payments are in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. However, certain potential payments are linked to 
continuing employment assumptions for the retained founder management team, which would be forfeited in full should they leave 
within the stipulated period. Under IFRS 3 (revised) this type of arrangement is required to be accounted for as remuneration expense  
as opposed to part of the consideration. As a result, the acquisition resulted in negative goodwill of £0.2m, which was recognised as a 
gain in the consolidated income statement within “gain/(loss) on business combinations and divestments and unrealised impairment  
of investments”. The discounted fair value of the deferred contingent purchase price payments treated as remuneration was £6.1m  
and this was charged to the consolidated income statement within operating costs (significant non-recurring items). Acquisition-related 
costs (included within other operating costs excluding depreciation and amortisation) amount to £0.2m.  Financial statements

Adjustments to goodwill in respect of prior year acquisitions 
Cyveillance, Inc. 
The comparative figures for the balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2010 have been restated to update the initial estimate of  
the fair value of assets acquired with Cyveillance, Inc. on 1 July 2009. The tax losses acquired at the time have subsequently been valued. 
The financial effect of this is to reduce goodwill and decrease the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet by £1.9m. There is no impact 
on the Group’s reported profit before tax for these periods. An additional column has not been included on the balance sheet to show 
the opening position in relation to the restated amounts as the restatement would not have affected the opening position.

The deferred consideration of £0.4m was recognised on the acquisition of Cyveillance, Inc. based upon the estimated payment to be made. This deferred consideration  
was credited to the consolidated income statement in the year to 31 March 2011 as the conditions for the deferred consideration were not met.

 Goodwill and deferred tax liabilities have been restated to reflect fair value changes in respect of the acquisition of Cyveillance in the year ended 31 March 2010. 
Set out below are the allocations of purchase consideration, assets and liabilities of the acquisitions made in the prior year and the 
adjustments required to the book values of the assets and liabilities in order to present the net assets of these businesses at fair value 
and in accordance with Group accounting policies. The fair value adjustment in respect of deferred tax liabilities has been restated as

In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any changes in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was granted up to the reporting date. Credit risk is limited due to the high percentage of turnover being derived from UK 
and US defence and other government agencies. Accordingly, the Directors believe there is no further credit provision required in excess 
of the allowance for doubtful debts. As at 31 March 2011, the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts of £5.8m (2010: £8.8m).

 Goodwill and deferred tax liabilities have been restated to reflect fair value changes in respect of an acquisition in the year ended 31 March 2010 (see note 13). 
At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £188.7m (2010: £117.1m) potentially available for offset against future 
profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount due to uncertainty over the timing of its utilisation. These 
losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

28. Financial risk management 
The Group’s international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign 
exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks. 
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board, setting out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial 
instruments to manage risk. The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest 
rate derivatives. Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies. 
A) Fair values of financial instruments  
The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices including those within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly

allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk. For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, 
where available. Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present 
value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where  
fair value equals carrying value.

B) Interest rate risk 
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group’s 
current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30-80% of the level of borrowings, achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings,  
and also through the use of interest rate swaps. Where there are significant changes in level and or structure of debt, policy permits 
borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board review of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage. At 31 March 2011 99%  
(2010: 98%) of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates with no adjustment for interest rate swaps at 31 March 2011.

of return of those leases. 
Interest rate risk management 
The Group private placement borrowings are fixed rate, while the Revolving Credit Facility is floating rate and undrawn as at 31 March 
2011. The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2011 was £nil (31 March 2010: 
£138.4m or US$210m).   Financial statements

C) Currency risk 
Transactional currency exposure 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional 
currency. It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Group’s transactional 
hedge contracts. 
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains 
and losses recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as 
hedges of net investments in overseas entities. 
Functional currency of the operating company 
 Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities) 
all figures in £ millions US dollar Euro Australian dollar Other Total

31 March 2010 – sterling 5.1 1.4 4.1 0.4 11.0 
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.  
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases 
denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs. The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency 
contracts as at 31 March 2011 against sterling are net US dollars sold £5.4m (US$8.3m) and net Euros sold of £12.8m (€14.3m). 
Translational currency exposure 
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States. As a result, the sterling value of the 
Group’s balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these 
translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional 
currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency or in some  
cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group had one €6m currency loan and one A$1.5m currency loan as net investment hedges in year, both were repaid before  
31 March 2011. 
D) Financial credit risk 
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not 
currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by Board approved policy of only selecting 
counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AA- or equivalent. In the 
normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies. 
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding  
trade and other receivables, totals £121.9m (2010: £80.2m). The Group held cash and cash equivalents of £102.5m at 31 March 2011 
(2010: £63.9m), which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets. The cash and cash equivalents were held with different 
financial institutions which are rated AA or better.

H) Sensitivity analysis 
The Group’s sensitivity to changes in market rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2011 is set out in the table below.  
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its 
impact on the Group’s overseas net assets and earnings respectively. Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities 
is not included in this analysis. 
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain market conditions 
occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets 
which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which 
therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses. 
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% (100 basis points) in  
the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2011, with all other 
variables remaining constant. The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or 
strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2011, with all other variables remaining 
constant. Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only – in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

Rights attaching to the Special Share 
QinetiQ carries out activities which are important to UK defence and security interests. To protect these interests in the context of the 
ongoing commercial relationship between the MOD and QinetiQ, and to promote and reinforce the Compliance Principles, the MOD 
holds a Special Share in QinetiQ. The Special Share confers certain rights on the holder: 
a) to require the Group to implement and maintain the Compliance System (as defined in the Articles of Association) so as to make  
at all times effective its and each member of QinetiQ Controlled Group’s application of the Compliance Principles, in a manner 
acceptable to the Special Shareholder; 
b) to refer matters to the Board or the Compliance Committee for its consideration in relation to the application of the Compliance 
Principles; 
c) to veto any contract, transaction, arrangement or activity which the Special Shareholder considers: 
i) may result in circumstances which constitute unacceptable ownership, influence or control over QinetiQ or any other member  
of the QinetiQ consolidated Group contrary to the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom; or 
ii) would not, or does not, ensure the effective application of the Compliance Principles to and/or by all members of the QinetiQ 
Controlled Group or would be or is otherwise contrary to the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom; 
d) to require the Board to take any action (including but not limited to amending the Compliance Principles), or rectify any omission  
in the application of the Compliance Principles, if the Special Shareholder is of the opinion that such steps are necessary to protect 
the defence or security interest of the United Kingdom; 
e) to exercise any of the powers contained in the Articles in relation to the Compliance Committee; and 
f) to demand a poll at any of QinetiQ’s meetings (even though it may have no voting rights except those specifically set out  
in the Articles). 
The Special Shareholder has an option to purchase defined Strategic Assets of the Group in certain circumstances. The Special 
Shareholder has, inter alia, the right to purchase any Strategic Assets which the Group wishes to sell. Strategic Assets are normally 
testing and research facilities (see note 36 for further details).   
  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 93 
The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to H.M. Government (or as it directs). At any time the Special 
Shareholder may require QinetiQ to redeem the Special Share at par. If QinetiQ is wound up the Special Shareholder will be entitled to 
be repaid the capital paid up on the Special Share before other shareholders receive any payment. The Special Shareholder has no other 
right to share in the capital or profits of QinetiQ. 
The Special Shareholder must give consent to a general meeting held on short notice. 
The Special Share entitles the Special Shareholder to require certain persons who hold (together with any person acting in concert with 
them) a material interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their Ordinary Shares in certain prescribed circumstances on the grounds 
of national security or conflict of interest. 
The Directors must register any transfer of the Special Share within seven days. 
Other reserves 
The translation reserve includes the cumulative foreign exchange difference arising on translation since the Group transitioned to IFRS. 
Movements on hedge instruments, where the hedge is effective, are recorded in the hedge reserve until the hedge ceases. 
The capital redemption reserve is not distributable and was created following redemption of preference share capital and the bonus 
issue of shares. 
Own shares 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by independent trusts and include treasury shares and shares held by the 
employee share ownership plan. Included in retained earnings at 31 March 2011 are 5,494,001 shares (2010: 6,440,256 shares).  Financial statements

The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans for employees. The total share-based payment expense in the year was 
£3.3m (year to 31 March 2010: £5.8m). 
2003 Employee share option scheme (2003 ESOS) 
Under the employee share option scheme all employees as at 25 July 2003 received share options which vested when the Group 
completed its IPO and which must be exercised within ten years of grant. The options are settled by shares.

QinetiQ Share Option Scheme (QSOS)  
No new options were granted during the year under the QSOS. The exercise price of QSOS options is equal to the average market price 
of the Group’s shares on the date of the grant. The options vest after three years. For 3,349,939 (2010: 8,711,683) of the options 
outstanding at the end of the year the number that will vest is dependent upon the growth of earnings per share (EPS) over the 
measurement period. 25% of options will vest if EPS growth is 22.5% for the period and 100% will vest if growth is at least 52%. No 
options will vest if EPS growth is below 22.5%. Options will vest on a straight line basis if EPS growth is between 22.5% and 52%. For the 
remaining nil (2010: 425,073) options the EPS growth target is replaced by a performance target based on QinetiQ’s ranking by reference 
to total shareholder return (TSR) against a comparator group of FTSE listed companies over a three-year performance period, such that  
a below-median ranking will result in nil shares vesting, at the median level 30% of the options would vest and the amount vested will 
increase on a straight-line basis, such that 100% would vest if TSR reaches the upper quartile of the ranking over a three-year period.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)  
In the year the Group made awards of conditional shares to certain UK senior executives under the Performance Share Plan. The awards 
vest after three years with 50% of the awards subject to total shareholder return conditions and 50% subject to EPS conditions as 
detailed in the QSOS TSR and EPS conditions above.

Restricted Stock Units (RSU)  
In the year the Group granted RSU awards to certain senior US employees under the RSU Plan. The awards vest over one year, two years, 
three years and four years. Half of the awards are dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets and half on a time-based 
criterion. The time-based criterion requires the employee to have been in continued service up to the date of vesting. QNA organic profit 
growth is measured over the most recent financial year compared to the previous financial year, with 125% of this element awarded at 
QNA organic profit growth rate above 15%, 100% awarded at 12.5%, 75% awarded at 10% and 25% awarded at 5%.

Of the awards outstanding at the end of the year 7,845 were exercisable (2010: 2,726). 
Value Sharing Plan (VSP)  
In the year the Group granted VSP awards to certain senior UK employees under the VSP Plan. The awards vest over a three-year 
performance period. 70% of the awards are dependent on creating additional shareholder value, measured as net cash returns to 
investors and the increase in PBT over an 8.5% hurdle. 30% of the awards are dependent on total shareholder return (TSR) against a 
comparator group of FTSE 250 listed companies (less investment trusts) over a three-year performance period. Half of the awards vest 
three years from the date of grant, the remaining half of the awards vest four years from the date of grant. Further details of the vesting 
conditions of the scheme are in the Remuneration Report on page 38.

Group Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
Under the QinetiQ Share Incentive Plan the Group offers UK employees the opportunity of purchasing up to £125 worth of shares a 
month at the prevailing market rate. The Group will make a matching share award of a third of the employee’s payment. The Group’s 
matching shares may be forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by QinetiQ within three years of the award of the shares.  
There is no exercise price for these SIP awards.

and be entitled to matching awards to a maximum of 1:1 based upon EPS performance. The number that will vest is dependent upon the 
growth of EPS over the measurement period of three years as detailed in the QSOS EPS conditions above. No awards will vest if EPS

Share-based award pricing – options 
Share options (excluding TSR performance related) have been valued using Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of awards. 
There were no such awards in 2010 or 2011. 
No assumptions have been disclosed in the current year, as no QSOS awards have been made in the year ended 31 March 2011.  
Share-based award pricing – other 
Share-based awards that vest based upon non-market performance conditions, including certain PSP, RSUs and Deferred Annual  
Bonus awards have been valued at the share price at grant less attrition. For the 2003 Share Option Scheme, there was a pre-bonus  
issue weighted average share price of £1 and a weighted average exercise price of £1 based on third-party transactions in the Company’s 
shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options. Prior to IPO in February 2006, there was no active market for  
the Company’s shares, therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of 
businesses. At this time the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.

36. Transactions with MOD 
The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 33. Transactions between the 
Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows: 
Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties 
Under the terms of the Group's acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD 
retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred. These are: 
i) Restrictions on transfer of title 
The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets (see below) include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval  
of MOD. The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances. 
ii) Property clawback agreement 
The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a ‘trigger event’. A ‘trigger event’ includes the granting of planning 
permission for development and/or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings. During the 12 years 
from 1 July 2001, following a ‘trigger event’, the MOD is entitled to clawback a proportion of the gain on each individual property 
transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation. The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on  
a sliding scale which reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2011 stands at 16% (2010: 28%). The July 2001 valuation was 
approximately 16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001. 
Compliance Regime 
The Compliance Committee monitors the effective application of the Compliance Regime required by the MOD to maintain the position 
of QinetiQ as a supplier of independent and impartial scientific/technical advice to the MOD and ensures that the required standards are 
met in trials involving human volunteers.  
Strategic assets 
Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent  
of the MOD, to: 
i)  dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset; or 
ii)  voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset. 
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2011 was £3.8m (31 March 2010: £4.4m). 
Long-Term Partnering Agreement 
On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide the Test and Evaluation (T&E) facilities 
and training support services to the MOD. This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to £5.6bn, dependent on the level  
of usage by MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing the T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost 
saving and innovative service delivery.  Financial statements

Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of £56.7m at 31 March 2011 (31 March 2010: £55.1m)  
in the ordinary course of business.  
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the 
MOD and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve  
or may involve legal proceedings against the Group. The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Group's 
insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a 
material effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or 
the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005. Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the 
arrangements referred to in note 36, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum 
dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.

39. Post-retirement benefits 
Triennial funding valuation 
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June  
2008 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of £111.3m. On the basis of this full valuation, the Trustees of the scheme and the 
Company agreed the employer contribution rate of 11.5% from 30 June 2008, and past service deficit recovery payments of £13m per 
year for a ten-year period from this date. The next scheduled triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2011. 
Introduction and background to IAS 19 
International Accounting Standard 19 (Employee Benefits) requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on 
defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date. It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term 
market factors. The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group – 
principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which  
are used to discount future liabilities. The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market 
growth, as advised by qualified actuaries. 
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme 
In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees. The Defined Benefit (DB) section of  
the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees. All Group employees who were members,  
or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme 
were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of 
schemes which are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club. On 31 March 2009, the Group withdrew from the Public Sector Transfer Club. 
The Defined Contribution (DC) section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB 
section of the scheme. The Company closed the DC section from 31 March 2011 and has replaced this with a Group Personal Pension 
Plan managed by Zurich. All existing DC members will be automatically transferred to the GPP Plan. The DC Section will be wound up by 
the Trustees in due course. The expected employer cash contribution to the defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 March 2012 
is £32.5m (2011: £36.6m), subject to the outcome of the next triennial valuation in June 2011. 
Other UK schemes  
In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme. The net 
pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2011 amounted to £nil (31 March 2010: £0.2m). QinetiQ also offers employees access to a 
Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement. 
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date (March 2010: £nil). Set out below is a summary of the 
overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes’ liabilities. The fair value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in 
the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which 
are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were:

  QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 101 
Assumptions 
The major assumptions (weighted to reflect individual scheme differences) were: 
 2011 2010 
Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.6% 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment  3.6% 3.6% 
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.6% 5.6% 
RPI inflation assumption 3.6% 3.6% 
CPI inflation assumption 2.7% N/A 
Assumed life expectancies in years   
Future male pensioners (currently aged 60) 88 87 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 60) 90 89 
Future male pensioners (currently aged 40) 90 89 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 40) 91 90 
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in  
the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators. The life expectancy assumptions for 
mortality have increased in the year to 31 March 2011 with the base tables for mortality in line with the Medium Cohort projections  
with minimum annual rates of improvement of 1.25% for males and 0.75% for females (2010: improvement 1% for males and 0.5%  
for females). The current mortality rates reflect the standard tables PNMA00MC (for males) and PNFA00MC (for females) for members’ 
year of birth. These mortality tables are published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession. 
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities 
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £24.1m 
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £24.5m 
Salary increase Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £5.8m 
Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by £22.2m 
Scheme assets 
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon the expected return rates for each asset class. Equity return rates  
are the long-term expected return rates based upon the market rates of return for risk-free investments, typically government bonds, 
together with the historical level of risk premium associated with equities; with the resulting rate then being reviewed and benchmarked 
against a peer group of listed companies. Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets (weighted to reflect the individual 
scheme actual asset allocations) were: 
 2011 2010 
Equities 8.0% 8.0% 
Corporate bonds 5.5% 5.5%

QinetiQ has taken full advantage of changes brought about by the Companies Act 2006 which recognises the growing importance of 
electronic communications and allows companies to provide documentation and communications to shareholders via their websites 
(except to those who have specifically elected to receive a hard copy (i.e. paper)). 
The wider use of electronic communications enables fast receipt of documents, reduces the Company’s printing, paper and postal costs 
and has a positive impact on the environment.

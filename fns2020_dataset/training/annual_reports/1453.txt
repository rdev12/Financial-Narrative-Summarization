discovery, early- and late-stage development to manufacturing  
and distribution, and the global commercialisation of primary care, 
specialty care-led and specialty care medicines that transform lives.
Our primary focus is on three important areas of healthcare: 
Cardiovascular and Metabolic disease (CVMD); Oncology; and 
Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity (RIA). We are also active 
in the Infection, Neuroscience and Gastrointestinal (ING) disease areas.
We operate in more than 100 countries and our innovative medicines 
are used by millions of patients worldwide. 
We want to be valued as a source of great medicines and trusted  
as a company that delivers business success responsibly. We are 
committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards 
across all our activities. We push the boundaries of science to deliver

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
5 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Chairman’s  
Statement
“ As expected, our financial 
performance in 2013 reflected 
the ongoing impact of the loss 
of exclusivity for several key 
brands, with revenue down  
6% to $25,71 1 million.”
Dear shareholder
One of the key responsibilities 
of a board of directors is to set  
a company’s strategy. As the 
CEO outlines in his Review on 
the following pages, and as we 
seek to demonstrate throughout 
this Annual Report, your Board 
has chosen a very clear strategic 
route to follow. It is rooted in our 
heritage as a company focused 
on innovative science to deliver 
great medicines and sets out our 
ambition to lead in science and 
return to growth.
Good governance
As your Directors review our strategy and 
carry out their other duties, it is my role  
as Chairman to lead the Board effectively. 
To my mind, good governance is at the 
heart of that. So that you can easily see 
how we are governed, we have provided 
a corporate governance overview on page 
26 of this Annual Report. We also briefly 
describe how our governance structure 
supports the delivery of our business 
strategy. You can find more detail in my 
full Corporate Governance Report from 
page 88. On page 24, we have also 
provided an overview of the risks that 
might prevent us from achieving the full 
potential of our strategy.
Transparent reporting
Hand in hand with good governance goes 
transparent reporting and this year we have 
made a number of other changes in the 
Annual Report intended to promote this. 
Some have been caused by changes in UK 
reporting regulations, others by changes to 
the Corporate Governance Code and some 
by ever-evolving reporting best practice. 
Significant changes include the introduction 
of a Strategic Report, which starts by 
explaining our business model and goes 
on to describe how each element helps 
deliver our strategic goals. The Strategic 
Report is introduced in more detail  
on page 1.
This year, the Annual Report also includes 
a revised Directors’ Remuneration Report 
from page 102, which is introduced by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
John Varley. A separate Audit Committee 
Report is introduced by the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, Rudy Markham.
All the changes we have made are also 
intended to reflect our greater than ever 
efforts to make this Annual Report fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Challenging environment
Any balanced review of AstraZeneca 
needs to reflect the environment in which 
we operate. The challenging conditions 
which I touched on last year continue. 
The world pharmaceutical market is still 
growing and underlying demographic 
trends remain favourable to long-term 
industry growth. However, many of the 
drivers of demand and supply in the 
industry are under pressure.
6 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report  Outlook 
As we look to the future, we expect a 
low-to-mid single digit percentage decline 
in revenue at CER for 2014. In percentage 
terms, Core EPS for 2014 is expected to 
decline in the teens at CER. Following the 
acquisition of BMS’s 50% interest in our 
joint diabetes business, and as the diabetes 
business’s pipeline of new products is 
progressively launched, we expect 2017 
revenues will be broadly in line with 2013 
revenues. This expectation involves a 
number of assumptions, including, among 
other things, Nexium US generic launch  
in May 2014.
Appreciation
Before closing, and on behalf of the  
Board, I want to thank the employees 
of AstraZeneca whose efforts helped  
us achieve so much in 2013 as we lay  
the foundations for leading in science  
and returning to growth. In particular,  
I want to express my appreciation to  
Pascal and all the members of the SET  
for the leadership they have shown  
and the inspiration they have provided  
to the organisation.
Finally, I would like to thank all my fellow 
Directors for the contribution they have 
made to our discussions throughout a 
busy 2013. We look forward to welcoming 
as many of you as possible to our Annual 
General Meeting in April.
Leif Johansson 
Chairman
Core EPS for 2013 were $5.05, down  
23% on 2012. This decline was greater  
than the decline in revenue primarily  
due to our investment in our key growth 
platforms and strengthened pipeline. 
Reported EPS for the year was down  
55% to $2.04. The impairment of Bydureon 
in the fourth quarter reduced Reported  
EPS by $1.10, resulting in a Reported loss 
per share for the quarter of $0.42.
A responsible company
I firmly believe that our commitment to 
good financial performance needs to be 
matched by a continued focus on being 
a responsible company, by working with 
integrity and delivering sustainable business 
development. I therefore fully support the 
decision we have made to focus our 
responsible business activities on access 
to healthcare, diversity and reducing our 
environmental impact. It is where I believe 
we are able to implement standards that 
will accelerate our business strategy and 
deliver wider benefits to society.
It is also gratifying to see our current efforts 
recognised by again being listed in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability World Index in 2013, 
with a record-equalling score, and retaining 
our listing on the European Index for the 
sixth year running.
Return to shareholders 
Consistent with our progressive dividend 
policy to maintain or grow the dividend 
each year, the Board has recommended  
a second interim dividend of $1.90. This 
brings the dividend for the full year to 
$2.80 (176.0 pence, SEK 18.33). 
The Board regularly reviews our distribution 
policy and overall financial strategy to 
continue to strike a balance between the 
interests of the business, our financial 
creditors and our shareholders. Having 
regard for business investment, funding the 
progressive dividend policy and meeting 
our debt service obligations, we currently 
believe it is appropriate to continue the 
suspension of the share repurchase 
programme which was announced in 
October 2012. We continue to target a 
strong, investment grade credit rating.
On the demand side, we face increased 
competition from generic drugs as some  
of the world’s most successful medicines 
come off patent. In addition, securing 
recognition (through reimbursement 
approval) and reward for innovation 
(through favourable pricing and sales) 
is becoming more difficult in the face of 
intense pricing pressures, particularly 
in Established Markets facing rising 
healthcare costs. On the supply side, the 
industry faces an ongoing R&D productivity 
challenge. R&D costs have risen significantly 
over the past decade, while industry-wide 
probability of success of new medicines, 
though showing some recent signs of 
improvement, has not kept pace.
Loss of exclusivity
Loss of exclusivity has had, and continues 
to have, a significant impact on AstraZeneca. 
In 2013, loss of exclusivity on brands such 
as Arimidex, Atacand, Crestor, Nexium 
and Seroquel IR in a number of markets 
accounted for a revenue decline of some 
$2.2 billion. Over the coming years, this 
trend will continue as medicines such as 
Crestor, Nexium and Seroquel XR continue 
to lose exclusivity in markets such as the 
US and Europe.
Of course, loss of exclusivity is a normal 
part of an innovative medicine’s life-cycle. 
It comes at the end of the period when a 
new medicine is safeguarded from being 
copied so that we can generate returns  
on the investment we have made, both to 
reinvest in the business and provide an 
appropriate return to you, our owners. A 
well-functioning intellectual property system 
of this type, which rewards innovation, is 
the principal economic safeguard in our 
industry. It underpins our business model, 
which we explore in more detail in the 
Business model section from page 10.
Our performance in 2013 
As expected, our financial performance in 
2013 reflected the ongoing impact of the 
loss of exclusivity for several key brands, 
with revenue down 6% to $25,711 million 
(2012: $27 ,973 million). Core operating 
profit fell by 22% to $8,390 million (2012: 
$11,159 million). The decline in revenue was, 
in part, offset by our key growth platforms: 
Brilinta, our diabetes franchise, respiratory, 
Emerging Markets and Japan, which 
delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of 
revenue in 2013.

Officer’s Review
Dear shareholder
At our Investor Day in March 
2013, we set out our strategy  
to Achieve Scientific Leadership, 
Return to Growth and ensure 
AstraZeneca is a Great Place  
to Work. A year on, we’ve built 
momentum behind our strategic 
priorities, in particular our 
objective of achieving scientific 
leadership, and started to deliver 
on some of the targets we have 
set ourselves. You can find more 
detail about the progress being 
made throughout this Annual 
Report, together with some  
case studies indicating how  
our pioneering science has  
the potential to transform lives.
Achieving scientific leadership
Accelerating and replenishing our portfolio 
in our three core therapy areas is central to 
our mission and vital to our success. I’m 
really pleased by the progress made during 
2013. At the end of the year, we had 99 
projects in our pipeline, of which 85 were  
in the clinical phase of development and 14 
were approved, launched or filed. That total 
included 11 new molecular entities, or 
NMEs, in Phase III of development or  
under regulatory review, almost double  
the number we had at the end of 2012. 
Four NMEs that progressed to Phase III 
came from our existing pipeline: olaparib, 
selumetinib and moxetumomab pasudotox 
are potential cancer treatments, while 
benralizumab is for severe asthma. A 
further two NMEs came from transactions 
we undertook during the year: PT003, for 
the treatment of COPD, came to us from 
the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics and 
Epanova, a novel treatment for dyslipidaemia, 
came from the acquisition of Omthera.
Alongside this, we submitted regulatory 
filings for naloxegol, for opioid-induced 
constipation, in the EU and US, and 
olaparib in the EU. Our diabetes treatment, 
Farxiga, was approved in the US in January 
2014, having been approved in the EU in 
2012 under the name Forxiga. Xigduo, also 
for diabetes, was approved in the EU in 
January 2014.
I am particularly excited about the  
progress we made with our early-stage 
pipeline in 2013, including the multiple  
trials that are now under way in our cancer 
immunotherapy portfolio. Collaborations 
and acquisitions further strengthened the 
progress being made, including AlphaCore 
in cardiovascular and metabolic disease  
as well as Amplimmune and Spirogen  
in oncology. 
Of course, there is no innovation without risk 
and we discontinued 15 projects during the 
year. This included fostamatinib where the 
results of clinical trials meant we decided 
not to proceed with regulatory filings.
We continue to redeploy resources to 
convert our promising late-stage pipeline 
into medicines that will transform patients’ 
lives and fund our growth platforms. Our 
productivity and efficiency programmes  
are providing some of the headroom to 
make those investments possible. 
Platforms for growth 
As the Chairman noted, our five growth 
platforms delivered an incremental  
$1.2 billion of revenue in 2013. While  
our focus on these platforms is beginning  
to bear fruit, we have more work to do if 
they are to deliver to their full potential.
Brilinta/Brilique is a key product for  
us and it continues to grow globally. 
However, despite encouraging progress  
in the US, there are challenges that are  
still to be overcome.
Our long-term commitment to diabetes  
was reinforced with the acquisition of 
BMS’s 50% interest in our joint diabetes 
business. The acquisition, which was 
completed in February 2014, included the 
rights for the development, manufacture 
and commercialisation of the business’s 
global diabetes assets. We believe that 
consolidating ownership of this portfolio  
will allow us to serve the needs of people 
with diabetes better. As a result of  
sales below expectations, we incurred  
an impairment charge for Bydureon, 
acquired as part of the BMS acquisition  
of Amylin. Nevertheless, we continue  
to have confidence in the commercial  
future of the product. 
Overall, diabetes revenues grew globally 
last year and we are stepping up our 
investment and improving execution of  
our plans to take full advantage of our 
unique portfolio.
In our respiratory franchise, Symbicort 
drove growth with a strong performance 
in the US, Japan and Emerging Markets. 
In Japan, our second largest market, 
growth was also helped by the performance 
of Nexium. Emerging Markets revenue 
growth of 8% meant we met our target 
of high single digit growth (at CER), with 
growth in China of 19% over the year.
While our revenue continues to be 
impacted by the loss of exclusivity for key 
brands, reducing by $2.2 billion in 2013, 
the progress being made provides us with 
the confidence that our 2017 revenues 
will be broadly in line with what we achieved 
in 2013.
8 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report In Simon’s place I am pleased to be able 
to welcome Marc Dunoyer who joined us in 
June 2013 and took over as Chief Financial 
Officer in November 2013. While we look 
for permanent successors, I am grateful to 
Ruud Dobber, who assumed the portfolio 
strategy role, and Caroline Hempstead  
who took over Lynn’s role. They are part  
of a strong SET team that continues to 
provide inspirational leadership as we focus 
the organisation on the continued delivery 
of our goals.
Looking ahead
As I commented at the start of my Review, 
I am pleased with the momentum we built 
in 2013 against our strategic priorities, 
particularly our objective of achieving 
scientific leadership. I look forward to 
reporting on how our journey progresses in 
2014 as we seek to build on our successes 
and realise our ambition for AstraZeneca.
Pascal Soriot 
Chief Executive Officer
helping improve collaboration, as well  
as reducing complexity and eradicating 
unnecessary cost. 
Overall progress is reflected in surveys that 
have shown an increasing employee belief 
in our strategic course. This is heartening, 
not least because implementation of our 
strategic priorities has created uncertainty 
for many. For my part, I will continue to 
work to ensure that we undertake the 
necessary changes with respect for the 
individuals concerned.
A great place to work needs great  
leaders and we welcomed many talented 
individuals at all levels in 2013. The year 
also saw two of our SET members leave. 
Simon Lowth left us at the end of October 
after nearly six years at AstraZeneca. He 
made a significant and lasting contribution 
to the business. I will miss him and would 
like to wish him well in the next chapter  
of his career. Also stepping down during 
the year was Lynn Tetrault, who did so  
on health grounds. I wish her a speedy 
recovery to full health. Lynn also made  
a significant contribution throughout her 
long career.
Great place to work
Our achievements are, of course, down 
to the people who work at AstraZeneca, 
as well as our partners and collaborators. 
However, I firmly believe that these efforts 
are more productive when we all share  
a common purpose. That is why I attach 
such great importance to the work we did 
during the year both to define our purpose 
as a Group – who we are and the unique 
contribution we make – as well as to define 
the values that describe our fundamental 
beliefs and bring our purpose to life.
Over 30,000 employees registered for our 
‘culture jam’, an online conversation about 
what it means to push the boundaries of 
science to deliver life-changing medicines, 
and about what our values mean in 
practice. It was a defining moment for 
AstraZeneca that demonstrated the 
passion our employees have for the work  
they do. 
Alongside this, I am pleased with the 
progress made following our decision 
to invest in three strategic R&D centres, 
including the creation of a new UK-based 
centre in Cambridge. This will bring teams 
together and closer to scientific partners, 
“ I am pleased with the momentum  
we built in 2013 against our strategic 
priorities, particularly our objective of 
achieving scientific leadership.”

Unmet medical need 
We are living in a time when underlying 
demographic trends are favourable to 
long-term pharmaceutical industry 
growth, and innovative scientific research 
continues to deliver new ways of satisfying 
unmet medical need. However, as the 
Our marketplace section from page 13 
demonstrates, the economic, social and 
political environment in which we operate 
presents major challenges, as well as 
opportunities. Our strategic priorities 
section from page 16 defines our response 
to this environment.
Resources 
In everything we do, we seek to optimise 
the value of all our resources. These include 
both our employees and the relationships 
we have with our partners, collaborators 
and suppliers. Our assets also include our 
intellectual property, our infrastructure and 
other physical assets. See the Resources 
Review from page 66 for more information.
Life-cycle of a 
medicine 
We are one of very few pure-play 
biopharmaceutical companies (that is, not 
involved in consumer or animal healthcare, 
diagnostics or medical devices) to span 
the entire value chain of a medicine from 
research, early- and late-stage development 
to manufacturing and distribution, and the 
global commercialisation of primary care, 
specialty care-led and specialty care 
medicines that transform lives. Our 
life-cycle management process (including 
line extensions) is designed to ensure  
a medicine’s continued safe use and  
to explore its potential for treating other 
diseases, or for extending its use into 
additional patient groups. See the Business 
Review from page 34 for more on our 
activities across a medicine’s life-cycle. 
The Therapy Area Review from page 48 
describes our activities across our chosen 
therapy areas.
Return to 
shareholders
The revenue we earn from the sale of our 
medicines generates the cash flow that 
helps us fund business investment, our 
progressive dividend policy, and meet our 
debt service obligations. We aim to strike 
a balance between the interests of the 
business, our financial creditors and our 
shareholders. See the Financial Review 
from page 74 for more information.
Improved health
We believe that continuous innovation 
in medical progress is vital to achieving 
sustainable healthcare. It adds value by:
 > leading to better health outcomes 
and transforming patients’ lives 
 > enabling healthcare systems to save 
costs and be more efficient
 > delivering value beyond the medicines 
themselves by, for example, improving 
access to healthcare and healthcare 
infrastructure
 > contributing to the development of the 
communities in which we operate, via 
local employment, and partnering.
Promoting and 
rewarding innovation
The creation and protection of our 
underlying intellectual property assets, 
as outlined below, are essential elements  
of our business model. Developing  
a new medicine is risky, costly and  
time consuming. It requires significant 
investment over 10 or more years before 
product launch, with no guarantee of 
success. For this to be viable, the new 
medicine must be safeguarded from 
being copied, with a reasonable amount 
of certainty and for an acceptable period 
of time, so we can generate the returns 
to reinvest in the business and provide 
an appropriate return to shareholders.
The loss of key product patents has 
affected sales significantly in recent years 
and will continue to do so. A key goal  
for our planning process is to ensure we 
sustain the cycle of successful innovation 
and so continue to refresh our portfolio 
of patented products that transform lives 
and generate shareholder value.

11 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Pioneering science,  
life-changing medicines
A company’s purpose defines its unique contribution to the world.
Purpose
We push the boundaries of science to deliver  
life-changing medicines. 
Values
>  We follow the science
  Science is at the heart of our business and is the basis for everything we do. We make 
decisions based on strong scientific evidence, encourage curiosity and always look to 
push the boundaries.
> We put patients first
  Patients are why we come to work every day. We always seek to understand and reflect 
their needs. We watch the wider healthcare environment and look to apply knowledge and 
experience from the external environment into our work. 
> We play to win
  Expectations are high. We challenge each other, make courageous choices and set high 
standards across the board. We work together and use the strengths and diversity both 
within and beyond AstraZeneca.
> We do the right thing
  We always take personal accountability for our actions and challenge those that are not in 
line with our values. We approach every interaction with candour, honesty and integrity.
> We are entrepreneurial
  Excellence isn’t always achieved first time, sometimes persistence is required. We seize 
opportunities, act with urgency and take smart risks. Whether we succeed or fail, there 
is always a valuable lesson.
At AstraZeneca we want the way we work, 
as embodied in our strategy and values,  
to bring our purpose to life. That is why,  
in a year when we refreshed our strategic 
priorities, we also reassessed our purpose 
and values. This was to make sure that we 
express clearly our purpose and values 
and the behaviours necessary to realise 
our strategic ambitions to Achieve Scientific 
Leadership, Return to Growth, and Be a 
Great Place to Work.
To bring our purpose to life for employees, 
we also took a fresh look at the values that 
define our beliefs as a company, guide our 
decision making and underpin our drive for 
business success. Following a review of 
our culture and need to deliver a redefined 
strategy, we identified five values intended 
to build on our strengths and highlight 
areas for transformation. Senior leaders 
and management teams from across the 
business contributed to the development 
of these values. We also held an online 
culture jam event in November 2013, 
to enable an organisation-wide, virtual 
dialogue to share ideas and create 
understanding of what our refreshed 
values mean.
Each value has a corresponding set 
of behaviours, that describe what 
is required at the individual level to 
demonstrate them. They apply to all 
employees and are complemented with 
manager accountabilities, which define 
what we expect from our managers.

World pharmaceutical market sales
Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry has doubled  
in value since 2000. This growth was 
powered by a large number of FDA 
approvals in the second half of the 1990s 
and the increased use of medicines around 
the world, driven by the global economic 
growth of the time. Now, many demand 
drivers in the industry are under pressure. 
Nonetheless, as the figure above shows, 
the world pharmaceutical market still grew 
by 2.5% in 2013. While average revenue 
growth was only 0.36% in Established 
Markets, Emerging Markets revenue was 
30 times higher at 10.7%. The top five 
pharmaceutical markets in the world 
remained the US, Japan, Germany, France 
and China, with the US representing 39.1% 
of global sales (2012: 40.3%; 2011: 41.1%).
Competition
The industry remains highly competitive. 
Our competitors are other large research-
based pharmaceutical companies that 
discover, develop and sell innovative, 
patent-protected prescription medicines 
and vaccines, as well as smaller 
biotechnology and vaccine businesses, 
and companies that produce generic 
medicines. While many of our peers are 
confronting similar challenges, these 
challenges are being met in different ways. 
For example, while some companies have 
pursued a focused strategy, others have 
diversified by acquiring or building branded 
generics businesses or consumer 
portfolios, arguing that this enables them 
to better meet changing customer needs 
and smooth shareholder risk.
While most organisations continued to 
pursue their existing strategies in 2013, 
there were exceptions, with some 
companies moving away from diversification. 
Key industry trends included ongoing 
efforts to improve R&D innovation and 
productivity, expansion of geographic 
scope, especially in Emerging Markets 
and Japan, and the pursuit of operational 
efficiency. Business development and 
partnering increased at all stages of 
product development.
There continued to be a shift away from 
the development of new primary care 
medicines towards oncology, other 
specialty care drugs and orphan diseases. 
As an illustration, in 2013, just 30% of the 
new NMEs approved by the FDA were 
for primary care medicines. 
Growth drivers
Expanding patient populations 
The world population is expected to rise 
from its current level, of some seven billion, 
to reach nine billion by 2050. In addition, 
the number of people who can access 
healthcare continues to increase, 
particularly among the elderly. Globally, 
it is estimated that between 2000 and 
2050, the number of people aged 60 years 
and over will increase from 605 million to 
two billion.
Developing markets now represent 
approximately 85% of the world population 
and over 20% of the world’s pharmaceutical 
revenues. Faster-developing economies, 
such as China, India and Brazil, offer  
new opportunities for the pharmaceutical 
industry to help many more patients  
benefit from innovative medicines. In 2013, 
pharmaceutical revenues rose in developing 
markets while those in established markets 
were broadly static. As the Estimated 
pharmaceutical sales and market growth 
– 2017 diagram overleaf shows, we expect 
this trend to continue. 
Unmet medical need 
In most Established Markets, ageing 
populations and certain lifestyle choices 
such as smoking, poor diet and lack of 
exercise are increasing the incidence of 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such 
as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, 
cancer, and respiratory diseases, which 
require long-term management. In 2008, 
almost two-thirds of deaths globally were 
from NCDs, with 80% of these in lower- 
and middle-income countries. By 2030, it is 
estimated that the number of people dying 
from cardiovascular diseases will reach 
23.3 million a year, while deaths from 
cancer will continue rising, to an estimated 
13.1 million annually.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
13 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 cost base. It does so at a time when 
regulators and those who pay for our 
medicines are demanding more and better 
evidence of comparative effectiveness of 
compounds, which increases development 
times and costs. 
The industry is using the full range of 
innovative technologies to achieve and 
accelerate product approvals. Additionally, 
greater emphasis is being placed on 
demonstrating Proof of Concept, which 
delivers data to show that candidate 
drugs result in a clinical change with 
an acceptable endpoint or surrogate 
in patients.
Regulatory requirements 
Our industry continues to be highly 
regulated. This reflects public demand for 
safe, effective and high-quality medicines 
that are responsibly tested, manufactured 
and commercialised. The nature and 
geographic scope of our business requires 
us to maintain important relationships 
worldwide with health authorities that 
assess the safety, efficacy and quality  
of medicines. These include the FDA  
in the US, the EMA in the EU, the PMDA  
in Japan and the CFDA in China. 
In 2013, the FDA implemented aspects 
of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, 
which was re-authorised in 2012, and EU 
authorities continued to implement the 
new pharmacovigilance legislation, also 
introduced in 2012. These measures share 
the common goals of protecting patient 
safety, creating greater transparency in 
regulation throughout a product’s life-cycle 
and taking more account of the patient 
perspective in the regulatory process. 
There is also a global trend to increase 
public access to the documentation 
companies submit to health authorities 
to support marketing authorisations.
So far as the development of biosimilars is 
concerned, health authorities continue to 
face the challenge of developing robust 
standards to ensure their safety, efficacy 
and quality. For further information on 
biosimilars, see the Patent expiries and 
genericisation section opposite.
There are ongoing efforts to harmonise 
regulations and achieve global convergence, 
yet the number of regulations and their 
impact continue to multiply. Clinical  
trials that support the registration of 
products in a regulatory jurisdiction  
must be relevant to a variety of patient 
demographics. Programmes using foreign 
clinical trial data also need to meet each 
health authority’s requirements and be 
relevant to their population. Meanwhile, 
health authorities continue to redefine 
patient-safety assessment processes.  
In addition, in emerging pharmaceutical 
markets, health authorities are developing 
their own individual requirements and  
safety initiatives. 
The growing complexity and globalisation 
of clinical studies, and the pressure on 
industry and healthcare budgets, has  
led to an increase in consortia, including 
industry, academia and regulators. These 
are driving innovation and streamlining 
regulatory processes, as well as defining 
and clarifying approval requirements for 
new technology and approaches, such  
as PHC. They are also accelerating the 
development of treatments that address 
public health priorities. 
In another trend, following regulatory 
approval, the safety and efficacy data  
of most medicines are being increasingly 
scrutinised by health technology 
assessment and/or reimbursement 
bodies at a national level. 
Advances in science and technology 
Innovation is critical if we are to address 
unmet medical need. Existing drugs will 
continue to be important in meeting the 
growing demand for healthcare, particularly 
with the increasing use of generic 
medication. At the same time, advances 
in the understanding of diseases and the 
application of new technologies will be 
required to deliver new medicines. 
Such approaches include personalised 
healthcare (PHC) and predictive science,  
as well as other new types of therapy. 
Advances in the technologies for the design 
and testing of novel compounds herald 
fresh opportunities for using innovative 
small molecules as new medicines. The use 
of large molecules, or biologics, has also 
become an important source of innovation, 
with biologics among the most commercially 
successful new products. Forecasts for 
2018 predict that of the world’s top 100 
pharmaceutical products, 51% of sales will 
come from biologics. This compares with 
only 39% in 2012 and 17% in 2004. Most 
pharmaceutical companies now pursue 
R&D in both small molecules and biologics.
The challenges
R&D productivity
Improving R&D productivity is a critical 
challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. 
Global investment in pharmaceutical R&D 
reached an estimated $135 billion in 2013, 
a 53% increase from $88 billion in 2004. 
However, the annual growth in R&D spend 
has slowed in recent years. In contrast to 
the increase in spending, the FDA approved 
27 NMEs in 2013 (2012: 39), which was in 
line with the annual average of 26 approvals 
over the past 10 years.
To ensure the industry delivers a sustainable 
return on R&D investment, it is working 
to increase the probability of success in 
developing commercially viable new drugs 
and is moving to a lower, more flexible

Strategic Report | Strategy | Our marketplace However, when applications are supported 
by strong data and compelling benefit/risk 
propositions, regulators continue to approve 
drugs that address unmet medical need. 
Pricing pressure 
Pricing and reimbursement continues  
to be highly challenging in many markets. 
Most pharmaceutical sales are generated  
in highly regulated markets where 
governments and private payers, such as 
insurance companies, exert various levels 
of control on pricing and reimbursement. 
Cost-containment, including limitations on 
pharmaceutical spending, continues to be 
a focus. A wave of austerity programmes, 
following the recent global economic 
downturn, are further constraining 
healthcare providers and tougher economic 
conditions constrain those patients who 
pay directly for medicines. Additional 
challenges may arise if suppliers and 
distributors face credit-related difficulties. 
At the same time, pharmaceutical 
companies require significant extra 
resources to demonstrate to payers the 
economic, as well as therapeutic, value  
of medicines.
In 2013, pressures on pricing were driven 
by the implementation of drug price control 
mechanisms and other regulatory reforms 
issued the previous year (for example, the 
Royal Decree in Spain and the Balduzzi 
Decree in Italy), as well as price 
renegotiations due to budget pressures, 
particularly in France and Belgium.
In the US, the Affordable Care Act has 
already had a direct impact on healthcare 
activities despite the fact that many of the 
healthcare coverage expansion provisions 
of the Affordable Care Act do not take 
effect until 2014. For example, in 2010 there 
was an increase in the mandatory Medicaid 
rebates. In addition, the pharmaceutical 
industry, including AstraZeneca, is making 
prescription drugs more affordable to 
Medicare beneficiaries through, for 
example, helping to close the coverage gap 
in the Medicare Part D prescription drug 
programme. The industry continues to work 
with policymakers and regulators to help 
ensure they strike a balance between 
containing costs, improving outcomes and 
promoting an environment that fosters 
medical innovation.
In August 2011, as part of the bipartisan 
agreement to raise the federal debt  
ceiling, the US Congress created the  
Joint Select Committee on Deficit 
Reduction (Committee). The Committee 
was empowered to recommend a package 
of $1.2 trillion in cost savings with the 
requirement that, if the Committee failed  
to reach an agreement, the savings  
would be achieved through across  
the board spending cuts (sequestration). 
The Committee discussions ended without 
reaching an agreement and the President 
and Congress were subsequently unable 
to reach agreement. Thus, sequestration 
took effect in March 2013 and impacts 
most federal government healthcare 
programmes with broad reductions in 
federal government spending. 
In Europe, governments have continued 
to implement legislation on mandatory 
discounts, clawbacks and referencing rules, 
driving prices down, especially in distressed 
economies such as Greece and Portugal. 
In Germany, Europe’s largest pharmaceutical 
market, manufacturers are now required to 
prove the additional benefit of their drugs 
over existing alternatives. If the additional 
benefit is not shown, the drug is transferred 
to the German reference pricing system 
where, for each drug group, a single 
reimbursement level or reference price 
is set.
In China, pricing practices are high on the 
agenda of regulatory authorities. 2013 was 
impacted by the continuation of the triennial 
maximum retail drug price review which 
began in 2012, and more pressure is 
expected. In Japan, biennial cuts are 
expected to continue. In Latin America, 
pricing is increasingly controlled by 
governments, for example in Colombia  
and Venezuela. 
More about the impact of price controls 
and reductions, and of healthcare reform in 
the US, can be found in the Principal risks 
and uncertainties section from page 200.  
The principal aspects of price regulation  
in our major markets are described further 
in the Geographical Review from page 214.
Patent expiries and genericisation 
The patents on some of the biggest-selling 
drugs ever produced are expiring. As a 
consequence, payers, physicians and 
patients in Established Markets have 
increased access to low-price, generic 
alternatives in many important classes  
of primary care drugs. For example, for 
prescriptions dispensed in the US in 2013, 
generics constituted 86% of the market 
by volume (2012: 84%). 
Patents only protect pharmaceutical 
products for a finite period and the expiry 
or early loss of patents often leads to the 
availability of generics. Generic versions of 
drugs are very competitive with significantly 
lower pricing than the innovator equivalents. 
This is partly due to lower investment by 
generic manufacturers in R&D and market 
development. While generic competition 
has traditionally occurred when patents 
expire, it can also happen where the validity 
of patents is disputed or successfully 
challenged before expiry. Such early 
challenges have increased with generics 
companies increasingly willing to launch 
products ‘at risk’, for example, prior to the 
resolution of the relevant patent litigation. 
This trend is likely to continue, resulting in 
significant market presence for the generic 
version during the period in which litigation 
remains unresolved, even though the 
courts may subsequently rule that the 
innovative product is properly protected 
by a valid patent. The unpredictable nature 
of patent litigation has led innovators to 
seek to settle such challenges on terms 
acceptable to both innovator and generic 
manufacturer. However, some competition 
authorities have sought to challenge the 
scope and/or availability of this type of 
settlement agreement. 
Biologics have, to date, sustained longer 
life-cycles than traditional small molecule 
pharmaceuticals and have faced less 
generic competition. With limited 
experience to date, the substitution of 
biosimilars for the original branded product 
has not followed the same pattern as 
generic substitution in small molecule 
products and, as a consequence, erosion 
of branded market share has not been as 
rapid. This is also due to a more complex 
manufacturing process for biologics 
compared with small molecule medicines. 
In addition, it is due to the inherent 
difficulties in producing a biosimilar which, 
as a biological equivalent, rather than an 
exact chemical copy, could require additional 
clinical trials. However, with regulatory 
authorities in Europe and the US continuing 
to implement abbreviated approval 
pathways for biosimilar versions, innovative 
biologics are likely to become increasingly 
subject to competition from biosimilars.
Building trust 
The pharmaceutical industry faces 
challenges in building and maintaining 
trust, particularly with governments and 
regulators. The past decade has seen 
a significant increase in the number of 
settlements between innovator companies 
and governmental and regulatory authorities 
for violating various laws. Companies are 
taking steps to address this reputational 
challenge by embedding a culture of ethics 
and integrity, adopting higher standards 
of governance and improving relationships 
with employees, shareholders and 
other stakeholders.
In July 2013, it emerged that a number 
of companies, including pharmaceutical 
businesses, were under investigation by 
the China Public Security Bureau following 
allegations of bribery and criminal offences. 
Investigations by the DOJ and SEC under 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are 
also continuing.

15 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Our strategic priorities
Our strategic priorities define how we are responding to the 
external environment and focusing our efforts and resources 
to ensure we can deliver our purpose. 
We also have a strong position in China 
and other Emerging Markets. We combine 
a global reach with local customer 
relationships and are pioneering new 
customer-focused commercial models.
We need to build on these strong 
foundations. We also have to address  
some key challenges. AstraZeneca is faced 
with a number of significant patent expiries 
in the coming years and we must improve 
our R&D productivity by delivering more 
products successfully from our Phase III 
pipeline. Once medicines are approved for 
use, we need to improve the way in which 
we launch products. Organisationally, we 
need to reduce our costs, change our 
culture, and simplify and improve the way 
we work.
Innovation and growth
Our strategic priorities are focused on 
innovation and returning to growth. They 
are based on:
 > science-led innovation
 > a broad R&D platform built on three  
core therapy areas
 > a balanced portfolio of specialty and 
primary care products
 > a global commercial presence, with 
strength in Emerging Markets.
Strategic R&D centres
In March 2013, as part of our strategy, we 
announced plans to invest in strategic R&D 
centres in Gaithersburg, Maryland, US, in 
Cambridge, UK, and in Mölndal, Sweden. 
Our aim is to improve pipeline productivity 
and to establish AstraZeneca as a global 
leader in biopharmaceutical innovation. 
The centres are a major investment, 
designed to locate more of our scientists 
close to globally recognised bioscience 
clusters, bring teams together to improve 
collaboration, and simplify our footprint 
and so reduce complexity and eliminate 
unnecessary cost.
In June 2013, we confirmed that our new 
UK-based global R&D centre and corporate 
headquarters will be located at the 
Cambridge Biomedical Campus on the 
outskirts of the city. The planned 
investment of around $515 million is 
expected to be completed by 2016.
It is planned that R&D work will no longer 
be carried out at our Alderley Park site in 
the UK. Over the next three years, around 
1,600 roles will relocate from Alderley Park, 
with a significant majority going to the new 
centre in Cambridge and the remainder  
to our nearby Macclesfield facility or sites 
outside the UK. At least 700 non-R&D roles 
are expected to remain at Alderley Park.  
We will explore all options to ensure 
Alderley Park has a successful future.
In the US, a number of roles have already 
relocated to our facility in Gaithersburg, 
while most of the others will move during 
2014. Our site in Wilmington, Delaware will 
remain our North America commercial 
headquarters.
Restructuring
Since 2007 , we have undertaken  
significant efforts to restructure and 
reshape our business to improve long-term 
competitiveness. The first phase was 
completed in 2009. The second phase 
began in 2010 and the restructuring  
actions were completed in 2011.
At our Investor Day, we described how 
we were transforming the way we work 
to deliver our strategy by simplifying the 
organisation and its processes, while 
creating an innovative environment.  
We continue to drive productivity 
improvements across the organisation, 
removing complexity, creating additional 
headroom to invest in the pipeline and  
key growth platforms, and ensuring  
returns to our shareholders.
In March 2013, we announced a 
restructuring programme which was 
combined with the third phase of the 
programme announced in February 2012  
to create a combined Phase 4 programme. 
It initially entailed an estimated global 
headcount reduction of about 5,050 over 
the 2013–2016 period. The combined 
programme of changes was estimated to 
incur $2.3 billion in one-time restructuring 
charges, of which $1.7 billion were 
expected to be cash costs. In 2013, the 
Company continued to implement the 
Phase 4 programme, incurring costs of 
$1.4 billion and delivering approximately 
$400 million of annualised benefits. The 
overall Phase 4 programme remains on 
track to deliver approximately $800 million 
anticipated annual benefits by the end of 
2016. Total costs for this programme are 
now anticipated to be approximately 
$200 million higher at $2.5 billion.
We believe that biopharmaceuticals 
remains an attractive business, with strong 
underlying drivers of demand: expanding 
and ageing populations; a growing chronic 
disease burden; and increasing wealth 
through economic growth, especially in 
Emerging Markets. While the hurdles to 
adopting new products have increased, 
people are still willing to pay for 
differentiated, innovative medicines that 
transform lives.
In response to these circumstances and, as 
we announced at our Investor Day in March 
2013, we have made a clear set of choices. 
We will:
 > focus our R&D and commercial 
investments
 > prioritise and accelerate promising 
assets and business development
 > transform our innovation model and 
the way we work.
We will do this through our strategic 
priorities which are to:
1 Achieve Scientific Leadership
2 Return to Growth
3 Be a Great Place to Work.
The table from page 18 examines our 
strategic priorities in more detail, explains 
what they mean and how we are 
implementing them.
Distinctive capabilities
Our chosen priorities reflect our belief that 
AstraZeneca has the skills and capabilities 
to take advantage of the opportunities 
that exist:
Pipeline and science Few pharmaceutical 
companies can match our combination of 
capabilities in small molecules, biologics, 
immunotherapies and protein engineering. 
These capabilities allow us to produce 
combination therapies (such as drug 
antibody conjugates) and customisable 
molecules, targeted to specific patient 
populations. We also have good underlying 
discovery science and strong disease 
knowledge, research portfolios, and related 
technology platforms in a number of areas.
Commercial presence Over the past 
decade, we have developed strong 
commercial franchises that address 
oncology, cardiovascular, metabolic and 
respiratory diseases. We have a significant 
commercial capability in primary care. 
16 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Strategy  The Phase 4 programme has been 
expanded to include additional activities 
such as a transformation of our IT 
organisation and infrastructure, the exit of 
R&D activities in Bangalore, India, and the 
exit from branded generics in certain 
Emerging Markets to further reduce costs 
and increase flexibility. When completed,  
the expansion of the restructuring 
programme is expected to deliver a further 
$300 million in annual benefits by the end of 
2016, bringing total anticipated annualised 
benefits of the Phase 4 programme to 
$1. 1 billion. Total incremental programme 
costs from these new initiatives are 
estimated to be $700 million, of which 
$600 million is cash, bringing the total 
anticipated cost of our Phase 4 programme 
to $3.2 billion. The expansion of the 
programme is estimated to affect 
approximately 550 positions, bringing the 
total global headcount reduction under the 
Phase 4 programme to around 5,600 over 
the 2013–2016 period. 
Final estimates for programme costs, 
benefits and headcount impact in all 
functions are subject to completion of  
the requisite consultation in the various 
areas, many of which have already  
begun. Our priority as we undertake these 
restructuring initiatives is to work with  
our affected employees on the proposed 
changes, acting in accordance with 
relevant local consultation requirements 
and employment law.
Outlook 
As outlined above, our strategy is focused 
on innovation and returning to growth. 
In support of this, we have made some 
choices around our three strategic 
priorities. We have also been explicit about 
our immediate priorities, mid-term goals 
and long-term aspirations. 
As we experience a period of patent 
expiries and declining revenue, our: 
 > Immediate priorities are to drive our 
on-market revenues through investment 
in our growth platforms and our portfolio 
of on-market brands. These include 
products in our three core therapy areas, 
and a focus on the Emerging Markets 
and Japan. We are also pursuing 
business development and investment 
in R&D. We have already accelerated  
a number of projects and progressed  
them into Phase III development.
 > Mid-term goals to 2016 are to progress 
our Phase II pipeline and exploit the 
potential of our biologics portfolio. 
 > Long-term aspirations to 2020 and 
beyond, in line with our strategic ambition, 
is to Achieve Scientific Leadership and 
sustainable growth, including the launch 
of two NMEs annually. 
Financial expectations
In February 2014, we updated our financial 
expectations, which superseded all 
previous guidance and planning 
assumptions:
 > we expect a low-to-mid single digit 
percentage decline in revenue at CER 
for 2014, with a marginally lower Core 
gross margin
 > in percentage terms, Core EPS for 2014 
is expected to decline in the teens at CER
 > we expect revenues in 2017 will be 
broadly in line with 2013.
These expectations involve a number  
of assumptions, including, among other 
things, Nexium US generic launch in  
May 2014.
What differentiates AstraZeneca?
We believe that in implementing our strategic priorities we can achieve  
the following:
 > A differentiated strategy A pure-play innovation/science strategy combined 
with global commercial scale
 > Growth levers Internal growth platforms (Brilinta, Emerging Markets, our 
diabetes portfolio, our respiratory franchise and Japan) can return the Company 
to growth, accelerated by focused business development 
 > Pipeline potential We expect our promising Phase II pipeline to advance to  
a strong late-stage portfolio by 2016
 > Re-focused delivery Re-focusing efforts on three core therapy areas, resources 
and business development efforts prioritised for growth and innovation 
 > Sustainability Bold steps being taken to transform our R&D innovation model, 
culture and operating model
 > Shareholder returns Productivity improvement and commitment to our 
progressive dividend policy.

role is to recommend new 
Board appointments to  
the Board and to consider, 
more broadly, succession 
planning to senior executive 
management and Board 
positions. The Nomination

controls. The Audit 
Committee is responsible  
for reviewing our financial 
reporting, internal controls, 
compliance with laws and  
our relationship with our 
external auditor, as well as  
risk management.
We seek to attract, retain 
and develop the highest-
calibre talent while paying  
no more than is necessary. 
The Group’s short- and 
long-term incentive plans 
are closely linked to our 
strategic and financial  
goals, and the delivery of 
sustainable shareholder 
value. The Remuneration 
Committee is responsible

Strategic Report | Strategy Remuneration
We seek to create sustainable growth in shareholder value by developing and 
executing a remuneration strategy that supports the successful implementation  
of our business strategy.
The progress and success of our strategy will be measured against three key  
areas: Achieve Scientific Leadership; Return to Growth; and Achieve Group Financial 
Targets. During 2013, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the Group’s short-  
and long-term performance incentive plans for the Executive Directors and senior 
management to ensure that they supported the delivery of these goals.
The key components of AstraZeneca’s remuneration strategy for Executive Directors 
are set out below. Full details of the Directors’ remuneration are outlined in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 102.
Item Policy/link to strategy/performance measures
Base pay To be sufficient (but no more than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop high-calibre talent to achieve our strategy
Short Term Incentive 
(STI) plan (annual 
bonus)
The performance measures form a Group scorecard which 
is closely aligned to our strategy and rewards commercial, 
scientific and financial success. The measures are 
considered by the Remuneration Committee and updated 
annually, and may include metrics linked to the strategic 
objectives of Achieve Scientific Leadership, Return to 
Growth, Achieve Group Financial Targets, and Be a Great 
Place to Work
Long Term Incentive 
(LTI) plans
The variable LTI arrangements comprise two plans: the 
PSP and the AZIP (see below). Currently, LTI awards are 
granted with a split between the two plans in the ratio 75% 
PSP and 25% AZIP
AstraZeneca 
Performance Share 
Plan (PSP)
The PSP performance measures are designed to align  
to financial and strategic objectives over a three-year 
performance period. They include:
 > external financial metrics, namely Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance 
 > internal financial metrics, namely cumulative free  
cash flow
 > Return to Growth measures, which are based on 
quantitative medium-term sales targets relating to key 
products and territories
 > Achieve Scientific Leadership measures, which reflect  
our ability to deliver innovation to the market
AstraZeneca 
Investment Plan 
(AZIP)
The AZIP performance measures are designed to align 
senior management’s interests to the Group’s longer-term 
financial performance over a four-year performance period 
(with a four-year holding period). They are:
 > dividend per share performance 
 > dividend cover performance

Immune-mediated therapies
Life-changing medicines 
Every year, 14 million people are diagnosed with  
cancer and more than eight million die from the disease. 
Cancer cases are projected to continue rising to more 
than 22 million estimated annually by 2035*.
Since the 1970s, AstraZeneca has developed families of medicines such as hormone-based cancer  
treatments including Nolvadex (tamoxifen), Zoladex and Faslodex, as well as Iressa, a forerunner in the field 
of targeted therapies. Among other benefits, these treatments have played a part in increasing the five-year 
survival rate for women with breast cancer from less than 70% 50 years ago to around 90% today.

Strategic Report | Pioneering science, life-changing medicines Pioneering science
Much of our scientific 
effort is focused on 
harnessing the  
power of patients’  
own immune system 
capabilities to  
fight cancer. 
Real lives
There remains a large unmet medical  
need in the treatment of lung cancer.  
One female patient, a non-smoker, 
was diagnosed with lung cancer and 
prescribed Iressa. When her disease 
progressed she enrolled onto the trial for 
AZD9291 and recorded a partial response 
to the treatment. Her message to us was 
simple: “Keep doing what you are doing 
and be proud of what you do. For me and 
thousands of other people, AstraZeneca’s 
research is really life-changing.”
We believe this approach – immune-
mediated cancer therapies, or IMT-Cs –  
will become a cornerstone of cancer 
therapy in the future. At MedImmune, 
our biologics arm, scientists are working 
to develop IMT-Cs to counter cancer’s 
immune system evading methods by 
restoring the body’s signals that activate, 
and inhibiting the signals that restrain, the 
immune system’s ability to fight cancer.
It is likely that the best strategy for any 
one patient will involve a combination of 
IMT-Cs, possibly alongside other courses 
of treatment. These parallel treatments 
include small molecule medicines 
being developed by our small molecule 
IMED units.
To support our IMT-C research  
capabilities, we acquired Amplimmune  
in 2013. Amplimmune, a biologics 
company focused on developing novel 
therapeutics in cancer immunology, will 
bolster our oncology pipeline with multiple 
early-stage assets for our IMT-C portfolio.

and the Oncology section in the Therapy Area Review from

Development
We are transforming our organisation  
to drive science and innovation, changing  
our culture and improving productivity.
Achieve Scientific Leadership 
As outlined in the Our strategic priorities 
section from page 16, achieving scientific 
leadership is a critical component of our 
path to success. 
During 2013, we:
 > focused on distinctive science in three 
core therapy areas 
 > prioritised our portfolio and accelerated 
key programmes
 > achieved our 2016 target volume for our 
Phase III pipeline three years ahead of 
schedule and improved the quality of  
our Phase II pipeline.
Achieving scientific leadership also requires 
us to change our culture and transform  
the way we work. We need to access the 
best science, whether inside or outside 
AstraZeneca. We have therefore developed 
a biotech-style operating model, with two 
autonomous research and early clinical 
development science units and a late-stage 
development organisation. We are 
collaborating across early- and late-stage 
development to tap into the best scientific 
research and develop medicines that 
transform lives. Our focus on increasing 
productivity and improving the quality of our 
pipeline is starting to benefit from our past 
investment in key capabilities, such as 
payer partnering, PHC, predictive science 
and clinical trial design. 
Transforming the way we work includes 
plans to co-locate teams across small 
molecules and biologics at our strategic 
R&D hubs – in Gaithersburg, Maryland, US; 
Cambridge, UK; and Mölndal, Sweden to 
ensure seamless delivery of the portfolio 
from early to late development and into 
life-cycle management. For more information, 
see the Strategic R&D centres section  
on page 5. We have also reshaped our 
organisation, reducing management  
layers and process complexity to improve 
decision making and empower employees. 
This means our R&D organisation is  
leaner and more efficient. As outlined  
in the Managing change section on  
page 69, we continue to support 
employees through these changes.
Research and early clinical 
development 
Our two biotech units drive innovation in 
discovery research and early development. 
Innovative Medicines and Early Development 
(IMED) is our small molecule organisation, 
while MedImmune focuses on biologics. 
Both units comprise specialist disease 
area-led Innovative Medicines sections  
and are accountable for delivery of pipeline 
projects up to Proof of Concept stage, 
when they move to our Global Medicines 
Development (GMD) unit for late-stage 
development, as described opposite. 
Our way of working gives us a distinctive 
innovation platform comprising small 
molecules, biologics, therapeutic 
combinations and PHC approaches. 
Scientific collaborations, alliances and 
business development play a critical part 
in our innovation strategy. 
Working collaboratively
To enable us to build the strongest portfolio 
possible, we are agnostic as to the source 
of scientific innovation, with a significant 
proportion of our pipeline derived from 
external sources. We have significantly 
enhanced our innovation capability by 
establishing numerous alliances and 
licensing opportunities, and completed 
strategic bolt-on acquisitions.
In Oncology, we forged new partnerships 
across our small molecule and biologics 
pipeline. In September 2013, we signed a 
worldwide licensing agreement with Merck 
for MK-1775, their oral small molecule 
inhibitor of WEE-1 kinase. MK-1775 is 
currently being evaluated in Phase IIb 
clinical studies in combination with 
standard-of-care therapies for treating 
patients with certain types of ovarian 
cancer. In October 2013, we completed 
the acquisition of Amplimmune, a biologics 
company that develops novel therapeutics 
in cancer immunology, and Spirogen, a 
biotechnology company specialising in 
antibody-drug conjugate technology for 
use in oncology. 
Choosing the right therapeutic technology 
is vital, especially since many targets have 
proved intractable to traditional small 
molecule and protein approaches. In 
March 2013, we entered into an exclusive 
agreement with Moderna Therapeutics 
to discover, develop and commercialise 
pioneering messenger RNA Therapeutics 
for the treatment of serious cardiovascular, 
metabolic and renal diseases, and cancer. 
Messenger RNA Therapeutics are an 
entirely new treatment approach that 
enables the body to produce therapeutic 
protein in vivo, opening up new treatment 
options for a wide range of diseases that 
cannot be addressed using existing 
technologies. See the case study on 
page 46 for more information.
“ Our strategic approach 
means we are well 
positioned to take advantage 
of our integrated expertise in 
small molecules, biologics, 
immunotherapies and 
protein engineering.” 
  B a hi j a J al l al 
EVP , MedImmune 
36 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Business Review In 2013, we also progressed collaborations 
with several key biotech and research 
institutions to develop and access 
innovative technology. For example, we 
extended our collaboration with X-Chem 
Inc. and plan to use their high-diversity 
library and highly efficient screening 
platform to improve the rate and quality of 
small molecule discovery. A collaboration 
with the Wyss Institute for Biologically 
Inspired Engineering at Harvard University 
will leverage the Institute’s technologies  
to better predict the safety of drugs  
in humans. 
Innovative approaches
In Oncology, our distinctive innovation 
platform means we can combine small 
molecules with biologics, known as 
immune-mediated cancer therapies 
(IMT-Cs), a promising therapeutic approach 
which harnesses the patient’s own immune 
system to fight cancer. We believe that by 
developing novel combinations of IMT-Cs, 
with each other and with small molecules, 
we can deliver significant improvements  
in overall survival. See the case study on  
page 32 for more information.
In January 2014, AstraZeneca announced  
a research collaboration with Immunocore 
under which both companies will research 
and develop Immunocore’s Immune 
Mobilising Monoclonal T-Cell Receptor 
Against Cancer (ImmTAC) technology.
A growing appreciation and a deeper 
understanding of disease diversity is 
uncovering new therapeutic targets.  
In Oncology, we work with major 
organisations, such as the National Cancer 
Institute in the US, Cancer Research UK 
and the NN Petrov Institute in Russia, to 
better understand disease and resistance 
mechanisms. In 2013, we established the 
Integrated Cardio Metabolic Centre with  
the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden to 
identify and validate novel targets within 
cardio-metabolic diseases. We also  
opened the previously announced 
Manchester Collaborative Centre for 
Inflammation Research, a unique 
pre-competitive partnership between  
The University of Manchester, GSK and 
AstraZeneca, designed to establish a 
world-leading translational centre for 
inflammatory diseases.
Our personalised healthcare strategy
A greater understanding of disease 
mechanisms leads to more sophisticated 
diagnostic protocols for tailoring both novel 
and existing treatments to the needs of 
individual patients. By the end of 2013, this 
PHC strategy was applied to 64% of our 
pipeline. PHC aims to match medicines 
only to those patients who will benefit from 
them. Advances in science mean we can 
increasingly design and use tests to tell us 
how an individual patient is likely to respond 
to a particular medicine before prescribing 
it for them. In 2013, we partnered with a 
number of diagnostic companies to 
co-develop diagnostics at the point of entry 
into clinical trials: Roche Molecular Systems 
for selumetinib, AZD5363 and AZD9291; 
Myriad Genetics for olaparib; and Abbott 
for volitinib. We also entered into a master 
collaboration agreement with Qiagen that 
includes continued support for Iressa.
One promising area for PHC is asthma,  
a heterogeneous group of conditions with 
closely related clinical features but diverse 
underlying causes and molecular 
phenotypes. By using PHC strategies early 
in the drug development process, we can 
target these distinct asthma phenotypes  
to optimise treatments. One example of this 
is benralizumab, where we are targeting 
patients in our Phase III programme with  
a distinct asthma phenotype. Benralizumab 
is the first in a series of novel PHC-driven 
biologic therapies in our portfolio that may 
represent a critical advance in the 
development of personalised asthma 
management. 
“ We are creating a more 
porous research environment 
that will help us Achieve 
Scientific Leadership by 
fostering collaboration 
between scientists both 
within and outside 
AstraZeneca.” 
  M en e l a s P a n galo s 
EVP, IMED 
Open innovation
The creation of a porous research 
environment, where scientists share ideas 
more freely, collaborate on projects and 
drive scientific innovation, is key to our drive 
to Achieve Scientific Leadership. In October 
2013, building on our open innovation 
agreements with the Medical Research 
Council in the UK, and the US National 
Institutes of Health’s new National Center 
for Advancing Translational Sciences, we 
announced an agreement with the National 
Research Program for Biopharmaceuticals 
of Taiwan to explore new therapeutic uses 
for 20 of our small molecule and biologic 
compounds. We also progressed our 
previously announced Open Innovation 
partnership with the Science for Life 
Laboratory, based in Sweden, supporting 
10 joint collaborative research projects 
covering research in metabolic, 
cardiovascular, inflammatory, cancer and 
regenerative medicine, and hosted by the 
Karolinska Institutet and Uppsala University. 
Late-stage development 
Our late-stage development organisation, 
GMD, takes projects from the point when it 
is first decided to progress them through to 
Phase III development. GMD designs and 
delivers drug programmes to support the 
approval, launch and reimbursement of our 
late-stage projects. It also pursues life-cycle 
management opportunities for products on 
the market, finding new indications for 
medicines so that more patients can 
benefit. It is responsible for both the small 
molecule and biologics projects delivered 
by our two research and early clinical 
development units, and works in 
partnership with other companies and 
organisations to co-develop new medicines 
which are in-licensed or part of a 
partnership agreement.
Prioritised pipeline
During 2013, we prioritised and, in several 
cases, accelerated late-stage development 
of projects in those disease areas where  
we believe there is the greatest potential  
to meet patient need. At the end of 2013, 
there were 11 NME projects in late-stage 
development (2012: six), either in Phase III 
or under regulatory review, including two 
from the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics 
and Omthera. Further information about  
our development pipeline is given in  
the Development pipeline section from 
page 194.
We have increased development 
collaborations with pharmaceutical partners 
and work closely with others including 
Academic Research Organisations (AROs), 
Clinical Research Organisations (CROs) and 
technology providers to deliver clinical trial 
programmes in the most efficient way, while 
identifying rigorous and innovative means  
to expand understanding of the benefits 
and risks of our products throughout their 
life-cycle, as described below.
Quality and efficiency
We continue to reshape our organisation 
and implement new operating models and 
processes to improve our efficiency and 
quality in delivering late-stage clinical trials. 
We are upgrading our IT platforms and 
systems by, for example, introducing a  
new regulatory information management 
system, using tools to provide real-time 
information about the progress of patients 
enrolled in studies and common platforms 
for sharing study information globally.  
We are standardising processes, for 
example, by adopting common data 
standards for our clinical trials and through 
simpler designs for clinical trial protocols  
we are reducing the number of amendments. 
We have adopted simpler ways of working, 
for example by reducing management 
layers and creating broader roles. We are 
cutting complexity and making 
accountabilities clearer.

Patients in global AstraZeneca studies  
by geographical region in 2013 (%)
We have grown our payer and real-world 
evidence capabilities and are providing the 
data, analysis and insights to demonstrate 
the value of our medicines to patients and 
show how they help to reduce healthcare 
costs. These studies use observational 
data, such as electronic medical records 
and patient surveys, to illustrate the impact 
of a medicine in the real-world setting. 
For example, they can show how a 
medicine can improve outcomes for 
patients compared to other treatment 
options, or reduce demand on hospital 
stays or specialist services.
Delivery through collaboration
We want to make a difference in how we 
develop drugs, not just for ourselves, but 
to benefit the industry. We do this through 
collaboration and partnership.
In 2013, we were active partners in the 
TransCelerate programme, a collaboration 
of leading biopharmaceutical companies 
that have joined forces to solve common 
R&D challenges, reduce time and cost, 
and improve quality. The year also saw 
the introduction of a new pharmaceutical 
network to rapidly source high-quality 
comparator drugs for clinical trials to speed 
up drug development, reduce drug waste 
and costs, and to continue to ensure the 
safety of patients in trials and meet all 
regulatory requirements. In addition, there 
have been initiatives to introduce common 
cross-industry processes associated with 
clinical trial site qualification and training.
We continued to work with the European 
Innovative Medicines Initiative, which 
launched two new projects in February 
2013 under the ‘New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs’ 
programme. This advances research into 
a potential new treatment for Gram-
negative bacteria, one of the toughest 
types of drug-resistant bacteria to treat, 
and tackles the economic hurdles of 
bringing new antibiotics to market.
Bioethics
†
We want to be recognised for the high 
quality of our science and the impact 
we make on serious diseases, and to be 
trusted for the way we work. Our standards 
of bioethics are global and apply to all 
AstraZeneca research activity, in all 
locations, whether conducted by us  
or on our behalf by third parties. 
Patient safety 
The safety of the patients who take our 
medicines is of fundamental importance 
to us. Our objective is to enhance 
pharmacovigilance awareness – including 
the use of collaborative programmes to 
share and use our knowledge and best 
practice in order to improve reporting and 
patient safety in developing countries.
All drugs have potential side effects and 
we aim to minimise the risks and maximise 
the benefits of each of our medicines. 
We continually monitor the use of all our 
medicines to ensure that we become aware 
of any side effects not identified during the 
development process. This is known as 
pharmacovigilance and is core to our 
responsibility to patients. We have 
comprehensive and rigorous systems in 
place for detecting and rapidly evaluating 
such effects, including mechanisms for 
highlighting those that require immediate 
Investment in capabilities
We continue to invest in core development 
capabilities to exploit science, drive 
performance, bring quality to our decision 
making and add value. This includes 
capabilities such as therapy area and 
disease area expertise, statistical 
modelling, translational patient safety,  
payer and real-world evidence, and  
global medical affairs.
We have also established leading  
capability and experience in delivering  
large outcomes trials, which are extensive, 
multi-country, multi-site studies involving 
many thousands of patients. Such trials 
often involve us collaborating with AROs 
and CROs to find the right patients in  
a timely way. In 2013, we delivered the 
SAVOR study to provide information on 
cardiovascular (CV) safety for Onglyza, a 
treatment for Type 2 diabetes. This large 
CV outcomes trial was completed and 
delivered two years ahead of schedule.
We have strengthened our collaborations 
with AROs with, for example, ongoing 
partnerships with the TIMI Study Group 
(on the Brilinta PEGASUS study), and the 
Duke Clinical Research Institute and CPC 
Clinical Research, an academic research 
organisation affiliate of the University of 
Colorado (on the Brilinta EUCLID study).
We have invested in ‘intelligent 
pharmaceuticals’ which explore how 
we can use science and technology, such 
as mobile phones and other monitoring 
devices to provide services beyond a 
medicine: for example, to provide patients 
with targeted information about their 
treatment and reminders about their 
medication; and physicians and other 
carers with alerts to prevent problems 
arising and to avoid the need for hospital 
or doctor visits. Pilot studies are under 
way to test new technology approaches.

Strategic Report | Business Review | Research and Development attention. We also work to ensure that 
accurate, well-informed and up-to-date 
information concerning the safety profile of 
our drugs is provided to regulators, doctors, 
other healthcare professionals and, where 
appropriate, patients. 
The pharmacovigilance awareness 
programme that was developed in 2012 
has now been made available to marketing 
companies. There are also initiatives under 
way in a number of countries where we are 
working closely with local health authorities 
to raise pharmacovigilance awareness. 
We have an experienced, in-house team 
of clinical patient safety professionals 
dedicated to ensuring that we meet our 
commitment to patient safety. At a global 
level, every medicine in development 
and on the market is allocated a Global 
Safety Physician and a team of patient 
safety scientists. In each of our markets, 
we have dedicated safety managers 
with responsibility for patient safety at 
a local level.
Our Chief Medical Officer has overall 
accountability for the benefit/risk profiles 
of our products in development and on 
the market. He provides medical oversight 
and ensures appropriate risk assessment 
processes exist to enable informed safety 
decisions to be made rapidly.
Clinical trials 
We conduct clinical trials at multiple sites 
in several different countries/regions as 
shown in the chart above. A broad 
geographic span helps us ensure that 
those taking part in our studies reflect the 
diversity of patients around the world for 
whom the new medicine is intended. This 
approach also helps identify the types of 
people for whom the treatment may be 
most beneficial. 
Our global governance process for 
determining where we locate clinical trials 
provides the framework for ensuring a 
consistent approach worldwide. We take 
several factors into account, including the 
availability of experienced and independent 
ethics committees and a robust regulatory 
regime, as well as sufficient numbers of 
trained healthcare professionals and 
patients willing to participate.
Before a trial begins, we work to make 
sure that those taking part understand the 
nature and purpose of the research and 
that the proper procedure for gaining 
informed consent is followed (including 
managing any special circumstances, such 
as different levels of literacy). Protecting 
participants throughout the trial process 
is a priority and we have strict procedures 
to ensure they are not exposed to any 
unnecessary risks. 
All our clinical studies are conceptually 
designed and finally interpreted in-house 
but a percentage are run for us by contract 
research organisations. In 2013, around 
29% of patients in our small molecule 
studies and around 64% of those in our 
biologics studies were monitored by 
such organisations on our behalf. We 
contractually require these partners to 
work to our global standards and conduct 
risk-based audits to monitor compliance.
Animal research 
We continue to promote and embed 
scientific and technical best practice in 
animal research.
This includes our commitment to minimise 
the use of animals in our research without 
compromising the quality of the research 
data. Wherever possible, we use 
non-animal methods, such as computer 
modelling, that eliminate or reduce the need 
to use animals early in drug development. 
We also work to refine our existing 
methods. This replacement, reduction 
and refinement of animal studies is known 
as ‘the 3Rs’. To support our drive for 
continuous improvement, we work within 
AstraZeneca and with the wider scientific 
community to share good practice and 
3Rs achievements.
The number of animals we use will  
continue to vary because use depends  
on a number of factors, including the 
amount of pre-clinical research we are 
doing, the complexity of the diseases under 
investigation and regulatory requirements. 
We believe that, without our active 
commitment to the 3Rs, our animal use 
would be much greater. In 2013, we used 
260,930 animals in-house (2012: 304,751). 
In addition, 19,676 animals were used by 
external contract research organisations 
on our behalf (2012: 14,284). 
The welfare of the animals we use is a top 
priority and our Bioethics Policy applies 
worldwide. Government authorities inspect 
our internal animal research facilities. 
External organisations that conduct animal 
studies on our behalf are required to 
comply with our global standards and 
we undertake activities to ensure our 
expectations are being met. During 2013, 
we continued to implement our new Good 
Statistical Practice global standard, across 
our internal animal research and some of 
our external partners.
†  Further information on AstraZeneca’s approach to  
responsible business can be found in the Responsible 
Business section from page 220 and on our website,  
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Clinical trial transparency 
AstraZeneca has a long-standing commitment to making information about  
our clinical research publicly available, to enhance the scientific understanding  
of how our medicines work. We have a commitment to be transparent, to benefit  
the medical interest of patients and investigational research participants, and the 
disclosure requirements set out in our Bioethics Policy exceed the current legal 
requirements. By 31 December 2013, we had 2,241 registered investigational clinical 
studies and, in line with our policy or legal requirements, had posted the results  
and/or clinical study reports and synopses relating to more than half of these  
on a range of public websites, including our own dedicated clinical trials website, 
www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com.
Since February 2013, we have voluntarily disclosed the research protocol for  
our clinical trials on www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com once a manuscript  
relating to results of the relevant trial on an investigational or approved product is 
published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The posted protocol includes key 
sections necessary for evaluating the study, but proprietary information in the 
protocol is edited before posting. This policy also applies to observational studies 
published in peer-reviewed journals relevant to the efficacy or safety profile of an 
AstraZeneca product.
Calls for ‘open access’ to clinical data raise complex practical, legal and ethical 
issues around full disclosure of patient information. Decision makers, as well as 
academia and industry, have a duty to consider all the implications that could  
arise from such proposals. These include ensuring scientific rigour, safeguarding 
patient privacy and protecting innovation and medical progress. We are in active 
discussions with stakeholders including regulators, legislators, industry and 
academia about proposals to routinely publish full clinical trial and patient data,  
in order to identify globally recognised, practicable solutions that deliver real  
benefits to medical science and to our patients.

We have a strong global commercial 
capability and are building on this so that 
we can better meet the needs of patients.
Organisation and approach 
If we are to change the lives of people 
around the world, we need to ensure the 
right medicines are available and that 
patients have access to them. To that end, 
our sales and marketing teams, which 
comprised around 29,600 employees at  
the end of 2013, are active in more than 
100 countries. In most countries, our  
sales are made through wholly-owned  
local marketing companies. Elsewhere,  
we sell through distributors or local 
representative offices. 
Our products are marketed largely to 
primary care and specialist doctors. We 
aim to meet their needs by having highly 
accountable local leaders who understand 
their customers and focus on business 
growth. Our activities are grouped into 
three Commercial Regions – North 
America, Europe and International – as well 
as Japan, our second largest market. In 
addition, our GPPS organisation develops 
global product strategies and drives 
commercial excellence, ensuring a strong 
customer focus and commercial direction  
in managing our pipeline and marketed 
products. All our efforts are underpinned  
by a commitment to conducting sales  
and marketing activity in accordance with 
our values and to driving commercial 
success responsibly.
increases in patient co-insurance or 
co-payments, are the primary drivers of 
increased generics use. In 2013, 86% of 
prescriptions dispensed in the US were 
generic. While widespread adoption of a 
broad national price-control scheme in the 
near future is unlikely, increased focus on 
pharmaceutical prices and their impact on 
healthcare costs is likely to continue for the 
foreseeable future.

European markets, which include France, 
Germany, Italy, the UK, Spain, and the 
Nordic-Baltic countries. The total European 
pharmaceutical market was worth  
$205 billion in 2013. We are the ninth 
largest pharmaceutical company with  
a 3.1% market share of prescription  
sales by value. 
In 2013, our sales in Europe were  
$6.7 billion, down by 9% from 2012.  
The major external variables affecting  
sales were the macroeconomic 
environment, increased government 
interventions (for example price and volume 
interventions) and increased trade across 
markets. The austerity environment also 
continues in Europe and is accelerating  
in some markets. We continue to launch

AstraZeneca is the third largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in the US, with a 5.1% market 
share of US pharmaceuticals by  
sales value.
Sales in the US in 2013 decreased by 9%  
to $9,691 million (2012: $10,655 million; 
2011: $13,426 million), as loss of exclusivity 
on Seroquel IR in March 2012 as well as  
the impact of generic competition was  
only partially offset by performance across 
our growth platforms, up $493 million or 
29%, including Brilinta, Symbicort and 
diabetes brands.
The Affordable Care Act, which came  
into force in March 2010, has had, and is 
expected to continue to have, a significant 
impact on our US sales and the US 
healthcare industry as a whole. In 2013, the 
overall reduction in our profit before tax for 
the year due to higher minimum Medicaid 
rebates on prescription drugs, discounts on 
branded pharmaceutical sales to Medicare 
Part D beneficiaries, and an industry-wide 
excise fee was $933 million (2012: $858 
million). See the Geographical Review,  
from page 214 for more information. 
Currently, there is no direct governmental 
control of prices for commercial 
prescription drug sales in the US. However, 
some publicly funded programmes, such 
as Medicaid and TRICARE (Department of 
Veterans Affairs), have statutorily mandated 
rebates and discounts that have the effect 
of price controls for these programmes. 
Additionally, pressure on pricing, availability 
and use of prescription drugs for both 
commercial and public payers continues  
to increase. This is driven by, among other 
things, an increased focus on generic 
alternatives. Budgetary policies within 
healthcare systems and providers, including 
the use of ‘generics only’ formularies, and 
“ We combine a global reach 
with strong local customer 
relationships. We are 
committed to working

Zealand declined by 18% in 2013, primarily 
due to the entry of generic rosuvastatin 
(Crestor) and generic candesartan 
(Atacand) into the Australian market. For 
more information on our performance in 
Established ROW, see the Geographical 
Review, from page 214.
Emerging Markets 
Emerging Markets, as defined in the 
Glossary on page 232, comprise a range  
of countries with the unifying characteristic 
of a dynamic, growing economy. As outlined 
in the Our marketplace section on page 13, 
demand drivers and strong economic 
fundamentals mean that these countries 
represent a major growth opportunity for 
the biopharmaceutical industry.
Emerging Markets are, however, not 
immune to the impact of the prolonged 
economic downturn. Market volatility is 
higher than in Established Markets, with 
Venezuela, for example, currently beset  
by political and economic challenges. 
Regulatory and government interventions 
also typically present challenges in a 
number of markets at any one time.
AstraZeneca was the eighth largest 
multinational pharmaceutical company 
across the Emerging Markets in 2013 with 
revenue of $5.4 billion. Within Emerging 
Markets, there are several particularly  
good growth opportunities within China, 
Russia, Africa, parts of Asia (India, Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Vietnam), and Latin America 
(Argentina and Chile).
To expand our presence in Emerging 
Markets, we have established an 
International Region whose 16,100 
employees, almost all of whom are  
located within their respective markets,  
are focused on meeting customers’ needs. 
The Region’s platforms for growth include 
our new medicines, notably Brilinta, as  
well as those for diabetes, and our 
established portfolio of medicines for 
cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and 
gastrointestinal diseases. To provide 
information to physicians on this broad 
portfolio, we are selectively investing  
in sales capabilities where we see 
opportunities from unmet patient need,  
and expanding our reach through 
multi-channel marketing. 
We are also pursuing innovative 
collaboration opportunities. This includes 
partnering with other biopharmaceutical 
companies to access products that 
complement our own portfolio. For 
example, the team in China works as part 
of our global collaboration with FibroGen  
to develop and commercialise roxadustat 
(FG-4592), a first-in-class oral compound  
in development for treating anaemia. For 
more information on our performance in 
Emerging Markets, see the Geographical 
Review from page 214.
“ Our customers, and their 
needs, are changing. We are 
changing too – ensuring we 
reach and engage with our 
customers in ways that work 
best for them.”

Driving commercial success 
Our Global Commercial Excellence  
team delivers innovative commercial 
capabilities for the benefit of all our 
customers, via a range of specialist teams. 
One leverages data and analytics to identify 
opportunities to improve healthcare, while  
a second builds on the success of our 
service, inside sales and nurse educator 
teams, to ensure we engage customers in 
innovative ways that work for them. A digital 
team enhances the content and services 
we deliver online, while a Commercial 
Learning Academy seeks to deliver 
excellence across the range of our global 
commercial capabilities. Our commercial 
operations unit strives to deliver these 
capabilities across the organisation.
In 2013, one area of focus was medical 
affairs, where we engaged key opinion 
leaders in our clinical programmes and  
took a lead in evidence generation, with 
greater numbers of patients involved in  
our interventional, real-world evidence,  
and investigator-sponsored studies. 
Pricing our medicines 
Our challenge is to deliver innovative 
medicines that improve health for patients, 
bring benefits to society and provide an 
appropriate return on our investment.  
Our global pricing policy provides the 
framework to ensure appropriate patient 
access while optimising the profitability of 
all our products in a sustainable way. When 
setting the price of a medicine, we take into 
consideration its full value to patients, to 
those who pay for healthcare and to society 
in general. We also pursue a flexible 
approach to the pricing of our medicines. 
For example, we support the concept  
of differential pricing, provided that 
appropriate safeguards ensure lower-priced 
products are not diverted from patients 
who need them to be sold and used in 
more affluent markets. 
Delivering value for payers 
Our medicines play an important role in 
treating unmet medical need. Health is a 
fundamental value for patients and society 
and improving health brings economic as 
well as therapeutic benefits. Effective 
treatments can also help to lower 
healthcare costs by reducing the need  
for more expensive care, such as hospital 
stays or surgery, or through preventing 
people from developing more serious or 
debilitating diseases that are costly to  
treat. They also contribute to increased 
productivity by reducing or preventing the 
incidence of diseases that prevent people 
from working. 
As outlined in the Pricing pressure section 
on page 15, there is continued downward 
pressure on drug pricing and, in the current 
difficult economic environment, payers 
expect us to define the value our medicines 
create. We are acutely aware of the 
challenges facing those who pay for 
healthcare and are committed to delivering 
value, which will allow us to bring our 
medicines to the patients who need them. 
Therefore, we work with payers and 
providers to understand their priorities and 
requirements and generate evidence of 
how our products offer value and support 
cost-effective healthcare delivery.
Increasing access to healthcare
†
 
AstraZeneca is committed to increasing 
access to healthcare for under-served 
patient populations in a sustainable way. 
This is a priority for our Responsible 
Business agenda. 
Our access to healthcare strategy 
comprises three strands: 
 > The first component represents the most 
important way in which we enable 
access to our medicines – through our 
mainstream business.

Sales and marketing ethics
†
 
We are committed to delivering consistently 
high ethical standards of sales and 
marketing practice worldwide and to 
ensuring compliance with our Ethical 
Interactions Policy. We report publicly  
on the number of:
 > confirmed breaches of external sales  
and marketing codes 
 > instances of failure to meet our standards 
by employees in our Commercial 
Regions, including contract staff
 > corrective actions for breaches of our 
Code of Conduct or supporting policies 
by Commercial employees, including 
contract staff.
During 2013, we continued to provide 
training for employees on the global 
standards that govern the way we conduct 
our business around the world. We have 
comprehensive processes for monitoring 
compliance with our Code of Conduct  
and global policies, including dedicated 
compliance professionals who support  
our line managers locally in monitoring their 
staff activities. We also have a network  
of nominated signatories who review our 
promotional materials against all applicable 
requirements. In addition, in 2013, audit 
professionals conducted compliance audits 
of a selection of our marketing companies.
As shown in the Confirmed external 
breaches chart above, we identified 11 
confirmed breaches of external sales and 
marketing regulations or codes in 2013 
(2012: 10). There were 1,773 instances of 
non-compliance with AstraZeneca’s Code 
of Conduct, Global Policies or related 
control standards in our Commercial 
Regions, including contract staff and other 
third parties, the majority of which were 
minor (2012: 1,932). We believe that the 
movement in this number reflects our 
continued management oversight.
As shown in the Corrective actions table 
above, following these breaches (and it is 
important to note that a single breach can 
involve more than one person failing to 
meet required standards), we removed 187 
people from their role, formally warned 568 
others and provided further guidance or 
coaching on our policies for 1,813 more. 
The most serious breaches are raised with 
the Audit Committee.
US Corporate Integrity Agreement and 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
reporting
In April 2010, AstraZeneca signed an 
agreement with the DOJ to settle an 
investigation relating to the sales and 
marketing of Seroquel IR. The requirements 
of the associated CIA between 
AstraZeneca and the Office of the Inspector 
General of the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (OIG) include a 
number of active monitoring and 
self-reporting obligations that differ from the 
self-reporting required by authorities in the 
rest of the world. To meet these obligations, 
AstraZeneca provides notices to the OIG 
describing the outcomes of particular 
investigations potentially relating to 
violations of certain laws, as well as a 
separate annual report to the OIG 
summarising monitoring and investigation 
outcomes relevant to the CIA requirements. 
Under the CIA, AstraZeneca also discloses 
on a publicly available website certain 
payments to US physicians and institutions. 
In addition, with effect from March 2014, 
AstraZeneca will begin reporting to the US 
government detailed information relating  
to payments to physicians and teaching 
hospitals in the US, as required by The 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
†  Further information on AstraZeneca’s approach to  
responsible business can be found in the Responsible 
Business section from page 220 and on our website,  
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
 > The second strand captures how we  
are making it easier for more patients to 
afford our medicines, particularly in the 
emerging middle class in Emerging 
Markets. We will build on the experience 
of initiatives such as our ‘Faz Bem’ 
(Wellbeing) programme in Brazil, which 
provides significant discounts on our 
medicines and provides other services 
for patients, and our Patient Access Card 
schemes in Central and Eastern Europe. 
For example, Faz Bem expanded by  
29% in 2013, which led to us reaching 
290,000 more Brazilian patients.
 > The final area of focus is in strengthening 
healthcare capabilities, particularly in 
developing economies where the price  
of a medicine may not be the most 
significant barrier to providing healthcare. 
Our ambition here is to considerably 
expand our efforts in Africa to enable  
far greater access to hypertension 
medication, and other essential services, 
for patients who do not have access to 
medication or other forms of care. In 
2014, we will evaluate how we can best 
do this and with whom we can partner 
most effectively. We believe that working 
in partnership with different stakeholders 
is the most effective and sustainable way 
to increase access to healthcare.
“ If we are to fulfil our potential 
to transform the lives of 
patients in Emerging Markets, 
we need to develop 
sustainable ways of increasing 
access to healthcare.”

Strategic Report | Business Review | Sales and Marketing Manufacturing 
and Supply
Our programme of investment  
in continuous improvement helps  
us get our medicines to patients  
as efficiently as possible.
Our strategy is to balance innovative and 
efficient in-house manufacturing capabilities 
with external manufacturing resources, 
particularly in relation to the early stages of 
our production process. Where efficiencies 
can be achieved, we continue to consider 
using outsourced production but our 
strategy is to retain the final stages of the 
production cycle in-house. This balance is 
designed to give us product integrity and 
quality assurance while affording us cost 
efficiency and volume flexibility.
We progressed two key production facilities 
during 2013 in China (Taizhou), our second 
facility in the country, and in Russia 
(Vorsino), which will enable us to better 
supply our products to both markets locally. 
These sites are intended to commence 
phased commercial production in 
2014/2015. In 2013, we also announced 
plans to invest $190 million to construct a 
new facility at our Macclesfield (UK) facility 
by 2017 , to continue production of Zoladex. 
The work is led by our global engineering 
group who put a strong focus on carrying 
out these projects fully in line with our 
ethical and safety standards. 
Regulation and compliance 
Facilities and processes for manufacturing 
medicines must observe rigorous 
standards of quality. They are subject to 
inspections by regulatory authorities to 
ensure compliance with prescribed 
standards. Regulatory authorities have the 
power to require improvements to facilities 
and processes, halt production and impose 
conditions that must be satisfied before 
production can resume. Regulatory 
standards are not harmonised globally  
and evolve over time.
We hosted 26 independent inspections 
from 10 different regulatory authorities  
in 2013. All observations from such 
inspections are reviewed along with the 
outcomes of internal audits and subsequent 
improvement actions are put in place as 
required to ensure ongoing compliance. 
We are actively involved in providing  
input into evolving regulations, both at 
national and international levels, through  
our membership of industry associations.  
We work actively, for example, with both 
EFPIA and Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America on discussions 
around improving supply chain security  
and minimising drug shortages.
Our supply and manufacturing strategy is 
based on our commitment to maintaining 
the highest ethical standards while 
complying with internal policies, and laws 
and regulations. We achieve this by placing 
compliance responsibility with line 
managers who are supported by dedicated 
compliance teams. Independent assurance 
is provided by our IA function. 
Product quality and supply chain 
We are committed to delivering product 
quality that underpins the safety and 
efficacy of our medicines. We have a 
comprehensive quality management 
system in place designed to assure the 
quality of our products in compliance  
with relevant regulations.
Continuous improvement
Our continuous improvement programme 
allows us to improve our systems and 
minimise the impact of our activities on the 
environment. We focus on what adds value 
to our customers and patients, as well as 
waste elimination. The programme has 
delivered significant benefits in recent 
years, including reduced manufacturing 
lead times and lower average stock levels, 
both of which improve our ability to respond 
to customer needs and reduce inventory 
costs. All improvements are designed to 
ensure we maintain product quality, safety 
and customer service.
We have applied Lean production business 
improvement tools and ways of working to 
improve the efficiency of our manufacturing 
plants for a number of years and, in recent 
years, have applied them to the whole  
of our supply chain. This has led to 
improvements in quality, lead times and 
overall equipment effectiveness. In 2013, 
we continued to establish more efficient 
processes, with experts from our global 
supply chain organisation providing 
cross-functional support throughout  
the business. 
“  People who take our 
medicines rightly expect 
them to be safe and 
effective. Our quality 
management systems are 
designed to provide that 
assurance.”

43 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Working with suppliers
†
We are committed to integrating 
AstraZeneca’s ethical standards into 
our procurement activities and decisions 
worldwide. Our objective is to monitor 
compliance through our ongoing 
assessment and programmes, which 
focus on areas experiencing the greatest 
challenges. We address challenges with 
our suppliers and promote improvement 
through collaboration.
Our Global Responsible Procurement 
Standard defines one of the key business 
processes for integrating our ethical 
standards into our procurement activity 
and decision making worldwide. The same 
initial assessment process is used for all 
suppliers and more detailed, focused 
assessments are then made, relevant to the 
service provided. Since the programme 
began in 2009, we have completed 7 ,138 
assessments of new and existing suppliers, 
which accounts for approximately 90% of 
our spend with suppliers.
We categorise suppliers as high, medium 
or low risk. We focus our auditing efforts  
on high and medium risk rated suppliers 
but we also audit some suppliers that we 
consider to be lower risk, to confirm our 
performance expectations across all 
suppliers. In 2013, we continued our audit 
activity with 61 audits across 25 countries 
(482 audits in 2012) as set out in the table 
above. A full audit of all incumbent suppliers 
was completed in 2012, resulting in only 
new supplier and reassessment audits 
taking place in 2013. Improvements to the 
earlier stages of supplier due diligence, 
based on lessons learnt since 2009, have 
allowed an increased level of focus on 
suppliers categorised as ‘high risk’. 
Fifty three percent of suppliers audited 
demonstrated standards that met our 
expectations, with a further 41% 
implementing improvements to address 
minor non-compliances. None of the 
suppliers audited this year will require 
significant follow-up to confirm they will 
make the improvements we require. We 
will not use suppliers who are unable or 
unwilling to meet our expectations in  
a timely way. During 2013, we identified  
and rejected 48 prospective suppliers  
from consideration during our due  
diligence process. 
Environmental impact
†
Our targets for 2013
‡
 included reducing: 
 > operational greenhouse gas footprint 
to 794 thousand tonnes CO 2 e/yr
 > hazardous waste to 0.68 tonnes/$m 
sales and non-hazardous waste to 
0.51 tonnes/employee
 > water use to 3.9 million m
3
.
We work to reduce our greenhouse  
gas emissions by, among other things, 
improving our energy efficiency and 
pursuing lower-carbon alternatives to fossil 
fuels at our sites. We strive to ensure that 
our travel and transport activities are as 
efficient as possible. Our carbon footprint  
is also affected by some of our respiratory 
therapies, specifically our pressurised 
metered-dose inhalers that rely on 
hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants  
to deliver the medicine to a patient’s 
airways. While HFAs have no ozone 
depletion potential and a third or less  
of the global warming potential than the 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replace, 
they are still greenhouse gases. Our target 
is to reduce our operational greenhouse 
gas footprint (excluding emissions from 
patient use of our inhaler therapies) by  
20% from our 2010 levels by 2015. In 2013, 
our operational greenhouse gas footprint 
totalled 718 thousand tonnes, a reduction 
of 20% from our 2010 baseline. Further 
information on carbon reporting is included 
in the Responsible Business section from 
page 220.
Managing risk
Given our strategy to outsource the majority 
of API manufacturing, we place particular 
importance on our global procurement 
policies and integrated risk management 
processes to ensure uninterrupted supply 
of high-quality raw materials. Supplies are 
purchased from a range of suppliers.  
We factor in a wide range of potential risks 
to global supply, such as disasters that 
remove supply capability or the unavailability 
of key raw materials, and work to ensure 
that these risks are effectively mitigated. 
Contingency plans include the appropriate 
use of dual or multiple suppliers and 
maintaining appropriate stock levels. 
Although the price of raw materials may 
fluctuate, our global purchasing policies 
seek to avoid such fluctuations becoming 
material to our business.
We also take into account reputational risk 
associated with our use of suppliers and 
are committed to working only with 
suppliers that embrace standards of ethical 
behaviour that are consistent with our own. 
As part of our overall risk management, we 
carefully consider the timing of investment 
with a view to ensuring that secure supply 
chains are in place for our products. 
We also have a programme in place to 
provide appropriate supply capabilities 
for our new products.
“ As a responsible business, 
we will only work with those 
companies whose ethical 
standards are consistent with 
our own. Our supplier due 
diligence processes help 
provide confirmation that 
they meet our expectations.”

44 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Business Review | Manufacturing and Supply The management of waste is another  
key aspect of our commitment and we  
have a 2015 target of a 15% reduction in 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste from 
our 2010 levels. Our primary focus is waste 
prevention, but where this is not practical, 
we concentrate on waste minimisation  
and appropriate treatment or disposal  
to maximise the reuse and recycling of 
materials and minimise disposal to landfill. 
In 2013, our total waste was 32.8 thousand 
tonnes with a tonnes/$m index of 1.3. Our 
hazardous waste has been reduced by 
47% (a reduction of 31% indexed to $m 
revenues) since 2010, principally due to 
changing production patterns and a major 
investment at our manufacturing site in the 
south west of the UK to enable recycling 
and reuse of solvent wastes. Our 
non-hazardous waste indexed against 
number of staff has not improved due  
to the significant reductions in our staff 
numbers since the baseline was set.
We recognise the need to use water 
responsibly and, where possible, to 
minimise the use of water in our facilities.  
To support the delivery of our target  
to reduce water use by 25% from our  
2010 levels by 2015, we now have water 
conservation plans at our largest sites.  
In 2013, our water use was 3.7 million m
3
,  
a reduction of 19% from our 2010 baseline. 
Water use indexed to revenues was 
140m
3
/$m (+5% from 2010 baseline).
We are also working to ensure that we 
measure and report the impact of our 
external manufacturing activity on the 
environment, and that our suppliers have 
appropriate environmental improvement 
targets. We believe we have captured  
data for more than 90% of the globally 
managed outsourced manufacture of key 
intermediates and APIs, formulation and 
packaging for our established brands.  
The full data is available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Our continued commitment to product 
stewardship is underpinned by our  
ongoing work to integrate environmental 
considerations into a medicine’s complete 
life-cycle, from discovery and development, 
through manufacturing, commercialisation 
and to its ultimate disposal. We follow a 
progressive programme designed to ensure 
that our manufacturing emissions of APIs 
do not exceed our own internally defined 
standards. We confirmed safe discharges 
at all of our own manufacturing sites in 2010 
and have a rolling programme to confirm 
ongoing compliance. During 2013 we 
reassessed 12 of our sites to confirm safe 
discharges. We also follow a progressive 
approach and internal process to ensure 
ongoing ecopharmacovigilance for our 
products. This involves regular reviewing of 
emerging science and literature to identify 
any new information that might inform the 
environmental risk management plans for 
our products. This is a novel initiative and 
we published our approach in the Drug 
Safety journal in July 2013. Further 
information is available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility, 
including environmental risk assessment 
data for our medicines.

Cardiac regeneration
Pioneering science
We aim to develop 
medicines that will 
slow or stop cardiac 
disease progression, 
or improve the 
function of a 
damaged heart. 
Our goal is to develop therapies for 
congestive heart failure patients by activating 
cardiac stem cells in the heart to regenerate 
the myocardium. If successful, this would 
offer a potential cure to patients who are 
dying of heart failure and create an entirely 
new treatment paradigm. 
Breakthrough science in heart regeneration 
indicates that specific powerful biological 
molecules, also known as ‘paracrine  
factors’, play a major role in cardiac stem  
cell activation and the repair of damaged 
heart cells. We are leveraging our biologics 
expertise in developing these potentially 
transformative new treatments.
Additionally, in March 2013, AstraZeneca  
and Moderna Therapeutics agreed to 
develop pioneering messenger RNA 
Therapeutics. These have the potential  
to develop therapeutic protein in vivo  
and restore cardiac function in the body.
Then, in June 2013, we announced an 
agreement with the Karolinska Institutet, 
Stockholm, Sweden to create an integrated 
centre for cardiovascular and metabolic 
diseases. One of its priorities will be  
cardiac regeneration. 
See the Research and Development section from page 36  
and the Cardiovascular and Metabolic disease section in the 
Therapy Area Review from page 52 for more information.

Real lives
One young patient, now 49, was 
diagnosed with heart failure in 2001 and, 
10 years later, received a heart transplant 
– the only option available to her. She 
said: “It got to a point where I could only 
take 15 steps at a time before sitting 
down to catch my breath, and to me 
this was perfectly normal.” Most heart 
failure patients are not eligible for a heart 
transplant and her story emphasises 
the desperate need for new therapeutic 
approaches to reduce the burden of 
heart failure.
Life-changing medicines
Each year around 5.8 million people are 
diagnosed with heart failure in the US, with 
more than 23 million diagnosed worldwide. 
Under the current standard of care, 50% of patients will die within five years of 
diagnosis, with 90% dying within 10 years*.
AstraZeneca has a strong history of innovation in cardiac care. More than three 
decades ago, we revolutionised the treatment of heart failure, by introducing 
beta-blockers. This innovation has saved many lives worldwide. Our most recent 
contribution to cardiac care is Brilinta.

47 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Overview
Our Business model section on page 10 demonstrates how we apply 
our resources and assets across the whole life-cycle of a medicine.
These efforts were detailed in the Business Review. In this Therapy Area Review, we describe how we 
apply those resources across our chosen therapy areas.
Fourteen projects (inclusive of combination 
trials) entered first human testing (Phase I) 
during 2013. For further detailed information, 
see our Development pipeline table from 
page 194. 
Across the clinical portfolio, 33 projects 
successfully progressed to their next 
phase. This excludes two Phase I studies 
expanded to include patients in 2013,  
one progression within Phase II and one 
Phase II start in a new indication. The 
Pipeline delivery table opposite summarises  
the year’s key pipeline progressions.  
Four NMEs commenced Phase III trials  
as a result of the acceleration of selected 
quality programmes. Fifteen projects  
were withdrawn in 2013: 13 projects  
were withdrawn following poorer than 
anticipated safety or efficacy results;  
one was withdrawn for economic reasons; 
and one because of uncertainty in the 
scientific hypothesis. 
The early clinical pipeline shows a shift 
toward specialty care, with 80% of 
programmes in Phase I and II directed at 
such indications. Our late-stage pipeline 
was strengthened during 2013 through  
a combination of internal acceleration  
of priority programmes and in-licences  
and acquisitions of externally originated 
compounds in our core therapy areas. We 
believe that our investment in the quality of 
our science and strong governance will 
allow us to launch a rising number of 
first-in-class therapies in the next decade.
Our biologics pipeline has matured in 
recent years resulting in a 50-50 balance of 
small molecule programmes and biologics 
in the clinical portfolio. In specialty care we 
focus on specifically defined or biologically 
targeted populations, determined by the 
scientific pathway of the disease and mode 
of action of the molecule. An increasing 
number of specialty care products require  
a diagnostic test for patient eligibility or to 
achieve the best outcomes. The diseases 
which specialty care products treat are 
generally more severe, with the patient 
population concentrated under the care  
of a subset of doctors and in specialty 
healthcare facilities. Specialty care  
products generally command higher prices 
and must deliver higher value. Making them 
available to the right patients requires tight 
co-ordination between our commercial, 
medical and supply chain teams. 
For information about the risks inherent in 
the clinical phase of development, please 
see the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section from page 200. 
Our products 
While the focus of this Therapy Area Review 
is on our key marketed products, many of 
our other established products are crucial 
to certain markets within Emerging Markets 
and, taken together, represent an important 
part of AstraZeneca’s business.
For a list of all our potential new products 
and product life-cycle developments, see 
the Pipeline by therapy area table on page 
50 and the Development pipeline table, 
from page 194. For details of patent expiries 
of our key marketed products, see the 
Patent expiries section on page 198.
Indications for each product described  
in this Therapy Area Review may vary  
from country to country. Local prescribing 
information should be referred to for 
country-specific indications for any 
particular product.
Many of our products are subject to 
litigation. Information about material legal 
proceedings can be found in Note 25 to  
the Financial Statements from page 176. 
Details of relevant risks are set out in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
from page 200.
As outlined in the Our strategic priorities 
section from page 16, a key element of our 
drive to Achieve Scientific Leadership is our 
decision to focus on distinctive science in 
three core therapy areas: Cardiovascular 
and Metabolic disease (CVMD); Oncology; 
and Respiratory, Inflammation and 
Autoimmunity (RIA). We will do this by 
exploiting our unique combination of 
strengths in biologics and small molecules, 
immunotherapies and protein engineering 
technologies. Our approach to Infection, 
Neuroscience and Gastrointestinal (ING)  
is opportunity-driven.
This Therapy Area Review reflects the 
range of our activities. They are led by  
our GPPS team but draw heavily on the 
expertise of the whole organisation, so 
ensuring our science is connected with 
patients’ needs. We embed these insights 
into our work based on our interactions  
with healthcare providers, patients, 
regulators and payers. This approach  
helps us to prioritise resources and 
optimise our portfolio, thereby delivering 
medicines that customers value and  
which meet their needs.

Our strategic priorities
AstraZeneca is a leader in the treatment  
of cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic 
diseases. We aim to build on our strong 
position, with a particular focus on 
thrombosis (blood clotting), atherosclerosis 
(hardening of the arteries) and metabolic 
diseases, including diabetes and its 
complications. Despite improvements  
in the quality of diagnosis and treatment, 
unmet medical need remains high. These 
diseases, together with their complications, 
continue to grow worldwide (both in 
Established Markets and Emerging 
Markets) as a consequence of the  
spread of a westernised lifestyle. We are 
developing potential new therapies using  
a variety of approaches, including small 
molecules, antibodies, peptides and 
proteins, to address this growing need.
Our strategy for our CV disease area is  
to maximise the benefits for patients from 
our existing portfolio of medicines, such as 
our statin, Crestor, and ensure we supply 
Brilinta/Brilique, our oral antiplatelet 
treatment, to all those who can benefit from 
it. We also want to optimise the potential  
of our research and clinical projects for the 
treatment of conditions such as heart and 
kidney diseases, atherosclerosis and acute 
coronary syndromes (ACS). In addition,  
we are exploring ways to expand our  
core capabilities to deliver differentiated 
products, such as research into cardiac 
regeneration. See the case study on page 
46 for more information.
Finally, we are searching for business 
development transactions that complement 
our activities. For example, in March  
2013, we cemented our long-standing 
collaboration with the Karolinska Institutet 
by announcing the creation of a research 
centre, at the Institutet’s site in Stockholm, 
Sweden. The centre will conduct 
pre-clinical and clinical studies to advance 
the understanding of CV and metabolic 
disease pathophysiology and assess  
new drug targets. Also in March 2013, we 
announced an exclusive agreement with 
Moderna Therapeutics to discover, develop 
and commercialise pioneering messenger 
RNA Therapeutics for the treatment of 
serious CV, metabolic and renal diseases.
These transactions will also support our 
ambitions for our Metabolic disease area, 
with its focus on diabetes, diabetic 
nephropathy and obesity. We plan to 
continue building our base with existing 
brands and develop our research and 
clinical projects so we are best able to meet 
individual patients’ unique sets of medical 
needs and build a position of leadership  
in the area.
Cardiovascular disease 
Hypertension (high blood pressure) and 
dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of blood 
lipids) damage the arterial wall which may 
lead to atherosclerosis. Lipid-modifying 
therapy, primarily statins, is a cornerstone 
for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
ACS is an umbrella term for sudden chest 
pain and other symptoms due to insufficient 
blood supply (ischaemia) to the heart 
muscle. ACS is the acute manifestation of 
ischaemic heart disease and is associated 
with considerable subsequent mortality and 
morbidity. There remains a significant need 
to improve patient outcomes and reduce 
the costs of treating ACS.
Our 2013 focus
Globally, Crestor gained market share  
(by value) after its launch in 2003 with  
its differentiated profile in managing 
cholesterol levels and its more recent label 
indications for slowing the progression of 
atherosclerosis and reducing the risk of CV 
events in some markets. Crestor is the only 
statin with an atherosclerosis indication  
in the US not limited by disease severity  
or restricted to patients with coronary heart 
disease. A competitor to Crestor , atorvastatin 
(Lipitor), was available in generic form in the 
US from late 2011 and, since May 2012, 
several generic atorvastatin products have 
become available.
Fewer than half the people thought to  
have high levels of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL -C) (so-called ‘bad 
cholesterol’) are diagnosed and treated.  
Of treated patients, only about half reach 
their doctors’ recommended cholesterol 
targets using existing treatments. Study 
data have shown that the usual 10mg 
starting dose of Crestor is more effective  
at lowering LDL -C and produces greater 
achievement of LDL -C goals than 
commonly prescribed doses of other 
statins. Crestor also produces an increase 
in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C) (so-called ‘good cholesterol’) 
across the dose range and has again been 
shown to reduce atherosclerotic plaque.
Crestor continues to face increasing 
challenges from generic products. For 
instance, competition resulting from the 
expiration of the Crestor patent in Canada 
had a significant negative impact on our 
2013 financial results. Patents protecting 
Crestor have been subject to a number of 
challenges in different jurisdictions. Details 
of these matters are included in Note 25 to 
the Financial Statements, from page 176.
While also subject to competition from 
generics, Atacand continues to be an 
important treatment option for patients  
with hypertension and symptomatic heart 
failure. It is approved for the treatment of 
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
53 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 hypertension in more than 125 countries 
and for symptomatic heart failure in  
more than 70 countries. Atacand Plus 
(candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide)  
is a fixed-dose combination of Atacand  
and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, 
indicated for the treatment of hypertension 
in patients who require more than one 
anti-hypertensive therapy. Atacand Plus  
is approved in 99 countries.
Brilinta/Brilique is an oral antiplatelet 
treatment for ACS in a new chemical class 
called cyclo-pentyl-triazolo-pyrimidines, 
which are selective adenosine diphospate 
(ADP) receptor antagonists that act on  
the P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Brilinta/Brilique 
remains under regulatory review in nine 
countries. It has been approved in 100 
countries, including the US, Canada  
and Brazil under the trade name Brilinta, 
and in the EU, Iceland and Norway  
under the trade name Brilique. Additional 
marketing authorisations and regulatory 
submissions are planned for 2014. 
Epanova is a patent-protected, novel, 
ultra-pure mixture of free fatty acids  
derived from fish oils, including multiple 
long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that 
reduces triglycerides and improves other 
key lipid parameters. Epanova came  
into AstraZeneca’s portfolio through the 
acquisition in July 2013 of Omthera, a 
specialty pharmaceutical company based 
in the US, focused on the development  
and commercialisation of new therapies for 
dyslipidaemia. In September 2013, the FDA 
accepted an NDA for Epanova for review.
Clinical studies 
Brilinta/Brilique is being investigated in  
a range of clinical trials under the 
PARTHENON programme. PARTHENON  
is an AstraZeneca-funded comprehensive, 
long-term and evolving global research 
initiative designed to address unanswered 
questions in atherothrombotic disease and 
to investigate the impact of Brilinta/Brilique 
on reducing CV events and death. The 
benefit of Brilinta/Brilique on CV thrombotic 
events, including CV mortality, observed  
in patients who have had an ACS event, 
supports continued study in other areas  
of CV disease. 
The current PARTHENON programme is 
designed to include around 80,000 patients 
worldwide. Key clinical trials captured within 
the programme are described below:
 > PEGASUS-TIMI 54, a 21,000 patient 
study, continues in more than 30 
countries. The study examines the risk/
benefit profile of Brilinta/Brilique plus 
aspirin to prevent adverse CV events 
compared with aspirin alone in higher-risk 
patients who had experienced a heart 
attack at least one but not more than 
three years before the study
 > EUCLID is a global clinical trial involving 
13,500 patients with peripheral arterial 
disease (PAD), a condition affecting 
approximately 27 million people in Europe 
and North America. It began enrolling 
patients in early 2013 and is evaluating 
the efficacy of Brilinta/Brilique 
(monotherapy) compared to clopidogrel 
(monotherapy) in reducing a composite 
endpoint of CV death, myocardial 
infarction (MI) or ischaemic stroke
 > SOCRATES is a global clinical trial 
planned to enrol 9,600 patients who have 
experienced an acute ischaemic stroke 
or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Annually, 15 million people worldwide 
suffer a stroke. Ischaemic strokes and 
TIAs occur as a result of an obstruction  
of a vessel supplying blood to the brain. 
The SOCRATES study evaluates the 
efficacy of Brilinta/Brilique monotherapy 
compared to aspirin in reducing major 
vascular events
 > THEMIS is a global clinical trial involving 
17 ,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus at high risk of cardiovascular 
events. The study compares the efficacy 
of long-term treatment with ticagrelor 
versus placebo for the prevention of major 
cardiovascular events in patients without 
a history of previous MI or stroke, but with 
documented coronary atherosclerosis.
In 2013, we announced plans to 
commence the STRENGTH trial, planned  
to enrol 13,000 patients into a Phase III, 
double-blind, long-term outcomes study  
to assess statin residual risk reduction with 
Epanova in high cardiovascular risk patients 
with hypertriglyceridaemia (statin treated).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic 
progressive disease of epidemic scale, 
affecting at least 90% of people with 
diabetes worldwide. The disease continues 
to grow as a consequence of western 
lifestyles. It increasingly affects people  
at a younger age, with many patients 
requiring multiple medications to control 
their condition.
There are a number of established oral 
generic and branded treatments available, 
such as biguanides and sulfonylureas. 
However, newer classes such as DPP-4 
inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and 
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists 
are successfully entering the market by 
offering effective blood sugar control.  
The CV safety of these new classes  
has been given particular emphasis in 
recent regulatory reviews and guidance 
documents provided by the FDA and  
other regulatory authorities.
Our 2013 focus
In 2013, AstraZeneca continued its 
worldwide diabetes alliance with BMS  
to co-develop and co-commercialise  
two compounds discovered by BMS for  
the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Onglyza and Forxiga. In April 2013, 
following the completion of BMS’s 
acquisition of Amylin in August 2012, 
AstraZeneca and BMS assumed full  
global commercialisation rights of Amylin’s 
portfolio of products related to diabetes 
(and other metabolic diseases) with a 
primary focus on a franchise of GLP-1 
agonists for the treatment of Type 2 
diabetes mellitus. The products include 
Byetta, Bydureon and Symlin. The alliance 
was the first to offer products in the three 
newest and fastest growing classes  
of diabetes treatments: DPP-4, SGLT-2  
and GLP-1.
In December 2013, we announced an 
agreement to acquire the entirety of  
BMS’s 50% interest in the companies’  
joint diabetes business. This secured 
AstraZeneca the IP rights and other assets 
for the development, manufacture and 
commercialisation of these diabetes  
assets, which include Onglyza, Kombiglyze, 
Komboglyze, Forxiga/Farxiga, Xigduo, 
Byetta, Bydureon, metreleptin, and Symlin. 
The acquisition, which completed in 
February 2014, consolidated worldwide 
ownership of the diabetes business within 
AstraZeneca, allowing us to maximise our 
primary and specialty care capabilities and 
geographical reach in this area, especially  
in Emerging Markets. Approximately 3,900 
employees will transfer with the acquisition 
of this business. The transaction reinforces 
our long-term commitment to diabetes,  
a key platform for returning AstraZeneca  
to growth.
Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class 
SGLT-2 inhibitor. It was approved in the  
EU in November 2012 and in the US  
(where it is called Farxiga) in January  
2014. Forxiga/Farxiga is intended to be 
used as an adjunct to diet and exercise in 
combination with other glucose-lowering 
medicinal products, including insulin, or  
as a monotherapy. Forxiga/Farxiga is  
now approved in 40 countries with six 
others under regulatory review. Additional 
submissions are planned for 2014.
Xigduo (dapagliflozin and metformin 
hydrochloride) was approved in January 
2014 in the EU, for adults aged 18 and  
over with Type 2 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control. It is indicated in patients 
inadequately controlled on their current

Strategic Report | Therapy Area Review | Cardiovascular and Metabolic disease metformin-based treatment regimen  
or who are currently being treated with  
the combination of dapagliflozin and 
metformin as separate tablets. An NDA for 
dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride 
(extended release) fixed-dose combination 
in a once-daily tablet was submitted to the 
FDA in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Metreleptin is an investigational agent  
for the treatment of metabolic disorders 
associated with inherited or acquired 
lipodystrophy (LD), a rare disease estimated 
to affect a few thousand people around  
the world. The FDA has accepted and 
granted a priority review designation for  
the Biologics License Application (BLA)  
for metreleptin and assigned a February 
2014 review deadline. In December 2013, 
the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs 
Advisory Committee reviewed the BLA  
for it and voted 11 to one that there is 
substantial evidence that the benefits of 
metreleptin outweigh the risks for the 
treatment of paediatric and adult patients 
with generalised LD. The committee did  
not recommend metreleptin in patients  
with partial LD for the indication currently 
proposed, by a vote of two to 10. We 
remain committed to pursuing metreleptin 
for treatment in patients with metabolic 
disorders associated with partial LD. Work 
is ongoing to make metreleptin available 
outside the US.
In the pipeline 
We continue to develop the delivery 
systems for Bydureon, including a dual 
chamber pen that will reduce the number  
of steps required to mix its components.  
A supplemental new drug application 
(sNDA) was submitted to the FDA in the 
third quarter of 2013 and we are expecting 
a six-month review. We filed for approval  
of the dual chamber pen in the EU in the 
fourth quarter of 2013.
We are also developing a once-weekly 
suspension of Bydureon. Recruitment  
is complete for the exenatide weekly 
suspension Phase III programme and  
the studies are ongoing. 
In July 2013, AstraZeneca and FibroGen 
announced they had entered into a 
strategic collaboration to develop and 
commercialise roxadustat (FG-4592), a 
first-in-class oral compound in late-stage 
development for the treatment of anaemia 
associated with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
The collaboration focuses on the US,  
China and all major markets excluding 
Japan, Europe, the CIS, the Middle East 
and South Africa, which are covered by  
an existing agreement between FibroGen 
and Astellas.
In Phase II clinical studies, roxadustat  
met its primary objective of demonstrating 
anaemia correction in treatment-naïve  
CKD patients not on dialysis, as well as  
of maintenance of haemoglobin levels and 
anaemia correction in patients on dialysis. 
This efficacy was combined with an 
acceptable safety profile in clinical trials.  
An extensive roxadustat Phase III 
development programme for the US is 
planned along with initial Phase III trials  
in China, with anticipated regulatory filings 
in China in 2015 and in the US in 2017 .
Clinical studies 
With the completion of the SAVOR-TIMI 53 
(saxagliptin assessment of vascular 
outcomes recorded in patients with Type 2 
diabetes mellitus) trial in September 2013, 
Onglyza is now among the most extensively 
studied anti-diabetic medications. The trial, 
involving 16,500 adult patients with Type 2 
diabetes mellitus, with a history of 
established CV disease or multiple risk 
factors, was also designed to fulfil a 
post-marketing requirement for the FDA.
Within its clinically relevant high CV risk 
population, SAVOR met the primary safety 
objective, demonstrating no increased  
risk for the primary composite endpoint  
of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal 
ischaemic stroke, when added to a 
patient’s current standard of care (with or 
without other anti-diabetic therapies), as 
compared to placebo. Onglyza did not 
meet the primary efficacy endpoint of 
superiority to placebo for the same 
composite endpoint. Patients treated with 
Onglyza experienced improved glycaemic 
control and reduced development and 
progression of microalbuminuria over two 
years as assessed in exploratory analyses. 
The large size of SAVOR also allowed us  
to evaluate a broad range of other data of 
interest. Overall adverse events, serious 
adverse events and discontinuations  
were similar to placebo and the rates of 
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were 
low and balanced between Onglyza and 
placebo. The major secondary composite 
endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal ischaemic stroke or hospitalisation 
for heart failure, unstable angina or 
coronary revascularisation was balanced 
across the two arms. One component of 
the composite secondary endpoint, 
hospitalisation for heart failure, occurred 
more in the Onglyza group compared to 
placebo. There was no increased rate of 
hypoglycemia among patients treated with 
Onglyza compared to placebo when added 
to metformin monotherapy and higher rates 
of hypoglycemia only in the Onglyza group 
compared to the placebo group among 
patients taking sulfonylureas, agents known 
to cause hypoglycemia, at baseline. 
In April 2013, we initiated DECLARE,  
a large ongoing CV outcomes trial to 
understand the impact of Forxiga on  
CV risk/benefit. The trial is working to 
determine whether Forxiga (10mg),  
when added to a patient’s current 
anti-diabetes therapy, is effective in 
reducing cardiovascular events such  
as MI, ischaemic stroke and CV-related  
death, compared with placebo. The  
trial is a randomised, double-blind,  
placebo-controlled trial designed to  
enrol approximately 17 ,000 patients. 
Enrolment began in April 2013 with an 
anticipated completion date in 2019. 
The EXSCEL (EXenatide Study of 
Cardiovascular Event Lowering) study  
is designed to determine if there are 
favourable CV effects of exenatide 
treatment using Bydureon. The EXSCEL 
study started in 2010 and is planned to  
run until 2017 . The study has enrolled 
patients during 2013 and is designed  
for 9,500 patients.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and  
accounted for 8.2 million deaths in 2012. About 70%  
of deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.
Our strategic priorities
We aim to build on our position as one of 
the world leaders in cancer treatment with 
established brands such as Zoladex and 
Arimidex, growing brands such as Faslodex 
and Iressa, and the successful introduction 
of novel therapeutic approaches currently in 
development. Our future growth will come 
about by targeting the right treatments at 
the right patients, using both small 
molecules and biologics, and taking 
advantage of cutting-edge science and 
innovative technologies. 
Our oncology pipeline includes a range of 
novel compounds focused on several areas 
critical to the development and progression 
of cancer. In particular, we are developing 
potential new cancer drugs using a variety 
of biologics approaches directed towards 
molecular targets with a strong role in 
cancer progression. These have the 
potential to eliminate cancer cells in more 
effective ways. We are also focused on 
targeting the genetic drivers of cancer  
and the resistance mechanisms to current 
therapies, using companion diagnostics to 
identify the right patients. This strategy is 
driving the continued growth of Iressa and 
the rapid development of AZD9291, a third 
generation epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) inhibitor which could have 
the potential to address the most common 
resistance mechanism to first generation 
inhibitors, such as Iressa.
Our emphasis on triggering cancer cell 
death builds on our work in DNA damage 
response with our olaparib programme.  
To complement our DNA damage portfolio, 
we completed our in-licensing of MK-1775 
(AZD1775) from Merck in September 2013. 
AZD1775 is a WEE-1 kinase inhibitor which 
inhibits a key cell cycle checkpoint and is in 
early clinical development.
In addition, we aim to be a key player in 
developing immune-mediated cancer 
therapies (IMT-Cs), a clinically validated 
 > Arimidex (anastrozole) is an aromatase 
inhibitor used for the treatment of breast 
cancer.
 > Caprelsa (vandetanib) is a kinase inhibitor

(MTC) in patients with unresectable 
(non-operable) locally advanced or 
metastatic disease.
 > Casodex (bicalutamide) is an anti-androgen 
therapy used for the treatment of prostate 
cancer.
 > Faslodex (fulvestrant) is an injectable 
estrogen receptor antagonist used for  
the treatment of hormone receptor-

post-menopausal women whose disease 
has progressed following treatment with 
prior endocrine therapy.

cancer immunology, and Spirogen,  
a biotechnology company specialising  
in antibody-drug conjugate technology  
for use in oncology. We also entered into  
a collaboration agreement with ADC 
Therapeutics to jointly develop two of its 
antibody-drug conjugate programmes in 
pre-clinical development, and made an 
equity investment in the company.
We aim to be a leader in identifying and 
developing combination therapies to exploit 
scientific and biological synergies. With our 
expertise across both small molecule and 
biologics research and development, we 
believe we are well positioned to explore 
novel combination therapies leading to 
better outcomes for cancer patients. 
Our 2013 focus
Despite generic competition, Arimidex 
remains a leading global hormonal therapy 
for patients with early-stage breast cancer. 
This success is largely based on the 
extensive long-term efficacy and safety 
results of the ATAC study, which showed 
Arimidex to be significantly superior to 
tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer 
recurrence during and beyond the five-year 
treatment course. 
Zoladex is approved in more than 120 
countries for the treatment of prostate 
cancer, breast cancer and certain benign 
gynaecological disorders. In non-metastatic 
prostate cancer, Zoladex has been shown 
to improve overall survival, both when used 
in addition to radical prostatectomy and to 
radiotherapy. In breast cancer, Zoladex  
is widely approved for use in advanced 
breast cancer in pre-menopausal women. 
In a number of countries, Zoladex is also 
approved for the adjuvant treatment of 
early-stage pre-menopausal breast cancer 
as an alternative to and/or in addition to 
chemotherapy. Zoladex offers proven 
survival benefits for breast cancer patients 
with a favourable tolerability profile.
Casodex is used as a 50mg tablet for the 
treatment of advanced prostate cancer  
and as a 150mg tablet for the treatment  
of locally advanced prostate cancer. It is 
subject to competition from generics.
Iressa was the first EGFR-TK inhibitor  
to be approved in advanced non-small  
cell lung cancer and is approved in 89 
countries. Iressa is the leading EGFR-TK 
inhibitor for patients with EGFR M+ 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the 
European and Asian markets. Iressa is 
currently not approved in the US. EGFR 
mutations can be identified by a number  
of diagnostic tests.
Faslodex 500mg is approved in 75 
countries, including the EU member states, 
the US and Japan. It offers an additional, 
efficacious, hormonal therapy option and  
is given by once monthly injections. We are 
now exploring the efficacy and safety of 
Faslodex 500mg compared to Arimidex in 
the 1
st
 line advanced breast cancer setting 
(hormone-naïve patients) in the Phase III 
FALCON trial.
Caprelsa fights cancer through two proven 
mechanisms: by blocking the development 
of tumour blood supply by inhibiting the 
vascular endothelial growth factor pathway 
and by inhibiting the growth and survival of 
the tumour through EGFR and rearranged 
during transfection (RET) pathways. 
Caprelsa was approved by the FDA and 
granted orphan drug status in April 2011, 
and by the EU in February 2012 for the 
treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in 
patients with unresectable locally advanced 
or metastatic disease. Caprelsa is also 
approved in Canada and remains under 
review by other regulatory agencies around 
the world.
In the pipeline 
In 2013, we advanced three compounds 
into Phase III clinical trials. Olaparib, a poly 
ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor,  
is currently in Phase III trials for 1
st
 line and 
platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated 
ovarian cancer and 2
nd
 line gastric cancer. 
Additionally, in September 2013, the EMA 
accepted a MAA for olaparib (capsules)  
for the maintenance treatment of patients 
with BRCA mutated platinum-sensitive 
relapsed serous ovarian cancer. Selumetinib, 
a potent mitogen-activated protein  
kinase (MEK) inhibitor licensed from  
Array BioPharma Inc., is being studied in  
a Phase III trial in KRAS mutation-positive 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Moxetumomab pasudotox, a CD22 
immunoconjugate, is being studied in a 
Phase III trial in unresponsive or relapsed 
hairy cell leukaemia.
Our oncology research pipeline targets 
both solid tumour and hematologic 
cancers. Across our small molecule  
and biologics portfolio, we have three 
investigational compounds in Phase III 
clinical trials, six in Phase II clinical trials, 
and 15 projects in Phase I clinical trials. 
Additional drug candidates are expected  
to progress into clinical trials in 2014.

and Autoimmunity
Some 235 million people suffer from asthma  
with most asthma-related deaths in low- and  
lower-middle income countries.
Our strategic priorities
We aim to build on our strong position in 
the respiratory area by delivering innovative 
inhaled and targeted therapies that address 
the evolving unmet medical needs of 
patients with asthma, COPD, and idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
In the inflammation and autoimmunity 
therapy areas we intend to help improve 
the lives of patients by developing a 
rheumatology franchise, establishing a 
foothold through our late-stage programme 
in gout, and employing a more opportunity-
driven approach to dermatology.
In addition to novel targeted therapies, 
our respiratory strategy involves developing 
unique inhaled therapies. 
We are also looking at ways to transform 
how respiratory diseases are managed. 
We believe a better understanding of 
biology, patient phenotypes and new drug 
combinations will help improve clinical 
outcomes for patients.
Asthma and COPD 
Asthma is a major cause of chronic 
morbidity and mortality. There is evidence 
that it has become much more common 
over the past 20 years. The number  
of patients whose asthma is not well 
controlled by current, approved treatments 
remains a particular unmet medical need.
Currently, fixed-dose combinations of 
an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a 
long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA) (for 
example, Symbicort) help treat moderate 
to severe asthma. However, our R&D efforts 
focus on targeted therapies to treat more 
severe, refractory patients who experience 
severe or frequent exacerbations and a 
reduced quality of life. Additionally, the 
population of asthma patients is highly 
heterogeneous and we are working to 
better understand patient subtypes and to 
tailor therapies to the different phenotypes.

Strategic Report | Therapy Area Review COPD is a serious lung disease that 
includes chronic bronchitis and/or 
emphysema. Medication only has a small 
impact on the course of the disease and 
the prognosis for patients remains poor.
The goal of COPD treatment is to  
slow disease progression and control 
symptoms. Deterioration of lung function 
over time usually requires more aggressive 
treatment, including introducing additional 
inhaled treatments in an attempt to  
manage symptoms better. A new class of 
fixed-dose combinations of a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a  
LABA are being developed for COPD  
and are likely to be positioned as 1
st
 line 
therapy for symptomatic mild to moderate 
COPD patients who need effective 
bronchodilatation and are at lower risk of 
exacerbations. With the acquisition of Pearl 
Therapeutics in June 2013, AstraZeneca 
added a LAMA/LABA combination to its 
pipeline. ICS/LABA combinations, including 
Symbicort, are best suited for COPD 
patients with exacerbations according to 
recently updated guidelines from the Global 
Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
Disease (GOLD). The GOLD guidelines 
encourage triple therapy of LAMA/LABA/
ICS when symptoms persist despite 
treatment with an ICS/LABA. Formulation 
and device technology acquired from Pearl 
Therapeutics will also allow us to develop a 
triple fixed-dose combination in one device 
which we plan to accelerate into Phase II 
clinical development in 2014.
Our 2013 focus 
The range of Symbicort products  
improves symptoms and provides a 
clinically important improvement in the 
health of many patients with asthma or 
COPD by providing effective and rapid 
control of the symptoms, with a long-term 
maintenance effect.
Pulmicort is one of the world’s leading 
ICS products for treating asthma and is 
available in several forms, such as respules. 
Teva has had an exclusive licence to sell a 
generic version of Pulmicort Respules in the 
US since 2009. Pulmicort continues to face 
increasing challenge from generic products. 
More information about litigation relating to 
Pulmicort can be found in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 176.
In the pipeline 
As outlined above, the acquisition of Pearl 
Therapeutics has added a LAMA/LABA 
combination to our Phase III pipeline and  
a faster route to developing a triple therapy. 
PT003 is being developed as a twice-daily 
fixed-dose combination of components  
that are already approved and marketed  
in various formulations in many parts of  
the world – the LAMA glycopyrronium  
and LABA formoterol (a component of 
Symbicort). It is the only LAMA/LABA being 
developed in a pressurised metered-dose 
inhaler (pMDI), the most widely used 
inhalation delivery format. Phase III trials 
began in May 2013. PT010 is a triple 
combination of LAMA/LABA/ICS given 
twice-daily from a pMDI device being 
developed for severe COPD. It is currently 
in Phase I and has the potential to be 
among the first products to deliver the three 
separate therapeutic entities via one inhaler.
Benralizumab is a MAb directed at the 
interleukin-5 receptor (IL -5R) and depletes 
eosinophils in the lung, immune cells that 
have been shown to play an important  
role in asthma. We have accelerated the 
initiation of the Phase III asthma programme 
and in October 2013 we initiated CALIMA, 
the first of five studies in the Phase III  
clinical development programme for 
benralizumab. The CALIMA study aims  
to determine whether benralizumab 
reduces the number of exacerbations in 
patients with severe asthma and elevated 
eosinophils who remain inadequately 
controlled despite treatment with inhaled 
and/or oral corticosteroids. 
Other therapies in development for severe 
asthma include the biologic tralokinumab 
and the small molecule AZD5069. 
Tralokinumab is a human antibody targeting 
IL -13, a key cytokine involved in many 
aspects of asthma. Tralokinumab has 
completed Phase II studies in inadequately 
controlled asthma, and is also currently in 
Phase II development for the treatment of 
mild to moderate IPF. AZD5069 is a CXCR2 
antagonist in Phase II development for 
asthma. CXCR2 inhibition prevents the 
recruitment and activation of neutrophils,  
a cell type thought to play a central role in 
asthma and COPD. 
Inflammation and 
Autoimmunity
Gout is the most common form of 
inflammatory arthritis. It occurs when  
high levels of uric acid in the blood, known 
as hyperuricaemia, lead to deposition of 
needle-like crystals in joints and soft tissues 
throughout the body, causing inflammation. 
Hyperuricaemia results when the kidneys  
do not efficiently remove enough uric acid, 
or when the body produces too much. In 
2013, there were an estimated 15.3 million 
diagnosed cases of gout in major markets, 
which include the US, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Japan. 
This is forecast to increase to 17 .7 million  
in 2021. 
Psoriasis is a chronic disease in which the 
immune system causes the skin cells to 
grow at an accelerated rate. Instead of 
being shed, the skin cells pile up, causing 
painful and itchy, red, scaly patches that 
can bleed. Up to 12 million patients are 
diagnosed with psoriasis across the US 
and Europe each year. Despite various 
treatment options for moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis, many patients do not 
meet their therapeutic goals, including the 
resolution of underlying inflammation, 
clearing of symptoms and improvement  
64 million
An estimated 64 million people suffer 
from COPD, with more than 3 million 
people dying each year. Almost 90% 
of COPD deaths occur in low- and

59 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 in quality of life. Biologics are currently used 
in moderate to severe cases where patients 
are candidates for, or are unresponsive to, 
phototherapy or systemic therapy. 
Current treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) focuses on 
suppressing symptoms and controlling 
disease flares and, in the case of lupus 
nephritis, preventing renal failure. Although 
a biologic medicine has recently been 
launched for SLE, most therapies used  
are off-label and there remains significant 
unmet medical need. Most emerging 
biologic agents are likely to be used initially 
after failure of standard therapies (including 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) 
or in combination to provide incremental 
benefit, prevent flares and allow reduction 
of high-dose chronic steroid use.
Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with 
generic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
agents and, where the relevant criteria are 
met, biologic disease modifiers. Novel 
effective treatments are needed as only 
about a third of patients treated with 
biologics achieve their treatment goals.  
We anticipate that the rheumatoid arthritis 
market will experience modest annual 
growth over the next decade. Sales of  
the biologic tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
alpha-blockers accounted for 72% of  
major market rheumatoid arthritis sales in 
2012. Use of other biologic approaches is 
expected to increase due to new entrants, 
new subcutaneous formulations and use 
earlier in the treatment pathway. Novel  
oral drugs targeting intra-cellular signalling 
pathways may provide anti-TNF-like levels 
of efficacy and potentially more convenient 
dosing, especially in patients who are not 
taking, or are ineligible to take, injectable 
biologic agents.
In the pipeline 
In 2012, AstraZeneca acquired Ardea,  
a San Diego-based company. Ardea is 
developing lesinurad, a selective uric acid 
re-absorption inhibitor (SURI) that inhibits 
the URAT1 transporter, normalising uric 
acid excretion and reducing serum uric  
acid (sUA). 
In December 2013, we announced top-line 
results from LIGHT, a Phase III study 
investigating the potential of lesinurad as a 
monotherapy in the small population of 
gout patients who are intolerant to, or 
cannot take, one or both xanthine oxidase 
inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat. In the 
trial, lesinurad, used as a monotherapy, met 
the primary endpoint. However, patients in 
the study were more likely to experience 
serum creatinine elevations and renal 
adverse events, including serious events, 
compared to patients on placebo.
The main Phase III trials in the lesinurad 
programme are investigating lesinurad in 
combination with allopurinol in patients not 
reaching target sUA levels on allopurinol 
alone (CLEAR1 and CLEAR2), and as a 
combination therapy with febuxostat in 
patients with tophaceous gout (CRYSTAL). 
We believe that combination therapy, 
addressing both production (xanthine 
oxidase inhibitors) and excretion (lesinurad) 
of uric acid may be an effective way to  
treat gout patients who have not achieved 
target sUA levels on xanthine oxidase 
inhibitors alone. The results of the lesinurad 
combination therapy studies are expected 
in mid-2014, and regulatory submissions in 
the US and EU are expected in the second 
half of 2014.
In August 2013, we decided to progress 
RDEA3170 as our lead gout molecule  
in Asia, including Japan and China. 
RDEA3170 is a next generation SURI and 
we have begun a programme of work to 
support submission in Japan and other 
Asian markets. In pre-clinical and Phase I 
clinical studies, RDEA3170 showed many  
of the same attributes as lesinurad but with 
significantly greater potency against the 
URAT1 transporter. It is being investigated 
as a potentially differentiated molecule that 
could be used earlier in the treatment of 
gout and in asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. 
Phase I studies in Japan are complete and 
a Phase II study will begin in early 2014.  
In addition, a global Phase II monotherapy 
programme for RDEA3170 began in August 
2013 and has completed recruitment ahead 
of schedule.
In October 2013, together with Amgen,  
we announced the initiation of the Phase III 
programme for brodalumab in moderate  
to severe psoriasis. The programme 
includes three Phase III studies evaluating 
treatment with brodalumab compared with 
ustekinumab and/or placebo. Brodalumab 
is a human MAb targeting the interleukin-17 
(IL -17) receptor, to treat moderate to severe 
psoriasis. The Phase II data showed that 
the primary and secondary end points  
were met, including many patients 
achieving and maintaining total skin 
clearance with continued brodalumab 
therapy. Brodalumab is also being 
investigated in Phase II studies for psoriatic 
arthritis and asthma. Brodalumab (AMG 827) 
is one of five MAbs from Amgen’s clinical 
inflammation portfolio which the two 
companies have agreed to develop and 
commercialise jointly. The other four 
compounds are AMG 139, AMG 157 ,  
AMG 181 and AMG 557 .
In 2013, we continued to invest in several 
novel multi-functional MAbs in inflammatory 
and autoimmune conditions. Sifalimumab, 
which targets interferon-alpha, continued 
clinical development with a Phase IIb study 
in patients with SLE. MEDI-546, which 
targets the interferon-alpha receptor, 
continued in a Phase IIb study in patients 
with SLE. Mavrilimumab, which targets  
the alpha sub-unit of the granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
receptor (GM-CSFR), continues in Phase IIb 
for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
has completed enrolment.
The results of the Phase III OSKIRA 
programme for fostamatinib, an oral spleen 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development as 
a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, did not 
measure up to the promising results seen 
earlier in development. Therefore, in June 
2013, AstraZeneca decided not to proceed 
with regulatory filings for fostamatinib and 
returned the rights to the compound to 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals.
 
60 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Therapy Area Review | Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity Infection, Neuroscience  
and Gastrointestinal 
AstraZeneca has a long history in the fields of Infection, Neuroscience and Gastrointestinal (ING) diseases 
which represent a high area of unmet medical need for patients around the world. Previously managed as 
three separate therapy areas, in March 2013 we combined them into one area and are investing in them 
opportunistically. We are developing or commercialising innovative therapies and are also seeking to 
optimise the potential of our existing medicines. We seek to maximise the access all patients have to our 
therapies, using innovative approaches in Emerging and Established Markets.
By making effective use of our structural 
and genomic-based discovery technologies 
and antibody platforms, vaccines and 
continued small molecule and biologics 
research, we plan to deliver novel approaches 
in areas of unmet medical need.
Influenza virus
Influenza is the most common vaccine-
preventable disease in the developed 
world. According to WHO, seasonal 
influenza results in three to five million  
cases of severe illness and up to half a 
million deaths each year, primarily among 
the elderly. Rates of infection are, however, 
highest among children, and school-age 
children are the main transmitters of the 
flu virus. Vaccinating children can lower the 
burden of influenza, both through direct 
immune protection and through blocking 
transmission or ‘herd immunity’. The LAIV 
(live attenuated influenza vaccine) which 
we developed is recognised as the most 
effective paediatric influenza vaccine, with 
studies showing a 50% superior efficacy 
over TIV (trivalent influenza vaccine) which 
is the standard of care. Recently published 
health economy models also show that 
vaccinating children with LAIV could  
be the most cost-effective influenza  
policy strategy. 
The latest development in our influenza 
vaccines is the quadrivalent vaccine, 
containing one additional B-virus strain  
for broader protection. The WHO rationale 
for adding another B-virus strain into the 
vaccine is to reduce the risk of mismatch 
between the circulating virus strains and 
the annual vaccine, which in turn could 
offer better overall protection. The 
intra-nasal FluMist Quadrivalent, LAIV, was 
the first quadrivalent vaccine to be 
approved globally by the FDA in February 
Our strategic priorities
Infectious diseases are the second leading 
cause of death worldwide after heart 
disease. We have one of the industry’s 
largest anti-bacterial pipelines, and a 
leading position in the area of respiratory 
viruses. Based on this strong foundation, 
we aim to bring innovative life-changing 
treatments to market and help patients 
avoid the consequences of infections.  
2012. In 2013, FluMist Quadrivalent was 
supplied to the US and Israel markets and 
successfully replaced the trivalent FluMist.
In December 2013, the EC granted 
marketing authorisation for Fluenz Tetra 
(equivalent to FluMist Quadrivalent), for the 
prevention of seasonal influenza in eligible 
children and adolescents aged from two 
to 18 years. Fluenz Tetra is the first and 
only intra-nasal, four-strain influenza 
vaccine available in Europe. Fluenz Tetra 
will replace Fluenz from the 2014-2015 flu 
season onwards. 
Paediatric influenza prevention and LAIV 
superiority over TIV was recognised in  
two major EU public programmes during 
2013. In August 2013, the German 
Standing Committee on Vaccinations 
(STIKO) recommended the use of LAIV  
in children aged two to six years with 
underlying medical conditions as the 
preferred influenza vaccine. Fluenz is the 
only available LAIV against seasonal 
influenza in Germany and this is the first 
time that a single vaccine has received 
preferential recommendation by STIKO.  
In September 2013, immunisation with 
Fluenz was rolled out in the UK following  
a 2012 decision by the Joint Committee  
of Vaccination and Immunisation. The 
roll-out is the first step in implementing the 
new nationwide paediatric flu vaccination 
programme which is expected to ultimately 
include all children from two to 16 years. 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
Approximately half of all infants worldwide 
are infected with RSV during the first year  
of life and nearly all children in the US 
have been infected by the time they reach 
their second birthday. RSV is the leading 
cause of hospitalisations and admissions 
to paediatric intensive care units in the first 
year of life.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
61 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Synagis is used for the prevention of 
serious lower respiratory tract disease 
caused by RSV in children at high risk of  
the disease. With approval in 83 countries, 
we continue to work with our worldwide 
partner AbbVie to protect vulnerable infants 
from RSV. Synagis is currently the only MAb 
approved for the immunoprophylaxis of 
RSV and is the global standard of care for 
RSV prevention. 
We are developing a live, intra-nasal vaccine 
for the prevention of lower respiratory tract 
illness caused by RSV in otherwise healthy 
infants. The lead vaccine candidate in 
clinical development is in Phase I.
Serious bacterial infections 
Antibiotic or antimicrobial resistance (AMR), 
has been recognised as one of the greatest 
threats to human health by world leaders 
and has recently taken a high position  
on the global health agenda. As a result, 
world demand for antibiotics and novel 
therapeutic approaches remains high  
and will continue to grow. Many bacterial 
infections currently have few satisfactory 
treatment options, prompting demand for 
new and better therapies. 
Zinforo, developed in collaboration with  
our partner Forest, is one of the latest 
antibiotics authorised in Europe. Zinforo  
is the first antibiotic to be approved by the 
FDA since the introduction of the Infectious 
Diseases Society of America’s ‘10 x 20’ 
initiative and is one of only a handful of new 
antibiotics to have been approved by the 
EMA and FDA in the last five years. Zinforo 
is indicated for use as a monotherapy in the 
treatment of hospitalised adult patients with 
complicated skin and soft tissue infections 
(cSSTI) or community-acquired pneumonia. 
It is the only cephalosporin with methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
efficacy that is approved for the treatment 
of cSSTI.
Merrem/Meronem remains the leading 
carbapenem anti-bacterial and is approved 
in most countries outside Japan, although  
it is subject to competition from generics  
in most major markets. It has a growing 
share of the intravenous antibiotic market 
because of its activity against multiple drug 
resistant bacteria.
Our antibacterials portfolio is targeting the 
most serious indications and pathogens. We 
continue to work with Forest on joint global 
development programmes exploiting the full 
potential of avibactam, including CAZ AVI (a 
combination of ceftazidime and avibactam), 
CXL (a combination of ceftaroline and 
avibactam) and ATM AVI (a combination of 
aztreonam and avibactam). We are also 
developing therapies independent of our 
collaboration with Forest. 
Our strategic priorities
In the neuroscience area, we have a  
long history in anaesthesia and analgesia, 
plus a sizeable business in psychiatry 
rooted in Seroquel IR and Seroquel XR.  
We are now focused on developing new 
drug candidates, primarily in Alzheimer’s 
and Parkinson’s diseases and pain control,  
that have the potential to offer therapeutic 
advantages.
While rapid progress is being made in 
understanding diseases of the brain, some 
of these debilitating illnesses have few 
effective treatments and, for others, there 
continues to be major unmet medical need. 
In response to this challenge, AstraZeneca 
created a Neuroscience IMED in 2012, a 
team of approximately 40 scientists based 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US and 
Cambridge, UK, two locations strongly 
associated with neuroscience research. 
The Neuroscience IMED conducts 
discovery and development externally 
through a network of partners in academia 
and industry. It is designed to merge 
scientific advances within the biotechnology 
and academic worlds and to develop their 
potential through the scientific, commercial 
and geographical reach of AstraZeneca.
Neurology 
Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the 
largest areas of unmet medical need. 
Product development in this therapy area  
is particularly difficult due, in part, to the 
challenges of establishing efficacy in clinical 
studies. Current treatments, most of which 
face patent expiry by 2015, target the 
symptoms, not the underlying cause,  
of the disease. Slowing the course of 
disease progression, through biologics 
and/or small molecule treatments, is the 
hope for Alzheimer’s disease patients and 
for people with other neurodegenerative 
disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease.
We have initiated multiple collaborations  
to help advance disease understanding 
and identify potential new drug targets.  
In Alzheimer’s disease, we are working  
with the Karolinska Institutet (Sweden),  
the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute (US), the 
National Institute of Radiological Sciences 
(Japan), Vanderbilt University (US), and  
an alliance of several academic centres 
(known as ‘A5’). A new, three-year 
collaboration with Tufts University (US) 
targets a range of diseases and disorders 
of the brain, including Alzheimer’s disease, 
Parkinson’s disease and autism spectrum 
disorders. Our collaboration with Vanderbilt 
University focuses on psychosis and other 
neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with 
major brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
disease and schizophrenia. 
AZD3241 is in Phase II of development  
and is a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor  
in development to delay progression of 
disability in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease or multiple system atrophy.

Psychiatry 
More than 450 million people worldwide  
are affected by mental, neurological or 
behavioural health problems, and more 
than 350 million people suffer from 
depression. Yet psychiatric illnesses remain 
under-diagnosed and under-treated 
conditions, with a substantial social and 
economic burden. 
Both Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate), 
launched in 1997 , and Seroquel XR 
(quetiapine fumarate extended release), 
launched in 2007 , have been important 
treatment choices for millions of patients 
worldwide. Seroquel XR remains a key 
product. In most markets, the substance 
patent protecting the active ingredient, 
quetiapine, expired in March 2012. 
However, in the majority of European 
markets, the formulation patent covering 
Seroquel XR does not expire until 2017 . 
While we remain confident in our IP and  
are committed to vigorously defending the 
patent protecting Seroquel XR, it has been 
subject to a number of challenges and 
revocations. Details of litigation relating to 
Seroquel XR are included in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 176. 
Analgesia and anaesthesia
Our established anaesthesia portfolio 
consists of a broad range of compounds, 
including an intravenous general 
anaesthetic/sedative and local anaesthetics 
available in various formulations, such as 
injectables, creams, gels, sprays and 
suppositories. Although these compounds 
were developed between 20 and 65 years 
ago and most no longer benefit from  
patent protection, they remain important 
medicines that meet a broad range of 
patient needs and continue to deliver 
significant value. 
Opioids are the current standard of care  
for managing moderate to severe pain in 
many countries. In the five countries that 
represent approximately 80% of global 
opioid use (US, UK, France, Germany and 
Canada), 45 million patients take them to 
manage chronic pain. Biologics are an 
emerging treatment option for pain control 
and we have an active interest in this area. 
We are exploring treatments in focused 
pain areas where patients can be selected 
on the basis of symptomatic characteristics. 
Vimovo, 375/20-500/20mg, co-developed 
by AstraZeneca and Pozen, is a fixed-dose 
combination of enteric-coated naproxen  
(an NSAID), and immediate-release 
esomeprazole, a stomach acid-reducing 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI). During  
2013, we reviewed the investment to 
commercialise Vimovo around the world 
given the significant market access and 
reimbursement challenges that affected the 
product’s overall performance. We decided 
to continue to market Vimovo in those 
markets where we believe it would be most 
responsive to commercial efforts, such  
as Canada, and a number of countries  
in Emerging Markets. We ceased sales 
promotion of Vimovo in the US and all 
promotion in the majority of Europe  
(except Spain and Portugal) from the 
second quarter of 2013. However, we 
continue to make the product available  
to patients in the EU. In November 2013,  
we announced an agreement for Horizon 
Pharma to acquire all US rights of Vimovo. 
We retained the right to commercialise 
Vimovo in the rest of the world. 
Naloxegol (formerly NKTR-118), licensed 
from Nektar Therapeutics, is an 
investigational peripherally-acting mu-opioid 
receptor antagonist (PAMORA), which has 
been studied in opioid-induced constipation 
(OIC) in adult patients with chronic 
non-cancer pain, the most common side 
effect caused by chronic administration  
of prescription opioid pain medicines.  
Over 69 million people worldwide take 
opioids to help deal with chronic pain. OIC 
can affect up to 90% of these patients with 
only 40-50% achieving desired treatment 
outcomes with current options such as 
OTC and prescription laxatives. If approved, 
naloxegol will be an important new 
treatment option for patients struggling  
with OIC and has the potential to be the  
first once-daily oral PAMORA medication  
to treat the condition. Following top-line 
results from two Phase III trials and one 
safety extension trial in patients with 
non-cancer related pain and OIC, an NDA 
and an MAA for naloxegol have been 
accepted by the FDA and EMA respectively. 
Additional analyses and regulatory 
consultations are ongoing.

Our strategic priorities
Nexium is marketed in more than 125 
countries and is available in oral (tablet, 
capsule and sachet for oral suspension) 
and intravenous dosage forms, for the 
treatment of acid-related diseases. Nexium 
is also approved for use in children from the 
age of one month in the US and from one 
year in Europe and other markets. Nexium 
capsules were launched in Japan in 
September 2011 after a national 
development programme. 
We aim to maximise the benefits for 
patients of our current gastrointestinal 
portfolio by focusing investment on  
Nexium in Japan and Emerging Markets, 
including China. 
Nexium is generally subject to competition 
from generics in Europe and we expect  
the first generic entry in the US in 2014. 
Patents protecting Nexium have been 
subject to a number of challenges in different 
jurisdictions and details of these matters  
are included in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 176. This includes 
consideration of Hanmi’s US launch of its 
505(b)(2) NDA esomeprazole strontium 
product. AstraZeneca understands that  
this product is not AB-rated and is not 
automatically a substitute for Nexium.
In 2012, Pfizer acquired the exclusive  
global rights to market Nexium for OTC 
indications worldwide. The NDA submission 
for Nexium OTC in the US was completed 
in mid 2013. In August 2013, the EC 
approved Nexium Control (the marketed

Personalised asthma treatments 
Real lives
The large number of patients whose 
respiratory disease is inadequately 
controlled by current treatments 
means there is a significant unmet 
medical need for improved treatments. 
One patient, aged 50 and prescribed 
Accolate, said: “Having asthma is so 
frightening. It affects everything that 
you do. I limit my life to a certain extent. 
Asthma is so unpredictable.”
Life-changing medicines
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are respiratory diseases caused 
by chronic inflammation that affect millions of lives. 
In the G7 markets alone, there are more than 100 million patients with asthma or COPD. 
Worldwide, total deaths from COPD are projected to increase by more than 30% in the next  
10 years without further interventions to cut risks to health*.
In recent years, we have introduced medicines such as Symbicort and Pulmicort for the 
treatment of respiratory diseases. By developing innovative inhaled and targeted therapies,  
as well as new devices to meet the needs of patients, we continue to advance respiratory 
medicine and provide relief, support and improved health in the easiest way possible.

Pioneering science
Diseases such as asthma and COPD  
are increasingly being recognised as  
a heterogeneous group of conditions. 
They have closely related clinical features 
but diverse underlying causes. Pioneering 
science is allowing us to break them down 
into meaningful sub-groups to enable  
a more targeted approach to treatment. 
We are using personalised healthcare 
(PHC) strategies early in the drug 
development process to target distinct 
asthma molecular phenotypes to optimise 
treatments. One example of this is 
benralizumab, where we are targeting 
patients in our Phase III programme with  
a distinct severe asthma phenotype. 
Benralizumab is the first in a series of  
novel PHC-driven biologic therapies  
in our portfolio that may represent  
a critical advance in the development  
of personalised asthma management.
We are also developing a number of small 
molecule projects in the respiratory therapy 
area. For example, AZD5069, which is in 
Phase II trials, aims to help uncontrolled 
persistent asthma patients by targeting 
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.

goals and ambition to Be a Great Place  
to Work, is built around a number of key 
areas. These include:
 > acquiring and retaining key capabilities 
and talent
 > developing leadership
 > evolving our culture
 > implementing a new set of values and 
behaviours. 
Another aim is to improve the strength  
and diversity of the talent pipeline and,  
by driving belief in our strategic priorities,  
to help build employee engagement. 
AstraZeneca’s leaders also direct 
considerable attention to managing change 
in our global team (see the Managing 
change section on page 69). We use a 
range of metrics to track our progress 
against these priorities, many of which  
are reported regularly to the SET. 
Acquiring and retaining key  
capabilities and talent
During 2013, we hired about 7 ,800 
permanent employees to support our 
growth platforms (including building our 
business in Emerging Markets), to continue 
to build the new capabilities required to 
implement our strategy successfully, and  
to replace leavers. We have successfully 
attracted talent to supplement critical 
capabilities across the business and to 
refresh our leadership pipeline in key areas.
We focus considerable attention on 
emerging talent recruitment to secure  
and develop the long-term potential for  
the business. For example, we run a global 
programme to hire recent graduates for  
our procurement, quality, engineering, IT 
and supply chain functions. In 2013, we 
launched a new graduate programme for 
IMED to complement our established  
IMED Post Doc Programme that recruits 
post-doctoral researchers. We invest  
in internships and thesis work opportunities 
globally, as well as leading a scheme in 
China and Japan for MBA students.
The composition of our global workforce 
continues to change, to reflect our focus  
on Emerging Markets, as shown in our 
Sales and Marketing workforce composition 
figure opposite. For example, in 2013, 
3,200 new recruits joined us in China.  
We deploy a range of innovative approaches 
to help achieve our plans in Emerging 
Markets and to ensure we have an 
attractive employer brand and strong  
global reputation. In 2013, AstraZeneca 
was featured for the first time in LinkedIn’s 
InDemand Employer list of the most sought-
after employers in the world. 
The level of voluntary employee turnover 
increased to 8.1% in 2013, from 7 .3% in 
2012. In a year of significant organisational 
change at senior level, we also experienced 
higher than normal turnover among our 
high performers. More broadly, our voluntary 
employee turnover rate among our high 
performers in 2013 also increased. We 
continued to invest significant management 
time in minimising the business risks of 
employee turnover, particularly in volatile 
markets. This included regular SET reviews 
of resignation rates in total, by SET area,  
by key markets and for significant sites. In 
addition, we took steps to retain key people 
and talent such as establishing regular risk 
assessments and retention plans.
Acquisition of BMS’s diabetes interests
In December 2013, AstraZeneca 
announced an agreement to purchase 
BMS’s 50% interest in AstraZeneca’s  
and BMS’s joint diabetes business. This 
acquisition completed in February 2014. 
Under the agreement, approximately 3,900 
BMS and Amylin employees will transfer  
to AstraZeneca. These employees are not 
included in the analysis described in this 
section or elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Developing leadership 
We encourage and support our people  
in achieving their full potential by providing  
a range of learning and development (L&D) 
programmes. These aim to build the 
capabilities and encourage the behaviours 
needed to deliver our business strategy.
We have a global approach, supported  
by our global talent and development 
organisation, to ensure high standards  
of L&D practice across AstraZeneca. We 
continue to develop and deploy instructor-
led and online development resources, 
which we aim to make available to all 
employees to increase access to learning 
and support self-development.
We recognise that good leadership plays  
a critical role in stimulating high levels of 
performance and engagement. In 2013,  
we initiated a Group-wide Leadership 
Development Strategy to strengthen our 
leadership and make it a differentiating 
factor in our success. Our ultimate vision  
is to offer all employees an appropriate, 
globally consistent leadership development 
experience that helps inspire an enterprise-
wide perspective. In 2013, we launched a 
customised programme for our Top 150 
leaders with Harvard Business School.  
This will be followed by a programme for 
the next 600 leaders with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT). Both 
programmes help leaders to consider the 
environment they create, how open and 
inclusive it can be, and how this can lead  
to opportunities for innovation. 
Changing our culture
Our leadership development frameworks 
focus on the behaviours we believe are 
essential for strong and effective leadership. 
Such behaviours were defined in line with 
the work completed in 2013, to identify  
the AstraZeneca values, as outlined in the 
Pioneering science, life-changing medicines 
section on page 12.
Each value has a corresponding set  
of required behaviours which describe  
what is required at the individual level  
to demonstrate the values. These 
behaviours apply to all employees  
and are complemented with manager 
accountabilities, which define what we 
expect from managers. 
Maximising our talent
The development of an internal pipeline  
of future global leaders is as high a priority 
as the judicious hiring of new leaders.  
We identify individuals with the potential  
for senior and complex roles, to provide 
succession candidates for leadership roles 
across AstraZeneca. We regard these 
individuals as key and proactively support 
them in reaching their potential through,  
for example, global talent development 
programmes and targeted development 
opportunities. The changes to the SET, 
announced in January 2013, included  
the promotion of six internal candidates, 
demonstrating our commitment to 
developing senior leaders.
We remain committed to making full  
use of the talents and resource of all our  
people. We have policies in place to avoid 
discrimination, including on the grounds  
of disability. Our policies cover recruitment 
and selection, performance management, 
career development and promotion, 
transfer, training (including re-training, if 
needed, for people who have become 
disabled) and reward.
Improving the strength and diversity  
of the talent pipeline
†
 
Our workforce has a diverse range of 
perspectives, talents and ideas. For a 
business founded on innovation, this is  
a source of great strength. Understanding 
the different needs and perspectives of  
our stakeholders is central to how we do 
business and to how we create medicines 
which make a difference to patients’ lives. 
We strive to reflect the diversity of the 
communities we serve in our workforce  
and leadership team. As we continue to 
reshape our organisation and geographic 
footprint, we aim to ensure diversity and 
inclusion are integrated in a meaningful way 
into our business and people strategies. 
Our objective is to accelerate diversity  
and inclusion in its broadest sense 
appropriately throughout the business,  
to build accountability, and track progress. 
As shown in the gender diversity figure 
overleaf, women make up 50.4% of  
our global workforce. There are currently 
three women on our Board (25%) and, 
below Board level, women account for  
40% of managers at Global Career Level F 
and above. 
Our 2015 target is to improve female 
representation:
 > at Global Career Level F and  
above (the highest six bands of our 
employee population) from 38% (2010)  
to 43% (2015)
 > in the global talent pool from 33% (2010) 
to 38% (2015). 
We also track the countries of origin of  
our senior leaders, and within our global 
talent pool, to measure progress over the 
medium term. 
Our progress against these metrics is 
primarily overseen by the Responsible 
Business Council (made up of senior 
leaders from across AstraZeneca)  
and through business area people 
strategies and business strategies.  
See the Responsible Business section  
from page 220 for more information.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
67 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 We continue to make progress against  
our diversity and inclusion strategy, as 
demonstrated, for example, by the Global 
Insight Exchange programme. This aims  
to accelerate the development of our 
leadership culture and talent pipeline 
through sharing diversity of thought and 
experience. The programme, which is now 
in its second year, launched a second 
cohort in 2013, consisting of 60 coaching 
pairs of individuals from different leadership 
levels, functional areas and geographies. 
Our progress has been recognised 
externally. In 2013, we received Opportunity 
Now’s ‘Global Excellence in Practice 
Award’ for work in Asia to attract and  
retain local and global talent with emphasis 
on gender and local geography diversity.  
In 2013, we were also included in The 
Times’ ‘Top 50 Employers for Women  
in the UK’ list for the first time and, in the 
US, (based on data submitted in 2011-2012) 
we were included in the top 10 of the 
National Association for Female Executives’ 
list of top 50 companies for female 
executives in 2013.
Employee engagement 
We use a variety of global leadership 
communication channels to engage 
employees in our business strategy.  
These include face-to-face meetings, video 
conferencing, Yammer (a social media tool) 
and regular global and business-specific 
communication campaigns (eg a week 
dedicated to communicating to employees 
about our scientific leadership ambitions 
and projects) to encourage two-way 
dialogue to take place. In 2013, we ran an 
online collaborative event, called ‘culture 
jam’ to discuss and explore our culture and 
values. The culture jam, with over 30,000 
registrations for the event, was designed  
to be a fully inclusive way of providing 
employees the opportunity to engage 
directly with senior leaders as well as hold 
virtual discussions with colleagues globally. 
Locally facilitated offline sessions were  
run in parallel so that employees could 
participate in local languages as 
appropriate, and without the need for 
computers. The culture jam generated 
some 25,000 employee questions, stories 
and comments that will be used to further 
support and accelerate culture change 
within the organisation.  
We did not hold a global employee survey 
(FOCUS) in 2013. Instead, we ran two 
‘pulse’ surveys across a sample of the 
organisation. A further survey was carried 
out in January 2014. The results rated 
employee understanding of our strategy at 
88%, with employee belief in our strategy 
rising to 84%. In parallel, we ran in-depth 
pulse surveys on employees affected by  
the site changes in the UK and the US.  
We intend to conduct regular employee 
surveys during 2014. As well as reviewing 
the pulse survey results, we also track key 
metrics, such as retention rates, to help 
assess levels of engagement. 
A key element of our new culture and 
behaviours is a continued focus on 
performance. By strengthening our focus 
on setting high-quality objectives aligned  
to our business strategy, and on ongoing 
coaching and feedback, we strive so  
that performance at all levels delivers  
value. The Board is responsible for  
setting our high level strategic objectives 
and monitoring performance against  
them (see the Operation of the Board 
section from page 88). Managers are 
accountable for working with their teams  
to develop individual and team performance 
targets, and for ensuring employees 
understand how they contribute to overall 
business objectives.
We will continue to empower our leaders  
to drive performance, hold our managers 
accountable for understanding and delivering 
against required standards, and provide the 
tools to reward outstanding contributions.
Our focus on optimising performance is 
reinforced by performance-related bonus 
and incentive plans. AstraZeneca also 
encourages our people to participate in 
various employee share plans, some of 
which are described in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, from page 102, and 
also in Note 24 to the Financial Statements, 
from page 173.
Human rights
†
We are committed to respecting and 
promoting international human rights in  
our operations and our sphere of influence. 
Our objective is to ensure that human rights 
considerations are appropriately integrated 
into our policies, processes and practices. 
AstraZeneca supports the principles set 
out in the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO) standards on child 
labour and minimum wages, and we are 
members of the United Nations Global 
Compact on Human Rights. As reported in 
2011, we have carried out labour reviews in 
106 countries in which we have employees. 
These focused on ILO core areas, including 
freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, child labour, discrimination, 
working hours, and wages. The review 
framework was adapted from the 
employment section of the Danish Institute 
for Human Rights assessment tool for 
pharmaceutical companies, which was 
developed with our industry’s help and 
launched in 2010. Results showed that our 
practices are generally good and consistent 
across all countries, based on our mandate 
that our global standards are applied when

external national standards do not  
meet our minimum requirements. We 
review our policies, procedures and 
practices against the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and  
Human Rights and implement changes 
where and when appropriate. 
Managing change 
Recruitment in Emerging Markets  
continues to be accompanied by 
headcount reductions in our Established 
Markets, reflecting our strategic drive  
to improve efficiency and effectiveness. 
Reductions followed restructuring in  
R&D, Supply and Manufacturing, Enabling 
Functions, and Sales and Marketing.  
The net effect of these changes since the  
end of 2006 has been to reduce our total 
headcount by some 15,300 from 66,800  
to 51,500. The Restructuring section on 
page 16 provides more information on  
our restructuring programme.
In March 2013, as outlined in the Our 
strategic priorities section from page 16,  
we announced the results of our strategy 
review, including plans to invest in three 
strategic R&D centres. Establishing these 
centres is significantly affecting our existing 
site occupancy and will result in relocating 
employees willing to move to the new 
locations, redundancy for those who 
cannot relocate, associated outplacement 
support, and recruitment to fill vacant 
positions. We are committed to ensuring 
that our core values, robust people policies, 
consultation infrastructure and prior 
experience are integrated into this process 
of change. Trade unions and employee 
representative groups are, and will continue 
to be, involved throughout the restructuring 
process, with the strong relationships built 
over recent years being of great value in 
executing this change.
Significant investment has been made  
in delivering enhanced relocation policies 
and practices to encourage employees  
to relocate, as well as allowing as much 
flexibility as possible in the timing of moves.
Employee relations
We work to ensure a level of global 
consistency in managing employee 
relations, while allowing enough flexibility  
to support local markets in building good 
relations with their workforces, taking into 
account local laws and circumstances.  
To that end, relations with trade unions are 
nationally determined and managed locally 
in line with the applicable legal framework 
and standards of good practice. However, 
each change programme has its unique 
challenges and a standard solution may  
not always be appropriate. Where this is the 
case, the appropriate solution is developed 
through consultation with employee 
representatives or, where applicable, trade 
unions, with the aim of retaining key skills 
and mitigating job losses. 
Safety, health and wellbeing
†
We are committed to promoting a safe, 
healthy and energising work environment  
in which our people, and those from third 
parties working with us, are able to express 
their talents, drive innovation and improve 
business performance.
Our targets for 2013, which were set in 
2011 for the years up to 2015, included:
 > no fatalities
 > lost time injury/illness rate per million 
hours worked of 2.26
 > 6.6 collisions per million kilometres driven.
In 2013, there were no fatal accidents 
involving AstraZeneca employees, 
contractors or members of the public. 
Our highest priority for improvement 
remains driver safety. We focus on 
promoting driver safety among our sales 
forces, which make up the largest group  
of employees who drive on AstraZeneca 
business. Performance is monitored 
centrally to assess progress and identify 
areas for improvement. In 2013, we 
improved on our annual target for collisions 
per million kilometres driven and are in  
a good position to meet our 2015 target.
In 2013, the lost time injury/illness rate 
reduced by 10% from 2012 and we 
achieved our 2015 target of a 25% 
reduction in the lost time injury/illness rate 
from the 2010 baseline, two years early. 
Work-related stress has been a particular 
focus for us in recent years. In 2013, we 
achieved a 13% reduction in the number  
of reportable cases compared to 2012. We 
are continuing our efforts in this area, using 
a risk-based approach, including wellbeing 
risk assessment tools, to identify high-risk 
areas and target interventions effectively.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
69 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Our relationships
Our employees are a critical resource in delivering our strategic 
priorities. But, to realise our full potential, we also depend on  
the trust and confidence of a wider set of stakeholders. 
Our relationships with our partners  
exist over the full life-cycle of a medicine. 
They include the patients and physicians  
for whom we provide medicines for some  
of the world’s most serious diseases  
and the universities and institutes that 
collaborate with our scientists. They also 
include governments, regulators, those  
who pay for healthcare, suppliers and 
commercial partners.
The Sales and Marketing section from  
page 40 outlines our focus on customers 
and our efforts to communicate with  
them in a way which suits them best. Our 
Research and Development section from 
page 36 demonstrates how we work from 
an early stage in a medicine’s life with those 
who pay for our medicines to demonstrate 
their full value to patients.
In the Manufacturing and Supply section 
from page 43, we examine the relationships 
we have with our suppliers and the 
commitment we have to working only with 
those that embrace standards of ethical 
behaviour consistent with our own. This 
commitment also extends to joint venture 
and co-promotion partners, and research 
and licensing partners.
Partnering
As outlined in the Our strategic priorities 
section from page 16, business development, 
specifically partnering, is an important 
supporting pillar that supplements and 
strengthens our pipeline, and our efforts  
to Achieve Scientific Leadership. As noted 
in the Research and Development section 
from page 36, we are keen to access the 
best science, whether it comes from within 
or outside our laboratories. 
We partner with others around the  
world, including academia, governments, 
industry, scientific organisations and patient 
groups to access the best science to 
stimulate innovation and to accelerate  
the delivery of new medicines to target 
unmet medical need. 
We are always looking for strategically 
aligned value-enhancing business 
development opportunities. Our current 
focus is on:
 > research transactions – increasing 
early-stage research transactions and 
academic alliances 
 > peer collaborations – exploring 
value-creating peer collaborations 
 > in-licensing and bolt-on acquisitions – 
pursuing partnering, in-licensing and 
bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our 
core therapy area portfolios.
Over the past three years we have 
completed more than 150 major business 
development transactions, including 51 in 
2013. Twenty one of these were clinical or 
research collaborations, 11 deals helped 
expand our capabilities in biologics and six 
were acquisitions. These acquisitions were 
of AlphaCore, Pearl Therapeutics, Omthera, 
Amplimmune, Spirogen and the acquisition 
of BMS’s 50% interest in BMS’s and 
AstraZeneca’s joint diabetes business 
(completed in February 2014). 
See the Research and Development 
section from page 36, the Therapy Area 
Review from page 48, and Note 22 to the 
Financial Statements for more information 
on our partnership activity in 2013.
Community investment
† 
We are committed to meeting our 
responsibility as a global corporation to 
support the wider community, maximising 
the benefit of our investment for all 
stakeholders, through focused investment  
and embracing best practice. 
In 2013, we spent $1.12 billion (2012: 
$1.18 billion) on community investment 
sponsorships, partnerships and charitable 
donations, including our product donation 
and patient assistance programmes which 
make our medicines available free of 
charge or at reduced prices. Through  
our three patient assistance programmes  
in the US, we donated products valued at 
an average wholesale price of more than 
$1.05 billion (2012: $1.12 billion). We also 
donated products worth over $18 million, 
valued at average wholesale prices, to 
charitable organisations AmeriCares and 
Direct Relief International. 
Our global community investment strategy 
focuses on two key areas, healthcare in the 
community and science in education. 
In 2013, we continued to expand our  
Young Health Programme (YHP) country 
programme and, as the figure opposite 
shows, have 18 programmes under way 
around the world. With over 480,000 young 
people directly reached with the skills and 
information they need to improve their 
health, we have exceeded our target of 
reaching a minimum of 300,000 young 
people by the end of 2013. This includes 
young people in communities across five 
continents. Over 4,500 of these young 
people have been trained to share this 
health information with their peers and with 
the community, and over 9,000 frontline 
health providers have completed training 
programmes in adolescent health. 
We are on track to meet our Clinton Global 
Initiative commitment to reach 500,000 
young people by the end of 2015. In 2013, 
as part of YHP , our work with Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public 
Health (JHSPH) included the publication  
of a special edition of the Journal of 
Adolescent Health. Phase 1 findings  
from the Wellbeing of Adolescents in 
Vulnerable Environments (WAVE) study 
being undertaken by JHSPH were also 
presented at the International Association 
of Adolescent Health, Istanbul in June 
2013. Phase 2 of WAVE is under way  
with a final report due in 2014.
70 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Resources Review Our support for science education in  
the community takes a number of forms. 
For example, in 2011, we entered a three- 
year partnership with Career Academies 
UK to support increased participation by  
16 to 19 year-olds in science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. 
The target that one-third of Career 
Academies have a STEM theme by the 
2014/2015 academic year, was exceeded  
in the 2013/2014 academic year, with  
54 Career Academies (35%) having a  
STEM theme. 
Disaster relief
The British Red Cross continues to act as 
our global disaster relief partner, with the 
majority of our disaster relief donations 
channelled through it. In response to the 
typhoon in the Philippines in November 
2013, we donated $390,000 via the British 
Red Cross to the Philippines Disaster 
Appeal. Product donations with a 
wholesale average cost value of over 
$350,000 were also made to support  
the victims of the disaster.
Following the 2011 earthquake in Japan, 
we made a commitment of $1,037 ,700  
to the Japanese charity Ashinaga, to build  
Sendai Rainbow House, a house for 
children orphaned by the disaster. In 
accordance with agreed project milestones, 
in October 2013, we made a final donation 
to Ashinaga of $259,425, completing  
our commitment. Completion of Sendai 
Rainbow House is expected in 2014.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
71 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Intellectual Property
A well-functioning system of IP rights underpins our business model. 
Discovering and developing a new 
medicine requires a significant investment 
of resources by research-based 
pharmaceutical companies over 10 or more 
years. For this to be a viable investment, 
new medicines must be safeguarded from 
being copied with a reasonable amount of 
certainty for a reasonable period of time.
Our industry’s principal economic 
safeguard is a well-functioning patent 
system that recognises our efforts and 
rewards innovation with appropriate 
protection, allowing time to generate the 
revenue we need to reinvest in new 
pharmaceutical innovation. Patent rights  
are limited by territory and duration, and  
a significant portion of a patent’s duration 
can be spent on R&D before it is possible 
to launch the protected product. Therefore, 
we commit significant resources to 
establishing and defending our patent  
and related IP protections for inventions.
Patent process
We file applications for patent protection  
for our inventions to safeguard the large 
investment required to obtain approval of 
potential new drugs for marketing. Further 
innovation means we may seek additional 
patent protection as we develop a product 
and its uses. We apply for patents via 
patent offices around the world, which 
assess whether our inventions meet the 
strict legal requirements for a patent to be 
granted. In some countries, our competitors 
can challenge our patents in the patent 
offices, and, in all countries, competitors 
can challenge our patents in the courts.  
We can face challenges early in the patent 
application process and throughout a 
patent’s life. These challenges can be to  
the validity of a patent and/or its effective 
scope and are based on ever-evolving legal 
precedents. There can be no guarantee  
of success for either party in patent 
proceedings. For information about third 
party challenges to patents protecting our 
products, see Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 176.
The basic term of a patent is typically  
20 years from the filing of the patent 
application with the relevant government 
patent office. However, the product 
protected by a pharmaceutical patent  
may not be marketed for several years  
after filing due to the time required for 
clinical trials and the regulatory approval 
process to obtain marketing approval for 
the product. Patent Term Extensions (PTE) 
are available in certain major markets, 
including the EU and the US, to compensate 
for these delays. The term of the PTE can 
vary from zero to five years depending on 
the time taken to obtain any marketing 
approval. The maximum patent term,  
when including PTE, cannot exceed  
15 years (EU) or 14 years (US) from the  
first marketing authorisation.
The generic industry is increasingly 
challenging innovators’ patents at earlier 
stages. Almost all leading pharmaceutical 
products in the US have faced, or are 
facing, patent challenges from generic 
manufacturers. Patent challenges to our 
competitors’ products may lead to the 
availability of generics in the same product 
class as patented products we currently 
supply, which may materially impact our 
business. We are also experiencing 
increased challenges elsewhere in the 
world, for example, in Europe, Canada,  
Asia and Latin America. Further information 
about the risks relating to patent litigation 
and early loss and expiry of patents is 
contained in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section from page 200.
Patent expiries
The tables on page 198 set out certain 
patent expiry dates and sales for our key 
marketed products. The expiry dates  
relate to a product’s basic substance  
patent unless indicated otherwise.  
The expiry dates shown include any  
PTE and Paediatric Exclusivity periods. 
Data exclusivity
In addition to patent protection, Regulatory 
Data Protection (RDP or ‘data exclusivity’)  
is an important IP right, which arises in 
respect of data which is required to be 
submitted to regulatory authorities in  
order to obtain marketing approvals for  
our medicines. Significant investment  
is required to generate such data (for 
example, through conducting global clinical 
trials) and this proprietary data is protected 
from use by third parties (such as generic 
manufacturers) for a number of years in a 
limited number of countries. The period of 
such protection, and the extent to which it 
is respected, differs significantly between 
countries. RDP is an important protection 
for our products, and we believe in enforcing 
our rights to it, particularly as patent rights 
are increasingly being challenged.
The RDP period starts from the date of the 
first marketing approval from the relevant 
health authority and runs parallel to any 
pending patent protection. RDP generally 
expires prior to patent expiry in all major 
markets. If a product takes an unusually 
long time to secure marketing approval,  
or if patent protection has not been secured, 
has expired or has been lost, then RDP 
may be the sole IP right protecting  
a product from copying, as generic 
manufacturers should not be allowed to  
rely on AstraZeneca’s data to support the 
generic product’s approval or marketing 
until the RDP right has expired. 
Compulsory licensing
Compulsory licensing (the over-ruling of 
patent rights to allow patented medicines to 
be manufactured and sold by other parties) 
is increasingly part of the access-to-
medicines debate. We recognise the right 
of developing countries to use the 
flexibilities in the World Trade Organization’s 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects  
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 
(including the Doha amendment) in certain 
circumstances, such as a public health 
emergency. We believe this should apply 
only when all other ways of meeting the 
emergency needs have been considered 
and where healthcare frameworks and 
safeguards exist to ensure the medicines 
reach those who need them.
“ Investing in new medicines  
is risky. Successful medicines 
must be safeguarded from 
being copied for a reasonable 
period so that we can make 
an appropriate return on our 
significant investment.”

In 2013, there was Core R&D expenditure 
of $4.3 billion in our R&D organisation 
(2012: $4.2 billion; 2011: $4.5 billion).  
In addition, $635 million was spent  
on acquiring product rights (such as 
in-licensing) (2012: $5,228 million; 2011: 
$189 million) and we invested approximately 
$490 million on the implementation  
of our R&D restructuring strategy (2012: 
$791 million; 2011: $468 million). The 
allocations of spend by early development 
and late-stage activities are presented in 
the R&D spend analysis table above. 
Manufacturing and supply resources 
Our principal small molecule manufacturing 
facilities are in the UK (Avlon and

Pennsylvania), the UK (Speke), and the 
Netherlands (Nijmegen) with capabilities  
in process development, manufacturing 
and distribution of biologics, including 
worldwide supply of MAbs and influenza 
vaccines, which enables efficient 
management of our combined small 
molecule and biologics pipeline. 
At the end of 2013, approximately 9,600 
people at 24 sites in 17 countries were 
working on the manufacture and supply  
of our products. 
Information technology and 
information services resources
At the end of 2013, our IT organisation 
comprised approximately 1,500 people 
across our sites centred in the UK (Alderley 
Park and Macclesfield), Sweden (Södertälje 
and Mölndal) and the US (Wilmington), 
together with people based with internal 
customers across our R&D and Operations 
sites, and our key marketing companies.  
In November 2013, we announced a review 
of our IT strategy to enable us to better 
support and enable AstraZeneca’s 
business priorities for the future. As part  
of our new strategy, we will make a number 
of changes to our operating model and 
organisational structure to make us more 
efficient, responsive and innovative.
Acquisition of BMS’s diabetes interest
In December 2013, AstraZeneca 
announced an agreement to purchase 
BMS’s 50% interest in AstraZeneca’s  
and BMS’s joint diabetes business. This 
acquisition completed in February 2014. 
Under the agreement, approximately 3,900 
BMS and Amylin employees will transfer  
to AstraZeneca. These employees are not 
included in the analysis described above  
or elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Our financial performance in 2013 was 
defined by the significant revenue decline 
associated with the loss of exclusivity  
for several products. Seroquel IR alone 
declined by over $900 million in constant 
currency terms, and regional losses of 
exclusivity for brands, including Atacand 
and Crestor, combined for a further 
negative impact of more than $1 billion.  
The changing product mix also impacted 
on our gross margin percentage.
As detailed in the Our relationships section 
from page 70, 2013 was a year of investment 
in business development. The acquisitions 
we have made have been in our three  
core therapy areas with the intention of 
strengthening our pipeline or helping us  
gain access to cutting-edge science.
Our 7% increase in Core SG&A costs  
at CER reflects our focus on investing in  
our growth platforms. The excise fee 
imposed by the enactment of US healthcare 
reform measures amounted to 2.7% of 
Core SG&A costs.
We generated an incremental $1.2 billion  
of revenue at CER for our key growth 
platforms: Brilinta, the diabetes franchise, 
respiratory, Emerging Markets and Japan. 
Core R&D expenditures were up only  
1%, to $4.3 billion. The Group was able  
to contain R&D costs despite increased 
business development activities in 2013. 
This was possible due to strong cost 
control and flexibility in the reallocation  
of resources. 
Reported operating profit, at $3.7 billion, 
was adversely impacted by an impairment 
charge of $1.8 billion taken against Bydureon.
In March 2013, we announced the fourth 
phase of our restructuring programme. 
Transforming the way we work is crucial  
to delivering our strategy and we are 
committed to dramatically simplifying our 
organisation and processes, while creating 
an innovative environment, including 
through co-location on a more focused 
footprint. Further details on our restructuring 
programme are provided in the Restructuring 
section from page 16. We continue to drive 
productivity improvements across the 
organisation, removing complexity and 
creating additional headroom to invest in 
growing our business and ensuring returns 
to our shareholders. 
Marc Dunoyer 
Chief Financial Officer
74 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report The purpose of this Financial Review is to 
provide a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the financial performance of the 
business during 2013, the financial position 
as at the end of the year, and the main 
business factors and trends which could 
affect the future financial performance of 
the business.
All growth rates in this Financial Review are 
expressed at CER unless noted otherwise.
Business background and results 
overview 
The business background is covered in  
the Our marketplace section from page  
13, the Therapy Area Review from page  
48 and the Geographical Review from  
page 214, and describes in detail the 
developments in both our products and the 
geographical regions in which we operate. 
As described earlier in this Annual Report, 
sales of our products are directly influenced 
by medical need and are generally paid for 
by health insurance schemes or national 
healthcare budgets. Our operating results 
can be affected by a number of factors 
other than the delivery of operating plans 
and normal competition, such as:
 > The risk of competition from generics 
following loss of patent protection or 
patent expiry of one of our products or  
an ‘at risk’ launch by a competitor or  
the launch of a generic competitor in  
the same class as one of our products, 
with the potential adverse effects on 
sales volumes and prices. For example, 
in 2013, our performance was affected 
by generic competition to Atacand, 
Crestor, Nexium and Seroquel IR. Further 
details of patent expiries for our key 
marketed products are included in the 
Patent expiries section on page 198.
 > The adverse impact on pharmaceutical 
prices as a result of the macroeconomic 
and regulatory environment. For instance, 
although there is no direct governmental 
control on prices in the US, action from 
federal and individual state programmes 
and health insurance bodies is leading to 
downward pressures on realised prices. 
In other parts of the world, there are a 
variety of price and volume control 
mechanisms and retrospective rebates 
based on sales levels that are imposed 
by governments. 
 > The timings of new product launches, 
which can be influenced by national 
regulators, and the risk that such new 
products do not succeed as anticipated, 
together with the rate of sales growth and 
costs following new product launches. 
 > Currency fluctuations. Our functional  
and reporting currency is the US dollar, 
but we have substantial exposures to 
other currencies, in particular the euro, 
Japanese yen, pound sterling and 
Swedish krona. 
 > Macro factors such as greater demand 
from an ageing population and increasing 
requirements of Emerging Markets. 
Over the longer term, the success of our 
R&D is crucial and we devote substantial 
resources to this area. The benefits of this 
investment are expected to emerge over 
the long-term and there is considerable 
inherent uncertainty as to whether and 
when it will generate future products.
The most significant features of our financial 
results in 2013 are:
 > Revenue was down 6% to $25,711 million 
(Reported: 8%) due to competition from 
generics.
 > The key growth platforms of Brilinta,  
the diabetes franchise, respiratory, 
Emerging Markets and Japan, delivered 
an incremental $1.2 billion of revenue at 
CER in 2013. This was more than offset 
by the impact of patent expiries which 
reduced revenue by $2.2 billion at CER.
 > Core operating profit was down 22% at 
CER (Reported: 25%) to $8,390 million, 
greater than the decline in our revenue 
primarily due to the higher expenditures 
associated with our key growth platforms 
and strengthened pipeline.
 > Reported operating profit was down 51% 
at CER (Reported: 54%) to $3,712 million, 
driven by impairment charges including 
$1,758 million for Bydureon.
 > Core operating margin of 33% of revenue 
was down 6.9 percentage points at  
CER (Reported: 7 .3 percentage points). 
Reported operating margin was 14.4% 
of revenue.
 > Core EPS decreased by 23% (Reported: 
26%) to $5.05. Reported EPS was down 
55% (Reported: 59%) to $2.04. 
 > Dividends paid decreased to  
$3,461 million (2012: $3,665 million). 
There were no share repurchases in  
the year (2012: $2,635 million), following 
the announcement in October 2012  
of the suspension of the Group’s share 
repurchase programme.
 > Total restructuring costs associated  
with the global programme to reshape  
the cost base of the business were 
$1,421 million in 2013. The fourth phase 
of restructuring is focused on the 
restructuring of R&D, into strategic 
research and development centres in  
the US, the UK and Sweden to improve 
pipeline productivity. The programme  
has been expanded to include additional 
activities such as a transformation of the 
IT organisation, the exit of R&D activities 
in Bangalore, India, and the exit from 
branded generics in certain Emerging 
Markets to further reduce costs and 
increase flexibility. Total restructuring 
costs charged since the start of our 
restructuring programme in 2007 amount 
to $7 ,848 million. 
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
75 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 The following measures are referred to  
in this Financial Review when reporting  
on our performance both in absolute  
terms, but more often in comparison  
to earlier years:
 > Reported performance. Reported 
performance takes into account all the 
factors (including those which we cannot 
influence, principally currency exchange 
rates) that have affected the results of  
our business, as reflected in our Group 
Financial Statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and as issued by the IASB. 
 > Core financial measures. These are 
non-GAAP measures because, unlike 
Reported performance, they cannot  
be derived directly from the information  
in the Group’s Financial Statements. 
These measures are adjusted to exclude 
certain significant items, such as:
 − amortisation and impairment of 
intangibles, including impairment 
reversals but excluding any charges 
relating to IT assets
 − charges and provisions related to  
our global restructuring programmes 
(this will include such charges that 
relate to the impact of our global 
restructuring programmes on our 
capitalised IT assets) 
 − other specified items, principally 
comprising legal settlements and 
acquisition-related costs which include 
fair value adjustments and the imputed 
finance charge relating to contingent 
consideration. 
  In determining the adjustments to  
arrive at the Core result, we use a set 
of established principles relating to  
the nature and materiality of individual 
items or groups of items, excluding,  
for example, events which (i) are 
outside the normal course of business, 
(ii) are incurred in a pattern that is 
unrelated to the trends in the 
underlying financial performance  
of our ongoing business, or (iii) are 
related to major acquisitions, to ensure 
that investors’ ability to evaluate  
and analyse the underlying financial 
performance of our ongoing business 
is enhanced. See the 2013 
Reconciliation of Reported results  
to Core results table on the page 
opposite for a reconciliation of 
Reported to Core performance.  
As detailed in our 2012 Annual Report, 
we revised our definition of Core 
performance measures in 2013. 
Further details of the restatement of 
prior year comparative values under 
our new Core measure definition are 
included in the Financials (Prior year) 
section on page 222.
 > Constant exchange rate (CER) growth 
rates. These are also non-GAAP 
measures. These measures remove  
the effects of currency movements  
(by retranslating the current year’s 
performance at previous year’s exchange 
rates and adjusting for other exchange 
effects, including hedging).  
A reconciliation of the Reported results 
adjusted for the impact of currency 
movements is provided in the 2013 
Reported operating profit table on the 
page opposite. 
 > Gross and operating profit margin 
percentages. These measures set out 
the progression of key performance 
margins and illustrate the overall quality  
of the business. 
 > Prescription volumes and trends for  
key products. These measures can 
represent the real business growth  
and the progress of individual products 
better and more immediately than 
invoiced sales. 
 > Net funds/debt. This represents our  
cash and cash equivalents, current 
investments and derivative financial 
instruments less interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings. 
CER measures allow us to focus on the 
changes in sales and expenses driven  
by volume, prices and cost levels relative  
to the prior period. Sales and cost growth 
expressed in CER allows management  
to understand the true local movement  
in sales and costs, in order to compare 
recent trends and relative return on 
investment. CER growth rates can be used 
to analyse sales in a number of ways but, 
most often, we consider CER growth by 
products and groups of products, and by 
countries and regions. CER sales growth 
can be further analysed into the impact of 
sales volumes and selling price. Similarly, 
CER cost growth helps us to focus on the 
real local change in costs so that we can 
manage the cost base effectively.
We believe that disclosing Core financial 
and growth measures, in addition to our 
Reported financial information, enhances 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse  
the underlying financial performance of  
our ongoing business and the related key 
business drivers. The adjustments made  
to our Reported financial information in 
order to show Core financial measures 
illustrate clearly, and on a year-on-year or 
period-by-period basis, the impact upon 
our performance caused by factors such  
as changes in sales and expenses driven 
by volume, prices and cost levels relative  
to such prior years or periods.
As shown in the 2013 Reconciliation  
of Reported results to Core results table  
on the page opposite, our reconciliation  
of Reported financial information to Core 
financial measures includes a breakdown  
of the items for which our Reported 
financial information is adjusted and a 
further breakdown by specific line item as 
such items are reflected in our Reported 
income statement. This illustrates the 
significant items that are excluded from 
Core financial measures and their impact 
on our Reported financial information,  
both as a whole and in respect of specific 
line items.
Management presents these results 
externally to meet investors’ requirements 
for transparency and clarity. Core financial 
measures are also used internally in the 
management of our business performance, 
in our budgeting process and when 
determining compensation.
Core financial measures are non-GAAP 
measures. All items for which Core financial 
measures are adjusted are included in our 
Reported financial information as they 
represent actual costs of our business in 
the periods presented. As a result, Core 
financial measures merely allow investors  
to differentiate between different kinds of 
costs and they should not be used in 
isolation. You should also refer to our 
Reported financial information in the 2013 
Reported operating profit table on the page 
opposite, our reconciliation of Core financial 
measures to Reported financial information 
in the Reconciliation of Reported results  
to Core results table on the page opposite, 
and to the Results of operations – summary 
analysis of year to 31 December 2012 
section from page 222 for our discussion  
of comparative Reported growth measures 
that reflect all factors that affect our 
business. Our determination of non-GAAP 
measures, and our presentation of them 
within this financial information, may differ 
from similarly titled non-GAAP measures  
of other companies.
The SET retains strategic management  
of the costs excluded from Reported 
financial information in arriving at Core 
financial measures, tracking their impact  
on Reported operating profit and EPS, with 
operational management being delegated 
on a case-by-case basis to ensure clear 
accountability and consistency for each 
cost category.

Revenue for the year was down 6% on  
a CER basis and 8% on a Reported basis. 
The revenue decline was driven by a loss  
of exclusivity on brands including Atacand, 
Crestor, Nexium and Seroquel IR, which 
reduced revenue by $2.2 billion at CER.  
Our key growth platforms of Brilinta, the 
diabetes franchise (which benefited from  
a full year of Amylin-related product sales), 
respiratory, Emerging Markets and Japan 
delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of 
revenue at CER in 2013. 
Revenue in the US was down 9% on a CER 
basis (Reported: 9%) with revenue in the 
Rest of World down 4% at CER (Reported: 
7%). Emerging Markets sales increased by 
8% at CER (Reported: 6%). Further details 
of our sales performance are contained in 
the Geographical Review from page 214.
Core gross margin was 82.0%, 0.5 
percentage points lower than last year at 
CER (Reported: 0.4 percentage points) 
driven by changes in our product mix to 
lower margin products when compared 
with 2012.
Core R&D expense for the year was up  
1% at CER and Reported, as a result of 
absorbing higher costs from business 
development projects as well as investment 
in the growing number of late-stage trials. 
Expenditures in Core number of SG&A 
costs were 7% higher than last year at CER 
(Reported: 6%), as a result of increased 
levels of expenditure in support of our 
growth platforms of Brilinta, the diabetes 
franchise and Emerging Markets during  
the year. SG&A costs also reflect a full year 
of costs associated with our expanded 
diabetes alliance with BMS on Amylin 
products entered into in 2012. The excise 
fee imposed by the enactment of US 
healthcare reform measures amounted  
to 2.7% (2012: 2.8%) of Core SG&A costs 
for the year.
Core other income for the year was  
down 30% at CER and Reported, with 
2012 benefiting from the sale of OTC  
rights for Nexium. 
Core operating profit for the year was down 
22% on a CER basis (Reported: 25%) to 
$8,390 million. Core operating margin was 
32.6% of revenue, down 6.9 percentage 
points at CER (Reported: 7 .3 percentage 
points). The decline in Core operating profit 
was greater than the decline in revenue 
primarily due to expenditure associated 
with the Group’s key growth platforms  
and strengthened pipeline.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
77 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Core EPS was $5.05, down 23% compared 
with last year at CER (Reported: 26%), and 
broadly in line with the decline in Core 
operating profit. 
Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core 
amounted to $4,678 million in 2013  
(2012: $3,011 million). Excluded from  
Core results were: 
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,421 million 
(2012: $1,558 million), incurred as the 
Group commenced the fourth phase of 
restructuring announced in March 2013. 
 > Amortisation totalling $1,591 million 
(2012: $1,134 million) relating to intangible 
assets, except IT-related amortisation 
charges. The increase was driven by  
a full year of amortisation arising from  
the amendment to the Merck exit 
arrangements and the expansion of our 
diabetes alliance during 2012, as detailed 
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements 
from page 150.
 > Net intangible impairment charges of 
$1,712 million (2012: $186 million), 
including $1,758 million against 
Bydureon, following sales performance 
below AstraZeneca’s commercial 
expectations at the time of entering into 
the expanded diabetes alliance in 2012, 
and $136 million following AstraZeneca’s 
decision not to proceed with regulatory 
filings for fostamatinib. Partially offsetting 
these charges was the impairment 
reversal of $285 million following the 
commencement of the first of several 
Phase III clinical programmes for olaparib. 
The full historic carrying value of the asset 
has been restored to our balance sheet. 
Further details relating to intangible asset 
impairments are included in Note 9 to  
the Financial Statements from page 150.
 > Legal provisions and other adjustments  
of $46 million income (2012: $133 million 
charges) including an $18 million 
adjustment to the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable arising on our 
business combinations completed in 
2013, as detailed in Notes 16 and 22 to 
the Financial Statements on page 158 
and from page 166.
Reported operating profit for the year  
was down 51% at CER (Reported: 54%) to 
$3,712 million; Reported EPS was down 
55% on a CER basis (Reported: 59%) to 
$2.04. The larger declines compared with 
the respective Core financial measures  
are mainly the result of the $1,758 million 
impairment of Bydureon, as well as the  
full year amortisation related to the Merck 
Second Option. 
Net finance expense was $445 million 
(2012: $502 million). Interest payable on 
defined benefit pension scheme liabilities 
fell by $14 million, and there were fair value 
gains of $5 million recorded on long-term 
bonds in 2013, versus $10 million losses in 
2012. Interest on long-term bonds for the 
year was $16 million lower than 2012.
The Reported taxation charge of  
$696 million (2012: $1,376 million), 
consisted of a current tax charge  
of $1,398 million (2012: $1,677 million)  
and a credit arising from movements  
on deferred tax of $702 million  
(2012: $301 million). The current tax  
charge includes a prior period current  
tax charge of $46 million (2012: credit  
of $79 million).
The Reported tax rate for the year was 
21.3% compared with 18.0% for 2012.  
The Reported tax rate for the year ended 
31 December 2012 benefited from a  
$230 million adjustment to deferred tax 
balances following substantive enactment 
of a reduction in the Swedish corporation 
tax rate from 26.3% to 22.0%, and a  
$240 million adjustment in respect of  
prior periods following the settlement of  
a transfer pricing matter. Excluding these 
benefits, the Reported tax rate for 2012 
was 24.1%. Further details relating to 
movements in our taxation balances  
are included in Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements from page 143.
Total comprehensive income for  
2013 decreased by $3,947 million  
to $2,458 million. This was driven by  
the decrease in profit for the year of 
$3,699 million, and a decrease of 
$248 million in other comprehensive 
income which was principally due to  
effects of movements in exchange rates  
on our consolidated results. 
78 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Financial Review Cash generated from operating  
activities was $7 ,400 million in the year  
ended 31 December 2013, compared  
with $6,948 million in 2012. Lower tax and 
interest payments partially offset the lower 
operating profit in 2013, after adjusting for 
impairments and non-cash costs, while 
working capital movements and a one-off 
pension fund contribution drove higher 
outflows in the prior year. 
Investment cash outflows of $3,112 million 
(2012: $5,607 million) included $1,158 million 
on completion of the acquisitions of Pearl 
Therapeutics, Omthera, Amplimmune and 
Spirogen, and $1,316 million for the 
purchase of other intangible assets.  
The comparative period of 2012 included 
the cash outflows for the purchase of  
Ardea ($1,187 million) and intangible assets 
associated with our collaboration with  
BMS on Amylin ($3,358 million).
Net cash distributions to shareholders  
were $2,979 million, through dividends of 
$3,461 million partially offset by proceeds 
from the issue of shares of $482 million. 
At 31 December 2013, outstanding  
gross debt (interest-bearing loans  
and borrowings) was $10,376 million  
(2012: $10,310 million). Of the gross  
debt outstanding at 31 December 2013, 
$1,788 million is due within one year 
(2012: $901 million). 
Net funds of $39 million have increased  
by $1,408 million during the year as a result 
of the net cash inflow as described above.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
79 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 In 2013, net assets decreased by $693 million 
to $23,253 million. The decrease in net 
assets is broadly as a result of the Group 
profit of $2,571 million being offset by 
dividends of $3,499 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased 
by $271 million to $5,818 million. Additions 
of $816 million (2012: $772 million) were 
offset by depreciation of $906 million  
(2012: $1,023 million), impairments of  
$101 million (2012: $nil) and disposals  
of $82 million (2012: $224 million).
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s goodwill of $9,981 million 
(2012: $9,898 million) principally arose on 
the acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 and 
the restructuring of our US joint venture  
with Merck in 1998. Goodwill of $77 million 
arising on our acquisitions of Pearl 
Therapeutics and Amplimmune, as detailed 
in Note 22 to the Financial Statements from 
page 166, was capitalised in 2013.
Intangible assets amounted to $16,047 
million at 31 December 2013 (2012: 
$16,448 million). Intangible asset additions 
were $3,217 million in 2013 (2012: 
$6,916 million), including product rights 
acquired in our acquisitions of Pearl 
Therapeutics ($985 million), Omthera 
($526 million), Amplimmune ($534 million) 
and Spirogen ($371 million). Amortisation  
in the year was $1,779 million (2012: 
$1,296 million). Impairment charges in the 
year amounted to $2,082 million (2012: 
$199 million) including a $1,758 million 
charge on our diabetes product Bydureon 
and a $136 million impairment charge 
following our decision not to proceed with 
regulatory filings for fostamatinib. These 
impairment charges were partially offset by 
a $285 million impairment reversal following 
enrolment of the first patient in the first of 
several Phase III clinical programmes for 
olaparib, an impairment provision previously 
having being taken against this compound 
in 2011. 
Further details of our additions to intangible 
assets, and impairments recorded, are 
included in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 150. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables decreased by 
$182 million to $5,514 million in line  
with lower revenues in 2013. 
Prepayments and accrued income 
increased by $1,988 million driven, 
principally, by an increase in prepayments 
following the modification of the royalty 
structure under our global licence 
agreement for Crestor, which now includes 
fixed minimum and maximum annual 
royalty payments to Shionogi. These  
future royalties have been recognised  
within payables and as a prepayment. 
Prepayments also increased due to 
payments made to Moderna Therapeutics 
and Immunocore during the year on new 
research collaborations. 
Trade and other payables increased by 
$2,492 million in 2013 to $12,714 million, 
with increases in other payables of  
$2,277 million due to the recognition of 
future royalty payments on Crestor, as 
detailed above, and contingent consideration 
of $532 million recognised on the acquisitions 
of Pearl Therapeutics ($149 million), 
Omthera ($62 million), Amplimmune  
($153 million) and Spirogen ($168 million).
The increase in provisions of $45 million  
in 2013 includes $771 million of additional 
charges recorded in the year, offset by 
$681 million of cash payments. Included 
within the $771 million of charges for  
the year is $652 million for our global 
restructuring initiative and $23 million in 
respect of legal charges. Cash payments 
include $532 million for our global 
restructuring programme. Further details  
of the charges made against provisions  
are contained in Notes 17 and 25 to the 
Financial Statements on page 158, and  
176 to 183, respectively.
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable has increased by 
$523 million to $2,582 million, principally 
due to cash tax timing differences and an 
increase in accruals for tax contingencies. 
The tax receivable balance of $494 million 
comprises tax owing to AstraZeneca  
from certain governments expected to be 
received on settlements of transfer pricing 
audits and disputes (see Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 176) and  
cash tax timing differences. Net deferred 
tax liabilities increased by $157 million  
in the year.
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations 
decreased by $10 million in 2013. Employer 
contributions to the pension scheme of 
$369 million were offset by current and 
past service cost charges of $204 million, 
net financing costs of $79 million and 
exchange movements. 
Approximately 97% of the Group’s 
obligations are concentrated in the UK,  
the US, Sweden and Germany. In recent 
years, the Group has undertaken several 
initiatives to reduce its net pension 
obligation exposure. For the UK defined 
benefit pension scheme, which is 
AstraZeneca’s largest defined benefit

80 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Financial Review scheme, these initiatives have included 
agreeing funding principles for cash 
contributions to be paid into the UK 
pension scheme to target a level of assets 
in excess of the current expected cost  
of providing benefits, and, in 2010, 
amendments to the scheme to freeze 
pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels.  
In addition to the cash contributions  
to be paid into the UK pension scheme, 
AstraZeneca makes contributions to an 
escrow account which is held outside the 
pension scheme. The escrow account 
assets are payable to the fund in agreed 
circumstances, for example, in the event of 
AstraZeneca and the pension fund trustee 
agreeing a change to the current long-term 
investment strategy. 
Further details of the Group’s pension 
schemes are included in Note 18 to the 
Financial Statements from page 159.
Commitments and contingencies
The Group has commitments and 
contingencies which are accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policies 
described in the Financial Statements in  
the Group Accounting Policies section  
from page 136. The Group also has 
taxation contingencies. These are 
described in the Taxation section in the 
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
section on page 87 and in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 176.
Research and development 
collaboration payments
Details of future potential R&D collaboration 
payments are also included in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 176.  
As detailed in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements, payments to our collaboration 
partners may not become payable due to 
the inherent uncertainty in achieving the 
development and revenue milestones linked 
to the future payments. As part of our 
overall externalisation strategy, we may 
enter into further collaboration projects  
in the future that may include milestone 
payments and, therefore, as certain 
milestone payments fail to crystallise due to, 
for example, development not proceeding, 
they may be replaced by potential 
payments under new collaborations.
Investments, divestments and capital 
expenditure 
The Group has completed over 150 major 
business development transactions over 
the past three years, five of which were 
accounted for as business acquisitions 
under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, 
being the acquisitions of Pearl Therapeutics, 
Omthera, Amplimmune and Spirogen in 
2013, and Ardea in 2012, and all others 
being in-licences, strategic alliances and 
collaborations. Further details of our 
business acquisitions and disposals in the 
past three years are contained in Note 22  
to the Financial Statements from page 166. 
Details of our significant externalisation 
transactions are given below:
 > In March 2013, AstraZeneca signed an 
exclusive agreement with Moderna 
Therapeutics to discover, develop and 
commercialise pioneering medicines 
based on messenger RNA Therapeutics 
for the treatment of serious cardiovascular, 
metabolic and renal diseases as well  
as cancer. Under the terms of the 
agreement, AstraZeneca made an 
upfront payment of $240 million. 
AstraZeneca will have exclusive access 
to select any target of its choice in 
cardiometabolic and renal diseases,  
as well as selected targets in oncology, 
over a period of up to five years for 
subsequent development of messenger 
RNA Therapeutics. In addition, Moderna 
Therapeutics is entitled to an additional 
$180 million for the achievement of  
three technical milestones. Through  
this agreement, AstraZeneca has the 
option to select up to 40 drug products 
for clinical development and Moderna 
Therapeutics will be entitled to 
development and commercial milestone 
payments as well as royalties on drug 
sales ranging from high single digits  
to low double digits for each product. 
AstraZeneca will lead the pre-clinical, 
clinical development and commercialisation 
of therapeutics resulting from the 
agreement and Moderna Therapeutics 
will be responsible for designing and 
manufacturing the messenger RNA 
Therapeutics against selected targets.
 > In July 2013, AstraZeneca entered into 
a strategic collaboration with FibroGen 
to develop and commercialise roxadustat 
(FG-4592), a first-in-class oral compound 
in late-stage development for the 
treatment of anaemia associated with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This 
broad collaboration focuses on the US, 
China and all major markets excluding 
Japan, Europe, the CIS, the Middle East 
and South Africa, which are covered  
by an existing agreement between 
FibroGen and Astellas. The AstraZeneca-
FibroGen joint effort will be focused on 
the development of roxadustat to treat 
anaemia in CKD and ESRD, and may be 
extended to other anaemia indications. 
AstraZeneca and FibroGen plan to 
undertake an extensive roxadustat Phase 
III development programme for the US, 
and to initiate Phase III trials in China, with 
anticipated regulatory filings in China in 
2015 and in the US in 2017 . AstraZeneca 
will pay FibroGen committed upfront and 
subsequent non-contingent payments 
totalling $350 million, as well as potential 
future development-related milestone 
payments of up to $465 million, and 
potential future sales-related milestone 
payments, in addition to tiered royalty 
payments on future sales of roxadustat  
in the low 20% range. Additional 
development milestones will be payable 
for any subsequent indications which  
the companies choose to pursue. 
AstraZeneca will be responsible for  
the US commercialisation of roxadustat, 
with FibroGen undertaking specified 
promotional activities in the ESRD 
segment in this market. The companies 
will also co-commercialise roxadustat in 
China where FibroGen will be responsible 
for clinical trials, regulatory matters, 
manufacturing and medical affairs, and 
AstraZeneca will oversee promotional 
activities and commercial distribution.
 > In April 2012, AstraZeneca announced  
an agreement to jointly develop and 
commercialise five monoclonal 
antibodies from Amgen’s clinical 
inflammation portfolio: AMG 139, AMG 
157 , AMG 181, AMG 557 and brodalumab 
(AMG 827). Under the terms of the 
agreement, AstraZeneca made a  
$50 million upfront payment and the 
companies share both costs and profits. 
Approximately 65% of costs for the  
2012 to 2014 period are funded by 
AstraZeneca. Thereafter, the companies 
will split costs equally. In addition, 
AstraZeneca will make development 
milestone payments up to a maximum  
of $30 million up to launch. On 
commercialisation, Amgen will retain a 
low-single-digit royalty for brodalumab 
and a mid-single-digit royalty for the rest 
of the portfolio after which the companies 
will share profits equally.
 > In January 2007 , AstraZeneca signed 
an exclusive co-development and 
co-promotion agreement with BMS for 
the development and commercialisation 
of Onglyza, a DPP-IV and Farxiga/Forxiga, 
a selective sodium-glucose co-
transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, both 
for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. In 
August 2012, AstraZeneca expanded its 
diabetes alliance with BMS to incorporate 
the development and marketing of 
Amylin’s portfolio of diabetes products. 
The portfolio of collaboration products  
in Amylin includes Byetta (exenatide) 
injection and Bydureon (exenatide 
extended-release for injectable 
suspension/exenatide 2mg powder  
and solvent for prolonged release 
suspension for injection), Symlin 
(pramlinitide acetate) injection, and 
metreleptin, a leptin analogue. AstraZeneca 
expanded the alliance for a total 
consideration of $3.7 billion. In December 
2013, AstraZeneca announced an 
agreement under which AstraZeneca

acquired the entirety of BMS’s interests 
in the companies’ diabetes alliance for  
an initial consideration of $2.7 billion  
on completion and up to $1.4 billion in 
regulatory, launch and sales-related 
payments. AstraZeneca has also agreed 
to pay various sales-related royalty 
payments up until 2025. In addition, 
AstraZeneca may make payments up  
to $225 million when certain assets  
are subsequently transferred. The 
business combination completed on  
1 February 2014, and provides 
AstraZeneca with 100% ownership  
of the intellectual property and global 
rights for the development, manufacture 
and commercialisation of the diabetes 
business. Further details of this business 
combination are included in Note 28 to 
the Financial Statements from page 184. 
The Group determines the above business 
development transactions to be significant 
using a range of factors. We look at the 
specific circumstances of the individual 
externalisation arrangement and apply 
several quantitative and qualitative criteria. 
Because we consider business development 
transactions to be an extension of our  
R&D strategy, the expected total value  
of development payments under the 
transaction and its proportion of our annual 
R&D spend, both of which are proxies for 
overall R&D effort and cost, are important 
elements of the significance determination. 
Other quantitative criteria we apply include, 
without limitation, expected levels of future 
sales, the possible value of milestone 
payments and the resources used for 
commercialisation activities (for example, 
the number of staff). Qualitative factors we 
consider include, without limitation, new 
market developments, new territories, new 
areas of research and strategic implications.
In aggregate, payments capitalised under 
the Group’s externalisation arrangements, 
other than those detailed above, amounted 
to $301 million in 2013, $156 million in  
2012, and $123 million in 2011. The Group 
recognised other income in respect of  
other externalisation arrangements totalling 
$20 million in 2013, $255 million in 2012 
including $250 million of income from an 
agreement with Pfizer for OTC rights for 
Nexium, and $18 million in 2011.
Capitalisation
The total number of shares in issue at 
31 December 2013 was 1,257 million. 
10.4 million Ordinary Shares were issued  
in consideration of share option exercises 
for a total of $451 million. There were no 
share repurchases in 2013. Shareholders’ 
equity decreased by $507 million to 
$23,224 million at the year end. Non-
controlling interests decreased to 
$29 million (2012: $215 million), mainly 
driven by changes in non-controlling 
interests’ shareholdings in Japan.
Dividend and share repurchases
The Board has recommended a second 
interim dividend of $1.90 (116.8 pence, 
12.41 SEK) to be paid on 24 March 2014. 
This brings the full year dividend to $2.80 
(176.0 pence, 18.33 SEK).
This dividend is consistent with the 
progressive dividend policy, by which the 
Board intends to maintain or grow the 
dividend each year.
The Board regularly reviews its distribution 
policy and its overall financial strategy to 
continue to strike a balance between the 
interests of the business, our financial 
creditors and our shareholders. Having 
regard for business investment, funding  
the progressive dividend policy and 
meeting our debt service obligations, the 
Board currently believes it is appropriate  
to continue the suspension of the share 
repurchase programme which was 
announced in October 2012.
Future prospects 
We believe challenging market conditions 
will persist in 2014, including continued 
government interventions on price. The 
revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity 
will also continue to affect our performance 
including the anticipated Nexium US first 
generic launch in May 2014.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management policies
Insurance
Our risk management processes are 
described in the Managing risk section from 
page 199. These processes enable us to 
identify risks that can be partly or entirely 
mitigated through the use of insurance.  
We negotiate best available premium rates 
with insurance providers on the basis of our 
extensive risk management procedures.  
In the current insurance market, the level  
82 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Financial Review of cover is decreasing while premium rates 
are increasing. Rather than simply paying 
higher premiums for lower cover, we focus 
our insurance resources on the most critical 
areas, or where there is a legal requirement, 
and where we can get best value for 
money. Risks to which we pay particular 
attention include business interruption, 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability, and 
property damage. Insurance for product 
liability has not been available on 
commercially acceptable terms for several 
years and the Group has not purchased in 
the market product liability insurance since 
February 2006.
Taxation
Tax risk management forms an integrated 
part of the Group’s risk management 
processes. Our tax strategy is to manage 
tax risks and tax costs in a manner 
consistent with shareholders’ best 
long-term interests, taking into account 
both economic and reputational factors.  
We draw a distinction between tax planning 
using artificial structures and optimising tax 
treatment of business transactions, and we 
engage only in the latter.
Treasury
The principal financial risks to which the 
Group is exposed are those arising from 
liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency  
and credit. The Group has a centralised 
treasury function to manage these risks  
in accordance with Board-approved 
policies. Specifically, liquidity risk is 
managed through maintaining access  
to a number of sources of funding to  
meet anticipated funding requirements, 
including committed bank facilities and 
cash resources. Interest rate risk is 
managed through maintaining a debt 
portfolio that is weighted towards fixed 
rates of interest. Accordingly, the Group’s 
net interest charge is not significantly 
affected by movements in floating rates  
of interest. We do not currently hedge  
the impact on earnings and cash flow  
of changes in exchange rates, with the 
exception of the currency exposure that 
arises between the booking and settlement 
dates on non-local currency purchases  
and sales by subsidiaries and the external 
dividend. Credit risk is managed through 
setting and monitoring credit limits 
appropriate for the assessed risk of  
the counterparty.
Our capital and risk management 
objectives and policies are described in 
further detail in Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 169 and in the Risk 
section from page 199.
Sensitivity analysis of the Group’s  
exposure to exchange rate and interest  
rate movements is also detailed in Note 23 
to the Financial Statements from page 169.
Critical accounting policies and 
estimates
Our Financial Statements are prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU (adopted IFRS) and as issued by  
the IASB, and the accounting policies 
employed are set out in the Group 
Accounting Policies section in the Financial 
Statements from page 136. In applying  
these policies, we make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities. The actual outcome could differ 
from those estimates. Some of these 
policies require a high level of judgement 
because the areas are especially subjective 
or complex. We believe that the most 
critical accounting policies and significant 
areas of judgement and estimation are in:
 > revenue recognition 
 > research and development 
 > impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets 
 > litigation 
 > post-retirement benefits 
 > taxation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recorded at the invoiced 
amount (excluding inter-company sales  
and value-added taxes) less movements  
in estimated accruals for rebates and 
chargebacks given to managed-care and 
other customers and product returns – a 
particular feature in the US. The impact in 
the rest of the world is not significant. It is 
the Group’s policy to offer a credit note for 
all returns and to destroy all returned stock 
in all markets. Cash discounts for prompt 
payment are also deducted from sales. 
Revenue is recognised at the point of 
delivery, which is usually when title passes 
to the customer, either on shipment or  
on receipt of goods by the customer 
depending on local trading terms. Income 
from royalties and from disposals of IP , 
brands and product lines is included in 
other operating income.
Rebates, chargebacks and returns  
in the US
When invoicing sales in the US, we estimate 
the rebates and chargebacks that we 
expect to pay. These rebates typically  
arise from sales contracts with third party 
managed-care organisations, hospitals, 
long-term care facilities, group purchasing 
organisations and various federal or state 
programmes (Medicaid ‘best price’ 
contracts, supplemental rebates etc).  
They can be classified as follows:
 > Chargebacks, where we enter into 
arrangements under which certain 
parties, typically hospitals, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Public 
Health Service Covered Entities and the 
Department of Defense, are able to buy 
products from wholesalers at the lower 
prices we have contracted with them. 
The chargeback is the difference 
between the price we invoice to the 
wholesaler and the contracted price 
charged by the wholesaler. Chargebacks 
are paid directly to the wholesalers.
 > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other 
federal and state programmes, where we 
pay rebates based on the specific terms 
of agreements with the US Department 
of Health and Human Services and with 
individual states, which include product 
usage and information on best prices 
and average market prices benchmarks.
 > Contractual, under which entities such as 
third party managed-care organisations, 
long-term care facilities and group 
purchasing organisations are entitled  
to rebates depending on specified 
performance provisions, which vary  
from contract to contract.
The effects of these deductions on our  
US pharmaceuticals revenue and the 
movements on US pharmaceuticals 
revenue provisions are set out overleaf.
Accrual assumptions are built up on a 
product-by-product and customer-by-
customer basis, taking into account 
specific contract provisions coupled with 
expected performance, and are then 
aggregated into a weighted average rebate 
accrual rate for each of our products. 
Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted  
on a monthly basis. There may be further 
adjustments when actual rebates are 
invoiced based on utilisation information 
submitted to us (in the case of contractual 
rebates) and claims/invoices are received 
(in the case of regulatory rebates and 
chargebacks). We believe that we have 
made reasonable estimates for future 
rebates using a similar methodology to that 
of previous years. Inevitably, however, such 
estimates involve judgements on aggregate 
future sales levels, segment mix and the 
customers’ contractual performance.
Managed-care and group purchasing 
organisation rebate charges increased by 
$1,321 million in 2013 (2012: $160 million; 
2011: $682 million) mainly due to the  
higher contracted rates in the commercial 
and Medicare Part D segments due to 
pricing pressures and the impact of 2013 
price increases.
Cash discounts are offered to customers  
to encourage prompt payment. Accruals 
are calculated based on historical 
experience and are adjusted to reflect 
actual experience.

84 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Strategic Report | Financial Review Industry practice in the US allows 
wholesalers and pharmacies to return 
unused stocks within six months of, and  
up to 12 months after, shelf-life expiry.  
The customer is credited for the returned 
product by the issuance of a credit note. 
Returned products are not exchanged for 
products from inventory and once a return 
claim has been determined to be valid  
and a credit note has been issued to the 
customer, the returned products are 
destroyed. At the point of sale in the US,  
we estimate the quantity and value of 
products which may ultimately be returned. 
Our returns accruals in the US are based 
on actual experience. Our estimate is  
based on the preceding 12 months for 
established products together with 
market-related information, such as 
estimated stock levels at wholesalers and 
competitor activity, which we receive via 
third party information services. For newly 
launched products, we use rates based  
on our experience with similar products  
or a pre-determined percentage.
For products facing generic competition 
(such as Atacand and the Toprol-XL 
franchise in the US) our experience is that 
we usually lose the ability to estimate the 
levels of returns from wholesalers with the 
same degree of precision that we can for 
products still subject to patent protection. 
This is because we have limited or no 
insight into a number of areas: the actual 
timing of the generic launch (for example, a 
generic manufacturer may or may not have 
produced adequate pre-launch inventory); 
the pricing and marketing strategy of the 
competitor; the take-up of the generic; and 
(in cases where a generic manufacturer has 
approval to launch only one dose size in a 
market of several dose sizes) the likely level 
of switching from one dose to another. 
Under our accounting policy, revenue is 
recognised only when the amount of the 
revenue can be measured reliably. Our 
approach in meeting this condition for 
products facing generic competition will 
vary from product to product depending  
on the specific circumstances.
The closing adjustment in respect of  
prior years increased 2013 net US 
pharmaceuticals revenue by 0.2% (2012: 
increased revenue by 1.0%; 2011: increased 
revenue by 1.1%). However, taking into 
account the adjustments affecting both the 
current and the prior year, 2012 revenue 
was reduced by 0.8%, and 2011 revenue 
was reduced by 0.3%, by adjustments 
between years.
We have distribution service agreements 
with major wholesaler buyers which serve 
to reduce the speculative purchasing 
behaviour of the wholesalers and reduce 
short-term fluctuations in the level of 
inventory they hold. We do not offer any 
incentives to encourage wholesaler 
speculative buying and attempt, where 
possible, to restrict shipments to underlying 
demand when such speculation occurs.
Sales of intangible assets
A consequence of charging all internal R&D 
expenditure to the income statement in the 
year in which it is incurred (which is normal 
practice in the pharmaceutical industry)  
is that we own valuable intangible assets 
which are not recorded on the balance 
sheet. We also own acquired intangible 
assets which are included on the balance 
sheet. As a consequence of regular reviews 
of product strategy, from time to time we 
sell such assets and generate income. 
Sales of product lines are often accompanied 
by an agreement on our part to continue 
manufacturing the relevant product for a 
reasonable period (often about two years) 
while the purchaser constructs its own 
manufacturing facilities. The contracts 
typically involve the receipt of an upfront 
payment, which the contract attributes  
to the sale of the intangible assets, and 
ongoing receipts, which the contract 
attributes to the sale of the product we 
manufacture. In cases where the 
transaction has two or more components, 
we account for the delivered item (for 
example, the transfer of title to the 
intangible asset) as a separate unit of 
accounting and record revenue on delivery 
of that component, provided that we can 
make a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
of the undelivered component. Where the 
fair market value of the undelivered 
component (for example, a manufacturing 
agreement) exceeds the contracted  
price for that component, we defer  
an appropriate element of the upfront 
consideration and amortise this over the 
performance period. However, where  
the fair market value of the undelivered 
component is equal to or lower than the 
contracted price for that component, we 
treat the whole of the upfront amount as 
being attributable to the delivered intangible 
assets and recognise that part of the 
revenue upon delivery. No element of  
the contracted revenue related to the 
undelivered component is allocated to the 
sale of the intangible asset. This is because 
the contracted revenue relating to the 
undelivered component is contingent on 
future events (such as sales) and so cannot 
be anticipated.
Research and development
Our business is underpinned by our 
marketed products and development 
portfolio. The R&D expenditure on internal 
activities to generate these products  
is generally charged to profit in the year  
that it is incurred. Purchases of IP and 
product rights to supplement our R&D 
portfolio are capitalised as intangible 
assets. Further details of this policy  
are included in the Group Accounting 
Policies section of our Financial Statements 
from page 136. Such intangible assets are 
amortised from the launch of the underlying 
products and are tested for impairment 
both before and after launch. This policy  
is in line with practice adopted by major 
pharmaceutical companies.
Impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets
We have significant investments in  
goodwill and intangible assets as a result of 
acquisitions of businesses and purchases 
of assets, such as product development 
and marketing rights.
Details of the estimates and assumptions 
we make in our annual impairment testing 
of goodwill are included in Note 8 to  
the Financial Statements on page 149.  
The Group, including acquisitions, is 
considered a single cash-generating unit 
for impairment purposes. No impairment  
of goodwill was identified.
Impairment reviews have been carried  
out on all intangible assets that are in 
development (and not being amortised), all 
major intangible assets acquired during the 
year and all intangible assets that have had 
indications of impairment during the year. 
Sales forecasts and specific allocated  
costs (which have both been subject to 
appropriate senior management sign-off) 
are discounted using appropriate rates 
based on AstraZeneca’s risk-adjusted, 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
Our weighted average cost of capital 
reflects factors such as our capital structure 
and our costs of debt and equity. In 
building to the range of rates used in our 
internal investment appraisal of future 
projects and capital investment decisions, 
we adjust our weighted average cost  
of capital for other factors which reflect, 
without limitation, local matters such as  
risk on a case-by-case basis.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
85 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 A significant portion of our investments  
in intangible assets and goodwill arose  
from the restructuring of the joint venture 
with Merck in 1998, the acquisition of 
MedImmune in 2007 , and the payments  
to partially retire Merck’s interests in  
our products in the US in 2008 and  
2010. In addition, our recent business 
combinations, as detailed in Note 22 to  
the Financial Statements from page 166, 
have added significant product, marketing 
and distribution intangible rights to our 
intangible asset portfolio. As detailed  
earlier in this section of the Annual Report, 
we recorded an impairment charge of 
$1,758 million against the intangible  
asset relating to Bydureon in 2013. We  
also recorded an impairment reversal of 
$285 million on our intangible asset for 
olaparib following commencement of the 
first of several Phase III clinical programmes 
for this asset. We are satisfied that the 
carrying values of our intangible assets  
as at 31 December 2013 are fully justified 
by estimated future cash flows. The 
accounting for our intangible assets, 
including details of our arrangements  
with Merck and our collaboration with  
BMS on Amylin products, is fully explained 
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements  
from page 150. 
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in impairment 
testing of intangible assets are included  
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements. 
Litigation
In the normal course of business, 
contingent liabilities may arise from 
product-specific and general legal 
proceedings, from guarantees or from 
environmental liabilities connected with our 
current or former sites. Where we believe 
that potential liabilities have a less than 50% 
probability of crystallising, or where we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of 
the liability, we treat them as contingent 
liabilities. These are not provided for but  
are disclosed in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 176.
In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines  
and penalties have been assessed and 
which are not subject to appeal (or other 
similar forms of relief), or where a loss  
is probable (more than 50% assessed 
probability) and we are able to make a 
reasonable estimate of the loss, we indicate 
the loss absorbed or the amount of the 
provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is 
more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare 
circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim 
are charged to profit as they are incurred. 
Where it is considered that the Group has  
a valid contract which provides the right  
to reimbursement (from insurance or 
otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part  
of any loss incurred or for which a provision 
has been established and we consider 
recovery to be virtually certain, then the 
best estimate of the amount expected  
to be received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets and of the 
amounts concerned usually involve a series 
of complex judgements about future events 
and can rely heavily on estimates and 
assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that  
the provisions recorded are adequate 
based on currently available information 
and that the insurance recoveries recorded 
will be received. However, given the 
inherent uncertainties involved in assessing 
the outcomes of these cases and in 
estimating the amount of the potential 
losses and the associated insurance 
recoveries, we could in future periods incur 
judgments or insurance settlements that 
could have a material adverse effect on  
our results in any particular period.
The position could change over time, and 
there can, therefore, be no assurance that 
any losses that result from the outcome of 
any legal proceedings will not exceed the 
amount of the provisions that have been 
booked in the accounts.
Although there can be no assurance 
regarding the outcome of legal 
proceedings, we do not currently expect 
them to have a material adverse effect  
on our financial position, but they could 
significantly affect our financial results  
in any particular period.
Post-retirement benefits
We offer post-retirement benefit plans 
which cover many of our employees around 
the world. In keeping with local terms and 
conditions, most of these plans are ‘defined 
contribution’ in nature, where the resulting 
income statement charge is fixed at a set 
level or is a set percentage of employees’ 
pay. However, several plans, mainly in the 
UK (which has by far the largest single 
scheme), the US and Sweden, are defined 
benefit plans where benefits are based  
on employees’ length of service and final 
salary (typically averaged over one, three or 
five years). The UK and US defined benefit 
schemes were closed to new entrants in 
2000. All new employees in these countries 
are offered defined contribution schemes. 
As detailed in the Group Accounting 
Policies section of the Financial Statements 
from page 136, the Group adopted the 
amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ 
in 2013. We continue to recognise all 
actuarial gains and losses immediately 
through Other comprehensive income. 
Investment decisions in respect of defined 
benefit schemes are based on underlying 
actuarial and economic circumstances with 
the intention of ensuring that the schemes 
have sufficient assets to meet liabilities as 
they fall due, rather than meeting accounting 
requirements. The trustees follow a strategy 
of awarding mandates to specialist, active 
investment managers, which results in a 
broad diversification of investment styles 
and asset classes. The investment 
approach is intended to produce less 
volatility in the plan asset returns.
In assessing the discount rate applied to

AA corporate bonds with durations 
corresponding to the maturities of those 
obligations, except in Sweden where we 
have used rates on mortgage bonds as  
the market in high quality corporate bonds 
is insufficiently deep.

Strategic Report | Financial Review In all cases, the pension costs recorded  
in the Financial Statements are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries, but require the exercise 
of significant judgement in relation to 
assumptions for long-term price inflation 
and, future salary and pension increases.
Further details of our accounting for 
post-retirement benefit plans are included 
in Note 18 to the Financial Statements  
from page 159.
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to tax audit issues  
and exposures. Amounts accrued are 
based on management’s interpretation  
of country-specific tax law and the 
likelihood of settlement. Tax benefits are  
not recognised unless the tax positions  
are probable of being sustained. Once 
considered to be probable, management 
reviews each material tax benefit to assess 
whether a provision should be taken 
against full recognition of the benefit on  
the basis of potential settlement through 
negotiation and/or litigation. All such 
provisions are included in current liabilities. 
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax 
liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer 
pricing audits in jurisdictions around the 
world and, in some cases, is in dispute with 
the tax authorities. These disputes usually 
result in taxable profits being increased  
in one territory and correspondingly 
decreased in another. Our balance sheet 
positions for these matters reflect 
appropriate corresponding relief in the 
territories affected.
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in determining our 
recorded liability for transfer pricing audits 
and other tax contingencies are included in 
the Tax section of Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements on page 183.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404
As a consequence of our NYSE listing, 
AstraZeneca is required to comply with 
those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
applicable to foreign issuers. Section 404  
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies annually to assess and make 
public statements about the quality and 
effectiveness of their internal control over 
financial reporting. As regards Sarbanes-
Oxley Act Section 404, our approach is 
based on the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations (COSO) 1992 framework. 
Our approach to the assessment has  
been to select key transaction and financial 
reporting processes in our largest operating 
units and a number of specialist areas, 
such as financial consolidation and 
reporting, treasury operations and taxation, 
so that, in aggregate, we have covered a 
significant proportion of each of the key line 
items in our Financial Statements. Each of 
these operating units and specialist areas 
has ensured that its relevant processes and 
controls are documented to appropriate 
standards, taking into account, in particular, 
the guidance provided by the SEC. We 
have also reviewed the structure and 
operation of our ‘entity level’ control 
environment. This refers to the overarching 
control environment, including structure  
of reviews, checks and balances that are 
essential to the management of a 
well-controlled business.
The Directors have concluded that our 
internal control over financial reporting is 
effective at 31 December 2013 and the 
assessment is set out in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting on page 
127 . KPMG Audit Plc has audited the 
effectiveness of our internal control over 
financial reporting at 31 December 2013 
and, as noted in the Auditor’s Reports  
on the Financial Statements and on  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
(Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404) on page 
128, their report is unqualified.

87 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 This Corporate Governance 
Report describes how the Group 
is organised, including the overall 
structure and principal roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, its 
Committees and the SET.
Board composition
The membership of the Board at  
31 December 2013 and information about 
individual Directors is contained in the Board 
of Directors section on pages 28 and 29.
Corporate governance
We have prepared this Annual Report with 
reference to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code published by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) in September 
2012. This Corporate Governance Report 
(together with other sections of this Annual 
Report) describes how we apply the main 
principles of good governance in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have 
complied throughout the accounting period 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which is available on  
the FRC’s website, www.frc.co.uk.
Leadership and responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and CEO are  
split. Leif Johansson, our Non-Executive 
Chairman, is responsible for leadership of 
the Board. Our CEO, Pascal Soriot, leads 
the SET and has executive responsibility for 
running our business. The Board comprises 
10 Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors 
– the CEO, Pascal Soriot, and the CFO,  
Marc Dunoyer.
All Directors are collectively responsible for 
the success of the Group. In addition, the 
Non-Executive Directors are responsible  
for exercising independent, objective 
judgement in respect of Board decisions, 
and for scrutinising and challenging 
management. The Non-Executive Directors 
also have various responsibilities concerning 
the integrity of financial information, internal 
controls and risk management.
The Board conducts an annual review  
of the Group’s overall strategy. The CEO,  
the CFO and the SET take the lead in 
developing our strategy, which is then 
reviewed, constructively challenged and 
approved by the Board.
John Varley, who joined the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director in 2006, was 
appointed as our Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director in April 2012.  
The role of the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director is to provide a 
sounding board for the Chairman and  
to serve as an intermediary for the other 
Directors when necessary. The Senior 
independent Non-Executive Director is  
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman or Executive Directors 
has failed to resolve, or for which such 
contact is inappropriate. 
There are four principal Board Committees: 
the Audit Committee; the Remuneration 
Committee; the Nomination and Governance 
Committee; and the Science Committee. 
The membership and work of these 
Committees is described below. In addition, 
there may from time to time be constituted 
ad hoc Board Committees for specific 
projects or tasks. In these cases, the scope 
and responsibilities of the Committee are 
documented. The Board provides adequate 
resources to enable each Committee to 
undertake its duties.
Reserved matters and delegation  
of authority
The Board maintains and periodically 
reviews a list of matters that are reserved  
to, and can only be approved by, the Board. 
These include: the appointment, termination 
and remuneration of any Director; approval 
of the annual budget; approval of any item 
of fixed capital expenditure or any proposal 
for the acquisition or disposal of an 
investment or business which exceeds  
$150 million; the raising of capital or loans 
by the Company (subject to certain 
exceptions); the giving of any guarantee  
in respect of any borrowing of the Company; 
and allotting shares of the Company.  
The matters that have not been expressly 
reserved to the Board are either delegated 
by the Board to its Committees or to  
the CEO.
The CEO is responsible to the Board  
for the management, development and 
performance of our business for those 
matters in respect of which he has been 
delegated authority from the Board. 
Although the CEO retains full responsibility 
for the authority delegated to him by  
the Board, he has established, and chairs, 
the SET, which is the vehicle through which 
he exercises that authority in respect of  
our business.
The roles of the Board, the Board 
Committees, the Chairman and the CEO 
are documented, as are the Board’s 
reserved powers and delegated authorities.
Operation of the Board 
The Board is responsible for setting our 
strategy and policies, oversight of risk  
and corporate governance, and monitors 
progress towards meeting our objectives 
and annual plans. The Board discharges 
these responsibilities through a programme

Corporate Governance Board effectiveness
Composition of the Board,  
succession planning and diversity
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee and, where appropriate, the full 
Board, regularly review the composition of 
the Board and the status of succession to 
both senior executive management and 
Board-level positions. Directors have regular 
contact with, and access to, succession 
candidates for senior executive 
management positions.
The Board aims to maintain a balance  
in terms of the range of experience and 
skills of individual Board members, which 
includes relevant international business, 
pharmaceutical industry and financial 
experience, as well as appropriate scientific 
and regulatory knowledge. The biographies 
of Board members set out on pages 28  
and 29 give more information about current 
Directors in this respect. The Board views 
As part of the business of each Board 
meeting, the CEO typically submits a 
progress report, giving details of business 
performance and progress against the 
goals the Board has approved. To ensure 
that the Board has good visibility of the  
key operating decisions of the business, 
members of the SET attend Board meetings 
on a regular basis and Board members 
meet other senior executives throughout the 
year. The Board also receives accounting 
and other management information about 
our resources, and presentations from 
internal and external speakers on legal, 
governance and regulatory developments. 
At the end of Board meetings, the 
Non-Executive Directors meet without the 
Executive Directors present to review and 
discuss any matters that have arisen during 
the meeting and/or such other matters as 
may appear to the Non-Executive Directors 
to be relevant in properly discharging their 
duty to act independently.
of meetings that includes regular reviews of 
financial performance and critical business 
issues, and the formal annual strategy 
review day. The Board also aims to ensure 
that a good dialogue with our shareholders 
is maintained and that their issues and 
concerns are understood and considered.
The Board held 11 meetings in 2013, 
including its usual annual strategy review. 
Four of those meetings were telephone  
(or, in one case, videoconference) meetings, 
some convened at short notice, at which 
business development transactions were 
discussed and approved. All of the meetings 
held in person took place in London, UK 
with the exception of the meeting in July 
2013, which took place at MedImmune’s 
site in Cambridge, UK, and the meeting  
in September 2013, which took place  
at MedImmune’s site in Gaithersburg, 
Maryland, US. The Board is currently 
scheduled to meet six times in 2014,  
and will meet at such other times as  
may be required to conduct business.

“ It is my role as Chairman to lead 
the Board effectively. To my mind, 
good governance is at the heart 
of that.”  gender, nationality and cultural diversity 
among Board members as important 
considerations when reviewing the 
composition of the Board. The Board 
recognises, in particular, the importance  
of gender diversity. Currently, 30% of the 
Company’s Non-Executive Directors are 
women and they make up 25% of the full 
Board. Since the formation of AstraZeneca 
in 1999, the proportion of female Board 
members has been approximately 25%. 
Although it has not set any specific 
measurable objectives, the Board intends  
to continue with its current approach to 
diversity in all its aspects, while at the same 
time seeking Board members of the highest 
calibre, and with the necessary experience 
and skills to meet the needs of the Company 
and its shareholders. Information about our 
approach to diversity in the organisation 
below Board-level can be found in the 
Employees section from page 66. 
The following changes to the composition  
of the Board have occurred during the 
period covered by this Annual Report:
 > Simon Lowth served as an Executive 
Director and CFO until 31 October 2013 
when he left the Company 
 > Marc Dunoyer was appointed as an 
Executive Director and as CFO with  
effect from 1 November 2013.
Independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors
During 2013, the Board considered the 
independence of each Non-Executive 
Director for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the 
corporate governance listing standards  
of the NYSE (Listing Standards). With the 
exception of Marcus Wallenberg, the Board 
considers that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. Leif Johansson 
was considered by the Board to be 
independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation 
to the Chairman after his appointment.
Marcus Wallenberg was appointed as  
a Director of Astra in May 1989 and 
subsequently became a Director of the 
Company in 1999. He is a Non-Executive 
Director of Investor AB, which has a 4.09% 
interest in the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 31 January 2014. A number 
of Wallenberg charitable foundations have 
connections to Mr Wallenberg and to 
Investor AB. For these reasons, the Board 
does not believe that he can be determined 
independent under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. However, the Board 
believes that he has brought, and continues 
to bring, considerable business experience 
and makes a valuable contribution to the 
work of the Board. In April 2010, he was 
appointed as a member of the Science 
Committee, reflecting his interest in 
innovation and R&D, knowledge of the 
history of the Company and its scientific 
heritage and culture, and his broad 
experience of other industries and 
businesses in which innovation and R&D  
are important determinants of success.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles enable the Directors to 
authorise any situation in which a Director 
has an interest that conflicts or has the 
potential to conflict with the Company’s 
interests and which would otherwise be  
a breach of the Director’s duty, under section 
175 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board 
has a formal system in place for Directors to 
declare such situations to be considered  
for authorisation by those Directors who 
have no interest in the matter being 
considered. In deciding whether to 
authorise a situation, the non-conflicted 
Directors must act in the way they consider, 
in good faith, would be most likely to 
promote the success of the Company, and 
they may impose limits or conditions when 
giving the authorisation, or subsequently,  
if they think this is appropriate. Situations 
considered by the Board and authorisations 
given are recorded in the Board minutes 
and in a register of conflicts maintained  
by the Company Secretary, and are 
reviewed annually by the Board. The Board 
considers that this system continues to 
operate effectively.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance Committee 
section on page 93 gives information about 
the appointment process for new Directors.
Newly appointed Directors are provided  
with comprehensive documentation 
containing information about the Group  
and their role as Non-Executive Directors. 
They also typically attend tailored induction 
programmes that take account of their 
individual skills and experience.
Time commitment
Our expectation is that Non-Executive 
Directors should be prepared to commit  
15 days a year, as an absolute minimum,  
to the Group’s business. In practice, Board 
members’ time commitment exceeds this 
minimum expectation when all the work that

contribution to the work of the Board  
and personal development needs were 
considered. Each Director continues to 
perform effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to their role. In addition,  
led by the Senior independent Non-
Executive Director, the other Non-Executive 
Directors (absent the Chairman) evaluated 
the performance of the Chairman. The 
Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees led reviews relating to their 
Committees. It was concluded that both 
Committees are operating effectively.
The Board’s annual performance evaluation 
was last externally facilitated in 2011. The 
Board intends to continue to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
guidance that the evaluation should be 
externally facilitated at least every three 
years and expects to commission an 
externally-facilitated review in 2014.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Article 66 of the  
Articles, all Directors retire at each AGM  
and may offer themselves for re-election  
by shareholders. Accordingly, all of the 
Directors will retire at the AGM in April 2014. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those 
Directors seeking re-election.
Accountability
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for  
our system of internal controls and risk 
management policies and is also 
responsible for reviewing their effectiveness. 
During 2013, the Directors continued to 
review the effectiveness of our system of 
The Company maintained Directors’  
and Officers’ Liability Insurance cover 
throughout 2013. The Directors are also 
able to obtain independent legal advice  
at the expense of the Company, as 
necessary, in their capacity as Directors.
The Company has entered into a deed of 
indemnity in favour of each Board member 
since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are 
still in force and provide that the Company 
shall indemnify the Directors to the fullest 
extent permitted by law and the Articles,  
in respect of all losses arising out of, or  
in connection with, the execution of their 
powers, duties and responsibilities, as 
Directors of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries. This is in line with current 
market practice and helps us attract and 
retain high-quality, skilled Directors.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducted an annual evaluation 
of its performance and that of individual 
Directors in respect of 2013. The evaluation 
involved a series of discussions between  
the Chairman and individual Directors. The 
themes arising from these discussions were 
considered at the Board meeting held in 
February 2014. A number of areas were 
reviewed, including the size and composition 
of the Board; Board processes and support; 
the content of Board agendas; and how the 
Board approached strategy, governance 
and succession planning. Some 
improvements to ways of working were 
proposed but overall the Board was 
considered to be operating effectively.  
As part of each Director’s individual 
they undertake for the Group is considered, 
particularly in the case of the Chairman of 
the Board and the Chairmen of the Board 
Committees. As well as their work in relation 
to formal Board and Board Committee 
meetings, the Non-Executive Directors  
also commit time throughout the year to 
meetings and telephone calls with various 
levels of executive management, visits to 
AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the world 
and, for new Non-Executive Directors, 
induction sessions and site visits.
On occasions when a Director is 
unavoidably absent from a Board or Board 
Committee meeting, for example where  
a meeting clashes with his or her existing 
commitments, he or she still receives and 
reviews the papers for the meeting and 
typically provides verbal or written input 
ahead of the meeting, usually through the 
Chairman of the Board or the Chairman  
of the relevant Board Committee, so that  
his or her views are made known and 
considered at the meeting. In addition,  
given the nature of the business to be 
conducted, some Board meetings are 
convened at short notice, which can make 
it difficult for some Directors to attend due  
to prior commitments.
Information and support
The Company Secretary is responsible  
to the Chairman for ensuring that all  
Board and Board Committee meetings  
are properly conducted, that the Directors 
receive appropriate information prior  
to meetings to enable them to make an 
effective contribution, and that governance 
requirements are considered and 
implemented.

level internal control processes. These 
reviews have included an assessment of 
internal controls and, in particular, financial, 
operational and compliance controls, and 
risk management and their effectiveness, 
supported by management assurance of 
the maintenance of controls reports from  
IA, as well as the external auditor on matters 
identified in the course of its statutory audit 
work. The system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable (not necessarily 
absolute) assurance of effective operation 
and compliance with laws and regulations.
Underpinning these reviews is an annual 
‘letter of assurance’ process by which 
responsible managers confirm the adequacy 
of their systems of internal financial and 
non-financial controls, their compliance  
with Group policies and relevant laws  
and regulations (including the industry’s 
regulatory requirements), and that they have 
reported any control weaknesses through 
our ‘continuous assurance’ process.
The internal control framework was in 
operation throughout 2013 and continues  
to operate up to the date of the approval  
of this Annual Report. The Directors believe 
that the Group maintains an effective, 
embedded system of internal controls  
and complies with the FRC’s guidance 
entitled ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
to Directors’ (formerly referred to as the 
Turnbull Report guidance) and, in the view 
of the Directors, no significant deficiencies 
have been identified in the system.
Further information about the ways in which 
we manage our business risks is set out in 
the Risk section from page 199, which also 
contains a list of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that we face.
Remuneration
Information about our approach to 
remuneration and the role and work of the 
Remuneration Committee, including our 
policy on executive remuneration, is set  
out in the Governance and Remuneration 
section from page 26 and in more detail  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
from page 102.
Relations with shareholders
In our financial and business reporting to 
shareholders and other interested parties by 
means of quarterly, half-yearly and annual 
reports, we aim to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of our strategy, 
financial position and prospects.
We make information about the Group 
available to shareholders through a range  
of media, including our corporate website, 
www.astrazeneca.com, containing a  
wide range of data of interest to institutional 
and private investors. We consider our 
website to be an important means of 
communication with our shareholders. 
The Company has been authorised  
by shareholders to place shareholder 
communications (such as the Notice  
of AGM and this Annual Report) on the 
corporate website in lieu of sending paper 
copies to shareholders (unless specifically 
requested). While recognising and 
respecting the fact that some of our 
shareholders may have different preferences 
about how they receive information from  
us, we will continue to promote the benefits 
of electronic communication given the 
advantages that this has over traditional 
paper-based communications, both in 
terms of the configurability and accessibility 
of the information provided and the 
consequent cost savings and reduction  
in environmental impact. 
We have frequent discussions with 
institutional shareholders on a range  
of issues. In December 2013, we held  
a meeting with a number of our major 
shareholders which was attended by the 
Chairman of the Board, Leif Johansson;  
the Chairman of the Audit Committee,  
Rudy Markham; and the Chairman of  
the Remuneration Committee and Senior 
independent Non-Executive Director,  
John Varley. At the meeting we outlined our 
approach to some of the more substantive 
components of our remuneration policy and 
also had the opportunity to discuss matters 
of relevance to the Audit Committee.  
In addition to holding discussions with 
groups of shareholders, we also hold 
individual meetings with some of our largest 
institutional shareholders to seek their views. 
Board members are kept informed of any 
issues, and receive regular reports and 
presentations from executive management 
and our brokers in order to assist them  
to develop an understanding of major 
shareholders’ views about the Group.  
From time to time, we conduct an audit  
of institutional shareholders to ensure  
that we are communicating clearly with 
them and that a high quality dialogue  
is being maintained. The results of this  
audit are reported to, and discussed by,  
the full Board.
We also respond to individual ad hoc 
requests for discussions from institutional 
shareholders and analysts. Our Investor 
Relations team acts as the main point of 
contact for investors throughout the year.  
As discussed above, the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director, John Varley, is  
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, CEO and/or CFO 
has failed to resolve, or in relation to  
which such contact is inappropriate. All 
shareholders, including private investors, 
have an opportunity at the AGM to put 
questions to members of the Board about 
our operation and performance. Formal 
notification of the AGM is sent to 
shareholders at least one month in advance. 
The Board ordinarily attends the AGM to 
answer questions raised by shareholders.  
In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, details of proxy voting by shareholders, 
including votes withheld, are given at the 
AGM and are posted on our website 
following the AGM.
Audit Committee 
The principal role of the Audit Committee  
is to provide assurance to the Board in  
the following areas: the integrity of our 
financial reporting and internal controls  
over financial matters; our internal controls 
over non-financial matters, compliance  
with laws and our Code of Conduct; the 
Company’s relationship with its external 
auditor; and the appropriateness of the 
Company’s risk management framework;  
in each case with the ultimate aim of 
protecting our shareholders’ interests.  
For more information, please see the  
Audit Committee Report from page 98.
Remuneration Committee
The principal role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to consider and set, on behalf 
of the Board, the remuneration (including 
pension rights and compensation payments) 
of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives. It also considers and sets  
the remuneration of the Chairman, in 
conjunction with the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and in the absence 
of the Chairman. No Director is involved in 
deciding his or her own remuneration.  
More information is set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 102.

Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 The Science Committee met two times  
in person in 2013, in Mölndal, Sweden  
and in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US,  
and held four other meetings, the majority  
of which were by telephone, to review 
specific business development or 
acquisition proposals. 
The Science Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com.
US corporate governance 
requirements
Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE and, 
accordingly, we are subject to the reporting 
and other requirements of the SEC 
applicable to foreign private issuers. Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies to include in their annual report 
on Form 20-F filed with the SEC, a report  
by management stating its responsibility for 
establishing internal control over financial 
reporting and to assess annually the 
effectiveness of such internal control.  
We have complied with those provisions  
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to 
foreign private issuers. The Board continues 
to believe that the Group has a sound 
corporate governance framework, good 
processes for the accurate and timely 
reporting of its financial position and results 
of operations, and an effective and robust 
system of internal controls. We have 
established a Disclosure Committee,  
further details of which can be found in the 
Disclosure Committee section overleaf.
The Directors’ assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over  
financial reporting is set out in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting section  
in the Financial Statements on page 127 .
We are required to disclose any significant 
ways in which our corporate governance 
practices differ from those followed by US 
companies under the Listing Standards.  
In addition, we must comply fully with the 
provisions of the Listing Standards relating 
to the composition, responsibilities and 
operation of audit committees, applicable  
to foreign private issuers. These provisions 
incorporate the rules concerning audit 
committees implemented by the SEC under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have reviewed 
the corporate governance practices 
required to be followed by US companies 
under the Listing Standards and our 
corporate governance practices are 
generally consistent with those standards.
Neither MWM Consulting nor The Zygos 
Partnership has any other connection to  
the Company. Spencer Stuart undertakes 
executive search assignments for the 
Company periodically.
The individual attendance record of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee’s 
members is set out on page 91.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.
Science Committee
The Science Committee’s core role is to 
provide assurance to the Board regarding 
the quality, competitiveness and integrity  
of the Group’s R&D activities by way of 
meetings and dialogue with our R&D 
leaders and other scientist employees;  
visits to our R&D sites throughout the world; 
and review and assessment of: 
 > the approaches we adopt in respect  
of our chosen therapy areas 
 > the scientific technology and R&D 
capabilities we deploy 
 > the decision-making processes for R&D 
projects and programmes
 > the quality of our scientists, their career 
opportunities and talent development
 > benchmarking against industry and 
scientific best practice, where 
appropriate.
The Science Committee periodically reviews 
important bioethical issues that we face, 
and assists in the formulation of, and agrees 
on behalf of the Board, appropriate policies 
in relation to such issues. It may also 
consider, from time to time, future trends  
in medical science and technology. The 
Science Committee does not review 
individual R&D projects but does review  
on behalf of the Board the R&D aspects  
of specific business development or 
acquisition proposals and advises the  
Board on its conclusions.
During 2013, the members of the  
Science Committee, all of whom have a 
knowledge of, or an interest in, life sciences, 
were Nancy Rothwell (Chairman of the 
Science Committee), Geneviève Berger, 
Bruce Burlington and Marcus Wallenberg. 
The EVP , GMD; the EVP , IMED; and the 
EVP , MedImmune attended meetings  
of the Science Committee in 2013. The 
Vice-President, IMED Operations acts  
as secretary to the Science Committee.
Nomination and Governance 
Committee
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s role is to recommend to the 
Board any new Board appointments and  
to consider, more broadly, succession plans 
at Board level. It continually reviews the 
composition of the Board using a matrix that 
records the skills and experience of current 
Board members, comparing this with the 
desired skills and experience it believes  
are appropriate to the Company’s overall 
business and strategic needs, both now 
and in the future. Any decisions relating to 
the appointment of Directors are made by 
the entire Board based on the merits of  
the candidates and the relevance of their 
background and experience, measured 
against objective criteria, with care taken  
to ensure that appointees have enough  
time to devote to our business. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee also advises the Board 
periodically on significant developments in 
corporate governance and the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
During 2013, the Chairman of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
was Leif Johansson. The members  
of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee were Rudy Markham,  
Nancy Rothwell and John Varley. Each  
of them is a Non-Executive Director  
and considered independent by the  
Board. The Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the Nomination and 
Governance Committee.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee considers both planned  
and unplanned (unanticipated) succession 
scenarios and met four times in 2013. 
During the summer of 2013, the search  
firm Spencer Stuart was engaged to  
identify potential candidates for the  
position of Executive Director and CFO 
following Simon Lowth’s decision to  
leave the Company. A number of external 
candidates were identified although, 
ultimately, an internal candidate was 
preferred and the Nomination and 
Governance Committee recommended  
to the Board the appointment of Marc 
Dunoyer as an Executive Director and  
CFO. This appointment took effect on 
1 November 2013.
As part of routine succession planning 
during the year, the Nomination and 
Governance Committee also engaged 
MWM Consulting and The Zygos 
Partnership to assist it with searches for 
new Non-Executive Directors. This work  
is continuing.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
93 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Business organisation
Senior Executive Team
The CEO is responsible for establishing,  
and chairs, the SET. The SET normally 
meets once a month or as otherwise 
required by business need, to consider 
major business issues, and makes 
recommendations to the CEO. Typically,  
it also reviews, in advance of submission  
to the Board, those matters which are  
to be submitted to the Board for review  
and decision. 
In addition to the CEO, the CFO, the  
General Counsel, and the Chief Compliance 
Officer, the SET comprises nine EVPs 
representing: IMED; MedImmune; GMD; 
North America; International; Europe; GPPS; 
Operations & Information Services; and 
Human Resources & Corporate Affairs.  
The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to the SET.
Early Stage Product Committees 
(ESPCs) and Late Stage Product 
Committee (LSPC) 
The ESPCs and LSPC were established  
in 2013, replacing previous governance 
committees including the Portfolio 
Investment Board. 
Early Stage Product Committees 
The ESPCs are senior-level, cross-functional 
governance bodies with accountability for 
oversight of our early stage small molecule 
and biologics portfolio to Proof of Concept 
stage. The EVPs of our two biotech units, 
IMED and MedImmune, chair our ESPCs. 
The ESPCs seek to deliver a flow of 
products to GMD for Phase III development 
through to launch. The ESPCs also seek  
to maximise the value of our internal and 
external R&D investments through robust, 
transparent and well-informed decision-
making that drives business performance 
and accountability. 
Specifically, the ESPCs have responsibility 
for the following: 
 > approving early-stage investment 
decisions 
 > prioritising the R&D portfolio 
 > licensing activity for products in Phase I 
and earlier
 > delivering internal and external 
opportunities
 > reviewing allocation of R&D resources.
Late Stage Product Committee 
The LSPC is also a senior-level governance 
body, accountable for the quality of the 
portfolio post-Phase III investment decision. 
It was formed in early 2013, replacing three 
committees, in a move to streamline 
development project governance. Jointly 
chaired by the EVPs of GMD and GPPS, 
members include, as appropriate, members 
of the SET, including the CEO and the CFO, 
and members of the GMD and GPPS 
leadership teams.
The LSPC seeks to maximise the value  
of our investments in the late-phase 
portfolio, also ensuring well informed  
and robust decision making. Specific 
accountabilities include:
 > approval of the criteria supporting  
Proof of Concept
 > decision to invest in Phase III development 
based on agreement of commercial 
opportunity and our plans to develop  
the medicine
 > evaluation of the outcome of the 
development programme and decision  
to proceed to regulatory filing
 > decision to invest in life-cycle 
management activities for the late-  
phase assets
 > decision to invest in late-phase business 
development opportunities.
Disclosure Committee
Our disclosure policy provides a framework 
for the handling and disclosure of inside 
information and other information of interest 
to shareholders and the investment 
community. It also defines the role of the 
Disclosure Committee. The members of  
the Disclosure Committee in 2013 were:  
the CFO, who chaired the Disclosure 
Committee; the EVP , GMD (who is also  
the Company’s Chief Medical Officer);  
the General Counsel; the Vice-President, 
Global Communications; the Vice-President, 
Investor Relations; and the Vice-President, 
Group Financial Planning and Reporting. 
The Deputy Company Secretary acted  
as secretary to the Disclosure Committee. 
The Disclosure Committee meets regularly 
to assist and inform the decisions of the 
CEO concerning inside information and  
its disclosure. Periodically, it reviews our 
disclosure controls and procedures and  
its own operation as part of work carried  
out to enable management and the Board 
to assure themselves that appropriate 
processes are operating for our planned 
disclosures, such as our quarterly results 
announcements and scheduled investor 
relations events.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date  
of approval of this Annual Report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there  
is no relevant audit information of which  
the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that  
he or she ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
Compliance and Internal Audit Services 
(IA)
The role of the Global Compliance function 
is to manage and maintain the compliance 
programme infrastructure and to help 
embed a culture of ethics and integrity  
in the Group. Global Compliance works 
closely with IA, with whom it provides 
assurance reporting to the Audit Committee. 
During 2014, the Global Compliance 
function will continue to focus on ensuring 
the delivery of an aligned approach to 
compliance that addresses key risk areas 
across the business. Further information 
can be found in the Risk section from  
page 199.
Global Compliance provides direct 
assurance to the Audit Committee on 
matters concerning compliance issues, 
including the results of monitoring 
conducted by Global Compliance and  
an analysis of compliance breaches. 
Complementing this, IA carries out a range 
of audits that include compliance-related 
audits and reviews of the assurance 
activities of other Group assurance 
functions. The results from these activities 
are reported to the Audit Committee.
IA is an independent appraisal function that 
derives its authority from the Board through 
the Audit Committee. Its primary role is to 
provide reasonable and objective assurance 
to the Directors regarding the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s governance, 
risk management, and internal control 
processes in relation to the Group’s defined 
goals and objectives.

Distributions to shareholders –  
dividends for 2013
Details of our distribution policy are set out 
in the Financial Review on page 82 and 
Notes 20 and 21 to the Financial Statements 
on page 165. 
The Company’s dividends for 2013 of  
$2.80 (176.0 pence, SEK 18.33) per 
Ordinary Share amount to, in aggregate,  
a total dividend payment to shareholders  
of $3,461 million. Two of our employee 
share trusts, AstraZeneca Share Trust 
Limited and AstraZeneca Quest Limited, 
waived their right to a dividend on the 
Ordinary Shares that they hold and instead 
received a nominal dividend. 
A shareholders’ resolution was passed at 
the 2013 AGM authorising the Company  
to purchase its own shares. The Company 
did not repurchase any of its own shares  
in 2013.
Going concern accounting basis 
Information on the business environment  
in which AstraZeneca operates, including 
the factors underpinning the industry’s 
future growth prospects, is included in the 
Strategic Report. Details of the product 
portfolio of the Group are contained in both 
the Strategic Report (in the Therapy Area 
Review from page 48) and the Directors’ 
Report. Information on patent expiry dates 
for key marketed products is included in the 
Patent expiries section from page 198. Our 
approach to product development and our 
development pipeline are also covered in 
detail with additional information by Therapy 
Area in the Strategic Report.
The Code includes information on how  
to report possible violations, including 
through the AZethics telephone lines and 
www.AZethics.com. Anyone who raises  
a possible breach in good faith is fully 
supported by management. We take  
all alleged compliance breaches and 
concerns extremely seriously and 
investigate them and report the outcome  
of such investigations to the Audit 
Committee, as appropriate. 
In 2013, 149 reports of alleged compliance 
breaches or other ethical concerns were 
made via telephone, the AZethics website, 
or the Global Compliance email or postal 
addresses described in the Code. In 2012, 
the number of reports through equivalent 
channels was 194. This decrease is in  
the context of a significant increase in 
management and self-reporting of 
compliance incidents, which can be seen  
as an indication that employees are more 
comfortable in raising their concerns with 
line managers, local HR, Legal or 
Compliance, as recommended in the Code 
and reinforced in the 2013 Code training.
Our Global Policies supplement the Code. 
They provide clear and comprehensive 
guidance in key ethical, compliance and 
corporate responsibility risk areas.
Other matters
Corporate governance statement under 
the UK Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules (DTR)
The disclosures that fulfil the requirements 
of a corporate governance statement under 
the DTR can be found in this section and in 
other parts of this Annual Report as listed 
below, each of which is incorporated into 
this section by reference:
 > significant holders of the Company’s 
shares 
 > Articles 
 > amendments to the Articles. 
Further information on the above can be 
found in the Shareholder Information section 
from page 225 and the Corporate 
Information section from page 230.
Subsidiaries and principal activities
The Company is the holding company  
for a group of subsidiaries whose principal 
activities are described in this Annual 
Report. Principal subsidiaries and their 
locations are given in the Principal 
Subsidiaries section in the Financial 
Statements on page 186.
IA seeks to discharge the responsibilities  
set down in its charter by reviewing: 
 > the processes for ensuring that key 
business risks are effectively managed
 > the financial and operational controls that 
help to ensure the Group’s assets are 
properly safeguarded from losses, 
including fraud
 > the controls that help to ensure the 
reliability and integrity of management 
information systems
 > the processes for ensuring compliance 
with policies and procedures, external 
legislation and regulation.
In addition to fulfilling its primary remit of 
assurance to the Audit Committee, IA  
may also evaluate specific operations  
at the request of the Audit Committee  
or management, as appropriate. 
Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct (the Code),  
which is available on our website,  
www.astrazeneca.com, applies worldwide 
to all full-time and part-time Directors, 
officers, employees and temporary staff, 
in all companies within our Group. A Group 
Finance Code of Conduct complements  
the Code. It applies to the CEO, the CFO, 
the Group’s principal accounting officers 
(including key Finance staff in major 
overseas subsidiaries) and all Finance 
function employees. This reinforces the 
importance of the integrity of the Group’s 
Financial Statements, the reliability of the 
accounting records on which they are 
based and the robustness of the relevant 
controls and processes.
The Code is at the core of our compliance 
programme. It has been translated into over 
40 languages and employees have access 
to an electronic copy. It provides clear 
direction as to how our commitment to 
honesty and integrity is to be realised in 
consistent actions across all areas of the 
business. Compliance with the Code is 
mandatory and every employee receives 
training on it. Every employee is required to 
comply with local laws and regulations, as 
well as applicable national and international 
codes. We always seek to operate at the 
highest of these various standards. The 
Code is reviewed periodically and updated 
to take account of changing legal and 
regulatory obligations. 
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
95 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 The financial position of the Group, its  
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial 
Review from page 74. In addition, Note 23  
to the Financial Statements from page 169 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital,  
its financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit, market and liquidity risk. Further 
details of the Group’s cash balances and 
borrowings are included in Notes 13 and 14 
to the Financial Statements from pages 155 
and 156.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources available. As at 31 December 
2013, the Group had $10.4 billion in financial 
resources (cash balances of $9.2 billion  
and undrawn committed bank facilities of 
$3.0 billion, which are available until April 
2017 , with only $1.8 billion of debt due within 
one year). The Group’s revenues are largely 
derived from sales of products that are 
covered by patents which provide a 
relatively high level of resilience and 
predictability to cash inflows, although  
our revenue is expected to continue to  
be significantly impacted by the expiry of 
patents over the medium term. In addition, 
recent government price interventions in 
response to budgetary constraints are 
expected to continue to adversely affect 
revenues in many of our mature markets. 
However, we anticipate new revenue 
streams from both recently launched 
medicines and products in development, 
and the Group has a wide diversity of 
customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas. Consequently, the 
Directors believe that, overall, the Group  
is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Changes in share capital 
Changes in the Company’s Ordinary  
Share capital during 2013, including details 
of the allotment of new shares under  
the Company’s share plans, are given in  
Note 20 to the Financial Statements from 
page 165.
Directors’ shareholdings 
The Articles require each Director to be  
the beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares  
in the Company with an aggregate nominal 
value of $125 (which currently represents  
at least 500 shares because each Ordinary 
Share has a nominal value of $0.25).  
Such holding must be obtained within  
two months of the date of the Director’s 
appointment. At 31 December 2013, all of 
the Directors complied with this requirement 
and full details of each Director’s interests  
in shares of the Company are set out in the 
Directors’ interests in shares section from 
page 110. Information about the 
shareholding expectations of the 
Remuneration Committee (in respect of 
Executive Directors and SET members) and 
the Board (in respect of Non-Executive 
Directors) is also set out in the Directors’ 
interests in shares section from page 110.
Political donations 
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries 
made any EU political donations or incurred 
any EU political expenditure in 2013 and 
they do not intend to do so in the future in 
respect of which shareholder authority is 
required, or for which disclosure in this 
Annual Report is required, under the 
Companies Act 2006. However, to enable 
the Company and its subsidiaries to 
continue to support interest groups or 
lobbying organisations concerned with  
the review of government policy or law 
reform without inadvertently breaching  
the Companies Act 2006, which defines 
political donations and other political 
expenditure in broad terms, a resolution  
will be put to shareholders at the 2014  
AGM, similar to that passed at the 2013 
AGM, to authorise the Company and its 
subsidiaries to: 
 > make donations to political parties or 
independent election candidates
 > make donations to political organisations 
other than political parties
 > incur political expenditure, up to an 
aggregate limit of $250,000.
Corporate political contributions in the  
US are permitted in defined circumstances 
under the First Amendment of the US 
Constitution and are subject to both federal 
and state laws and regulations. In 2013,  
the Group’s US legal entities made 
contributions amounting in aggregate to 
$1,147 ,950 (2012: $1,759,450) to national 
political organisations, state-level political 
party committees and to campaign 
committees of various state candidates.  
No corporate donations were made at the 
federal level and all contributions were made 
only where allowed by US federal and state 
law. We publicly disclose details of our 
corporate US political contributions, which 
can be found at www.astrazeneca-us.com/
responsibility/transparency. The annual 
corporate contributions budget is reviewed 
and approved by the Deputy General 
Counsel, North America, the US Vice-
President, Corporate Affairs and the 
President of our US business to ensure 
robust governance and oversight. US 
citizens or individuals holding valid green 
cards exercised decision making over  
the contributions and the funds were not 
provided or reimbursed by any non-US legal 
entity. Such contributions do not constitute 
political donations or political expenditure for 
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 
and were made without any involvement  
of persons or entities outside the US. 
Significant agreements
There are no significant agreements to 
which the Company is a party that take 
effect, alter or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover 
bid. There are no persons with whom we 
have contractual or other arrangements, 
who are deemed by the Directors to be 
essential to our business. 
Use of financial instruments 
The Notes to the Financial Statements, 
including Note 23 (from page 169), include 
further information on our use of financial 
instruments.
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s AGM will be held on  
24 April 2014. The meeting place will be  
in London, UK. A Notice of AGM will be sent 
to all registered holders of Ordinary Shares 
and, where requested, to the beneficial 
holders of shares.

Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report External auditor 
A resolution will be proposed at the AGM  
on 24 April 2014 for the appointment of 
KPMG LLP as auditor of the Company, 
following a decision to wind down the 
Company’s current external auditor, KPMG 
Audit Plc, as part of a KPMG Group internal 
reorganisation. The external auditor has 
undertaken various non-audit work for us 
during 2013. More information about this 
work and the audit and non-audit fees that 
we have paid are set out in Note 27 to the 
Financial Statements on page 184. The 
external auditor is not engaged by us to 
carry out any non-audit work in respect  
of which it might, in the future, be required 
to express an audit opinion. As explained 
more fully in the Audit Committee section 
from page 98, the Audit Committee has 
established pre-approval policies and 
procedures for audit and non-audit work 
permitted to be carried out by the external 
auditor and has carefully monitored the 
objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor throughout 2013.
Directors’ Report 
The Directors’ Report, which has been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
comprises the following sections:
 > Corporate Governance Report
 > Audit Committee Report
 > Development Pipeline
 > Responsible Business 
 > Shareholder Information
 > Corporate Information
and has been signed on behalf of the

Audit Committee 
Report
Rudy Markham 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear shareholder
The principal duties of the Audit 
Committee are to provide 
assurance to the Board on: 
>  the integrity of our financial 
reporting and internal controls 
over financial matters
>  our internal controls over 
non-financial matters, 
compliance with laws and  
our Code of Conduct 
>  the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor
>  the role, resources and 
effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function
>  the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management 
framework
in each case with the ultimate 
aim of protecting our 
shareholders’ interests. 
In this Audit Committee Report, we describe 
the work of the Audit Committee during the 
year and highlight the significant issues it 
considered. In 2013, our focus was on 
sound financial reporting and compliance 
with our Code of Conduct, which are 
considered below.
Financial reporting
Robust financial reporting is underpinned by 
well designed internal controls, appropriate 
accounting practices and policies, and 
good judgement. The Audit Committee 
reviews, at least quarterly, the Company’s 
significant accounting matters and, where 
appropriate, challenges management’s 
decisions. In 2013, against a backdrop of 
revenue decline, one of the significant issues 
at the forefront of the Audit Committee’s 
deliberations was revenue recognition.  
In addition, the annual impairment review  
of intangible assets was another significant 
matter which came before the Audit 
Committee. Considering the quantum and 
appropriateness of the partial impairment  
of our diabetes asset, Bydureon, rights to 
which we acquired when we extended our 
diabetes collaboration with BMS in 2012, 
was a key aspect of our review. The Audit 
Committee also requested and received 
information about the then current business 
case associated with the extended BMS 
collaboration in order to understand, more 
fully, the initial acquisition business case and 
to test the robustness of the Company’s 
processes in respect of investment 
decisions. This review by the Audit Committee 
informed the Board’s decision to support 
the acquisition of BMS’s 50% share of  
the joint diabetes business, which was 
announced at the end of the year and  
which was completed on 1 February 2014.
In addition to IP litigation, which is a  
feature of the pharmaceutical industry,  
the Group is involved in a number of 
government investigations and is a 
defendant in certain product liability actions. 
The Audit Committee receives a regular 
update from the General Counsel on the 
status of those litigation matters which 
might result in fines or damages awards 
against the Group, in order to assess 
whether provisions should be taken and  
if so, when and in what amounts.
Compliance with the Code of Conduct
The Audit Committee has oversight of  
the Company’s responsibilities under  
a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA)  
which is now in its fourth year. In addition  
to receiving quarterly updates from the  
US Compliance Officer on our compliance  
with the CIA, in 2013, members of the  
Audit Committee visited our US business. 
We met senior managers in sales and 
marketing, compliance and internal audit to 
satisfy ourselves that a compliance culture 
has become embedded in our business.
Compliance with our Code of Conduct in 
our Emerging Markets, particularly in Russia 
and China has also been a focus for the 
Audit Committee in 2013. During the course 
of the year, the Audit Committee received  
a report from the EVP of our International 
region, on the steps we are taking in those 
markets to ensure that we operate ethically 
and within the law. This update was  
in addition to reports from the Chief 
Compliance Officer on compliance in all 
areas of our business which we received 
and discussed with her each quarter.
In December 2013, I joined our Chairman 
and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee at a meeting with some of  
our major investors to hear their views  
on our remuneration policy and corporate 
governance generally. We value dialogue 
with our shareholders and welcome your 
feedback on this Audit Committee Report.
Yours sincerely
Rudy Markham 
Chairman of the Audit Committee  Audit Committee membership  
and attendance
The members of the Audit Committee are 
Rudy Markham (Chairman of the Audit 
Committee), Bruce Burlington, Graham 
Chipchase, Jean-Philippe Courtois and 
Shriti Vadera. They are all Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board considers each 
member to be independent under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and under  
the general guidance and specific criteria  
of the Listing Standards concerning the 
composition of audit committees applicable 
to non-US companies listed on the NYSE.  
In April 2013, we submitted the required 
annual written affirmation to the NYSE 
confirming our full compliance with those 
standards. For the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
remains satisfied that at least one member 
of the Audit Committee has recent and 
relevant financial experience. At its meeting 
in December 2013, the Board determined 
that Rudy Markham and Graham Chipchase 
are audit committee financial experts for the 
purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For 
further information regarding the experience 
of the Audit Committee members, see the 
Board of Directors section from page 28. 
The Deputy Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Audit Committee. 
Meetings of the Audit Committee are 
routinely attended by the CFO; the General 
Counsel; the Chief Compliance Officer;  
the Vice-President, IA; the Vice-President, 
Group Financial Planning and Reporting; 
and our external auditor. The CEO attends 
on an agenda-driven basis. In line with its 
normal practice, the Audit Committee also 
held a number of private meetings, without 
management present, with the Chief 
Compliance Officer; the General Counsel; 
the Vice-President, IA; and the Company’s 
external auditor. These meetings were held 
between Audit Committee members and 
those individuals, separately from the main 
sessions of the Audit Committee.
Number of meetings and attendance 
The Audit Committee held five scheduled 
meetings in 2013. The individual attendance 
record of members of the Audit Committee 
is set out in the Board and Board 
Committee meeting attendance in 2013 
table on page 91. Following each Audit 
Committee meeting, the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee reported to the Board 
on the principal matters covered at the 
meeting and minutes of the meetings  
were circulated to all Board members.  
In addition, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee held regular scheduled calls 
between Audit Committee meetings with 
each of the CFO; the Chief Compliance 
Officer; the Vice-President, IA; and the  
lead partner of the external auditor.
The Audit Committee is currently scheduled 
to meet five times in 2014 and will meet at 
such other times as may be required.

which it considers in accordance with its 
schedule at each quarterly meeting or in 
some cases, annually.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
99 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
“  In 2013, our focus was on sound 
financial reporting and compliance 
with our Code of Conduct.”  During 2013 and in February 2014, the Audit 
Committee considered and discussed the 
following standing items: 
 > The key elements of the Financial 
Statements, and the estimates and 
judgements contained in our financial 
disclosures. Various accounting matters 
were considered. These included the 
areas described in the Financial Review 
under the heading ‘Critical accounting 
policies and estimates’ (with a focus on 
accounting issues relevant to litigation 
and taxation matters and goodwill 
impairment) from page 83 and discussion 
was supported by papers prepared by 
management and the external auditor. 
 > The reports received from the external 
auditor concerning their audit of the 
Financial Statements of the Group and 
from management, IA, Global 
Compliance and the external auditor on 
the effectiveness of our system of internal 
controls and, in particular, our internal 
control over financial reporting. This 
included review and discussion of the 
results of the Group’s ‘continuous 
assurance’ and annual ‘letter of 
assurance’ processes. The Audit 
Committee also reviewed quarterly 
activity reports of audit work carried out 
by IA and the status of follow-up actions 
with management, as well as reports from 
Global Compliance.
 > The systems and processes that 
management has developed for risk 
identification, classification and mitigation.
 > Compliance with the applicable provisions 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In particular, 
the status of compliance with the 
programme of internal controls over 
financial reporting implemented pursuant 
to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley  
Act. The Audit Committee remained 
focused on IT controls in the context  
of the changes to the Group’s IT 
environment, described below. Further 
information about this is set out in  
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 
section on page 87 . 
 > Data about reports made by employees 
via the AZethics helpline, online facilities 
and other routes regarding potential 
breaches of the Code of Conduct, 
together with the results of inquiries  
into those matters.
 > Quarterly reports received from the US 
Compliance Officer responsible for 
monitoring the US business’ compliance 
with the CIA (for more information about 
the obligations imposed on the Board by 
the CIA, see below).
 > Reports from the Group Treasury function 
and, in particular, reports concerning the 
Group’s liquidity and cash position and 
the appropriateness of its cash 
management policies in the context of  
the current economic situation.
 > Going concern assessment and adoption 
of the going concern basis in preparing 
this Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements.
 > Other reports, on a quarterly basis, 
concerning IA, Global Compliance and 
Finance, including the internal audit plan 
and progress and plans of Global 
Compliance.
 > Quarterly reports from the General 
Counsel on the status of certain litigation 
matters and governmental investigations.
 > The amount of audit and non-audit fees of 
the external auditor throughout 2013. The 
Audit Committee was satisfied throughout 
the year that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor 
were not in any way impaired by the 
nature of the non-audit work undertaken 
by the external auditor during the year, the 
level of non-audit fees charged for such 
work or any other facts or circumstances. 
Further information about the audit and 
non-audit fees for 2013 is disclosed in 
Note 27 to the Financial Statements on 
page 184.
 > A review and assessment of the Audit 
Committee’s performance.
In addition to its usual business as 
described above, during 2013, members  
of the Audit Committee met individual 
managers or groups of managers on a 
number of occasions in order to gain a 
deeper insight into areas relevant to the 
Audit Committee’s work and to provide  
an opportunity to discuss specific areas  
of interest. These included: 
 > Receiving regular updates from  
the IT team in connection with the  
transition from AstraZeneca’s previous  
IT infrastructure outsourcing provider  
to its new providers. 
 > Considering a presentation on risk 
management in our supply chain, 
particularly in Emerging Markets. 
 > Receiving a report and presentation on 
sales and marketing compliance-related 
activities in China and Russia.
 > Considering and debating a risk 
management update and an audit 
simplification initiative proposed by 
management.
 > Understanding the nature of the cyber 
security threat to AstraZeneca and our 
approach to mitigating that risk.
 > Considering post-investment reviews  
of a recent major business development 
transaction, a capital expenditure project 
and a Phase III investment decision.
In addition to the quarterly reporting 
stipulated by the CIA as described above,  
a number of other obligations required by 
the CIA were discharged by members of  
the Board and the Audit Committee during 
2013. For example, all members of the 
Board completed the annual CIA-required 
training, addressing the Code of Conduct 
and the elements of the CIA and the US 
compliance programme. Furthermore, the 
Board adopted a resolution (signed by each 
Board member) in respect of the third  
12 month reporting period under the CIA. 
The resolution summarised the Board’s 
oversight of the US compliance programme 
and stated that, to the best of the Board’s 
knowledge, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals 
LP and AstraZeneca LP (AstraZeneca’s 
principal US trading entities) have 
implemented an effective US compliance 
programme to meet US federal healthcare 
programme, FDA and CIA requirements. 
Significant issues considered by the 
Audit Committee in 2013
The Audit Committee determined that the 
significant issues considered during the  
year were:
 > revenue recognition
 > impairment of intangible assets
 > litigation and contingent liabilities
 > pension accounting 
 > tax accounting.
Revenue recognition
The US is our largest single market and 
sales accounted for 37 .7% of our revenue  
in 2013. Revenue recognition, particularly  
in the US, is impacted by rebates, 
chargebacks, cash discounts and returns 
(for more information see the Financial 
Review from page 83). The Audit Committee 
pays particular attention to management’s 
estimates of these items, their analysis  
of any unusual movements and their  
impact on revenue recognition informed  
by commentary from the external auditor. 
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group has significant intangible assets 
arising from the acquisition of businesses 
and IP rights to medicines which are both  
in development and on the market. In his 
quarterly report to the Audit Committee,  
the CFO outlines the carrying value of the 
Group’s intangible assets and, in respect of 
those intangible assets which are identified 
as at risk of impairment, the difference 
between the carrying value and 
management’s current estimate of 
discounted future cash flows for ‘at risk’ 
products (the headroom). Products will  
be identified as at risk either because  
the headroom is limited or because, for 
example, in the case of a medicine in 
100 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Audit Committee Report development, a significant development 
milestone such as the publication of  
clinical trial results could significantly alter 
management’s forecasts for the product. 
The Audit Committee questioned 
management on the robustness of the 
processes underpinning the cash flow 
projections and the timing of the  
impairment reviews.
In December 2013, as part of the annual 
impairment review, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the management processes  
for estimating future cash flows, which 
resulted in the impairment of our diabetes 
product, Bydureon. The Audit Committee 
was satisfied that those processes were 
sufficiently robust.
Litigation and contingent liabilities
Litigation, particularly that relating to the 
enforcement and defence of IP rights 
protecting medicines, is a significant  
feature of the pharmaceutical industry.  
In addition to IP litigation, the Group is 
involved in a number of government 
investigations and is a defendant in  
certain product liability actions. The Audit 
Committee receives regular updates from 
the General Counsel, and is informed by 
commentary from the external auditor,  
on the status of those litigation matters 
which might result in fines or damages 
awards against the Company in order  
to assess whether provisions should be 
taken and if so, when and in what amounts.
Pension accounting
Pension accounting continues to be  
a significant area of focus. In 2013, the  
Audit Committee considered the adjustments 
associated with the application of  
IAS 19 (2011). 
Tax accounting
Although the Audit Committee recognised 
that there continues to be significant 
exposure associated with specific tax 
contingencies, it noted that there were no 
significant developments in this exposure 
during the year.
Internal controls
At the February 2014 meeting, the CFO 
presented to the Audit Committee the 
conclusions of the CEO and the CFO 
following the evaluation of the effectiveness 
of our disclosure controls and procedures 
required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F at 31 
December 2013. Based on their evaluation, 
the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as  
at that date, we maintain an effective system 
of disclosure controls and procedures.
There was no change in our internal control 
over financial reporting that occurred during 
the period covered by this Annual Report 
that has materially affected, or is reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.
Appointing the auditor and safeguards 
on non-audit services
We noted in our 2012 Annual Report that, 
having reviewed the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code with regard  
to putting the external audit contract out  
to tender at least every 10 years, and 
cognisant of the fact that the lead audit 
partner at KPMG rotated in 2013, the Audit 
Committee determined that the audit would 
be put out to tender by 2018, in accordance 
with the transitional guidance issued by the 
FRC. KPMG was first appointed as sole 
external auditor to AstraZeneca in 2001 
following a competitive tender. The new EU 
audit reform framework, if approved, would 
not impact upon the Audit Committee’s 
decision to put the audit out to tender  
by 2018.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee maintains a policy  
(the Non-Audit Services Policy) and 
procedures for the pre-approval of all audit 
services and permitted non-audit services 
undertaken by the external auditor, the 
principal purpose of which is to ensure that 
the independence of the external auditor is 
not impaired. The policies and procedures 
cover three categories of work: audit 
services; audit-related services; and tax 
services. The policies define the type of 
work that falls within each of these 
categories and the non-audit services that 
the external auditor is prohibited from 
performing under the rules of the SEC and 
other relevant UK and US professional and 
regulatory requirements. The pre-approval 
procedures permit certain audit, audit-
related and tax services to be performed  
by the external auditor during the year, 
subject to fee limits agreed with the Audit 
Committee in advance. The CFO (supported 
by the Vice-President, Financial Planning 
and Reporting) monitors the status of all 
services being provided by the external 
auditor. The procedures also deal with 
placing non-audit work out for tender, where 
appropriate. Authority to approve work  
in excess of the pre-agreed fee limits is 
delegated to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee together with one other  
Audit Committee member in the first 
instance. A standing agenda item at  
Audit Committee meetings covers the 
operation of the pre-approval procedures 
and regular reports are provided to the  
full Audit Committee. 
In 2013, non-audit services provided  
to the Company by KPMG included tax 
compliance services and audit services in 
relation to employee benefit funds, in each 
case within the scope of the pre-approved 
services set out in the Non-Audit Services 
Policy. The Audit Committee supports 
management’s decision to enter into an 
outsourcing arrangement for all tax and 
statutory accounts preparation work which, 
once implemented during 2013/2014,  
will result in such work currently undertaken 
by KPMG transitioning to another firm.  
In addition, for other non-audit services, 
management has determined that the 
Company’s auditors should only be 
engaged where they are the only credible 
choice of service provider for a particular 
piece of work. 
Fees paid to the auditor for audit, 
audit-related and other services are 
analysed in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 184. Fees for  
non-audit services amounted to 39%  
of the fees paid to KPMG for audit, 
audit-related and other services in 2013. 
Assessing external audit effectiveness
In accordance with its normal practice,  
the Audit Committee considered the 
performance of KPMG. It also considered 
KPMG’s compliance with the independence 
criteria under the relevant statutory, 
regulatory and ethical standards applicable 
to auditors and assessed its objectivity, 
taking into account the level of challenge 
provided around the critical estimates  
and judgements involved in our financial 
reporting and the quality of our internal 
control over financial reporting. Having 
considered all these factors, the Audit 
Committee unanimously recommended  
to the Board that a resolution for the 
re-appointment of KPMG as the Company’s 
external auditor for the year ending  
31 December 2014 be proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM in April 2014. 
Consistent with current market practice, 
KPMG’s services to the Company are 
provided pursuant to terms of engagement 
which are reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
Neither these terms of engagement nor any 
other agreement include any contractual 
obligations under which the Board would  
be prevented from appointing a different 
audit firm were they to consider this to be  
in the best interests of the Group. The  
Audit Committee, through management, 
continues to maintain contact and dialogue 
with other major audit firms who are familiar 
with the Group’s business for succession 
purposes as required.

Corporate Governance 
TSR and free cash flow. The Remuneration 
Committee determined that two additional 
measures should be added. First, the 
introduction of an Achieve Scientific 
Leadership measure, which, for awards 
granted in 2013, comprised: new molecular 
entities (NME) generation; major life-cycle 
management approvals; volume of NMEs  
in Phase III; peak-year sales to track the 
value of pipeline output; and Phase II starts. 
Second, we added a Return to Growth 
measure, which, for awards granted in 2013, 
was based on quantitative medium-term 
sales targets relating to the five growth 
platforms described in the strategy: Brilinta; 
diabetes; respiratory; Emerging Markets; 
and Japan. 
The Remuneration Committee also 
considered the performance conditions 
attaching to the AstraZeneca Incentive Plan 
(AZIP). For 2013, the two AZIP four-year 
performance hurdles were payment of a 
dividend equal to, or greater than, $2.80; 
and a dividend cover floor of 1.5 times EPS 
calculated on a Core basis. We believe that 
Core EPS provides the best indicator of 
cash cover for the dividend. The AZIP award 
is structured such that the performance test 
will be failed if either the dividend per share 
falls below $2.80, or if the dividend cover 
falls below the floor, in any of the years of 
the performance period.
When Pascal Soriot joined us, he forfeited  
a number of LTI awards made to him by  
his previous employer. The value of these 
awards was carefully quantified and an AZIP 
award made on his recruitment in October 
2012 formed part of the compensation for 
this loss. This AZIP award was underpinned 
by the ‘old’ performance measures. The 
Remuneration Committee wished to align 
Mr Soriot’s LTI arrangements to the new 
strategy. Therefore, the Remuneration 
Committee required Mr Soriot to forfeit his 
2012 AZIP award and substituted it with a 
2013 AZIP award based on the new metrics 
aligned to the new strategy, as described 
above. The 2013 award was over the same 
(target being 250%). You will see in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration (the 
Implementation Report) that his base pay 
has been increased (effective 1 January 
2014) by 3% in conformity with the base pay 
increase for the UK employee population; 
and that his defined contribution pension 
funding has been increased from 24% of 
base pay per annum to 30% of base pay 
per annum, which we believe to be more in 
line with current market practice for FTSE30 
CEOs. We have granted Marc Dunoyer an 
annualised bonus award for 2013 of 129% 
of base salary in respect of his service as 
CFO (on appointment to which he became 
an Executive Director). He has been granted 
an at-target LTI award of 200% of base 
salary. There is no change to his base salary 
or to his pension entitlement for 2014.
Whilst the outlook for 2014 in terms of 
scientific progress and pipeline strength  
is more promising, the commercial and 
financial challenges facing the business  
are likely to persist. These features have 
informed our setting of targets for 2014. 
The Remuneration Committee recognises 
the need to be thoughtful in structuring 
performance measures so that they are 
sufficiently stretching to stimulate value 
creation for shareholders, but not so 
stretching that incentivisation is weakened.
Key matters in 2013
In 2013, in light of our new strategy focused 
on scientific leadership and returning to 
growth, the Remuneration Committee  
took the opportunity to review the LTI 
arrangements for the Company’s senior 
executives. At the AGM in April 2013,  
and following consultation with our major 
shareholders, I shared with you changes to 
AstraZeneca’s LTI programme, which were 
developed in order more closely to align 
performance measures to the Company’s 
strategy, such that employees are rewarded 
for the delivery of the Company’s key 
strategic priorities. Prior to these changes, 
the Performance Share Plan (PSP) operated 
with two equal performance measures:  
Dear shareholder
We have sought, in our 
deliberations and judgements 
throughout 2013, to take  
account of both the underlying 
performance of AstraZeneca  
and the experience of our 
shareholders. 
In March 2013, our new CEO, Pascal Soriot, 
set out his strategy for achieving scientific 
leadership and returning the Company to 
growth. During 2013, a number of key 
strategic milestones were achieved. The 
acquisition of companies such as Pearl 
Therapeutics, Omthera, Amplimmune and 
Spirogen has bolstered our pipeline and 
strengthened our capabilities in each of our 
core therapy areas. They have also brought 
with them leading scientific innovations and 
talented scientists. Licensing agreements 
and strategic collaborations, such as our 
collaboration with FibroGen, have created 
further additions to the late-stage portfolio. 
However, we recognise that these 
achievements must be considered in the 
context of financial performance in 2013 
below that of 2011 and 2012. Whilst there 
has been growth across our five key 
commercial platforms, revenue and Core 
operating profit have declined with the loss 
of exclusivity on some of our principal 
marketed products. As expected, this has 
resulted in a fall in Core EPS. Our short-term 
TSR performance, however, has improved 
(including into 2014). 
How has this performance fed through  
into remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors? We believe that  
the new leadership team is having a 
substantial impact on the actual and  
future performance of the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee awarded Pascal 
Soriot an annual bonus for 2013 of 170% of 
base salary and an above target Long-Term 
Incentive (LTI) award of 285% of base salary 
Directors’

number of shares as the original award,  
and the four-year performance period and 
four-year holding period will continue to 
apply, which will result in Mr Soriot’s new 
award vesting one year later than the 
original award.
Looking forward
At our AGM in April 2014, we will seek  
your approval to renew the PSP plan rules, 
which expire in April 2015. The original plan 
rules will remain substantially unchanged, 
except for three important amendments 
which we hope will be welcomed by our 
shareholders. First, we propose to remove 
the Remuneration Committee’s discretion  
to vest an award at above 100%. Second, 
we will introduce a two-year holding period 
after the three-year performance period; this 
will apply to Executive Directors only. This is 
in direct response to growing shareholder 
appetite for LTI plans with a longer life. 
Finally, we will include malus (in relation to 
unvested awards) and clawback (in relation 
to vested awards) provisions which can be 
exercised in circumstances that result in 
significant reputational damage to the 
Company, financial mismanagement or 
serious personal misconduct. We will  
also add the same malus and clawback 
provisions to the other AstraZeneca LTI  
plan rules and the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Senior leadership changes
Given the senior leadership changes during 
2013, the Remuneration Committee gave 
careful consideration to a number of related 
remuneration matters; in particular, the 
departure of Simon Lowth as CFO and  
the appointment of Marc Dunoyer as his 
successor. As Mr Lowth resigned, he  
will not be paid a bonus for 2013 and his 
outstanding LTI awards were forfeited in  
full. He was an extremely talented CFO,  
and provided strong leadership through 
uncertain times as Interim CEO. He gave 
excellent support to Pascal Soriot when  
he was first appointed as CEO, and the 
Remuneration Committee felt it appropriate 
to exercise its discretion to allow Mr Lowth 
to retain his Deferred Bonus Plan shares  
as these related to strong performance  
in prior years. Marc Dunoyer joined 
AstraZeneca in June 2013 as EVP , GPPS, 
and was appointed CFO in November 2013. 
Mr Dunoyer’s compensation arrangements 
are in line with the market, and his ongoing 
remuneration arrangements are somewhat 
below those of his predecessor. 
Shareholder engagement
In October 2013, new directors’ reporting 
regulations came into effect, requiring  
all UK listed companies to publish their 
remuneration policy (the Remuneration 
Policy Report) (page 114) and to explain  
how they implemented that policy in the 
Implementation Report (page 104). At the 
Company’s 2014 AGM, you will have a 
binding vote on the Remuneration Policy 
Report and an advisory vote on the 
Implementation Report. 
As a matter of course, we have regular 
dialogue with a number of our major 
shareholders, which in December 2013 
included a consultation meeting attended by 
the Chairman of the Board, Leif Johansson; 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee,  
Rudy Markham; and me. At this meeting,  
we outlined our approach to some of the 
more substantive components of our 
Remuneration Policy. This year, our 
shareholders’ views and insights have been 
at the forefront of our minds as we have 
considered and proposed amendments  
to our existing remuneration policy in order 
to enable us to continue to attract and retain 
the best people. It is proposed that our new 
remuneration policy will come into effect  
on 1 January 2015 and we intend that it  
will remain in place for three years. We 
recognise the desire of our shareholders  
for transparency, including in how we 
determine, quantify and assess the outcome 
relative to performance measures and 
targets. However, we also recognise the 
targets’ commercial sensitivity. Accordingly, 
we have disclosed in the Implementation 
Report a level of detail that provides 
transparency about AstraZeneca’s 
approach to remuneration without detailing 
information we consider commercially 
sensitive. Generally, our approach is to 
disclose performance measures and 
weightings in advance (ie for the current 
performance period) and outcomes  
against those targets in arrears (ie for  
the past performance period). While our 
Remuneration Policy will not come into 
effect until 1 January 2015, the 
Remuneration Committee intends to 
operate substantially within the policy  
during 2014.
As you read our Implementation and 
Remuneration Policy Reports, I hope you 
will see that, in the judgements we have 
made during the year, the Remuneration 
Committee has endeavoured to support  
the Company by incentivising the senior 
leaders, and all our employees, to focus  
on the delivery of our strategy, while also 
being careful to protect the interests of 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, 
reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic; 
but on the other, that the exercise of its 
discretion is not seen by employees to be 
arbitrary or unfair. Our Remuneration Policy, 
for which we seek your support through  
the binding vote, is consistent with this 
approach. We see remuneration resource 
as your resource and we attempt to spend  
it wisely and proportionately to increase the 
value of your shareholdings in AstraZeneca. 
We greatly value our ongoing dialogue with 
our shareholders and we welcome your 
feedback on this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. 
Yours sincerely
John Varley 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

responsibility is to develop and execute

Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Governance
Remuneration Committee membership
The Remuneration Committee members are John Varley (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee), Leif Johansson, Rudy Markham 
and Nancy Rothwell. Mr Johansson was considered by the Board to be independent upon his appointment as Chairman of the Board;  
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman after  
his appointment. All other members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Deputy Company 
Secretary acts as the secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
How did the Remuneration Committee spend its time during 2013?
The Remuneration Committee met 13 times in 2013. The individual attendance record of Remuneration Committee members is set out 
on page 91. At the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, the CEO; the 
EVP , Human Resources & Corporate Affairs; the Interim EVP , Human Resources & Corporate Affairs; the Vice-President, People Practices 
and Services; the Executive Compensation Director; and the Company Secretary attended one or more Remuneration Committee 
meetings in 2013 and provided advice and services that materially assisted the Remuneration Committee. In addition, all meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee were attended by one or both of Carol Arrowsmith and Nicki Demby, each representing Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), 
the Remuneration Committee’s independent adviser. 
The work of the Remuneration Committee focused on the following principal matters in 2013 and February 2014: 
 > Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements on appointment, 
change of role and departure as described elsewhere in this 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. Specifically, the appointment of 
Mr Dunoyer as CFO and the termination of Mr Lowth’s 
employment with the Company.
 > The terms of other senior executives’ remuneration packages on 
appointment, promotion or termination.
 > The assessment of Group and individual performance against 
performance targets to determine the level of annual bonuses for 
performance during 2012 and to set executive bonus targets 
during 2013.
 > The assessment of performance against targets to determine the 
level of vesting in 2013 under the PSP , and the setting of PSP and 
AZIP performance thresholds for awards made in 2013.
 > The determination of individual awards made to SET members 
and other participants under the Group’s main LTI plans: the PSP , 
the AZIP and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan.
 > The determination of restricted share awards to a number of 
senior executives under the AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan.
 > Proposed changes to the performance measures for the 
short-term and LTI arrangements.
 > A review of a report providing an analysis of key aspects of 
reward across the wider Group.
 > A benchmarking review of the Remuneration Committee’s 
activities and policies against institutional investor guidelines.
 > A review of the shareholding requirements for Executive Directors 
and the shareholding levels of other SET members.
 > A review of the sources and robustness of market remuneration 
data provided to the Remuneration Committee.
 > A review of the pension entitlements of Executive Directors and 
other SET members.
 > The determination of the Executive Directors’ and other SET 
members’ remuneration in 2014.
 > A review of the process for a periodic review of fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman.
 > A review of the performance of Deloitte, the independent adviser 
to the Remuneration Committee.
 > A tender process for the appointment of the independent adviser 
to the Remuneration Committee.
 > The assessment of Group and individual performance against 
performance targets to determine the level of annual bonuses for 
performance during 2013 and to set annual bonus targets for 
2014 and LTI awards to be granted during 2014.
 > The annual review of the performance of the Remuneration 
Committee.
 > The preparation, review and approval of this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Independent Adviser to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee retains Deloitte, represented by Carol Arrowsmith and Nicki Demby, who report directly to the 
Remuneration Committee and its Chairman and who provided independent advice on various matters considered by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2013. This service was provided to the Remuneration Committee on a time spent basis at a cost to the Company of 
£145,970 (including VAT). During the year, Deloitte also provided taxation advice and other specific non-audit services to the Group.  
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were no conflicts. Deloitte is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group, which is responsible for the stewardship and development of the voluntary code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The principles on which the code is based are transparency, integrity, objectivity, 
competence, due care and confidentiality. Deloitte adheres to the code.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee conducted a tender process, inviting five specialist firms to apply for the role of 
independent adviser to the Committee. The tender process, which involved interviews with both the Company’s management and  
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, concluded with the reappointment of Deloitte as the independent adviser.

  Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October 2012, with an annual rate of base salary in 2012 and 2013 of £1,100,000. Mr Dunoyer was appointed as CFO with effect from 1 November 
2013, with an annualised base salary of £680,000. The base salary for Mr Lowth’s position as CFO in 2013 increased from £660,000 to £710,000 with effect from 1 April 2013. Mr Lowth ceased to be 
a Director on 31 October 2013. Mr Lowth received a temporary base salary increase of £20,000 gross per month effective from June to September 2012 inclusive during his period as Interim CEO 
creating an annualised base pay figure of £900,000. This temporary base salary increase was not pensionable.
2
   Executive Directors may select benefits within the Company’s UK Flexible Benefits Programme or can select to take all, or any remaining allowance after the selection of benefits, in cash. In 2013,  
the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash (£102,000 in respect of Mr Soriot, £9,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer, and £44,000 in respect of Mr Lowth) and selected other benefits 
including healthcare insurance, death-in-service provision and tax preparation advice.
3
  One-third of the pre-tax bonus is deferred into Ordinary Shares. These will be held for three years before being released, subject to continued employment. The bonus is not pensionable.
4
  For Mr Lowth, for 2012, this sum is made up of: a revised sum of £816,000 being the market value of shares on the date of vesting in March 2013 in respect of the 2010 PSP award (three-year 
performance period 2010-2012) which, using an estimated market value based on the London Stock Exchange closing price on 30 January 2013, was reported as £771,000 in our 2012 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report; £126,000 being cash paid on the vesting of this PSP award in respect of dividends accrued; and £359,000 being the intrinsic gain on share options awarded in 2009 on the 
date of vesting in March 2012.
5
  Equivalent to 24% of base salary, taken as a cash alternative to participation in a defined contribution pension scheme.
6
  For Mr Soriot, for 2012, this sum is made up of: £991,000 being cash paid to compensate Mr Soriot in respect of his forfeited bonus opportunity for 2012 from his previous employer, paid at his 
previous employer’s target bonus rate and pro-rated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2012. Mr Soriot was required to invest this sum, after payment of income tax, in AstraZeneca shares;  
and an award of £2,000,000 representing the value of an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share by way of compensation for the loss of LTIs from his previous 
employer. 27,644 shares representing 40% of the award vested on 31 October 2013 in accordance with the vesting schedule, and the remaining 60% of the award will vest in equal proportions 
(subject to the Company’s closed trading periods) on 1 October 2014 and 1 October 2015. The value and structure of the restricted share award mirrors the value and structure of the award that  
Mr Soriot forfeited on his departure from his former employer. Accordingly, no performance conditions apply to the restricted share award made to Mr Soriot on his recruitment.

Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Additional notes to the Directors’ single total figure remuneration table
Annual bonus
For 2013, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity were measures for Achieve Scientific Leadership (30%), Return to Growth 
(30%) and Achieve Group Financial Targets (40%), together with individual performance, details of which are set out below. The CEO  
had a target annual bonus of 100% of base salary (range 0-180%) and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary  
(range 0-150%).
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses earned for the year will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date of 
deferral, subject to continued employment.
The performance measures for the annual bonus opportunity, the weighting, actual performance during the year and level of award are 
detailed in the tables below.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Company’s strategic 
priorities and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of these would compromise the Company’s competitive position versus its peers 
and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. As the annual bonus and PSP performance measures 
are indicators of the Company’s longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets/target ranges are and will remain commercially 
sensitive. Our approach, therefore, is to disclose performance measures and weightings in advance (ie for the current performance 
period) and performance outcomes against those measures in arrears (ie for the past performance period) with an explanation of the 
reward consequences for the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion in judging the annual bonus award for an individual Executive Director, taking into 
account Group and individual performance against targets. In 2013, the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Soriot’s annual 
bonus should amount to 170% of base salary, representing 94% of the potential maximum. The Remuneration Committee determined 
that Mr Dunoyer’s bonus should amount to 129% of base salary on an annualised basis, representing 86% of the potential maximum.  
The Remuneration Committee’s decisions recognise the impact the new leadership team is having on actual and future performance  
of the Company, including the outcome of the 2013 Group scorecard.
1. Achieve Scientific Leadership
These measures reflect the Company’s ability to deliver innovation to the market. In 2013, we made significant progress towards achieving 
scientific leadership and exceeded each of our pipeline targets.

2. Return to Growth
These measures are based on quantitative sales targets for 2013 relating to the Company’s five growth platforms: Brilinta, diabetes, 
respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan. In 2013, we did not, in aggregate, meet our Return to Growth targets. However, our five key 
growth platforms delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of revenue at CER.

measures  
and targets
A combination of measures focused on our scientific, commercial and financial performance assessed over the relevant three-year performance 
period:
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on the relative TSR performance of the Company against a predetermined peer group of global 
pharmaceutical companies. More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Company’s peer group, is set out in 
the Total shareholder return section from page 110.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on the achievement of a cumulative free cash flow target.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on Achieve Scientific Leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which reflects the 
Company’s ability to deliver innovation to the market; major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid 
term growth; the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration; a target for peak-year sales, to track the value of pipeline output; and 
delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
 > Twenty five percent of the award is based on Return to Growth measures based on quantitative sales targets relating to the Company’s five 
growth platforms: Brilinta, diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Company’s strategic priorities  
and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of certain of these may compromise the Company’s competitive position versus its peers  
and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. As the PSP performance measures are an indicator of the 
Company’s longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that these targets/target ranges are and will remain commercially sensitive. 
More information about the PSP’s performance measures is set out on page 118 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

Description  
of interest
The AZIP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The vesting date is the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance 
period (being 1 January in any given year), subject to performance and continued employment.
Basis of award The award comprises:
 > Mr Soriot’s regular 2013 award, with a face 
value of 62.5% of base salary
 > a previously announced award which replaces 
that originally made when Mr Soriot joined the 
Company in October 2012. 
The forfeiture and replacement of the AZIP  
award was determined by the Remuneration 
Committee to be in the interests of shareholders 
as it more closely aligns Mr Soriot’s LTI 
arrangements to the strategy announced by  
the Company in March 2013.
When granting LTI awards to Mr Soriot, the 
Remuneration Committee applied a target 
expected value of 250% of base salary, weighted 
25% in favour of the AZIP and 75% in favour of 
the PSP. For the AZIP, we assume an expected 
value on vesting of 100% of the value of the 
award at grant, which equates to an on-target 
award at face value of 62.5% of base salary.
Annual target award expressed as a percentage 
of base salary in respect of Mr Dunoyer’s position 
as EVP, GPPS and an additional award to 
compensate Mr Dunoyer for the forfeiture of 
unvested LTI awards from his previous employer.
Mr Dunoyer did not receive any AZIP awards 
during the year in respect of his position as  
a Director.
Annual target award expressed as a percentage 
of base salary.
When granting LTI awards to Mr Lowth, the 
Remuneration Committee applied a target 
expected value of 210% of base salary, weighted 
25% in favour of the AZIP and 75% in favour of 
the PSP. For the AZIP, we assume an expected 
value on vesting of 100% of the value of the 
award at grant, which equates to an on-target 
award at face value of 52.5% of base salary at 
the time of the award.

Payments for loss of office (Audited)
Mr Lowth ceased to be a Director of the Company on 31 October 2013. Mr Lowth received his base salary and benefits up until the  
end of October 2013 and did not receive any payments for the remainder of his notice period. Mr Lowth was not eligible to receive an 
annual bonus for 2013 and all outstanding LTI awards made under the PSP and AZIP lapsed in accordance with the plan rules on 
resignation. The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion by determining that Mr Lowth’s Deferred Bonus Plan awards for 2010 
(10,281 shares), 2011 (9,001 shares) and 2012 (11,728 shares) would vest on their pre-determined vesting dates. The 2010 award will vest 
on 25 February 2014, the 2011 award will vest on 24 February 2015, and the 2012 award will vest on 25 February 2016.

  Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October 2012, with an annualised base salary of £1,100,000. No increase in base salary was awarded to Mr Soriot in 2013. David Brennan, who 
relinquished his responsibilities as a Director and as CEO on 1 June 2012, was eligible to receive an annualised base salary of £997,223 for 2012.
The employee comparator group comprises employees in the UK, US and Sweden. We consider this to be an appropriate comparator 
group because it is representative of the Group’s major functions (Commercial, R&D, Manufacturing and Supply, and Enabling Functions) 
and the employee populations are well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics. To provide a meaningful comparison of salary 
increases, a consistent employee comparator group is used by which the same individuals appear in the 2012 and 2013 group.

The chart below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past five years with the TSR of the FTSE100 Index. This graph 
is re-based to 100 at the start of the relevant five-year period. We have also included a ‘Pharmaceutical peers (average)’, which reflects the 
TSR of the current comparator group.
The additional chart below shows how the Company’s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies 
 in the comparator group from the first day in the three-year performance period in respect of the PSP award made during the year to  
31 December 2013, and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior to 
the start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the PSP rules) and, for the purposes of the chart below, over the last three 
months of 2013.

Directors’ interests in shares (Audited)
Under the Company’s Articles all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneficial interest in at least  
500 shares in the Company. All of the Directors fulfil this requirement at the date of this Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In addition to this mandatory requirement, the Board imposes minimum shareholding requirements on the Executive Directors and SET 
members. The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary, and the CFO is required to 
hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their date of appointment. At the date of this report, Mr Soriot has 
fulfilled this requirement but, in view of Mr Dunoyer’s recent appointment as CFO, he does not yet fulfil the shareholding requirement.  
All other SET members are required to build a shareholding over time and hold 125% of base salary as shares while in office.
The Board also encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company  
with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (£75,000) or, in the case of the Chairman, 
approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee (£500,000). Geneviève Berger, Graham Chipchase and Bruce Burlington are building  
their shareholding in the Company over time. All of the other Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, had fulfilled this expectation 
as at 31 December 2013. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

The tables below show the interests of the Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is defined in the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2013 or on the date that they ceased to be a Director  
(if earlier), as well as details of any Director’s interests in options over the Company’s shares. All such interests were beneficial except as 
otherwise stated. No Director or senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the 
Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares  
of any of the Company’s subsidiaries. Between 31 December 2013 and 6 February 2014, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2014
The Company’s Remuneration Policy (the Policy) will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the Company’s AGM which will be held  
in April 2014. It is intended that the Policy will remain in force for three years unless earlier revision is required, and will be effective from  
1 January 2015. The Company will have regard to the proposed Policy in determining remuneration practices in the intervening period. 
The Implementation Report, detailing the implementation of the Company’s remuneration policy in the previous year, will be subject to  
an advisory shareholder vote at the Company’s AGM each year. 
Effective from 1 January 2014, Mr Soriot’s base salary was increased in line with increases in the UK employee population by 3% to 
£1,133,000. Mr Soriot’s pension allowance will increase to 30% of base salary per annum with effect from 1 January 2014, in line with 
pension allowances provided in comparable roles in the FTSE30. Mr Soriot’s target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged  
at 100% of salary and his LTI plan target will remain unchanged at 250% of base salary. However, the Remuneration Committee has 
exercised its discretion to grant an above-target LTI award for 2014 of 285% of base salary. 
In view of the timing of Mr Dunoyer’s appointment as CFO on 1 November 2013, the Remuneration Committee expects his remuneration 
will next be reviewed, in line with the Policy, at the end of 2014. Accordingly, for 2014, Mr Dunoyer’s annualised base salary will remain 
unchanged at £680,000, his target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 90% of base salary and his LTI plan target award 
will remain unchanged at 200% of base salary. The Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Dunoyer an LTI award for 2014 of 200% of 
base salary.
The performance measures and weightings for 2014 in respect of the LTI plans (AZIP and PSP) will be consistent with those described in 
the Long Term Incentives section in the Remuneration Policy Report from page 117 . The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2014 
will be consistent with those set in 2013 as described in the summary table overleaf. Individual performance for each of the Directors will 
be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Company’s objectives for the year.
Further information on the performance measures and targets set in respect of the annual bonus for 2013 can be found in the Additional 
notes to the Directors’ single total figure remuneration table section from page 105, and further information on the performance measures  
in respect of the Company’s LTI plans in 2013 can be found in the Share interests awarded during the year tables from page 107 .
Board and Committee fees for the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, will be reviewed in 2014. Further information on the 
Non-Executive Directors’ Board and Committee fees can be found on page 126 of the Remuneration Policy Report. 112 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013

Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Policy Report
This section sets out the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) that will be put forward for approval by shareholders at the Company’s 
AGM in April 2014. It is intended that the Policy shall apply from 1 January 2015 for a period of three years, and that remuneration 
paid in the period between the date of the AGM and the effective date of the Policy will be substantially in line with the Policy. 
Setting the Company’s Policy
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration 
arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. All roles within the organisation are 
benchmarked against comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee’s local market to ensure the Company is paying 
fairly at all levels. Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements are benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and 
the FTSE30. Each year the Company actively engages with its employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller 
focus groups, in order to solicit feedback generally and on a wide range of specified issues, including pay. 
While the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy,  
it does annually review Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; gender and 
geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation; and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior 
managers. Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore will have the opportunity to vote at the 2014 AGM 
on this Remuneration Policy Report. In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers 
the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Director’s local market in the relevant year. 
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and 
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company’s largest investors on general 
and specific remuneration matters and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members. Major shareholders were consulted on the 
changes made to the LTI performance measures in 2013, and it is the Company’s policy to seek input from major shareholders on an 
ad hoc basis where significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed. Members of the Remuneration Committee met 
with major shareholders in December 2013 to discuss the more significant components of the Policy, as set out in this Remuneration 
Policy Report. The Company’s shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM and any views expressed will be 
considered by the Remuneration Committee’s members. The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure 
that the Group’s remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good 
performance, managing risk, and the pursuit of the Company’s business objectives. 
Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the  
payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company 
(provided that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the agreement was not in consideration for the individual becoming  
a Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with 
such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including awards 
over shares, on the basis of the terms agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments
The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the Directors as described in this 
Remuneration Policy Report (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change  
in legislation). Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
Fixed elements of remuneration: base salary, benefits and pension
The Company’s approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a 
whole is the same. On an annual basis, the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance 
and the external market. AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all 
roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including pension, to all employees (including Directors) 
in the context of their local market.
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary is intended to 
be sufficient (but no more 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals  
in order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
The Remuneration Committee determines base salary based on  
a number of factors, including (but not limited to):
 > Recognition of the value of an individual’s sustained personal 
performance and contribution to the business
 > The individual’s skills and experience 
 > Internal relativities
 > Conditions in the relevant external market.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure they remain 
competitive, with any change usually taking effect from 1 January. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of  
base salary.
The current base salaries can be found on page 105 of the 
Implementation Report. 
While there is no formal maximum, annual base salary increases,  
if any, for the Executive Directors will normally be in line with the 
percentage increases awarded to the employee population within  
the individual’s country location. 
Higher increases may be made if the Remuneration Committee in its 
discretion considers it appropriate. For example, this may include:
 > Increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role
 > Development of the individual within the role.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Non-cash benefits are 
designed to be sufficient 
(but no more generous 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals 
in order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
UK-based Executive Directors are provided with a fund under the UK 
Flexible Benefits Programme. The fund value is based on a range of 
benefits including:
 > Private Medical Insurance for partner and children
 > Life assurance
 > Permanent health insurance
 > Company car
 > Additional holidays
 > Other additional benefits made available by the Company from time 
to time that the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate 
based on the Executive Director’s circumstances.
A Director may choose to take a proportion of, or the entire fund,  
as cash.
Non-UK based Executive Directors will receive a range of benefits  
(or a fund of equivalent value) comparable to those typically offered  
in their local market. They can elect to take the fund as cash or  
elect one or more of these benefits and take the balance as cash.
At its discretion, for Executive Directors on an international 
assignment or relocating to take up other Company duties, the 
Remuneration Committee may consider support towards the 
reasonable costs of relocation. 
At its discretion, the Remuneration Committee may provide an 
allowance towards the reasonable fees for professional services such 
as legal, tax, property and financial advice. The Company may also 
fund the cost of a driver and car for Executive Directors.
The Company also provides Directors’ and Officers’ Liability 
Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law 
and the Company’s Articles. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of benefits.
The current value of benefits available can be found on page 10  
of the Implementation Report. 
The maximum value of the fund available under the UK Flexible 
Benefits Programme will be equivalent to the cost to the Company  
of the suite of benefits at the time. 
The maximum value of the suite of benefits for non-UK based 
Executive Directors will be equivalent to the cost of the suite of 
benefits at the time. 
The value of the support towards the costs of relocation will be the 
reasonable costs associated with the Executive Director’s particular 
circumstances.
The value of the support towards the costs of professional fees and 
other costs will be the reasonable costs associated with the Executive 
Director’s particular circumstances.
The maximum value of the Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance 
and third party indemnity insurance is the cost at the relevant time. 
While the Remuneration Committee has not set an overall level of 
benefit provision, the Remuneration Committee keeps the benefit 
policy and benefit levels under review. 
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Provision of retirement 
benefits to attract, retain 
and develop high-calibre 
individuals in order to 
deliver the Company’s 
strategy.
Company allocations for Executive Directors’ pensions will be a 
proportion of the individual’s base salary and is in line with local 
market practice.
As part of the UK Flexible Benefits Programme, the Company 
provides an allocation consisting of a percentage of the UK-based 
Executive Director’s base salary, which the Executive Director can 
elect to pay into a pension scheme or take as cash. The Company  
will allocate an amount benchmarked to the local market. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of pension.
Currently the CEO and CFO receive an allocation equivalent to 30% 
and 24% of their base salaries respectively as a contribution towards 
the cost of their pension provisions. 
The maximum annual allocation that may be provided to UK-based 
Executive Directors is 35% of base salary.
Non-UK-based Executive Directors will receive a fund for the purpose 
of providing retirement benefits in line with the local market practice. 
The maximum value of that fund will be a sum equivalent to local 
market practice. The Executive Director may elect to take some or all 
of the fund as cash. 116 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Variable elements of remuneration 
Annual bonus
All employee bonuses are determined by reference to the Group scorecard and an assessment of individual performance. The Group 
scorecard is designed to reflect the Company’s strategy and the focus of its business activity and priorities in the performance year. 
The performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 
each year. They are designed to ensure that all eligible employees receive an element of reward based on the Group’s overall financial 
and non-financial performance. A scorecard approach ensures that all employees across functions and geographies are focused on 
the activities critical to delivering the business strategy. The performance measures and weightings underlying the annual bonus plan 
will be disclosed in advance. The outcomes against targets, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, will be disclosed in arrears. The 
Implementation Report will identify, in arrears, the performance versus the objectives and the consequent levels of remuneration 
deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee. 
For Executive Directors one-third of their pre-tax annual bonus is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years, under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan. Employees below SET level receive a bonus in cash and are not required to defer a proportion in shares. 
Annual bonus: cash
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The annual cash bonus 
rewards short-term 
performance against 
specific annual Group  
and individual objectives.
These objectives are 
designed to facilitate the 
delivery of the Company’s 
short-term strategy  
and thereby create value 
for our shareholders  
over time.
The annual cash bonus is based on Group and individual performance in the relevant performance year.
Scorecard measures and targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee based on the key strategic 
objectives for the year. Payout levels are determined by the Remuneration Committee after the year end,  
based on performance against targets. The performance period is one year.
The performance measures form a Group scorecard which is closely aligned to business strategy, and  
rewards scientific, commercial and financial success. While we expect the performance measures to be  
largely unchanged each year, the Remuneration Committee believes it is inadvisable to commit to a fixed  
set of measures in advance in order to retain flexibility to align incentives with the focus of corporate strategy  
in the relevant year. 
The greatest weighting is typically placed on the achievement of financial targets, with an equal weighting 
between the scientific and commercial growth metrics reflecting the importance of both sales and R&D 
success. The actual annual weighting will depend on the strategic priorities for the performance year. 
The Group scorecard is made up of a number of separate metrics within each performance measure. Each 
metric has a payout range associated with it (including a target which is intended to be stretching). In relation  
to each metric, a threshold level of performance is specified. If performance falls below this level there will  
be no payout for that proportion of the award. Each metric has a different weighting. If none of the metrics 
attributable to a performance measure is met then a bonus payout will not be made in respect of that 
performance measure. If none of the metrics is met in any of the performance measures, then no bonus  
payout will be made.
The Board will consider Company performance against the Group scorecard objectives as well as the 
Executive Director’s individual performance in order to determine the value of the bonus award. Individual 
performance will be assessed by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of objective criteria established  
by the Chairman in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO in the case of the CFO. The Remuneration Committee 
has the discretion to move the theoretical award up or down subject to the annual bonus award being no 
greater than the maximum percentage of base salary applicable to that award in the year in question.
The Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome is achieved, 
taking into account the overall performance of the Company and the experience of its shareholders.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus is delivered in cash and one-third is delivered in shares, which are deferred  
for three years as explained below. 
The annual bonus, including the deferred share element, payable for target performance for the CEO is 
currently 100% of base salary and for the CFO is currently 90% of base salary. 
For bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion, for up to six years from the payment date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the  
cash bonus award in certain circumstances including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group,  
(ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However,  
in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years  
from the payment date. 
The maximum annual 
amount payable to an 
Executive Director, is 
250% of base salary. 
If the Remuneration 
Committee ever  
felt that it would be  
in the interests of 
shareholders to grant 
an annual bonus of an 
amount exceeding the 
historical maximum 
opportunity of 180%  
of base salary in the 
case of the CEO and 
150% of base salary  
in the case of the  
CFO, it would consult  
major shareholders  
in advance.
Annual bonus: Deferred Bonus Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The deferred share 
element of the annual cash 
bonus under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan is designed to 
align Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of 
shareholders. 
Executive Directors are required to defer one-third of their pre-tax annual cash bonus into shares. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during the three-year holding  
period will be paid subject to continued employment.
Directors must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for deferred shares to vest.
Once performance measures have been applied to determine the value of the total bonus, no further 
performance measures apply to the deferred share element.
For deferred share elements relating to bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested deferred bonus award in certain circumstances (malus), 
including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group,  
or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual; 
 > for up to six years from the vesting date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the deferred bonus  
award in certain circumstances, including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant 
reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and  
(ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the vesting date. 
The maximum deferred 
bonus for Executive 
Directors is one-third  
of the maximum pre-tax 
bonus as detailed in the 
Annual bonus: cash 
section above. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

Long Term Incentives (LTIs)
Overview: An Executive Director’s target LTI award is considered annually and set at a level which takes account of market analysis. 
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant awards above or below target based on individual performance and potential. 
The CEO’s current LTI target is 250% of base salary on an expected value basis, and the CFO’s current LTI target is 200% of base 
salary on an expected value basis. An illustration of the expected value basis can be found in the Remuneration scenarios for 
Executive Directors section from page 121.
The Company’s variable long-term arrangements for Executive Directors currently comprise two LTI plans: the PSP and the AZIP . 
Under each of these plans the maximum market value of shares that may be awarded is 500% of a participant’s base salary. If the 
Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to an Executive 
Director with values exceeding the historical range of up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major 
shareholders in advance. Currently when LTI awards are granted to Executive Directors, the split between the two plans is weighted 
in the proportion: 75% PSP and 25% AZIP .
When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis. 
For the AZIP , the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant. For the PSP , the expected value on vesting is 
50% of the value of the award at grant. 
The table overleaf explains the operation, minimums and maximums payable under each of these LTI plans.
Performance measures: Performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The performance measures in respect of the PSP are designed to drive long-term performance against the Company’s strategic 
objectives, in terms of commercial, scientific and financial success. 
In respect of the AZIP , dividend-based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for shareholders on a sustainable 
basis over an extended period of time, and will be set by the Remuneration Committee at a level it considers appropriate at the  
start of the performance period. The combined eight-year performance and holding period is designed to reflect the development 
cycle of a medicine and therefore to align executive reward with successful product development.
When setting the performance measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will also determine an 
appropriate payout curve (if any), for each measure. The Remuneration Committee will assess performance against the performance 
measures to determine the level of payout. The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the 
payout should it consider it appropriate, subject to the maximum percentage of base salary applicable in the year in question. The 
intention of the Remuneration Committee is to exercise judgement appropriately, in particular so that the experience of shareholders 
over time is taken into account. As a matter of good practice, certain major shareholders would be consulted before any material 
change to the performance measures for the PSP or AZIP are implemented.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic; but on the other, 
that in exercising its discretion, that exercise is not seen by employees to be arbitrary or unfair. The Remuneration Committee’s 
objective is to use reward arrangements to drive performance by employees which supports the creation of value for shareholders.
Cessation of employment and other circumstances: The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual 
awards should be treated upon termination of an Executive Director’s employment (see Principles of payment for loss of office for 
Executive Directors section on page 124). Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including 
rights issues, sale of a business outside the Group and a change of control. The treatment of awards in these circumstances is also 
subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. In the event of a change of control an award will vest pro rata to the time elapsed 
between the date of grant of the award and the date of the event to the extent that the performance measures have been met up to 
the date of the event, subject to the Remuneration Committee’s discretion to make an alternative determination. 
Other employees: Other employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of PSP and/or Restricted 
Stock Units. The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards – these are the 
leaders who have the ability directly to influence the delivery of the Company’s strategic goals. Awards under the AZIP are currently 
granted to SET members only (including the Executive Directors). 118 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The PSP is an LTI plan 
designed to align the 
variable pay of our 
Executive Directors directly 
to the delivery of our 
medium-term business 
strategy. 
The PSP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on the achievement of stretching three-year performance targets and 
continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the PSP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant three-year performance period and consist of a range of 
measures designed to incentivise performance in furtherance of the Company’s business strategy. 
The performance measures (currently a combination of four measures: TSR, cumulative cash flow, 
sales of medicines in key therapy areas and territories, and innovation metrics) are closely aligned 
to business strategy, and reward commercial, scientific and financial success.
Currently each of the four measures has an equal weighting. When setting the performance 
measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will allocate 
weightings to those measures as it considers appropriate, taking into account strategic and 
business priorities.
The three-year performance period commences on 1 January in the year of the award. The vesting 
date is the third anniversary of the date on which the award is granted. A two-year holding period 
commencing three years from the date of grant for Executive Directors will be included in the new 
PSP rules which are being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2014 and, if approved, 
will be effective for awards made after the AGM. These awards will vest at the end of the holding 
period. During the holding period, no further performance measures will apply as performance has 
already been assessed.
All the performance measures have a payout curve. The payout curves are structured in different 
ways depending on the overall objective they are intended to measure. Typically, performance 
measures are structured such that 25% of the award will vest for threshold level of performance. 
The relationship between threshold, target and out-performance will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at each grant of the PSP and is dependent on whether the performance 
measure is science, commercial or finance based. An award will typically vest at 100% if the target 
(usually set at upper quartile performance) is achieved and threshold level of performance 
associated with any metric will be at or above a median level. There will be other vesting points 
between the threshold and maximum of 100% vesting, typically on a straight-line basis where the 
performance measures permit. 
The Remuneration Committee may (acting fairly and reasonably) adjust or waive a performance target 
if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target is no longer appropriate.
Payouts can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
Subject to shareholder approval of the renewal of the PSP at the 2014 AGM, for awards granted 
under the PSP after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), including 
(i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the 
Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual; 
 > for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw back from individuals 
some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) material restatement of the results 
of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the 
individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its 
discretion for up to two years from the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Under the PSP plan rules, the 
maximum market value of shares  
that may be awarded at the date of 
grant in respect of any year is 500% 
of a participant’s annual base salary. 
If each aspect of all of the 
performance measures is met  
and exceeded, the Remuneration 
Committee currently has the 
discretion to pay out a maximum  
of 125% of the value of the original 
award. However, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that it will 
not exercise this discretion in relation 
to outstanding or future awards. 
This feature has therefore been 
removed from the new PSP rules 
which are being put to shareholders 
for approval at the AGM in 2014. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The combined eight-year 
performance and holding 
periods of the AZIP are 
influenced by the Group’s 
medicine development 
cycle, reflecting the long- 
term investment horizons 
that are a feature of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
The AZIP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on achievement of two performance measures over a four-year performance 
period. The award is then subject to a further four-year holding period. Payout of the award is 
subject to continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the AZIP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant four-year performance period.
Currently, two performance measures apply: dividend level and dividend cover. Both measures 
must be achieved for the award to vest. 
If an event occurs which causes the Remuneration Committee (acting fairly and reasonably)  
to consider that a performance measure is no longer appropriate it may adjust that measure.
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period, with a subsequent four-year holding 
period. Performance periods commence on 1 January in the year of the award. Holding periods 
run for a period of four years starting from the end of the performance period, and end on the 
eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period. During the holding period, no further 
performance measures apply as performance has already been assessed. 
If both measures are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest in full  
at the end of the holding period. If either or both of the measures are not achieved, the award  
will lapse.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends paid during the performance and holding 
periods will be paid.
For awards granted under the AZIP prior to the AGM in 2014, the Company may reduce or cancel 
some or all of the shares that are the subject of a participant’s award at any time during the 
performance or the holding period if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee (acting fairly 
and reasonably), this is warranted by the underlying performance of the Company, the occurrence 
of an event that causes, or is very likely to cause, reputational damage to the Company, or serious 
misconduct by the participant.
In order to ensure consistency between our LTI plans, for awards granted under the AZIP on or 
after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), including 
(i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the 
Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual;
 > for up to six years from the end of the performance period, to claw back from individuals some  
or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) in the case of material restatement of the 
results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct 
by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration Committee may only 
exercise its discretion for up to two years from the end of the performance period. 
Under the AZIP plan rules the 
maximum market value of shares that 
may be awarded at the date of grant 
in respect of any year is 500% of a 
participant’s annual base salary. 120 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Restricted shares
In certain circumstances, as part of the recruitment arrangements, an Executive Director may be awarded restricted shares.  
There are no performance measures attached to awards of restricted shares because typically they will be awarded for the purpose 
of compensating newly recruited Executive Directors for loss of entitlements on leaving a previous employment. However, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider whether the lost incentives were subject to performance measures and their likely vesting.  
If foregone awards were subject to performance testing, then the compensatory AstraZeneca award will normally be granted under 
the PSP and/or AZIP in order to align the performance conditions attaching to the award to the delivery of the Company’s strategy. 
Restricted share awards will generally be used only when the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing.
The Remuneration Committee may divide an award of restricted shares into tranches vesting at different points and may apply 
performance measures bespoke to the individual if it considers it appropriate. If it decides to attach performance conditions, the 
performance conditions and period will be defined at grant.
In most instances, there are no performance conditions attached to these awards. They will therefore vest in full if the individual 
remains in office on the vesting date. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of awards of restricted shares.
Restricted shares may be used for the same purpose on the recruitment of other employees. 
AstraZeneca also operates another restricted share plan (the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan) to provide LTI awards  
to eligible employees globally. Currently Executive Directors and other senior executives are not eligible to participate in this plan.

The RSP provides for the granting of restricted share awards to key employees, excluding 
Executive Directors.
Mr Dunoyer, who was appointed as an Executive Director subsequent to his appointment as EVP, 
GPPS, was granted an award of restricted shares to compensate for loss of entitlements as a 
result of leaving his previous employment. 
Under the RSP plan rules the 
maximum market value of shares that 
may be awarded at the date of grant 
in respect of any year is 500% of a

Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors 
The charts below illustrate how much the current Executive Directors could receive under different performance scenarios in the first year 
of the Policy, assuming a constant share price. 
In order to compile the charts below, the following assumptions have been made:
Minimum 
remuneration
Consists of the fixed elements of remuneration only: base salary, taxable benefits and pension.
 > Base salary is latest known salary, ie that applicable in 2014 as the Remuneration Committee will not determine 
base salaries for 2015 until the end of 2014. 
 > Taxable benefits is taken from the corresponding figure in the Directors’ single total figure remuneration table  
as set out on page 105, with such sum annualised in the case of Mr Dunoyer. 
 > Pension measured as a cash payment equivalent to 30% of base salary in the case of the CEO and 24% of 
base salary in the case of the CFO.

Remuneration  
for on-plan 
performance 
(target)
Based on what the Executive Director would receive if performance were in line with the Company’s expectations:
 > on-target annual bonus payout of 100% of base salary for the CEO, and 90% for the CFO
 > LTI shares which vest at an expected value of 250% of base salary for the CEO (200% in the case of the CFO). 
Remuneration for 
out-performance 
(above target/
maximum)
Based on what the Executive Director would receive at stretch performance and maximum vesting of the 
performance shares:
 > an annual bonus payout of 180% of base salary for the CEO, and 150% for the CFO
 > maximum vesting of the awards made under the Company’s LTI plans (representing 100% of the face value of the 
PSP and AZIP awards where the PSP has an expected value of 50% and the AZIP an expected value of 100%).

Marc Dunoyer Pascal Soriot
The charts above also include the LTI awards that could be granted in 2015. When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee 
applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis. For the AZIP , the expected value on vesting is 100% of the 
value of the award at grant, and for the PSP , the expected value on vesting is 50% of the award at grant.
When granting LTI awards for the CEO, we apply a target expected value of 250% of base salary weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP  
(ie 62.5% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 62.5% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP (ie 187 .5%  
of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 375% of base salary. 
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CEO at an expected value of 250% provides a maximum number  
of shares under the awards with a face value of 437 .5% of base salary.
When granting LTI awards for the CFO, we apply a target expected value of 200% of base salary, weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP  
(ie 50% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 50% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP (ie 150% of base 
salary) which provides for an award at face value of 300% of base salary. 
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CFO at an expected value of 200% provides a maximum number  
of shares under the awards with a face value of 350% of base salary. 122 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors
The Company seeks to pay no more than necessary to recruit the best candidate available for a role as an Executive Director. On the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Company seeks to put in place a remuneration package which is broadly in line with the 
remuneration package applicable to relevant incumbent Executive Directors. However, in order to offer a competitive package to the most 
capable candidate, the Company may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of existing Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee may also agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Company’s international assignment policy 
which provides for support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs. 
The remuneration package offered to new recruits may include any element listed in the policy table above, or any other element which 
the Remuneration Committee considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances, with due respect to the interests of the 
Company’s shareholders. 
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Remuneration Committee will 
take into account a number of different factors, including typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors 
and internal relativities and market positioning. 
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice to Executive Directors. The Company also provides  
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company’s Articles to  
all Executive Directors.
The Company may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements from a previous employer. The value of 
such compensation cannot be anticipated and will depend upon a range of factors including the circumstances of the individual in 
question. In such circumstances, the Company will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company. However, the 
precise nature of the compensation package will depend on the type of entitlement that the recruit is foregoing and which the Company 
will generally seek to compensate in kind; the buyout might therefore comprise cash and/or restricted shares and/or LTI. The Remuneration 
Committee will obtain and take into account independent valuations of the entitlements to determine the appropriate level of 
compensation.
Shares which could be offered to the new recruit would be granted under LTI plans available at the time or under a plan specific to that 
individual as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. Performance measures may apply to such share awards. 
The Company’s policy seeks to link the performance of the Executive Director to the performance of the Company in any given period. 
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at that time and will be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. 
The Company will not offer cash or shares to newly recruited Executive Directors as a bonus, or ‘golden hello’ on joining other than to 
compensate for the loss of a previous remuneration opportunity. Where compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, the 
Company will explain the reasons for this to shareholders in a timely manner, and will provide details of the payments. 
Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus and 
up to 500% of base salary under the PSP and up to 500% of base salary under the AZIP . If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it 
would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical 
range of 0 – 680% of base salary (comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans),  
it would consult major shareholders in advance.
The Company intends to honour all remuneration arrangements previously entered into in the case of Group employees who are 
promoted to the position of an Executive Director.  Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
123 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Service contracts for Executive Directors
Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different 
from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report. The contractual obligations below  
are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise, and to the Executive Directors only.
Notice period The Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by giving not less than 12 months’ written 
notice. The Company may agree, on the appointment of a new Executive Director, that any notice given by the 
Company will not expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Director’s 
appointment. The Company agreed to such a provision in the case of Mr Dunoyer. 
An Executive Director may terminate his employment on 12 months’ written notice.
Payment in  
lieu of notice
The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s contract at any time with immediate effect and pay him a sum 
in lieu of notice. This sum will consist of (i) the base salary that the relevant Executive Director would have been 
entitled to receive during the notice period; and (ii) the cost to the Company of funding the Executive Director’s 
flexible benefit arrangements for this period, including the Company’s contribution in respect of pension. 
The payment in lieu of notice may be paid as a lump sum or the Company may decide to pay the first six months of the 
payment in lieu in equal monthly instalments, with the balance paid within 30 days of the final instalment being paid. 
Garden leave If an Executive Director has given or been given notice of termination, the Company has the right to place the 
Executive Director on ‘garden leave’. 
Summary 
termination
The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s employment summarily, in particular defined circumstances 
such as gross misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in  
lieu of holiday
If, on termination, the relevant Executive Director has exceeded his accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this 
excess may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable. If the Executive Director has unused holiday, 
entitlement, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused 
holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any 
excess holiday.
Directors’ and 
Officers’ Liability 
Insurance
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the 
Company’s Articles is provided to the Executive Directors for the duration of their employment and for a minimum  
of five years following termination.
Deemed  
treatment  
under AZIP  
and restricted 
share award
In respect of awards made to compensate Mr Soriot for loss of remuneration opportunity at his previous employer,  
if Mr Soriot gives notice of termination of his employment after the end of the performance period under the AZIP 
but before the end of the holding period, the award under the AZIP will vest on the earlier of the end of the holding 
period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment, unless the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise. If Mr Soriot’s employment is terminated by the Company (other than in the event 
of prescribed misconduct events), his restricted share award will continue to subsist. 124 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors
The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described 
above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director’s service contract in breach of contract  
(taking into account, as appropriate, the Director’s ability to mitigate his loss). The Remuneration Committee has discretion to award 
payments in certain circumstances, as set out below, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director’s 
performance. The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon 
termination of employment. Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including sale of a business 
outside the Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances may also be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. 
Generally, awards under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company by mutual agreement, 
for example in circumstances of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or where employment terminates by reason  
of the Executive Director’s death (see the table opposite for further information). In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual 
components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office are set out below, subject to the terms of any 
applicable bonus rules or share incentive plan rules:
>  Annual bonus 
An Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which he leaves the Company. Typically this sum will reflect  
an on-target bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which he worked. This is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and 
will depend on the circumstances, including an assessment of the Executive Director’s performance in the relevant period and the 
circumstances of his departure. The deferred share element of previous bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus 
awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director at the end of the period of 
deferral despite the fact that the Executive Director did not work for the entirety of this period. The Remuneration Committee has  
the discretion to accelerate and/or retain the deferral period and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on his 
departure and/or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case may be. The Remuneration Committee will decide whether  
it is appropriate in the circumstances for these shares to vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director. 
>  LTI plans  
The rules of the LTI plans envisage circumstances under which some, all or none of an Executive Director’s shares held under LTI plans 
will vest in connection with his departure. The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including 
the Executive Director’s reason for leaving (as set out in the table opposite) and may be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, 
depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
>  Restricted share awards and awards under the RSP 
The treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Director’s awards on recruitment. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances.
>  Non-statutory redundancy payment 
Executive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.
>  Pension contributions and other benefits 
Pension contributions and other benefits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date or as part of a payment in lieu 
of notice as described on page 123.
>  Payments in relation to statutory rights 
The amount considered reasonable to pay by the Remuneration Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall 
termination payment.
>  Payments required by law 
The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to or in respect of an Executive Director by any 
competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment by any applicable law, regulator  
or collective labour agreement.
>  M i tig ati o n 
The departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate his loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment. 
>  Professional fees 
The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, 
and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director. Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report

Bonus Plan)
Awards will vest at the end of the relevant deferral period, unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides otherwise.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion 
to apply the treatment for leavers by mutual 
agreement.
PSP
Where cessation of employment occurs within three years of the date of grant  
awards will vest, pro rata to the time elapsed between the date of grant of the award 
and the date of cessation of employment, at the end of the performance period after 
performance has been assessed, to the extent that the performance target(s) measured 
over the performance period has been met. 
Where cessation of employment occurs during any holding period the award will vest in 
respect of all the shares that continue to be subject to the award as soon as practicable 
following the cessation of employment.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to permit the award to vest 
immediately on cessation of employment where that cessation occurred as a result of 
one of the events mentioned above to the extent that the performance target(s) has,  
in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied from the date of grant  
to the date of cessation of employment. 
However, if the Remuneration Committee believes that exceptional circumstances 
warrant this, it may exercise its discretion to vest the award on another basis.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its 
discretion to preserve all or part of an award 
and apply the default treatment for leavers by 
mutual agreement as described in this table.
This discretion will not be exercised in the case 
of dismissal for gross misconduct. 
AZIP
Death, ill-health, injury or disability:
 > in the performance period: the award will vest as soon as practicable following the 
cessation of employment, pro-rated to take into account the period elapsed between 
the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment relative to the performance 
period and pro-rated to take into account the satisfaction of any performance 
measure(s), as agreed by the Remuneration Committee; 
 > in the holding period: the award will vest in respect of all the shares that continue  
to be subject to the award as soon as practicable following the cessation of 
employment.
Redundancy, retirement or certain corporate events (eg sale of a business outside  
the Group):
 > in the performance period: the award will vest at the later of the end of the 
performance period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of 
cessation of employment, to the extent any performance measures have been met  
by the end of the performance period and pro-rated to take into account the period 
elapsed between the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment relative 
to the performance period; 
 > in the holding period: the award will vest in respect of all shares that continue to  
be subject to the award at the earlier of the end of the holding period and the end  
of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment. Where the 
Remuneration Committee terminates an Executive Director’s employment (other  
than for gross misconduct) during the holding period, the awards will vest on the 
same basis.
In each case described above, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest  
the award or part of the award on a different basis.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its 
discretion to apply the default treatment for 
leavers by reason of redundancy or retirement 
described in this table. 
Restricted 
shares and 
awards under  
the RSP
Awards will lapse unless the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to 
preserve all or part of an award.
In relation to awards granted on or after 3 February 2014 and, where that award  
was granted at the time of the Executive Director’s recruitment to the Company in 
compensation for any awards or bonuses forfeited at his previous employer, the award 
will vest on the date his employment ceases, pro-rated to take into account the period 
elapsed between the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment, unless the 
Remuneration Committee decides not to pro-rate or to pro-rate on some other basis.
Ordinarily awards will lapse unless the 
Remuneration Committee exercises its 
discretion to preserve all or part of an award. 126 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report
Future Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees. Additional fees are also payable for membership and 
chairmanship of a Board Committee. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share 
awards or options. No pension contributions are made on their behalf. The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors 
during 2013 are set out below. Fees applicable in future years will be set out in the corresponding year’s Implementation Report. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the 
Chairman is determined by the other members of the Remuneration Committee and the Senior independent Non-Executive Director.  
No Director is involved in any decision relating to his or her own remuneration.
Annual Board and Committee fees
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
The annual fees are 
intended to be sufficient 
(but no more than 
necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals.
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees and additional fees 
for membership and chairmanship of a Board Committee. 
The individual fees paid to a Non-Executive Director are subject to periodic review and may be 
increased in the future to ensure that they remain sufficient to attract high-calibre individuals while 
remaining fair and proportionate. While Non-Executive Directors currently receive their fees in 
cash, the Company reserves the right to award part, or all, of their fees in shares.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of fees.

The Company also provides Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the 
fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company’s Articles and may also reimburse the costs 
of financial planning and tax advice.
The maximum amount payable in 
respect of these costs and cost of 
insurance will be the reimbursement 
of the Directors’ benefits grossed up 
for any tax payable by the individual. 
Other costs and expenses
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Intended to reimburse 
individuals for legitimately 
incurred costs and

In addition to the Chairman’s fee, a proportion of the office costs of the Chairman are reimbursed. 
In 2013, this amounted to £40,000. The amount of office costs to be reimbursed each year will be 
determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, based on an assessment of the 
reasonable requirements of the Chairman. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to 
approve contributions by the Company to office costs of other Non-Executive Directors in 
circumstances where such payments are deemed proportionate and reasonable.
The Company will pay for all travel (including travel to the Company’s offices), hotel and other 
expenses reasonably incurred by Non-Executive Directors in the course of the Company’s 
business, for example, professional fees such as secretarial support, and reimbursement for 
domestic security arrangements such as lights and alarms following a security assessment.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of other costs and expenses.
The maximum amounts payable in 
respect of these costs and expenses 
will be the reimbursement of the 
Directors’ costs and expenses 
grossed up for any tax payable by  
the individual.
Letters of appointment
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Articles, following 
their appointment, all Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. The Company is mindful 
of the independence provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and, in this regard, it is anticipated that Non-Executive Directors’ 
overall tenure will not normally exceed nine years. The Chairman may terminate his appointment at any time, with three months’ notice. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a notice period or any provision in his or her letter of appointment giving him, or her, a right to 
compensation payable upon early termination of appointment.

Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risks 
that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
The Directors assessed the effectiveness of 
AstraZeneca’s internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2013 based 
on the criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework (1992). Based on this assessment, 
the Directors believe that, as at 31 December 
2013, the internal control over financial 
reporting is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG Audit Plc, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, has audited the 
effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting as at 31 December 2013 
and, as explained on page 126, has issued 
an unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting. AstraZeneca’s 
internal control over financial reporting is 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
over the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

year ended 31 December 2013 set out  
on pages 132 to 186. In our opinion the 
Group Financial Statements: 
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of its profit for the year then ended; 
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of AstraZeneca PLC only 
 > have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU); and
 > have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Separate opinion in relation to 
IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
As explained in the Group Accounting 
Policies section of the Group Financial 
Statements set out on pages 136 to 140, 
Revenue recognition ($25,711m)
Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee Report), page 137 (accounting policy), page 141 and 147 (financial disclosures) and page 83 
(financial risk management)
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition is one of the key 
judgemental areas for our audit, particularly 
in respect of estimates made for rebates, 
chargebacks and returns under contractual 
and regulatory requirements in the US which 
are deducted in arriving at revenue.
Our principal audit procedures included: testing the Group’s controls surrounding revenue 
recognition and key manual and systems-based controls in the order-to-cash transaction 
cycle, including reconciliations between sales systems and the general ledger; assessing 
whether appropriate revenue recognition policies are applied through comparison with 
accounting standards; and performing testing over revenue at significant components, 
which included analysis of product sales year on year, corroborating movements compared 
with expectations and inspection of contracts with customers. Our audit work in respect 
of the accrual for US rebates, chargebacks and returns involved testing key controls 
including the Group’s review of claims, credits and system accrual rates. In addition, we 
considered the accuracy and integrity of the accrual calculation, corroborated inputs and 
key assumptions, both to internal and independent sources, and considered the historical 
accuracy of the accrual. We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures of 
its revenue recognition policy and other related disclosures.
the Group, in addition to complying with its 
legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, has also applied IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB.
In our opinion, the Group Financial 
Statements comply with IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB.
3. Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the 
Financial Statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows.
KPMG Audit Plc has also reported separately 
on the Company Financial Statements of 
AstraZeneca PLC and on the information 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited. 
This audit report is set out on page 187.
The report set out below is provided in 
compliance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). KPMG Audit Plc 
has also issued reports in accordance with 
standards of the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board in the US, which will be 
included in the Annual Report on Form 20-F 
to be filed with the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Those reports are 
unqualified and include opinions on the 
Group Financial Statements and on 
the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting as at 31 December 2013 
(Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404). The 
Directors’ statement on internal control over 
financial reporting is set out on page 127.

over Financial Reporting (Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404) AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 129
Carrying value of intangible assets ($16,047m)
Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee Report), page 140 (accounting policy), page 150 (financial disclosures) and page 85 (financial  
risk management).
The risk Our response
The Group has significant intangible assets 
arising from the acquisition of products both 
launched and in development. Recoverability 
of these assets is based on forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows, which are 
inherently judgemental. For products in 
development the main risk is successful 
trial results and obtaining required regulatory 
approvals. For launched products, the key 
risk is the ability to successfully commercialise 
the individual product concerned. 
In this area our principal audit procedures included evaluating the Group’s assumptions 
used in assessing the recoverability of intangible assets, in particular, revenue and cashflow 
projections, useful life and discount rates. We also performed sensitivity analysis over 
individual intangible asset models where there was a higher risk of impairment. For products 
in development, a key assumption is the probability of obtaining the necessary clinical and 
regulatory approvals. Our procedures around such products in development included 
critically assessing the reasonableness of the Group’s assumptions through consideration 
of trial readouts, regulatory announcements and the Group’s internal governance and 
approval process. We also interviewed a range of key Research and Development personnel 
and compared assumptions with industry practice. For launched products we challenged 
key assumptions including the size of the therapeutic area market, the products’ projected 
share and expected pricing and associated costs. Our procedures also included holding 
discussions with relevant management personnel, sensitivity analysis based on our experience 
in the sector and retrospective assessment of the accuracy of the Group’s projections.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the carrying value 
of intangible assets.
Litigation and contingent liabilities (provisions of $59m)
Refer to page 101 (Audit Committee Report), page 139 (accounting policy), page 176 (financial disclosures) and page 86 (financial  
risk management).
The risk Our response
In the normal course of business, contingent 
liabilities may arise from product-specific and 
general legal proceedings, from guarantees, 
government investigations or from 
environmental liabilities connected with the 
Group’s current or former sites. The amounts 
involved are potentially material and the 
application of accounting standards to 
determine the amount, if any, to be provided 
as a liability, is inherently subjective. 
Having made enquires of the Directors to obtain their view on the status of significant legal 
matters, our principal audit procedures included: assessment of correspondence with the 
Group’s external counsel on all significant legal cases and discussions with external counsel 
where necessary. In addition we obtained formal confirmations from the Group’s external 
counsel for all significant litigation, used our own forensic and compliance specialists to 
assess the Group’s compliance logs and reports to identify actual and potential non-
compliance with laws and regulations, both those specific to the Group’s business and 
those relating to the conduct of business generally, analysed correspondence with regulators 
and monitored external sources. We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures detailing 
significant legal proceedings adequately disclose the potential liabilities of the Group.
Tax provisioning ($2,576m)
Refer to page 101 (Audit Committee Report), page 138 (accounting policy), page 183 (financial disclosures) and page 87 (financial  
risk management).
The risk Our response
Due to the Group operating in a number of 
different tax jurisdictions and the complexities 
of transfer pricing and other international tax 
legislation, accruals for tax contingencies 
require the Directors to make judgements 
and estimates in relation to tax issues 
and exposures.
In this area our principal audit procedures included: assessment of correspondence with 
the relevant tax authorities, and the use of our own local and international tax specialists 
to analyse and challenge the assumptions used to determine tax provisions based on our 
knowledge and experiences of the application of the relevant legislation by authorities and 
courts. We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of tax and 
uncertain tax positions.
Post-retirement benefits ($2,261m)
Refer to page 101 (Audit Committee Report), page 138 (accounting policy), page 159 (financial disclosures) and page 86 (financial  
risk management).
The risk Our response
Significant estimates are made in valuing 
the Group’s post-retirement defined benefit 
plans. Small changes in assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s net 
pension deficit would have a significant 
effect on the Group’s financial position.
Our principal audit procedures included the challenge of key assumptions, being the 
discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy supporting the valuation of the 
Group’s retirement benefit obligations, with the support of our own actuarial specialists. 
This involved a comparison of these key assumptions used against externally derived data. 
We obtained third party assurance reports on controls over the valuation of pension assets 
held by key custodians and compared asset values to third party confirmations. We also 
assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of post-retirement benefits.

4. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole was set at $248m. 
This has been determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, 
which we consider to be one of the principal 
considerations for members of the 
Company in assessing the financial 
performance of the Group. Materiality 
represents 7 .6% of Group profit before tax 
and 5.0% of Group profit before tax 
adjusted for this year’s significant intangible 
asset impairment as disclosed in Note 9.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to 
report to it all corrected and uncorrected 
misstatements we identified through  
our audit with a value in excess of  
$12m, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold  
that we believe warranted reporting  
on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were 
performed by component auditors at seven 
key reporting components in the following 
countries: the UK, the US, Sweden, China, 
Japan, Germany and France. In addition, 
specified audit procedures (predominantly 
the testing of transaction processing 
and review controls) for Group reporting 
purposes were performed at the Group’s 
shared service centres (both in-house and 
outsourced) in the UK, Malaysia, Romania 
and India. The coverage achieved by 
these Group procedures is shown in the 
charts below. 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting 
purposes at the key reporting components 
of the Group were all performed to lower 
materiality levels set individually for each 
component which ranged from $8m up 
to $188m.
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all 
the auditors in key components and shared 
service centres. These instructions covered 
the significant audit areas that should be 
covered by these audits (which included 
the relevant risks of material misstatement 
detailed above) and set out the information 
required to be reported back to the Group 
audit team. The Group audit team visited 
the key locations in the following countries 
to discuss key risks and audit strategy: 
the UK, the US, Sweden and Japan. Video 
and telephone conference meetings were 
also held with the auditors at these locations 
and all other key reporting components 
that were not physically visited. In addition, 
detailed specified procedures instructions 
were sent to all audit teams for work to be 
carried out at the shared service centre 
locations. Reporting by exception is also 
obtained from the majority of the other 
subsidiaries where a local statutory audit 
is required, but are not included in scope 
for audit or specified audit procedures

5. Our opinion on the other matter 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion the information given in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group Financial Statements. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect 
of the matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, based on the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in this Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the Financial 
Statements, a material misstatement of 
fact, or that is otherwise misleading.

and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; or
 > the Audit Committee Report does 
not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
 > we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.

The Group has also adopted the 
amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of 
Items in Other Comprehensive Income’ 
issued in 2011, resulting in a change to 
the presentation of items within other 
comprehensive income. In addition, effective 
1 January 2013, the Group has adopted 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 
‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ and 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, along 
with consequential amendments to IAS 27 
‘Separate Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 
‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’, amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures on offsetting 
financial assets and liabilities’ and 
amendments to IAS 36 ‘Recoverable Amount 
Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’. 
The adoption of these new standards and 
amendments has not had a significant 
impact on the Group’s profit for the period, 
net assets or cash flows.
The Company has elected to prepare 
the Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
These are presented on pages 188 to 192 
and the Accounting Policies in respect 
of Company information are set out on 
page 189.
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
are presented in US dollars, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.
In preparing their individual Financial 
Statements, the accounting policies of some 
overseas subsidiaries do not conform 
with IASB issued IFRSs. Therefore, where 
appropriate, adjustments are made in order 
to present the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on a consistent basis.
Basis for preparation of Financial 
Statements on a going concern basis
Information on the business environment 
AstraZeneca operates in, including the 
factors underpinning the pharmaceutical 
industry’s future growth prospects, is 
included in the Strategic Report. Details 
of the product portfolio of the Group 
(including patent expiry dates for key 
marketed products), our approach to 
product development and our development 
pipeline are covered in detail with additional 
information by Therapy Area in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report.
The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review 
from page 74. In addition, Note 23 to the 
Financial Statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities 
and its exposures to credit, market and 
liquidity risk. Further details of the 
Group’s cash balances and borrowings 
are included in Notes 13 and 14 to the 
Financial Statements.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources available. As at 31 December 
2013, the Group has $10.4bn in financial 
resources (cash balances of $9.2bn and 
undrawn committed bank facilities of $3.0bn 
that are available until April 2018, with only 
$1.8bn of debt due within one year). The 
Group’s revenues are largely derived from 
sales of products which are covered by 
patents which provide a relatively high level 
of resilience and predictability to cash 
inflows, although our revenue is expected 
to continue to be significantly impacted 
by the expiry of patents over the medium 
term. In addition, recent government price 
interventions in response to budgetary 
constraints are expected to continue to 
adversely affect revenues in many of our 
mature markets. However, we anticipate new 
revenue streams from both recently launched 
medicines and products in development, and 
the Group has a wide diversity of customers 
and suppliers across different geographic 
areas. Consequently, the Directors believe 
that, overall, the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Financial Statements 
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management 
to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities at the date of the Financial 
Statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
Judgements include matters such as the 
determination of operating segments while 
estimates focus on areas such as carrying 
values and estimated useful lives.
AstraZeneca’s management considers 
the following to be the most important 
accounting policies in the context of the 
Group’s operations.
Basis of accounting and preparation  
of financial information
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modified to include revaluation 
to fair value of certain financial instruments 
as described below, in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs) 
in response to the IAS regulation (EC 
1606/2002). The Consolidated Financial 
Statements also comply fully with IFRSs 
as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.
During the year the Group adopted the 
amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ 
issued in 2011. Under IAS 19 (2011), the 
Group determines net interest on the net 
retirement benefit obligation by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the retirement 
benefit obligations at the beginning of the 
annual period, taking account of any changes 
in the net retirement benefit obligation 
during the period as a result of contribution 
and benefit payments. Consequently, 
the net charge to ‘finance expense’ now 
comprises interest cost on the defined 
benefit obligation and interest income on 
plan assets. Previously, the Group 
determined interest income on plan assets 
based on their long-term rate of expected 
return and recorded it as ‘finance income’. 
As a result of applying the discount rate as 
detailed above, the net finance expense 
has been restated to reflect an increase 
of $72m for 2012 and $84m for 2011, 
with an equal and opposite decrease 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income. A consequential decrease to the 
taxation charge of $15m and $18m for 
2012 and 2011 respectively has been 
recorded, with an equal and opposite 
increase recognised in the income tax 
recorded within other comprehensive 
income. Basic earnings per share for 2012 
have been restated from $4.99 to $4.95 
(2011: $7.33 to $7.29). Diluted earnings per 
share for 2012 have also been restated from 
$4.98 to $4.94 (2011: $7 .30 to $7.25). The 
impact of adopting the amended standard 
in 2013 is to increase our net interest 
charge by approximately $115m along with 
consequential impacts as detailed above. 
In addition to these adjustments to our 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Group’s net assets for 2012 and 
2011 have reduced by $6m on adoption of 
the amendments to IAS 19, as previously 
unrecognised past service costs, which were 
recognised over the remaining service life 
of the employees, are now recognised 
retrospectively in retained earnings.
Group Accounting Policies AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 137
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised in 
profit in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is 
capitalised only if it meets the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
Where regulatory and other uncertainties 
are such that the criteria are not met, the 
expenditure is recognised in profit and 
this is almost invariably the case prior to 
approval of the drug by the relevant regulatory 
authority. Where, however, recognition 
criteria are met, intangible assets are 
capitalised and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives from 
product launch. At 31 December 2013, no 
amounts have met recognition criteria.
Payments to in-licence products and 
compounds from third parties for new 
research and development projects 
(in-process research and development), 
generally taking the form of up front 
payments and milestones, are capitalised. 
Where payments made to third parties 
represent future research and development 
activities, an evaluation is made as to the 
nature of the payments. Such payments are 
expensed if they represent compensation for 
subcontracted research and development 
services not resulting in a transfer of 
intellectual property. By contrast, 
payments are capitalised if they represent 
compensation for the transfer of intellectual 
property developed at the risk of the third 
party. Since acquired products and 
compounds will only generate sales and 
cash inflows following launch, our policy is 
to minimise the period between final approval 
and launch if it is within AstraZeneca’s 
control to do so. Assets capitalised are 
amortised, on a straight-line basis, over 
their useful economic lives from product 
launch. Under this policy, it is not possible 
to determine precise economic lives for 
individual classes of intangible assets. 
However, lives do not exceed 20 years. 
Intangible assets relating to products in 
development (both internally generated 
and externally acquired) are subject to 
impairment testing annually. All intangible 
assets are tested for impairment when 
there are indications that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Any impairment 
losses are recognised immediately in profit. 
Intangible assets relating to products 
which fail during development (or for which 
development ceases for other reasons) 
are tested for impairment at the point of 
termination and are written down to their 
recoverable amount (which is usually zero).
If, subsequent to an impairment loss being 
recognised, development restarts or other 
facts and circumstances change indicating 
that the impairment is less or no longer exists, 
the value of the asset is re-estimated 
and its carrying value is increased to the 
recoverable amount, but not exceeding 
the original value, by recognising an 
impairment reversal in profit.
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values 
are attributed to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities unless 
the fair value cannot be measured reliably, 
in which case the value is subsumed into 
goodwill. Where fair values of acquired 
contingent liabilities cannot be measured 
reliably, the assumed contingent liability is 
not recognised but is disclosed in the 
same manner as other contingent liabilities.
Future contingent elements of consideration 
which may include development and launch 
milestones, revenue threshold milestones 
and revenue-based royalties, are fair valued 
at the date of acquisition using decision-tree 
analysis with key inputs including probability 
of success, consideration of potential delays 
and revenue projections based on the 
Group’s internal forecasts. Unsettled 
amounts of consideration are held at fair 
value within payables with changes in fair 
value recognised immediately in profit.
Goodwill is the difference between the 
fair value of the consideration and the fair 
value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised 
and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there is an indication that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 
2002, goodwill was amortised over its 
estimated useful life; such amortisation 
ceased on 31 December 2002.
The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 
was to eliminate goodwill arising upon 
acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 
‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’ and IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’, such goodwill will remain 
eliminated against reserves.
Joint arrangements
The Group has arrangements over which it 
has joint control and which qualify as joint 
arrangements under IFRS 11. The form of 
these arrangements are joint operations. 
The Group recognises its share of revenue 
that it earns from the joint operations and 
its share of expenses incurred. The Group 
also recognises the assets associated 
with the joint operations that it controls 
and the liabilities it incurs under the joint 
arrangement collaboration agreements.
The accounting policy descriptions set out 
the areas where judgements and estimates 
need exercising, the most significant of 
which are revenue recognition, research and 
development (including impairment reviews 
of associated intangible assets), business 
combinations and goodwill, litigation and 
environmental liabilities, employee benefits 
and taxation.
Further information on estimates and 
critical judgements made in applying 
accounting policies, including details of 
significant methods and assumptions 
used, is included in Notes 4, 6, 8, 9, 18, 
22 and 25 to the Financial Statements. 
Financial risk management policies are 
detailed in Note 23.
Revenue
Revenues comprise sales and income 
under co-promotion and co-development 
agreements.
Income under co-promotion and co-
development agreements is recognised 
when it is earned as defined in the contract 
and can be reliably estimated. In general, 
this is upon the sale of the co-promoted/
co-developed product or upon the delivery 
of a promotional or developmental service.
Revenues exclude inter-company revenues 
and value-added taxes and represent net 
invoice value less estimated rebates, returns 
and settlement discounts. Revenues are 
recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to a third party. In general, this is upon 
delivery of the products to wholesalers. 
In markets where returns are significant 
(currently only in the US), estimates of returns 
are accounted for at the point revenue is 
recognised. In markets where returns are not 
significant, they are recorded when returned.
For the US market, we estimate the quantity 
and value of goods which may ultimately 
be returned at the point of sale. Our returns 
accruals are based on actual experience 
over the preceding 12 months for established 
products together with market-related 
information such as estimated stock levels at 
wholesalers and competitor activity which we 
receive via third party information services. 
For newly launched products, we use 
rates based on our experience with similar 
products or a pre-determined percentage.
When a product faces generic competition, 
particular attention is given to the possible 
levels of returns and, in cases where the 
circumstances are such that the level of 
returns (and, hence, revenue) cannot be 
measured reliably, revenues are only 
recognised when the right of return expires, 
which is generally on ultimate prescription 
of the product to patients.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 138
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates of exposures in relation to tax 
audit issues. Tax benefits are not recognised 
unless the tax positions will probably be 
sustained. Once considered to be probable, 
management reviews each material tax 
benefit to assess whether a provision 
should be taken against full recognition 
of that benefit on the basis of potential 
settlement through negotiation and/or 
litigation. All provisions are included in 
current liabilities. Any liability to interest 
on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax 
charge. See Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements for further details.
Share-based payments
All plans are assessed and have been 
classified as equity settled. The grant date 
fair value of employee share plan awards is 
calculated using a modified version of the 
binomial model. In accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting cost is 
recognised in profit over the vesting period 
of the awards, being the period in which the 
services are received. The value of the charge 
is adjusted to reflect expected and actual 
levels of awards vesting, except where the 
failure to vest is as a result of not meeting 
a market condition. Cancellations of equity 
instruments are treated as an acceleration 
of the vesting period and any outstanding 
charge is recognised in profit immediately.
Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to write off the 
difference between the cost of each item 
of property, plant and equipment and its 
residual value over its estimated useful life 
on a straight-line basis. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated 
remaining lives and residual values of 
individual productive assets, taking 
account of commercial and technological 
obsolescence as well as normal wear and 
tear. Under this policy it becomes impractical 
to calculate average asset lives exactly. 
However, the total lives range from 
approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, 
and three to 15 years for plant and 
equipment. All items of property, plant and 
equipment are tested for impairment when 
there are indications that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Any impairment 
losses are recognised immediately in profit.
Borrowing costs
The Group has no borrowing costs with 
respect to the acquisition or construction 
of qualifying assets. All other borrowing 
costs are recognised in profit as incurred 
and in accordance with the effective interest 
rate method.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases if 
they transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership, otherwise 
they are classified as operating leases. 
Assets and liabilities arising on finance 
leases are initially recognised at fair value or, 
if lower, the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The discount rate used in 
calculating the present value of the minimum 
lease payments is the interest rate implicit 
in the lease. Finance charges under finance 
leases are allocated to each reporting period 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the 
finance liability. Rentals under operating 
leases are charged to profit on a straight-
line basis.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly 
or indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control 
is regarded as the exposure or rights to the 
variable returns of the entity when combined 
with the power to affect those returns.
The financial results of subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date control is 
obtained until the date that control ceases.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The first in, first out 
or an average method of valuation is used. 
For finished goods and work in progress, 
cost includes directly attributable costs 
and certain overhead expenses (including 
depreciation). Selling expenses and certain 
other overhead expenses (principally central 
administration costs) are excluded. Net 
realisable value is determined as estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in 
selling and distribution.
Write-downs of inventory occur in the general 
course of business and are recognised in 
cost of sales.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets included in trade and other 
receivables are recognised initially at fair 
value. Subsequent to initial recognition they 
are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less any 
impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in trade and 
other payables are recognised initially at 
fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition 
they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method.
Employee benefits
As detailed in the Basis of accounting and 
preparation of financial information section, 
the Group accounts for pensions and other 
employee benefits (principally healthcare) 
under IAS 19 (2011). In respect of defined 
benefit plans, obligations are measured at 
discounted present value while plan assets 
are measured at fair value. The operating 
and financing costs of such plans are 
recognised separately in profit; current 
service costs are spread systematically 
over the lives of employees and financing 
costs are recognised in full in the periods 
in which they arise. Remeasurements of 
the net defined pension liability, including 
actuarial gains and losses, are recognised 
immediately in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a surplus to 
the Group, the recognised asset is limited 
to the present value of any available future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in 
future contributions to the plan. Payments 
to defined contribution plans are recognised 
in profit as they fall due.
Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs 
from reported profit because taxable profit 
excludes items that are either never taxable 
or tax deductible or items that are taxable 
or tax deductible in a different period. 
The Group’s current tax assets and liabilities 
are calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. This requires judgements 
to be made in respect of the availability of 
future taxable income.
No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised 
in respect of temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and branches where the Group is able to 
control the timing of reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
The Group’s deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated using tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset realised based 
on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 139
Bank and other borrowings
The Group uses derivatives, principally 
interest rate swaps, to hedge the interest 
rate exposure inherent in a portion of its 
fixed interest rate debt. In such cases the 
Group will either designate the debt as fair 
value through profit or loss when certain 
criteria are met or as the hedged item 
under a fair value hedge.
If the debt instrument is designated as 
fair value through profit or loss, the debt is 
initially measured at fair value (with direct 
transaction costs being included in profit 
as an expense) and is remeasured to fair 
value at each reporting date with changes 
in carrying value being recognised in profit 
(along with changes in the fair value of the 
related derivative). Such a designation has 
been made where this significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch which would result 
from recognising gains and losses on 
different bases.
If the debt is designated as the hedged item 
under a fair value hedge, the debt is initially 
measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the 
bonds), and is remeasured for fair value 
changes in respect of the hedged risk 
at each reporting date with changes in 
carrying value being recognised in profit 
(along with changes in the fair value of the 
related derivative).
Other interest-bearing loans are initially 
measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the 
bond) and are subsequently remeasured to 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method at each reporting date. Changes 
in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair 
value (with direct transaction costs being 
included in profit as an expense) and are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value at 
each reporting date. Changes in carrying 
value are recognised in profit.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being 
transactions denominated in a currency 
other than an individual Group entity’s 
functional currency, are translated into the 
relevant functional currencies of individual 
Group entities at average rates for the 
relevant monthly accounting periods, 
which approximate to actual rates.
Monetary assets, arising from foreign 
currency transactions, are retranslated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date. Exchange gains and losses on loans 
and on short-term foreign currency 
borrowings and deposits are included within 
finance expense. Exchange differences on 
all other foreign currency transactions are 
recognised in operating profit in the individual 
Group entity’s accounting records.
Non-monetary items arising from 
foreign currency transactions are not 
retranslated in the individual Group entity’s 
accounting records.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
income and expense items for Group entities 
with a functional currency other than US 
dollars are translated into US dollars at 
average exchange rates, which approximate 
to actual rates, for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated 
at the US exchange rates prevailing at 
the reporting date. Exchange differences 
arising on consolidation are recognised in 
other comprehensive income.
If certain criteria are met, non-US dollar 
denominated loans or derivatives are 
designated as net investment hedges of 
foreign operations. Exchange differences 
arising on retranslation of net investments, 
and of foreign currency loans which are 
designated in an effective net investment 
hedge relationship, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Foreign exchange 
derivatives hedging net investments in 
foreign operations are carried at fair value. 
Effective fair value movements are recognised 
in other comprehensive income, with 
any ineffectiveness taken to the income 
statement. Gains and losses accumulated 
in the translation reserve will be recycled to 
profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Litigation and environmental liabilities
Through the normal course of business, 
AstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, 
the settlement of which may involve cost 
to the Group. Provision is made where an 
adverse outcome is probable and associated 
costs, including related legal costs, can be 
estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate 
disclosures are included.
Where it is considered that the Group is 
more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare 
circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim 
are charged to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has 
a valid contract which provides the right to 
reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss 
incurred or for which a provision has been 
established, the best estimate of the amount 
expected to be received is recognised as 
an asset only when it is virtually certain.
AstraZeneca is exposed to environmental 
liabilities relating to its past operations, 
principally in respect of soil and groundwater 
remediation costs. Provisions for these costs 
are made when there is a present obligation 
and where it is probable that expenditure 
on remedial work will be required and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the cost. 
Provisions are discounted where the effect 
is material.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments 
include interests in leases, trade and 
other receivables and payables, and rights 
and obligations under employee benefit 
plans which are dealt with in specific 
accounting policies.
The Group’s other financial 
instruments include:
 > cash and cash equivalents
 > fixed deposits
 > other investments
 > bank and other borrowings
 > derivatives.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
in hand, current balances with banks and 
similar institutions and highly liquid 
investments with maturities of three months 
or less when acquired. They are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash 
and are held at amortised cost.
Fixed deposits
Fixed deposits, principally comprising 
funds held with banks and other financial 
institutions, are initially measured at fair 
value, plus direct transaction costs, and 
are subsequently remeasured to amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method 
at each reporting date. Changes in carrying 
value are recognised in profit.
Other investments
Where investments have been classified as 
held for trading, they are measured initially 
at fair value and subsequently remeasured 
to fair value at each reporting date. Changes 
in fair value are recognised in profit.
In all other circumstances, the investments 
are classified as ‘available for sale’, initially 
measured at fair value (including direct 
transaction costs) and subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value due to 
changes in exchange rates on monetary 
available for sale investments or impairments 
are recognised in profit. All other changes 
in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in profit when there 
is a decline in the value of an investment 
that is deemed to be other than temporary. 
On disposal of the investment, the cumulative 
amount recognised in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in profit as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.

Applicable accounting standards 
and interpretations issued but not 
yet adopted
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued 
in October 2010 and amended in November 
2013. It is applicable to financial assets and 
financial liabilities. For financial assets it 
requires classification and measurement 
in either the amortised cost or the fair value 
category. For a company’s own debt held 
at fair value, the standard requires the 
movement in the fair value as a result of 
changes in the company’s own credit risk to 
be included in other comprehensive income. 
Under the amendment issued in November 
2013 there is no mandatory effective date 
of IFRS 9. The standard has not yet been 
endorsed by the EU. The adoption of IFRS 9 
is not expected to have a significant impact 
upon the Group’s net results or net assets.
The amendments to IAS 32, on offsetting 
financial assets and liabilities and IAS 39, 
on novation of derivatives and continuation 
of hedge accounting, are effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014. IFRIC Interpretation 21 
‘Levies’ is also effective for periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments 
to IAS 19, employee contributions, is effective 
for the period beginning on or after 1 July 
2014. None of the amendments or the 
interpretation are expected to have a 
significant impact upon the Group’s net 
results, net assets or disclosures. The 
amendment to IAS 32 was endorsed by 
the EU in 2012 and the amendment to 
IAS 39 was endorsed by the EU in 2013. 
The amendments to IAS 19 and IFRIC 
Interpretation 21 have yet to be endorsed 
by the EU.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets, 
other than inventories and deferred tax 
assets, are reviewed at least annually to 
determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. For goodwill, intangible assets 
under development and for any other assets 
where such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated based 
on the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less cost to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows, 
adjusted for the risks specific to each 
asset, are discounted to their present value 
using a discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and the general risks affecting the 
pharmaceutical industry. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash 
flows of other assets. Impairment losses are 
recognised immediately in profit.
International accounting transition
On transition to using adopted IFRSs in  
the year ended 31 December 2005, the 
Group took advantage of several optional 
exemptions available in IFRS 1 ‘First-time 
Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’. The major impacts which are 
of continuing importance are detailed below:
 > Business combinations – IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ has been applied 
from 1 January 2003, the date of 
transition, rather than being applied fully 
retrospectively. As a result, the combination 
of Astra and Zeneca is still accounted for 
as a merger, rather than through purchase 
accounting. If purchase accounting had 
been adopted, Zeneca would have been 
deemed to have acquired Astra.
 > Cumulative exchange differences – 
the Group chose to set the cumulative 
exchange difference reserve at 
1 January 2003 to zero. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 141

2 Operating profit
Operating profit includes the following items:
Research and development expense
In 2013, research and development includes a reversal of the intangible asset impairment charge of $285m, booked in 2011 for olaparib. 
It also includes an impairment charge of $138m against Bydureon, following revised estimates for future sales performance below 
AstraZeneca’s commercial expectations at the time of entering into our collaboration with BMS on Amylin products in 2012, and an 
impairment charge of $136m following AstraZeneca’s decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib. Research and 
development in 2012 includes a $50m impairment following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214. 
In 2011, research and development includes a $285m impairment charge related to the termination of development of the investigational 
compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer and $150m impairment charge related to the intangible assets 
held in relation to TC-5214. 
Selling, general and administrative costs
In 2013, selling, general and administrative costs includes an intangible asset impairment charge of $1,620m against Bydureon following 
revised estimates for future sales performance as detailed above. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2012 includes net legal provisions 
of $72m, in respect of net legal provision charges relating to ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale Price litigation 
in the US, the Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation and Nexium commercial litigation. In 2011, selling, general and administrative costs included 
$135m of net legal provision charges, all of which were in respect of the ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale 
Price litigation in the US and the Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation. The current status of these matters is described in Note 25. These provisions 
constituted our best estimate at that time of losses expected for these matters.
Further details of impairment charges and reversals for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are included in Notes 7 and 9.
Profit on disposal of subsidiary
The profit on disposal of subsidiary in 2011 of $1,483m relates to the sale of the Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY International Inc.

Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2013 
prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies partially offset by tax accrual to tax 
return adjustments. The 2012 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $259m arising from a number of tax settlements 
(including settlement of a transfer pricing matter), partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual 
to tax return adjustments. The 2011 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $520m arising from a number of tax 
settlements, partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2013 
prior period deferred tax adjustment relates to tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2012 prior period deferred tax adjustment 
relates to a benefit of $102m arising from a number of tax settlements (including settlements of a transfer pricing matter) and tax accrual 
to tax return adjustments. The 2011 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a 
reclassification from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, 
appropriate amounts have been provided for. No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas 
as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas 
taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately 
$6,196m at 31 December 2013 (2012: $8,655m; 2011: $9,155m).
Factors affecting future tax charges
As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the 
levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. In 2013, 
the UK Government has enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 20% by 2015. Details of material 
tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.

 The 2013 item relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 23% to the rate of tax of 20% effective from 1 April 2015. The 2012 item relates to the reduction in the Sweden 
Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013 and the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 25% (the tax rate which was substantively enacted as effective from 
1 April 2012 as at 31 December 2011) to the tax rate of 23% effective from 1 April 2013. The 2011 item relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 27% (the tax rate which 
was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2011 as at 31 December 2010) to the tax rate of 25% effective from 1 April 2012. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 145
4 Taxation continued
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK. 
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is shown above. Profits arising from our 
manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of 
tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant that expires in 2016.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets of $214m have not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences (2012: $120m; 2011: $169m) 
because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.

6 Segment information
AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. 
Our biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, 
marketed and sold. All of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. We do not 
manage these individual functional areas separately. 
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board 
for the management, development and performance of our business. We consider that the SET is AstraZeneca’s chief operating decision 
making body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, 
and manufacturing and supply. In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises 
nine Executive Vice-Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International, 
GPPS, Operations & Information Services, and Human Resources & Corporate Affairs. All significant operating decisions are taken by the 
SET. While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is 
at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide 
impact of a new decision. For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to 
an appropriate sub-team for implementation. The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of 
pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the 
form of, and on the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new 
products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in 
many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence 
margin generated on a product. Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure 
of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources 
are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s Early 
Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee. The Group’s acquisitions in the biologics area, including 
MedImmune, have been integrated into the existing management structure of AstraZeneca, both for allocation of resources and for 
assessment and monitoring of performance purposes. As such, biologics does not operate as a separate operating segment.
Geographic areas
The tables below show information by geographic area and, for revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries. The figures

Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party. In general this is upon 
delivery of the products to wholesalers. Transactions with one wholesaler (2012: two; 201 1: two) individually represented greater than 10% of 
total revenue. The value of these transactions recorded as revenue was $3, 166m (2012: $3,517m and $3, 155m; 201 1: $4,298m and $4, 170m).

For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Group’s pre-tax cash flows over 10 
years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine. The projections 
include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics 
entering the market. In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information (including information 
on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets), 
our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry. The 10 year period is covered 
by internal budgets and forecasts. Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates 
are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use. No terminal value is included as 
these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. The methods used to determine recoverable 
amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects. For each 
group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate 
for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7 .0% for 2013, 2012 and 2011) to reflect 
the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was 
approximately 10% (2012: 10%; 2011: 10%).
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 
31 December 2013 (and 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011).
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied. The Directors have 
concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant 
risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The impairment reversal of $285m booked in 2013 was recorded in Research and development expense.
Impairment charges and reversals
In 2013, AstraZeneca commenced enrollment of the first patient in the first of several Phase III clinical programmes for olaparib. As a 
result of the initiation of this programme, the impairment charge of $285m, taken in 2011 as detailed below, was reversed and the full 
historic carrying value of the asset restored to our balance sheet. There are several indications currently under development for olaparib 
and, at the date of the reversal of the impairment, the recoverable value of the intangible asset relating to olaparib, determined using 
value in use calculations as detailed below, was estimated to be at least $650m above its carrying value. The 2013 impairment charge 
of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $1,758m against the intangible asset for Bydureon, acquired as part of 
the 2012 collaboration with BMS on Amylin products as detailed below, following revised estimates for future sales performance as part 
of the annual budgeting process that are below AstraZeneca’s commercial expectations at that time of entering into the collaboration. 
Impairment charges also include $136m following AstraZeneca’s decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
The 2012 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $50m following the decision by AstraZeneca not 
to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214, based on the final results of Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an 
adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant 
treatment. The remaining $149m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year. 
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a full impairment charge of $285m following the termination 
of development of the investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer. The 201 1 impairment of 
product, marketing and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment 
for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies. The remaining $117m charge relates 
to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based  
on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products’ expected post-tax cash flows over a period 
reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products. The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and 
forecasts. By their nature, the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates. 
Consequently, there is a significant risk that partial impairments recognised in this way may be subject to adjustments in future periods. 
Those adjustments may be material. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZeneca’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7.0% for 2013, 2012 and 2011) to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the 
individual products. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% (2012: 14%; 2011: 14%).

Collaboration with BMS on Amylin products
On 8 August 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin. On that date, AstraZeneca and BMS entered into collaboration arrangements, 
based substantially on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance, regarding the development and commercialisation of Amylin’s 
portfolio of products. Under the terms of the collaboration, the companies jointly undertake the global selling and marketing activities in 
relation to the collaboration products. BMS undertook all manufacturing activities with AstraZeneca receiving collaboration product at 
cost. Profits and losses arising from the collaboration were shared equally.
The total consideration for AstraZeneca’s participation in the collaboration was $3.7bn. AstraZeneca’s payment to BMS for its participation 
in the collaboration primarily resulted in the purchase of intangible assets, valued at $3,358m, related to the collaboration products: 
Byetta (exenatide) injection and Bydureon (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension/exenatide 2mg powder and solvent for 
prolonged release suspension for injection) that are approved for use in both the US and Europe, Symlin (pramlintide acetate) injection 
that is approved for use in the US, and metreleptin, a leptin analogue currently under review at the FDA for the treatment of diabetes and/or 
hypertriglyceridaemia in patients with rare forms of inherited or acquired lipodystrophy. In addition, a prepayment of $0.4bn was recognised 
representing payments in advance for collaboration products.
AstraZeneca accounts for the collaboration as a joint operation and recognises its share of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities.
As detailed in Note 28, subsequent to the year end in February 2014, AstraZeneca acquired BMS’s interests in the diabetes alliance, 
including acquiring 100% of the share capital of Amylin.
Arrangements with Merck
In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co., 
Inc. that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough) (‘Merck’) for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra 
products in the US. In 1998, this joint venture was restructured (the ‘Restructuring’). Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring 
(the ‘Agreements’), a US limited partnership (the ‘Partnership’) was formed, in which Merck is the limited partner and AstraZeneca is 
the general partner, and AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint venture’s business subject to certain limited partner and other rights 
held by Merck and its affiliates. These rights provide Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and place limitations 
on AstraZeneca’s commercial freedom to operate. The Agreements provide, in part, for: 
 > annual contingent payments; 
 > termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZeneca’s products and activities in stages, some of 
which are mandatory and others optional. 
The termination arrangements and payments include: 
 > the Advance Payment 
 > the Partial Retirement 
 > the True-Up 
 > the Loan Note Receivable 
 > the First Option 
 > the Second Option.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 153
9 Intangible assets continued 
AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Merck’s interests in 
the Partnership and Agreement products (including Merck’s rights to contingent payments). Once all payments are made, AstraZeneca 
will have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market. AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all of 
the termination arrangements arise from: 
 > The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999; and 
 > Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched (for example, Prilosec, 
Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand) and those that are in development. 
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased 
freedom to operate. 
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if 
a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed. 
Annual Contingent Payments
AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales of certain of its products in the US (the ‘contingent payments’ on the 
Agreement products). Contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised and 
consummated (as discussed under Second Option below). Contingent payments on all other Agreement products have ceased as 
discussed under First Option below.
Advance Payment 
The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements. Merck relinquished all rights, 
including contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger. 
As a result, AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of 
those products (including annual contingent payments), affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit. 
At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made. The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible 
asset and is being amortised over 20 years. Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years is 
used to reflect the typical timescale of development and marketing of a product. 
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable 
On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, 
the True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable. This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in certain AstraZeneca 
products (including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL), AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products and 
AstraZeneca obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory Therapy Area. Intangible assets of 
$994m were recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment ($1,656m) representing payments on account for future product 
rights associated with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below. These ‘non-refundable deposits’ were classified as 
intangible assets. 
First Option 
On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option. Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010. This payment 
resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in products covered by the First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain 
products in development at the time (principally Brilinta and lesogaberan; development of lesogaberan was subsequently discontinued). 
Also on 30 April 2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained 
the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. These rights were valued 
at $1,829m and were recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 ($1,182m having been transferred from non-refundable 
deposits to supplement the payment of $647m to Merck). Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m 
to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. The remaining 
non-refundable deposits of $474m relate to benefits that would be secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option.
Second Option
The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Merck’s interests in the Merck affiliates that hold 
the limited partner and other rights referred to above. Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of 
Merck’s interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US. This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017 , 
or if combined annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount. 
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option. 
The principal areas covered by the amendments are a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and 
agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price. Under the amended Agreements, 
Merck has granted to AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with 
closing on 30 June 2014. Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fall below a minimum amount also remain available 
to AstraZeneca. In addition to this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck have also reached agreement on the 
valuation methodology for setting certain components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise. In lieu of third party appraisals, 
the valuation for a 2014 exercise is now a fixed sum of $327m, based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for 
sales of Nexium and Prilosec in the US market. The agreed amount that would be payable on 30 June 2014 is subject to a true-up in 
2018 that replaces a shared forecast with actual sales for the period from closing in 2014 to June 2018. In addition, the exercise price 
for the Second Option also includes a multiple of ten times Merck’s average 1% annual profit allocation in the Partnership for the three 
years prior to exercise. AstraZeneca currently expects this amount to be around $80m. The component of the exercise price of the 
Second Option that includes the net present value of up to 5% of future US sales of Vimovo, with the precise amount dependent on 
an annual sales threshold that has not yet been achieved and the timing of the option exercise, will continue.

9 Intangible assets continued 
AstraZeneca believes that the amendments provide a greater degree of certainty to the valuation of the Second Option that is preferable 
to the previous arrangements and, barring unforeseen circumstances, AstraZeneca now intends to exercise the Second Option in 2014.
Under the amendments, if AstraZeneca exercises in 2014, Merck’s existing rights to manufacture Nexium and Prilosec would cease upon 
closing. In connection with the amendments, Merck also granted AstraZeneca flexibility to exploit certain commercial opportunities with 
respect to Nexium. 
AstraZeneca now considers that exercise of the Second Option is virtually certain. This judgement is supported by management’s view 
that: AstraZeneca is fully committed to exercising the Second Option in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances; external announcements 
of that intention constructively oblige AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances; and the Second Option price 
is highly favourable, giving economic compulsion for AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014. As such, AstraZeneca has applied an accounting 
treatment to reflect the Second Option as if the date of exercise were 26 June 2012 (the date of amendment of the Agreements), resulting 
in liabilities to Merck of approximately $1.5bn ($1.1bn of which will be paid by way of monthly contingent payments between 1 July 2012 
and 30 June 2014 and the balance as a lump sum on 30 June 2014), and a corresponding increase to intangible assets, from that date. 
These intangible assets, and the $474m from the First Option (detailed above), in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit 
opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from contingent payments.

represents the long-term element of minimum contractual royalties payable to Shionogi under the global licence agreement for Crestor, 
which was re-negotiated in December 2013. The resulting modified royalty structure, which now includes fixed minimum and maximum 
payments in years until 2020, has resulted in the Company recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted 
value of total minimum payments. The current portion of the prepayment is $350m and is reported in amounts due within one year.

 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,608m (2012: $1,551m; 2011: $1,505m) held at amortised cost. 
The fair value of these borrowings was $1,769m at 31 December 2013 (2012: $1,808m; 2011: $1,752m).
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices; the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal 
value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets. The carrying value of loans designated at fair value 
through profit or loss is the fair value; this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10. For loans designated in a fair 
value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged 
risk at each reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost. Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using 
the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to 
carrying values. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 157
14 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued
A gain of $5m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit 
risk. A gain of $39m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Changes in credit risk had no material 
effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group’s Financial Statements. The change in fair value 
attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable at maturity 
on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at 
the reporting date, and were as follows:
2013 2012 2011
Loans and borrowings 0.3% to 3.2% 0.6% to 2.0% 0.9% to 2.3%

All derivatives are held at fair value and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 10. None of the derivatives have 
been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques 
to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield 
curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end. The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing 
transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end. 
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at 
the reporting date, and were as follows:

Pensions
Background
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group. Many of these plans 
are ‘defined contribution’, where AstraZeneca’s contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ 
pay. However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany, are ‘defined benefit’, where benefits are based on employees’ 
length of service and average final salary (typically averaged over one, three or five years). The major defined benefit plans, apart from the 
collectively bargained Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979), have been closed to new entrants since 2000. 
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 
30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate, fiduciary-administered funds. The cash funding of the plans, which 
may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets 
together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations. The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca 
and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZeneca’s credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency 
of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles
97% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany. 
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles:
 > The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
 > The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure. In general, it does not believe in committing 
excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
 > The pension funds are not part of the Group’s core business. The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments 
underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
 > The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position. The Group would not wish 
to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be 
short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations. 
 > In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of 
providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of 
the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles. This determines the cash contributions payable to the 
pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 (2011) liabilities. To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability 
valuations are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield. At present, this puts a 
different, lower value on the liabilities than IAS 19 (2011).
UK
With regard to the Group’s UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised 
below) and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee. 
Role of Trustees (UK)
The UK Pension Fund is managed by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company. The Trustee Directors are composed 
of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The 
Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset 
investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits. They also are responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the 
level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund (see below).
Funding requirements (UK)
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently (ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits). 
The last funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2010. The latest funding 
valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund as at 31 March 2013 is underway. Within 15 months of each valuation, the Trustee and the 
Company must agree the contributions required (if any) to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure. 
Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the UK Pension Fund. The escrow 
account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund 
Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy. At 31 December 2013, £446m ($735m) of escrow fund assets 
are included within other investments (see Note 10).
Under the current funding plan, contributions of £264m ($436m) are required to be made towards the deficit no later than 31 January 2015. 
In practice, it is expected that these contributions will be made by transferring assets from the separate escrow account created for the 
purpose of managing funding of the UK Pension Fund. Under this plan the fund is expected to be fully funded by 31 March 2017 . However, 
this recovery plan is under review as part of the 31 March 2013 valuation.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 were as follows: 
long-term UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen 
in 2010), pension increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum. The resulting valuation of the Fund’s liabilities 
on that basis were £3,950m ($6,100m) compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2010 of £3,129m ($4,832m).

Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund 
assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the fund. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 
‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.
Regulation (UK)
The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on 
its website: www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.
Rest of Group
The IAS 19 (2011) positions as at 31 December 2013 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit 
plans. These plans account for 90% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations outside of the UK. The US and Sweden pension funds are 
managed by fiduciary bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds. These plans are funded in line with the financing 
principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
 > The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013, when plan obligations were $1,655m and plan 
assets were $1,651m. This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
 > The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013, when plan obligations were estimated 
to amount to $1,719m and plan assets were $1,238m.
 > The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2013. In accordance with practice in Germany, 
the plan has a low level of funding: plan obligations amounted to $361m and plan assets were $23m. 
On current bases, it is expected that contributions (excluding those in respect of past service cost) during the year ending 31 December 
2014 to the four main countries will be $285m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions
In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZeneca’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and 
life assurance benefits for retired employees. As at 31 December 2013, some 3,513 retired employees and covered dependants currently 
benefit from these provisions and some 8,098 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. AstraZeneca accrues for the present 
value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the 
financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2013 was $16m (2012: $16m; 2011: $12m). Plan assets were 
$314m and plan obligations were $331m at 31 December 2013. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement 
benefits under IAS 19 (2011).
Financial assumptions
Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 (2011) of the major defined benefit schemes operated 
by the Group to 31 December 2013. The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions 
which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions were as follows:

Demographic assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables. These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and 
adjusted where sufficient data is available. Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes 
where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2013 and members expected to retire  
in 2033 (2012: 2012 and 2032 respectively).

Risks associated with the Company’s defined benefit pensions
The UK defined benefit plan accounts for 67% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations and exposes the Company to a number of 
risks, the most significant of which are:
Risk Description Mitigation
Volatile asset 
returns 
The Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) is calculated using 
a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond 
yields; asset returns that differ from the discount rate 
will create an element of volatility in the solvency ratio. 
The UK Pension Fund holds a significant proportion 
(40%) of its assets in growth assets (such as equities) 
which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short 
term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to 
ensure it remains appropriate given the UK Pension 
Fund’s long-term objectives.
The Company and Trustee have put in place an equity option 
hedging strategy for the UK Pension Fund to reduce the 
volatility of equity investment returns. The hedging strategy 
protects against falls in equity markets of between 95% 
and 84% by foregoing upside above 105% returns.
The Company and Trustee have also hedged the UK 
Pension Fund equity investments against any changes to 
the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen for assets 
denominated in these currencies. Currently around 16%  
of the fund assets are hedged against the US dollar, 2% 
against the euro and 1% against the Japanese yen.
Changes in 
bond yields 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the 
value placed on the DBO for accounting purposes, 
although this will be partially offset by an increase in 
the value of the UK Pension Fund’s bond holdings.
The UK Pension Fund also holds a substantial proportion of 
its assets (60%) as corporate bonds, which provide a 
significant hedge against falling bond yields (falling yields 
which increase the DBO will also increase the value of the 
bond assets). This interest rate hedge is further extended 
by the use of interest rate swaps, so that overall the UK 
Pension Fund assets hedge 42% of the DBO exposure to 
changes in interest rates. Note that there are some 
differences in the credit quality of bonds held by the UK 
Pension Fund and the bonds analysed to decide the DBO 
discount rate, such that there remains some risk should 
yields on different quality bond/swap assets diverge.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line 
with price inflation (specifically inflation in the UK Retail 
Price Index) and higher inflation will lead to higher 
liabilities (although, in most cases, this is capped at an 
annual increase of 5%).
The UK Pension Fund holds some inflation-linked assets 
which provide a hedge against higher-than-expected 
inflation increases on the DBO. This is augmented by 
inflation swaps, such that overall the UK Pension Fund 
assets hedge 53% of the DBO exposure to changes in 
forward inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the UK Pension Fund’s obligations are 
to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. 
The UK Pension Fund entered into a longevity swap during 
2013 which provides hedging against the longevity risk of 
around 10,000 of the Pension Fund’s current pensioners 
and covers $3.8bn of the Pension Fund’s liabilities. A one 
year increase in life expectancy will result in $178m increase 
in pension fund assets.
Other risks
There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits) 
and legislative risks (such as the government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation).

Post-retirement scheme deficit
The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2013, as calculated in accordance 
with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (2011), are shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the 
short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived 
from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

predominantly to enhanced pensions on early retirement in the UK and Sweden. In addition, 2012 includes a $25m curtailment credit 
recognised in Sweden as a consequence of the Södertälje site closure. A settlement credit of $30m recognised in the US, in 2012, arose 
where a proportion of deferred inactive participants who were not yet eligible for retirement elected to exchange their plan benefit for 
immediate cash lump sums.

19 Reserves
Retained earnings
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves resulting from acquisitions, net of disposals, amounted to $679m 
(2012: $685m; 2011: $680m) using year end rates of exchange. At 31 December 2013, 99,341 shares, at a cost of $2m, have been 
deducted from retained earnings (2012: 55,555 shares, at a cost of $4m; 2011: 36,177 shares, at a cost of $2m).
There are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiaries; undistributed profits of 
prior years are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these companies. The undistributed income of AstraZeneca 
companies overseas might be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be 
distributed as dividends (see Note 4).

of share capital ($157m) in 1999. The reserves are available for writing off goodwill arising on consolidation and, subject to guarantees 
given to preserve creditors at the date of the court order, are available for distribution.

2013 acquisitions
Pearl Therapeutics
On 27 June 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics. Pearl Therapeutics is based in Redwood City, California, 
and is focused on the development of inhaled small molecule therapeutics for respiratory disease. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Pearl 
Therapeutics’ shares for an upfront consideration of $569m. In addition, consideration of up to $450m will become payable if specified 
development and regulatory milestones in respect of any triple combination therapies and selected future products that AstraZeneca 
develops using Pearl Therapeutics’ technology platform are achieved. Sales-related payments of up to a further $140m will become 
payable if pre-agreed cumulative sales thresholds are exceeded. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree 
analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
Goodwill of $44m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these is 
the synergistic benefit generated by acquiring Pearl Therapeutics’ workforce, whose skills and knowhow are critical to the best and 
most efficient completion of the ongoing development programmes.
Pearl Therapeutics’ results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 27 June 2013. For the period from acquisition to  
31 December 2013, Pearl Therapeutics’ revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $49m.

Omthera Pharmaceuticals
On 18 July 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Omthera is a specialty pharmaceutical company 
based in Princeton, New Jersey, focused on the development and commercialisation of new therapies for abnormal levels of lipids in the 
blood, referred to as dyslipidaemia. 
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Omthera’s shares for an upfront consideration of $323m with up to $120m in future development and 
approval milestones. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of 
success and consideration of potential delays.
Omthera’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 18 July 2013. For the period from acquisition to

22 Acquisitions and disposals continued
Amplimmune
On 4 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Amplimmune, a privately-held, Maryland, US-based biologics company 
focused on developing novel therapeutics in cancer immunology. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 100% 
of Amplimmune’s shares for an initial consideration of $225m and deferred consideration of up to $275m based on reaching predetermined 
development milestones. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability 
of success and consideration of potential delays.
The acquisition bolsters AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline by obtaining multiple early-stage assets for its immune-mediated cancer therapy 
(IMT-C) portfolio, including AMP-514, an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Other Amplimmune assets 
include multiple preclinical molecules targeting the B7 pathways. 
Goodwill of $33m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified, but include Amplimmune’s very 
early programmes of potential interest for oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, as well as research tools and animal models.
Amplimmune’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 4 October 2013. For the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2013, Amplimmune’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $5m.

On 15 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Spirogen, a privately-held biotech company focused on antibody drug 
conjugate technology for use in oncology. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Spirogen’s shares for an initial consideration of $200m and 
deferred consideration of up to $240m based on reaching predetermined development milestones. Existing out-licensing agreements 
and associated revenue streams are excluded from this acquisition. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree 
analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
AstraZeneca has also entered into a collaboration agreement with ADC Therapeutics to jointly develop two of ADC Therapeutics’ 
antibody-drug conjugate programmes in preclinical development. AstraZeneca has also made an equity investment in ADC Therapeutics, 
which has an existing licensing agreement with Spirogen.
Spirogen’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 15 October 2013. For the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2013, Spirogen’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was immaterial.

22 Acquisitions and disposals continued
Acquisition costs arising on acquisitions in 2013 were immaterial.
If the 2013 acquisitions had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period (1 January 2013), on a pro forma basis, the revenue of 
the combined Group for 2013 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $2,458m. This pro forma information 
has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the 
results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2013 and should not be 
taken to be representative of future results.
2012 acquisitions
Ardea
On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea. Ardea is a US (San Diego, California) based biotechnology company 
focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardea’s 
shares for cash consideration of $1,268m. The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the Respiratory, 
Inflammation and Autoimmunity Therapy Area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable  
assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill. In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is 
underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these is the premium 
attributable to a highly-skilled workforce and established experience in the field of gout. 
Ardea’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from 20 June 2012. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012, 
Ardea’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $43m. If the acquisition had taken effect 
at the beginning of the reporting period (1 January 2012), on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2012 would have 
been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $6,245m. This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account 
any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects, but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually 
would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2012 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

23 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current 
investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity 
requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from 
its operations. 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these 
is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose 
of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or 
net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only 
instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options 
only to offset previously purchased options. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (Note 20), debt (Note 14) and cash (Note 13). For the foreseeable future, 
the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through:
 > managing funding and liquidity risk
 > optimising shareholder return
 > maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Board’s distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component. 
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders’ return strategy, and in 2012, decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain 
strategic flexibility.
The Group’s net funds position (loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative  
financial instruments) has increased from a net debt position of $1,369m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $39m at  
31 December 2013, as a result of increased cash inflows from operating activities offset by investment activities and dividends paid  
to shareholders in the year.
Liquidity risk
The Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board  
considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. 
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and 
manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets. The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by 
Moody’s and A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s. The Group’s long-term credit rating is A2 stable outlook by Moody’s and AA- negative outlook 
by Standard and Poor’s.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $9,217m, fixed deposits of $15m, less overdrafts of $222m at 31 December 2013, the  
Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity. At 31 December 2013, the Group has issued $1,608m under 
a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $7 ,674m under a SEC-registered programme. The Group regularly monitors the credit 
standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. 
The committed facilities of $3bn mature in April 2018 and were undrawn at 31 December 2013.

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each 
year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation 
requires Board approval. A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune 
has been held at fixed rates of interest. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2013, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.8bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 
2014 and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 
to floating rates. No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2013, 2012 or 2011. At 31 December 2013, swaps with a notional 
value of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated 
as fair value through profit or loss. Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit 
is not expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is 
disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 136. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 171
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 
2011, is set out below. In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps 
which convert the debt to floating rate.

and other financial assets on which no interest is received. 
Foreign currency risk
The US dollar is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures 
are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational
Approximately 62% of Group external sales in 2013 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion 
of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish kronor. Surplus cash 
generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash 
flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated 
significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring 
of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval. 
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment 
hedging. As at 31 December 2013, 5.5% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 10.0% of 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net 
investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken 
to profit. Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
In 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt. 
During 2013, the Group entered into an additional cross-currency swap to convert the remaining un-hedged $250m of the 1.95% 2019 
maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt. Both these instruments were designated in net investment hedges against the foreign 
currency risk of the Group’s Japanese yen net assets.
Also in 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $151m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2018. 
This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Group’s Chinese renminbi net assets. 
Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that 
the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
Transactional
One hundred percent of the Group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up 
to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies’ reporting 
currency. In addition, the Group’s external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish kronor, is fully hedged 
from announcement to payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are 
taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes 
in market rates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably 
possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation 
date. For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 
2013, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2013, a 1% 
increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year. The exchange rate sensitivity 
analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2013, with all other 
variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case 
assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the above sensitivity analysis over the three-year period.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances (including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents), 
derivative instruments, trade and other receivables. The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect 
of the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately 
owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group establishes 
an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is 
deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against 
the underlying receivable. 
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 77% of US sales (2012: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 
73%; 2011: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75%).

The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers. Given the profile 
of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade 
receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 173
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Other financial assets
The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the 
level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash. The majority of excess cash is centralised within the 
Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising 
security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according 
to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis. The majority of the Group’s 
cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2013 was $8,409m invested in five US dollar AAA-rated liquidity 
funds. The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating. No more 
than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the 
reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some 
bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of 
the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 
2013 was $326m (2012: $230m; 2011: $21m).
24 Employee costs and share plans for employees
Employee costs
The average number of people, to the nearest hundred, employed by the Group is set out in the table below. In accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006, this includes part-time employees.
2013 2012 2011

Continuing operations 51,600 53,500 59,800
Geographical distribution described in the table above is by location of legal entity employing staff. Certain staff will spend some  
or all of their activity in a different location.
The number of people employed by the Group at the end of 2013 was 51,500 (2012: 51,700; 2011: 57 ,200).
The costs incurred during the year in respect of these employees were:

Severance costs of $653m are not included above (2012: $846m; 2011: $431m).
The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and 
market-related packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a 
whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group’s current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below; 
other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan
Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual 
performance. Bonuses are paid in cash. The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary 
Shares). Employees may invest up to £1,500 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company 
with the total proceeds at the end of the period. The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of 
the 12 month period. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which 
was made in 2011. Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee 
Share Plan. At the Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee 
Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK 
Performance Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. 
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations 
in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.

The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan
This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus 
Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors 
and members of the SET. Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in February each year, the first award having been made 
in February 2006.
Sweden
In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 
50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees 
in Sweden.
US
In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong 
individual performance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 80 
participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs. AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased 
in the market or funded via a share trust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan 
operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans 
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $156m (2012: $139m; 2011: $153m). The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan
This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during 
a close period of the Company. The first grant of awards was made in June 2005. The main grant of awards in 2013 under the plan was 
in June, with further smaller grants in August and November. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions. For awards to all participants in 2013, except employees of MedImmune, vesting is subject to 
a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance. A separate performance condition 
applies to employees of MedImmune. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for 
setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should 
be invited to participate. Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 102.

performance conditions measured over a period of between three and eight years. For awards granted in 2013, the performance 
conditions relate to the annual dividend paid to shareholders and dividend cover over a four year performance period. The awards are 
then subject to a four-year holding period before they can vest. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any

Research and development collaboration payments
The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners. Such collaborations 
may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group 
generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as 
intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development 
cycle. Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term 
revenue forecasts for the related product. The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the 
Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

The table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. 
Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as 
set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (eg royalty-type payments) which 
are expensed as the associated sale is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2013.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted. As detailed 
in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 200, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and 
risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain 
regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). 
The timing of the payments is based on the Group’s current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities
The Group’s expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary 
for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Group’s research, manufacturing and commercial operations 
and are not separated from overall operating and development costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements 
resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2011, 2012, or 2013.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating 
and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination. In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly 
owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at approximately 
18 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under 
federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). Similarly, 
Stauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical 
Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 30 sites where SMC is likely to incur 
US Environmental Consequences. AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. These 
environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Group’s business and, at most of these sites, 
remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance 
activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group’s R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where 
a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated 
future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2013 in the aggregate of $87m (2012: $88m; 2011: $92m), mainly relating to the US. 
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation. Where 
the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that 
this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of  
such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: (1) the nature and extent of claims 
that may be asserted in the future; (2) whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted 
claims; (3) the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known; (4) the potential for 
recoveries from, or allocation of liability to, third parties; and (5) the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and 
liability allocation process can take. Notwithstanding, and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future 
environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in 
aggregate, between $50m to $90m (2012: $50m to $90m; 2011: $50m to $90m) which relates solely to the US. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 177
Over the course of the past several years, 
including in 2013, a significant number 
of commercial litigation claims in which 
AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, 
particularly in the US, thereby reducing 
potential contingent liability exposure 
arising from such litigation. Similarly, in part 
due to patent litigation and settlement 
developments, greater certainty has been 
achieved regarding possible generic entry 
dates with respect to some of our patented 
products. At the same time, like other 
companies in the pharmaceutical sector 
and other industries, AstraZeneca continues 
to be subject to government investigations 
around the world.

that the substance patent protecting Crestor 
is valid and enforceable. In January 2013, 
defendants Aurobindo Pharma Limited, 
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical 
Industries, LTD., and, separately, Apotex 
Corp., filed petitions for rehearing and 
rehearing en banc of aspects of the 
decision. In February and March 2013, 
the Court of Appeals denied the petitions. 
The defendants did not seek further review 
of the decision, which is now final. 
In April 2013, AstraZeneca and Apotex, 
Inc (the Canadian affiliate of Apotex Corp.) 
jointly requested the US District Court 
in Florida (District Court) to enter a 
stipulated order dismissing the claims and 
counterclaims in the case against Apotex, 
Inc. In May 2013, pursuant to agreement 
by the parties, the District Court dismissed 
and closed the related litigation against 
Apotex Inc.
In December 2012, a trial took place in 
the US District Court for the District of 
Delaware in which AstraZeneca contended 
that a 505(b)(2) NDA for rosuvastatin zinc 
tablets infringes the substance patent for 
Crestor tablets. In March 2013, the parties 
entered into a settlement agreement 
resolving the litigation, and the case was 
dismissed by consent judgment. Under the 
agreement, Watson Laboratories, Inc. and 
Actavis, Inc (together, Watson), and EGIS 
Pharmaceuticals PLC conceded that the 
Crestor substance patent is valid, enforceable 
and would be infringed by Watson’s 
rosuvastatin zinc product and its rosuvastatin 
calcium product. The settlement agreement 
permits Watson to begin selling its generic

Legal proceedings
AstraZeneca is involved in various legal 
proceedings considered typical to its 
business, including actual or threatened 
litigation and/or actual or potential 
government investigations relating to 
employment matters, product liability, 
commercial disputes, pricing, sales and 
marketing practices, infringement of IP 
rights, the validity of certain patents and 
competition laws. The more significant 
matters are discussed below.
Most of the claims involve highly complex 
issues. Often these issues are subject to 
substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the 
probability of a loss, if any, being sustained 
and an estimate of the amount of any loss 
is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for 
a majority of these claims, it is not possible 
to make a reasonable estimate of the 
expected financial effect, if any, that will 
result from ultimate resolution of the 
proceedings. In these cases, AstraZeneca 
discloses information with respect to the 
nature and facts of the cases.
With respect to each of the legal proceedings 
described below, other than those for 
which provision has been made, we are 
unable to make estimates of the possible 
loss or range of possible losses at this 
stage, other than as set forth in this section. 
We also do not believe that disclosure of 
the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, 
would be meaningful with respect to those 
legal proceedings. This is due to a number 
of factors, including: (1) the stage of the 
proceedings (in many cases trial dates have 
not been set) and the overall length and 
extent of pre-trial discovery; (2) the entitlement 
of the parties to an action to appeal a 
decision; (3) clarity as to theories of liability, 
damages and governing law; (4) uncertainties 
in timing of litigation; and (5) the possible need 
for further legal proceedings to establish 
the appropriate amount of damages, if any.
However, we have disclosed the amount of 
damages sought by plaintiffs in the Nexium 
settlement anti-trust litigation because of the 
extraordinarily high level of those claims, 
notwithstanding that AstraZeneca believes 
that the plaintiffs’ damages scenarios are 
speculative, contrary to fact and without merit 
and are not a reasonable estimate of the 
expected financial effect, if any, that will result 
from ultimate resolution of the proceedings.
While there can be no assurance regarding 
the outcome of any of the legal proceedings 
referred to in this Note 25, based on 
management’s current and considered 
view of each situation, we do not currently 
expect them to have a material adverse 
effect on our financial position. This position 
could of course change over time, not least 
because of the factors referred to above.
In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines 
and penalties have been assessed and 
which are not subject to appeal (or other 
similar forms of relief), or where a loss 
is probable and we are able to make a 
reasonable estimate of the loss, we indicate 
the loss absorbed or the amount of the 
provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is 
more likely than not to prevail, legal costs 
involved in defending the claim are charged 
to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has 
a valid contract which provides the right 
to reimbursement (from insurance or 
otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part 
of any loss incurred or for which a provision 
has been established, and we consider 
recovery to be virtually certain, the best 
estimate of the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets, and of 
the amounts concerned, usually involve a 
series of complex judgements about future 
events and can rely heavily on estimates 
and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes 
that the provisions recorded are adequate 
based on currently available information and 
that the insurance recoveries recorded will 
be received. However, given the inherent 
uncertainties involved in assessing the 
outcomes of these cases, and in estimating 
the amount of the potential losses and the 
associated insurance recoveries, we could 
in the future incur judgments or insurance 
settlements that could have a material 
adverse effect on our results in any 
particular period.
IP claims include challenges to the Group’s 
patents on various products or processes 
and assertions of non-infringement of 
patents. A loss in any of these cases could 
result in loss of patent protection on the 
related product. The consequences of any 
such loss could be a significant decrease 
in product sales, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits 
filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement 
against companies that have filed ANDAs 
in the US, seeking to market generic forms 
of products sold by the Group prior to the 
expiry of the applicable patents covering 
these products, typically also involve 
allegations of non-infringement, invalidity 
and unenforceability of these patents by 
the ANDA filers. In the event that the Group 
is unsuccessful in these actions or the 
statutory 30-month stay expires before a 
ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved 
will also have the ability, subject to FDA 
approval, to introduce generic versions of 
the product concerned.
AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will 
vigorously defend and enforce, its IP .

of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s 
claim construction, including that Hanmi’s 
product would not infringe the patents 
at issue. In January 2014, AstraZeneca 
requested a rehearing in the Court of 
Appeals. AstraZeneca understands that 
Hanmi’s 505(b)(2) esomeprazole strontium 
product is not AB-rated and is not subject 
to automatic substitution with Nexium.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In Australia in 2011, Ranbaxy Laboratories 
Ltd and Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd 
(together, Ranbaxy) filed an application for 
the revocation on the basis of invalidity of two 
Nexium patents (Australian Patent No. 676337 
and Australian Patent No. 695966) with the 
Federal Court of Australia. AstraZeneca 
cross-claimed for infringement of these 
patents and asserted infringement of a 
further Nexium patent (Australian Patent 
No. 695774). In May 2013, the Federal Court 
of Australia maintained the validity of each 
of the patents-in-suit and held that Ranbaxy 
infringed the 676337 and 695966 patents but 
that the 695774 patent was not infringed. 
Ranbaxy appealed this decision and 
AstraZeneca cross-appealed. In November 
2013, AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy entered 
into a settlement agreement. Under the 
terms of the agreement the appeal and 
cross-appeal were discontinued.
In Australia, in August 2013, AstraZeneca 
commenced proceedings against 
Alphapharm Pty Ltd for infringement 
of the 676337 and 695966 patents.
In Canada, patent infringement proceedings 
against Apotex Inc. continue. A trial was 
held from September to November 2013. 
The decision is under reserve.
In Canada, in March 2013, the Federal 
Court prohibited Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals 
Canada Inc. (Ranbaxy) from receiving a 
marketing authorisation for its esomeprazole 
magnesium product until June 2015. 
Ranbaxy appealed the decision. In December 
2013, AstraZeneca settled the proceeding 
with Ranbaxy.
In the UK, in September 2010, AstraZeneca 
initiated patent infringement proceedings 
against Consilient Health Limited (Consilient) 
and Krka, d.d., Novo Mesto (Krka). Consilient 
and Krka had previously agreed not to 
launch their esomeprazole magnesium 
product pending the outcome of the patent 
infringement proceedings. Although this 
injunction was discharged in July 2011, 
AstraZeneca may remain liable for damages 
resulting from the injunction. In 2012, 
Consilient and Krka commenced damages 
proceedings. A damages inquiry hearing 
took place in December 2013, and a 
finding of fact was issued in January 2014. 
Damages will be awarded to Consilient and 
Krka in due course. The decision is under 
reserve. A provision has been taken.

Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole)
US patent litigation
In November 2008, AstraZeneca 
commenced litigation to recover patent 
infringement damages against Andrx 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Andrx). In October 
2013, the US District Court for the Southern 
District of New York entered a consent 
order and final judgment in favour of Andrx, 
awarding no damages to AstraZeneca. 
AstraZeneca did not appeal the decision.
AstraZeneca continues litigation to recover 
patent infringement damages against 
Apotex Corp. and Apotex Inc. (together, 
Apotex). In December 2013, the US District 
Court for the Southern District of New York 
entered final judgment against Apotex for 
approximately $104m. Apotex has appealed 
the decision.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In Canada, the AstraZeneca patent 
infringement proceeding against Apotex Inc. 
regarding omeprazole capsules and tablets 
remains pending. 
In May 2012, in Canada, the Federal Court 
found AstraZeneca liable to Apotex Inc. 
for section 8 damages arising from notice 
of compliance proceedings that had been 
finally dismissed in December 2003. In March 
2013, AstraZeneca’s appeal was dismissed. 
The actual amount of damages owing, 
if any, will be determined at a future date 
by a court reference procedure. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
US patent litigation 
In 2013, AstraZeneca received four 
Paragraph IV notice letters from companies 
seeking to market generic esomeprazole 
magnesium 20mg and 40mg delayed-
release capsules. In response to these 
notice letters and corresponding ANDA 
filings, AstraZeneca commenced separate 
patent infringement litigation against 
Watson Laboratories, Inc., Wockhardt USA 
LLC, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and Kremers 
Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the US 
District Court for the District of New Jersey. 
All four litigation proceedings are in early 
stages and trial dates have not been set.
In February 2011, AstraZeneca commenced 
patent infringement litigation in the US 
District Court for the District of New Jersey 
(District Court) against Hanmi USA Inc. and 
affiliates (Hanmi) in response to Hanmi’s 
filing of an NDA under 505(b)(2) to market 
esomeprazole strontium delayed-release 
capsules. In June 2013, AstraZeneca 
entered into a settlement agreement to 
expedite AstraZeneca’s appeal of the 
District Court’s December 2012 claim 
construction to the US Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit (Court of Appeals). 
Under a District Court consent judgment, 
Hanmi conceded that AstraZeneca’s 
two patents at issue are valid and 
enforceable. In December 2013, the Court 
version of Crestor and its rosuvastatin zinc 
product beginning 2 May 2016, at a fee 
to AstraZeneca of 39% of net sales 
of Watson’s products until the end of 
Paediatric Exclusivity on 8 July 2016. 
The entry date could be earlier and the 
fees eliminated in certain circumstances.
AstraZeneca is defending three patent 
infringement lawsuits in the US District 
Court for the District of South Carolina, 
which among other things, claim that 
AstraZeneca’s Crestor sales induce 
infringement of the plaintiffs’ patents. 
The first was filed in April 2011 by plaintiff 
Palmetto Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the 
other two were filed in July and December 
2013 by co-plaintiffs Medical University of 
South Carolina Foundation for Research 
Development and Charleston Medical 
Therapeutics, Inc.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
AstraZeneca is engaged in proceedings in 
Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, 
South Africa and Taiwan regarding patent 
and/or regulatory exclusivity for Crestor. 
Generic drug manufacturers have 
commenced sales of generic rosuvastatin 
drug products in Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, 
Mexico, South Africa and Taiwan. 
In Australia, in 2011, AstraZeneca instituted 
proceedings against Apotex Pty Ltd 
asserting infringement of various formulation 
and method patents for Crestor. In January 
2012, AstraZeneca instituted similar 
proceedings against Watson Pharma Pty 
Ltd. and Actavis Australia Pty Ltd. In March 
2013, the Federal Court of Australia held all 
three patents at issue invalid. AstraZeneca 
appealed the decision. The appeal was 
heard in July 2013 and a decision has not 
yet been released.
Faslodex (fulvestrant) 
Patent proceedings outside the US
In Europe, in 2008, the Opposition Division of 
the European Patent Office (EPO) maintained 
a Faslodex formulation patent, EP 1250138, 
following an opposition against the grant of 
this patent by Gedeon Richter Plc, which 
appealed this decision. The Board of Appeal 
of the EPO has called the parties to oral 
proceedings on 18 March 2014.
In Brazil, in January 2013, AstraZeneca 
instituted proceedings against Eurofarma 
Laboratorios S.A (Eurofarma) asserting 
infringement of a formulation patent for 
Faslodex. In May 2013, Eurofarma were 
found to infringe the patent. Eurofarma 
appealed and legal proceedings are in 
progress. In February 2013, Eurofarma 
separately filed nullity actions against the 
formulation patent in the 31st Specialized 
Intellectual Property Federal Court of Rio 
de Janeiro and, in April 2013, at the 
Brazilian Patent Office. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 179

Generic versions of Seroquel XR have been 
launched in Austria, Denmark, Germany, 
Italy, Portugal, Romania, the UK and 
elsewhere in Europe. While AstraZeneca 
continues to have confidence in the patent 
protecting Seroquel XR and will continue to 
take appropriate legal action, additional 
generic launches and adverse court rulings 
are possible.
Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) 
US patent litigation
In October 2013, AstraZeneca and Accuhale 
LLC (Accuhale) executed a settlement 
agreement to resolve a lawsuit brought in 
the US District Court for the Eastern 
District of Pennsylvania that alleged sales 
of Symbicort infringed a patent purportedly 
owned by Accuhale. A provision has been 
taken. This case has been dismissed. 
Vimovo (fixed-dose combination of 
naproxen/esomeprazole)
US patent litigation
In January 2014, AstraZeneca and POZEN 
Inc. commenced patent infringement actions 
in the US District Court for the District of 
New Jersey against two additional ANDA 
challengers seeking approval to market a 
generic copy of Vimovo. Separately, four 
patent infringement actions regarding 
generic versions of Vimovo are pending in the 
same Court. No trial dates have been set.
Zestril (lisinopril dehydrate)
Patent/regulatory proceedings outside 
the US
In 1996, two of AstraZeneca’s predecessor 
companies, Zeneca Limited and Zeneca 
Pharma Inc. (as licensees), Merck & Co., 
Inc. and Merck Frosst Canada Inc. 
(together, Merck Group) commenced a 
patent infringement action in Canada 
against Apotex, Inc. (Apotex), alleging 
infringement of Merck Group’s lisinopril 
patent. In 2010, after having established 
Apotex’s liability, AstraZeneca and the 
Merck Group initiated proceedings to 
recover damages and that damages claim 
remains pending.
In September 2013, AstraZeneca entered 
into an agreement with Hexal AG, a member 
of the Sandoz group of companies (Hexal/
Sandoz), to resolve more than 30 European 
disputes between AstraZeneca and Hexal/
Sandoz affiliates related to AstraZeneca’s 
Nexium patents and Hexal/Sandoz’s version 
of esomeprazole magnesium. The agreement 
resolves disputes in 20 countries. 
AstraZeneca is involved in many proceedings 
regarding patent and/or regulatory exclusivity 
for Nexium, including in Australia, Austria, 
Canada, China, Denmark, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, 
Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, 
Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. There is 
generic entry in many European markets. 
While AstraZeneca continues to have 
confidence in the patents protecting Nexium 
and will continue to take appropriate legal 
action, additional generic launches and 
adverse court rulings are possible.
Pulmicort Respules 
(budesonide inhalation suspension) 
US patent litigation 
In April 2013, the US District Court for the 
District of New Jersey (District Court) ruled 
that AstraZeneca’s US patent no. 6,598,603 
(the ‘603 patent) is invalid and that the 
generic defendants involved in the litigation 
do not infringe a second patent, US patent 
no. 7 ,524,834 (the ‘834 patent). In April 2013, 
AstraZeneca filed a notice of appeal and in 
May 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Circuit (Court of Appeals) enjoined 
the generic defendants from entering the 
market until its ruling on AstraZeneca’s 
appeal. In October 2013, the Court of 
Appeals reversed and remanded for further 
proceedings the District Court’s decision 
that the generic defendants involved in 
the litigation do not infringe the ‘834 patent. 
The Court of Appeals upheld, however, the 
District Court’s decision that the ‘603 patent 
is invalid. In December 2013, the District 
Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion and 
temporarily enjoined the generic defendants 
from entering the market until resolution 
of AstraZeneca’s motion for a preliminary 
injunction. Also in December 2013, the 
Court of Appeals issued its mandate to 
the District Court. 
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate) 
US regulatory proceedings 
In April 2013, the US Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit (Court of 
Appeals) affirmed the trial court’s previous 
ruling that Seroquel IR was not entitled to 
additional regulatory exclusivity in the US 
beyond March 2012. In May 2013, the 
Court of Appeals denied AstraZeneca’s 
motion for reconsideration.
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate) 
US patent litigation/regulatory proceedings
In February 2013, the US Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit affirmed the March 
2012 decision of the US District Court for 
the District of New Jersey that the Seroquel 
XR formulation patent is valid and infringed.
In February 2013, AstraZeneca settled its 
patent infringement action against Torrent 
Pharmaceuticals Limited and Torrent 
Pharma Inc., and in April 2013 settled its 
patent infringement action against Lupin 
Ltd. In both cases, AstraZeneca granted a 
license to the Seroquel XR product patent, 
effective 1 November 2016, or earlier, in 
certain circumstances.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In March 2013, the Federal Court of Canada 
dismissed AstraZeneca’s application to 
prohibit the Canadian Minister of Health from 
issuing a notice of compliance to Teva 
Canada Limited (Teva) for its generic 
quetiapine fumarate product relating to 
Seroquel XR. Teva has launched its generic 
Seroquel XR at risk and has filed an action 
seeking section 8 damages arising from 
these proceedings. 
Also in March 2013, AstraZeneca 
discontinued its application to prohibit the 
Canadian Minister of Health from issuing a 
notice of compliance to Sandoz Canada 
Inc. (Sandoz) for its generic quetiapine 
fumarate product relating to Seroquel XR. 
In August 2013, AstraZeneca and Sandoz 
entered into a settlement agreement 
ending the ongoing patent litigation 
between the parties and allowing Sandoz 
to launch generic Seroquel XR immediately. 
In the UK, in March 2012, the UK High Court 
found the Seroquel XR formulation patent 
invalid. In April 2013, the Court of Appeal 
in the UK denied AstraZeneca’s appeal. 
In December 2013, the UK Supreme Court 
decided not to hear an appeal of the Court 
of Appeal’s decision.
In Spain, in October 2013, the Barcelona 
Court of Appeal reversed the July 2012 
opinion by the Commercial Court in 
Barcelona and found the Seroquel XR 
formulation patent invalid. AstraZeneca 
has appealed the decision.
In Portugal, there have been numerous 
challenges to the Seroquel XR formulation 
patent. There have been three arbitral panel 
decisions rendered in September, October 
and November 2013 respectively, all decided 
in AstraZeneca’s favour. There are other 
similar proceedings pending in Portugal.
In Belgium, in December 2013, the 
Commercial Court of Antwerp found the 
Seroquel XR formulation patent invalid. 
AstraZeneca intends to appeal this decision.

plaintiffs. In December 2013, 522 of the 
1,104 dismissed plaintiffs collectively 
moved the MDL court to have their claims 
reinstated. AstraZeneca has opposed 
this motion, which remains pending. On 
13 January 2014, the MDL court dismissed 
the claims of an additional 179 plaintiffs.
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate) 
With regard to Seroquel IR product liability 
litigation in the US, AstraZeneca is aware of 
approximately 10 cases in active litigation 
in various jurisdictions. 
Four putative class actions were initiated in 
Canada in the provinces of Alberta, British 
Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, alleging 
that AstraZeneca failed to provide adequate 
warnings in connection with an alleged 
association between Seroquel IR and the 
onset of diabetes. Class certification was 
denied in the Quebec proceedings in 2011 
and in the Ontario proceedings in 2012. Both 
decisions were appealed. In December 2012, 
the Quebec Court of Appeal approved the 
plaintiff’s motion to abandon the appeal of 
the lower court’s decision to deny class 
certification. In February 2013, the Ontario 
Divisional Court (Divisional Court) dismissed 
plaintiffs’ appeal. In October 2013, the 
Ontario Superior Court dismissed the action 
and approved a settlement in which plaintiffs 
agreed to abandon all further rights of appeal 
regarding the Divisional Court’s decision to 
deny class certification and AstraZeneca 
agreed not to pursue its costs award 
associated with the decision. The cases in 
Alberta and British Columbia remain stayed.
With regard to insurance coverage for 
the substantial legal defence costs and 
settlements that have been incurred in 
connection with the Seroquel IR product 
liability claims in the US related to alleged 
diabetes and/or other related alleged injuries 
(which now exceed the total amount of 
insurance coverage available), disputes 
continue with insurers about the availability 
of coverage under certain insurance policies. 
These policies have aggregate coverage 
limits of $300m. 
AstraZeneca commenced legal proceedings 
in the UK against two of the insurers in 
respect of policies with aggregate coverage 
limits of $200m and in February 2013 the 
High Court issued a judgment on preliminary 
legal issues which ruled that AstraZeneca 
was not entitled to recover under those 
policies. AstraZeneca appealed the decision, 
but in December 2013 the Court of Appeal 
issued a judgment which upheld the High 
Court’s ruling.
An arbitration has commenced against 
another insurer in respect of a policy with 
a coverage limit of $50m. 
AstraZeneca has not recognised an 
insurance receivable in respect of these 
legal actions. 
Commercial Litigation 
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium)
Qui tam litigation
As disclosed in the Government investigations 
section, the US Attorney’s Offices and all 
states, except for the State of Texas, have 
declined to intervene in the civil component 
of a previously disclosed investigation 
regarding Crestor. As a result, AstraZeneca 
has now been named as a defendant in 
a lawsuit filed in the US Federal Court in 
Wilmington, Delaware, under the qui tam 
(whistleblower) provisions of the federal False 
Claims Act and the Florida Whistleblower 
Act, alleging that AstraZeneca directed 
certain employees to promote Crestor 
off-label. AstraZeneca intends to vigorously 
defend this matter.
Israel 
In November 2012, a Motion to Certify 
a Claim as a Class Action and Statement 
of Claim were filed in Israel in the District 
Court in Tel Aviv, Jaffa against AstraZeneca 
and four other pharmaceutical companies 
for alleged deception and failure to disclose 
material facts to consumers regarding 
potential adverse events associated with 
certain drugs, including Crestor. In May 
2013, the Court granted AstraZeneca’s 
motion and dismissed the action as to 
all defendants. In July 2013, an amended 
Motion to Certify a Claim as a Class Action 
and Statement of Claim containing 
substantially similar allegations to those in 
the first action were filed in the same court 
against the same defendants. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
Consumer litigation 
Currently, there are no active cases among 
the various putative class actions filed in the 
US alleging that AstraZeneca’s promotion, 
advertising and pricing of Nexium to 
physicians, consumers and third party 
payers was unfair, unlawful and deceptive. 
In regard to the Massachusetts State Court 
case, in August 2013 the Court ordered final 
approval of the class settlement agreement 
and dismissal of the matter. In regard to the 
Delaware State Court case, an action that 
has been stayed since 2005, in December 
2013 the Court denied AstraZeneca’s 
motion to dismiss the matter for failure to 
prosecute. AstraZeneca anticipates that 
the stay of the case will be lifted in the first 
quarter of 2014. 
Settlement anti-trust litigation 
AstraZeneca is one of several defendants 
in a now consolidated, MDL proposed class 
action and individual lawsuits alleging that 
AstraZeneca’s settlements of certain 
patent litigation in the US relating to Nexium 
violated US anti-trust law and various state 
laws. The lawsuits were first filed in August 
2012. AstraZeneca firmly believes that 
plaintiffs’ allegations are without merit, 
Product Liability Litigation 
Byetta/Bydureon (exenatide)
Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, is a 
defendant in 272 filed lawsuits in various 
federal and state courts in the US involving 
a total of 442 plaintiffs claiming physical 
injury from treatment with Byetta or Bydureon. 
The lawsuits allege multiple types of injuries 
including pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and 
thyroid cancer. A Multi-District Litigation has 
been established in the US District Court for 
the Southern District of California in regard 
to the alleged pancreatic cancer cases 
in federal courts. Further, a co-ordinated 
proceeding has been established in 
Los Angeles, California in regard to the 
various lawsuits in California state courts. 
A trial involving a single plaintiff alleging 
pancreatitis caused by Byetta is scheduled 
for 18 February 2014 in the California state 
court co-ordinated proceeding.
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium)
AstraZeneca is defending 26 lawsuits in 
California state courts involving a total of 
708 plaintiffs claiming physical injury from 
treatment with Crestor. The lawsuits 
allege multiple types of injuries including 
diabetes mellitus, various cardiac injuries, 
rhabdomyolysis, and liver and kidney 
injuries. Twenty one cases have been 
consolidated into one co-ordinated 
proceeding in Los Angeles, California.
Iressa (gefitinib) 
Between 2004 and 2008, seven claims were 
filed against AstraZeneca in Japan in the 
Osaka and Tokyo District Courts (District 
Courts) alleging that Iressa caused a fatal 
incidence of interstitial lung disease in 
Japanese patients. In November 2011 and in 
May 2012, the Tokyo and Osaka High Courts 
reversed the District Courts’ decisions and 
ruled that neither AstraZeneca, nor the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare (MHLW), had any liability for any  
of the claims. The plaintiffs appealed 
both decisions to the Japanese Supreme 
Court (Supreme Court). In April 2013, the 
Supreme Court issued decisions to reject 
appeals against AstraZeneca in all respects. 
Appeals against MHLW were also rejected 
by the Supreme Court.
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
AstraZeneca has been defending product 
liability lawsuits brought by approximately 
1,900 plaintiffs, who allege that Nexium 
caused bone deterioration, loss of bone 
density and/or bone fractures. Approximately 
1,700 of these plaintiffs’ claims have been 
consolidated for pre-trial proceeding in the 
US District Court for the Central District of 
California through the Multi-District Litigation 
(MDL) process. In November 2013, the 
MDL court dismissed the claims of 1,104

On 10 December 2013, AstraZeneca and 
the other defendants filed numerous motions 
for summary judgment and motions 
challenging certain of plaintiffs’ expert 
witnesses. Plaintiffs filed numerous motions 
challenging expert witnesses proposed by 
the defendants. On 30 December 2013, the 
Court issued an oral ruling striking certain 
experts, subject to reconsideration prior to, 
or at, trial. In January 2014, the Court issued 
an oral ruling striking additional plaintiff 
expert witnesses, and oral and written orders 
denying certain of the summary judgment 
motions. Several summary judgment motions 
remain under consideration. A trial on certain 
factual issues in this matter is currently 
scheduled to commence in March 2014. 
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate)
Of the various state law claims brought 
by state Attorneys General generally 
alleging that AstraZeneca made false and/
or misleading statements in marketing 
and promoting Seroquel XR, AstraZeneca 
remains in litigation with the Attorney General 
of Mississippi. 
Synagis (palivizumab)
In September 2011, MedImmune filed an 
action against AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie) (formerly 
Abbott International, LLC) in the Circuit Court 
for Montgomery County, Maryland, seeking 
a declaratory judgment in a contract dispute. 
AbbVie’s motion to dismiss was granted. 
In September 2011, AbbVie filed a parallel 
action against MedImmune in the Illinois 
State Court. AbbVie’s motion to hold the 
disputed funds in escrow was rejected. 
In February 2012, the Court denied 
MedImmune’s motion to dismiss.
Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) 
AstraZeneca was defending anti-trust 
claims in the US regarding the listing and 
enforcement of patents protecting Toprol-XL. 
In March 2013, the US District Court for the 
District of Delaware entered an Order and 
Final Judgment approving AstraZeneca’s 
settlement agreement with the end-payers, 
for which a provision was taken in 2012. 
There are no further pending claims.
Other Commercial Litigation 
Average Manufacturer’s Price  
qui tam litigation (Streck)
AstraZeneca is one of several manufacturers 
named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in 
the US Federal Court in Philadelphia under 
the qui tam (whistleblower) provisions of the 
federal and certain state False Claims Acts 
alleging inaccurate reporting of Average 
Manufacturer’s Prices to the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
The action was initially filed in October 2008 
but remained under seal until May 2011, 
following the US government’s decision 
not to intervene in the case with regard 
to certain manufacturers, including 
AstraZeneca. As to AstraZeneca, the Court 
dismissed plaintiffs’ claims, both state and 
federal, for all Average Manufacturer Price 
submissions made before 1 January 2007 
but denied AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss 
all claims regarding submissions made 
after 1 January 2007.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Of the various lawsuits against AstraZeneca 
and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 
involving allegations that, by causing the 
publication of allegedly inflated wholesale 
list prices, defendants caused entities to 
overpay for prescription drugs, AstraZeneca 
remains in litigation with the Attorneys 
General of the states of Utah and Wisconsin.
AstraZeneca successfully appealed a 
$20m jury verdict entered against it in 
litigation brought by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. The Kentucky Supreme Court 
declined to hear the Commonwealth’s 
appeal. In September 2013, the Kentucky 
trial court entered final judgment in favour 
of AstraZeneca.
Drug importation and anti-trust litigation 
In August 2004, Californian retail pharmacy 
plaintiffs filed an action in the Superior 
Court of California alleging a conspiracy 
by AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical 
manufacturer defendants to set the price 
of drugs sold in California at or above 
the Canadian sales price for those drugs 
and otherwise restrict the importation of 
pharmaceuticals into the US. In April 2013, 
following the denial by the California 
Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the 
lower court’s decisions in AstraZeneca’s 
favour, the plaintiffs filed a writ of certiorari 
to the US Supreme Court seeking an 
appeal, which was denied in June 2013.
Medco qui tam litigation (Schumann) 
The US District Court for the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania (District Court) dismissed a 
qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuit filed against 
AstraZeneca that was based upon 
allegations that AstraZeneca submitted 
false pricing information to the government 
and made improper payments intended to 
influence the formulary status of Prilosec 
and Nexium to Medco and its customers 
in violation of the federal and certain state 
False Claim Acts. In February 2013, 
the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the 
US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 
regarding the District Court’s decision to 
dismiss AstraZeneca from the litigation 
with prejudice.
Shionogi arbitration Crestor 
royalty calculation
In July 2012, Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) 
initiated arbitration proceedings to resolve 
issues relating to the treatment of certain 
excise taxes and other specific items in the 
calculation of royalties on Crestor sales. 
In December 2013, AstraZeneca and 
Shionogi announced the full resolution 
of the arbitration proceedings.
and we are confident that our settlement 
agreements fully comply with applicable law. 
AstraZeneca will continue to vigorously 
contest plaintiffs’ factual allegations, legal 
theories and assertion of damages.
Plaintiffs seek damages, subject to trebling 
under federal law and some state laws, 
based on the difference between the price 
the alleged classes paid for Nexium and 
the price they claim they would have 
paid for generic esomeprazole beginning 
in April 2008 (and several other later, 
alternative dates) to the present. Plaintiffs 
have indicated that, based on certain factual 
assumptions, they believe the range of 
possible damages for the proposed classes, 
prior to trebling, is in the range of $9.7bn 
to $27.1bn. AstraZeneca believes that 
the plaintiffs’ damages scenarios are 
speculative, contrary to fact and without 
merit and are not a reasonable estimate 
of the expected financial effect, if any, 
that will result from ultimate resolution of 
the proceedings. Further legal, procedural, 
evidentiary and potentially dispositive 
rulings by the courts could significantly 
impact the range of possible damages 
plaintiffs ultimately may be able to seek, 
if any. No provision has been taken in 
respect of this matter.
In September 2013, after having heard oral 
argument in April 2013, the US District Court 
for the District of Massachusetts (the court 
which is hearing the consolidated MDL 
proceeding) issued a Memorandum and 
Order denying defendants’ motion to dismiss 
with respect to certain of plaintiffs’ claims, 
and granting in part and denying in part 
defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding 
other claims. 
In November 2013, the Court granted the 
end-payers’ motion for class certification, 
and in December 2013 the Court granted 
the direct purchasers’ motion for class 
certification. AstraZeneca and the other 
defendants have filed petitions seeking 
appellate review of both decisions. 
In November 2013, the Court denied 
AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., Ranbaxy Inc., and Ranbaxy Laboratories 
Ltd.’s (together, Ranbaxy) motion for 
summary judgment on the grounds that 
the plaintiffs’ claims with respect to the 
2008 settlement agreement are barred 
by the four-year statute of limitations. 
On 4 December 2013, the Court denied 
AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy’s motion for 
reconsideration of that decision. AstraZeneca 
has filed a petition seeking appellate review 
of the denial of this motion in connection with 
a review of the class certification rulings.

Government investigations/proceedings 
Except as otherwise noted, the precise 
parameters of the following inquiries are 
unknown, and AstraZeneca is not in a 
position at this time to predict the scope, 
duration or outcome of these matters, 
including whether they will result in any 
liability to AstraZeneca.
Brilinta (ticagrelor) 
In October 2013, AstraZeneca received 
a civil investigative demand from the US 
Department of Justice, Civil Division seeking 
documents and information regarding PLATO, 
a clinical trial about Brilinta. AstraZeneca  
is co-operating with the inquiry.
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
Department of Justice/Attorney General 
of Texas investigation
AstraZeneca received a subpoena from the 
Department of Justice and a Civil Investigative 
Demand issued by the Attorney General of 
Texas in connection with an investigation of 
the possible submission of false or otherwise 
improper pricing information for certain 
formulations of Nexium to the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services. In March 
2013, the federal case was dismissed with 
prejudice as to the relator, with the consent 
of the government, and without prejudice 
to the US government. In addition, the state 
case has been dismissed with prejudice as 
to the relator and without prejudice to the 
State of Texas. 
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate) and 
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate)
US Attorney’s Office investigations
In September 2013, AstraZeneca received 
a subpoena duces tecum from the US 
Attorney’s Office in Boston seeking 
documents and information related to the 
safety profile of Seroquel. AstraZeneca is 
co-operating with this inquiry. 
In July 2012, AstraZeneca received a civil 
investigative demand from the Office of 
the Attorney General for the State of Texas 
in connection with an investigation related 
to sales and marketing activities potentially 
involving Seroquel. AstraZeneca is 
co-operating with this inquiry.
The US Department of Justice is 
conducting an investigation related to sales 
and marketing activities involving Seroquel 
XR, in response to the filing of qui tam 
(whistleblower) lawsuits. In January  
2014, AstraZeneca was advised that  
the Department of Justice and all of the 
states, except for the State of Texas, intend 
to file a notice of non-intervention in the 
federal case. 
Synagis (palivizumab)
In June 2011, MedImmune received a 
demand from the US Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of New York requesting 
certain documents related to the sales  
and marketing activities of Synagis. In July 
2011, MedImmune received a similar court 
order to produce documents from the 
Office of the Attorney General for the State 
of New York Medicaid and Fraud Control 
Unit pursuant to what the government 
attorneys advised was a joint investigation. 
MedImmune has accepted receipt of these 
requests and is co-ordinating with the 
government offices to provide the 
appropriate responses and co-operate 
with any related investigation.
In May 2012, MedImmune received a 
subpoena duces tecum from the Office of 
Attorney General for the State of Florida 
Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit requesting 
certain documents related to the sales and 
marketing activities of Synagis. MedImmune 
has accepted receipt of the request and is 
co-ordinating with the Florida government 
to provide the appropriate responses and 
co-operate with any related investigation. 
AstraZeneca is unaware of the nature or 
focus of the investigation, however, based 
on the nature of the requests, it appears  
to be similar to the inquiries from the State 
of New York and Department of Justice 
(which is described above).
Other US Attorney’s Offices investigations
The US Attorney’s Offices in Alabama, 
Delaware and Texas along with the US 
Department of Justice are conducting 
investigations related to sales and marketing 
activities involving Crestor and Seroquel. 
In January 2014, AstraZeneca was advised 
that the Department of Justice and all of the 
states, except for the State of Texas, intend 
to file a notice of non-intervention in the 
federal case with regard to Seroquel.
With regard to the Crestor investigation, 
the US Attorney’s Offices and all states, 
except for the State of Texas, have declined 
to intervene in the civil component of the 
investigation. Additional components of the 
investigation by the Department of Justice, 
as well as an investigation by the Texas 
Office of Attorney General, continue.
Dutch National Competition 
Authority investigation
The Dutch National Competition 
Authority (now the ACM, formerly the 
NMa) investigation into alleged abuse of a 
dominant position is ongoing. The file remains 
with the Legal Department of the ACM and 
AstraZeneca expects a decision in 2014.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In connection with an investigation into 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues in  
the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca 
has received inquiries from the US 
Department of Justice and the SEC 
regarding, among other things, sales 
practices, internal controls, certain 
distributors and interactions with healthcare 
providers and other government officials  
in several countries. AstraZeneca is  
co-operating with these inquiries. 
AstraZeneca is investigating indications of 
inappropriate conduct in certain countries, 
including China. Resolution of this matter 
could involve the payment of fines and/or 
other remedies. 
Good Manufacturing Practices Subpoena
In March 2013, AstraZeneca received 
a subpoena duces tecum from the US 
Attorney’s Office in Boston seeking 
documents and information relating to 
products manufactured or packaged at 
AstraZeneca’s Macclesfield facility in the UK. 
AstraZeneca is co-operating with this inquiry.
India 
In February 2012, the Indian Central Bureau 
of Investigation (CBI) filed a First Information 
Report in the court in Delhi against 
AstraZeneca and public officials of the 
Central Procurement Agency of the Delhi 
Directorate of Health Services (DHS) in 
connection with circumstances surrounding 
the submission by AstraZeneca of an 
alleged false affidavit in relation to pricing 
as part of a tender for Meronem entered 
into by AstraZeneca with the DHS in 2009. 
The CBI has now concluded its investigation 
and a charge sheet was filed with the court 
in August 2013, but neither AstraZeneca, 
nor any AstraZeneca employee, has been 
charged with any offence. 
Medco
The US Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Delaware, Criminal Division, is conducting 
an investigation relating to AstraZeneca’s 
relationship with Medco and sales of Nexium, 
Plendil, Prilosec and Toprol-XL. In addition, 
the US Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Delaware and the Department of Justice 
are investigating potential civil claims 
relating to the same conduct. 
Serbia
In August 201 1, AstraZeneca’s Representative 
Office in Belgrade, Serbia (the Representative 
Office) was served with a criminal indictment 
alleging that local employees of AstraZeneca 
and several other pharmaceutical companies 
made allegedly improper payments to 
physicians at the Institute of Oncology and 
Radiology of Serbia. In December 2013, the 
Representative Office reached an agreement 
with the Serbian prosecutor, pursuant 
to which the prosecutor dismissed the 
indictment. A provision has been taken.
Additional government inquiries
As is true for most, if not all, major 
prescription pharmaceutical companies 
operating in the US, AstraZeneca is currently 
involved in multiple US federal and state 
inquiries into drug marketing and pricing 
practices. In addition to the investigations 
described above, various federal and state 
law enforcement offices have, from time 
to time, requested information from the 
Company. There have been no material 
developments in those matters.

may reduce in the future to the extent that 
any tax authority challenge is unsuccessful, 
or matters lapse following expiry of the 
relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a 
reduction in the tax charge in future periods.
Other tax contingencies 
Included in the tax accrual is $2,053m 
relating to a number of other tax 
contingencies, an increase of $207m mainly 
due to the impact of an additional year of 
transactions relating to contingencies for 
which accruals had already been established 
and exchange rate effects. For these tax 
exposures, AstraZeneca does not expect 
material additional losses. It is, however, 
possible that some of these contingencies 
may reduce in the future if any tax authority 
challenge is unsuccessful or matters lapse 
following expiry of the relevant statutes of 
limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax 
charge in future periods. 
Timing of cash flows and interest 
It is not possible to estimate the timing of 
tax cash flows in relation to each outcome, 
however, it is anticipated that a number of 
significant disputes may be resolved over 
the next one to two years. Included in the 
provision is an amount of interest of $344m 
(2012: $248m; 2011: $291m). Interest is 
accrued as a tax expense.
tax contingencies require management to 
make estimates and judgements with respect 
to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit, 
and actual results could vary from these 
estimates. The international tax environment 
presents increasingly challenging dynamics 
for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. 
These disputes usually result in taxable 
profits being increased in one territory 
and correspondingly decreased in another. 
Our balance sheet positions for these 
matters reflect appropriate corresponding 
relief in the territories affected. Management 
considers that at present such corresponding 
relief will be available, but given the challenges 
in the international tax environment will keep 
this aspect under careful review.
Management continues to believe that 
AstraZeneca’s positions on all its transfer 
pricing audits and disputes are robust and 
that AstraZeneca is appropriately provided. 
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca 
and the tax authorities are in dispute, 
AstraZeneca estimates the potential for 
reasonably possible additional losses above 
and beyond the amount provided to be up 
to $529m (2012: $522m; 2011: $375m), 
however, management believes that it is 
unlikely that these additional losses will arise. 
It is possible that some of these contingencies 
Tax
Where tax exposures can be quantified, 
an accrual is made based on best estimates 
and management’s judgement. Details of 
the movements in relation to material tax 
exposures are discussed below. As accruals 
can be built up over a long period of time 
but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures 
usually occurs at a point in time, and given 
the inherent uncertainties in assessing the 
outcomes of these exposures (which 
sometimes can be binary in nature), we could, 
in future periods, experience adjustments 
to these accruals that have a material 
positive or negative effect on our results in 
any particular period.
Transfer pricing and other international 
tax contingencies
The total net accrual included in the Group 
Financial Statements to cover the worldwide 
exposure to transfer pricing audits is $523m, 
an increase of $100m compared to 2012.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer 
pricing audits in jurisdictions around the 
world and, in some cases, is in dispute 
with the tax authorities. The issues under 
discussion are often complex and can 
require many years to resolve. Accruals for

28 Subsequent events
Acquisition of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s share of global diabetes alliance assets
On 1 February 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of BMS’s interests in the companies’ diabetes alliance. The acquisition provides 
AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and commercialisation 
of the diabetes business, which includes Onglyza (saxagliptin), Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended release), 
Komboglyze (saxagliptin and metformin HCl), Farxiga (dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US), Byetta (exenatide), Bydureon 
(exenatide extended release for injectable suspension), metreleptin and Symlin (pramlintide acetate).
The transaction consolidates worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care 
capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in Emerging Markets. The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share 
capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned 
by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga. In total, 
approximately 3,900 BMS employees are expected to transfer as part of the acquisition. This combination of intangible product rights 
and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the 
global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, requires that the acquisition is accounted for as a business combination in 
accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1 February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable 
for future regulatory-launch and sales-related milestones. AstraZeneca has also agreed to pay various sales-related royalty payments 
up until 2025. The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link 
to future sales and the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated. The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference 
to net sales and is therefore, theoretically, unlimited until royalties cease in 2025. AstraZeneca may also make payments up to $225m 
when certain additional assets are subsequently transferred. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, 
with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays. In accordance with IFRS 3, the fair value of 
contingent consideration, including future royalties, is recognised immediately as a liability.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca has entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and 
supply chain of the full portfolio of diabetes products. BMS will also continue to deliver specified clinical trials in line with the ongoing 
clinical trial plan, with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress 
the diabetes portfolio and support the transition for these areas. These arrangements will be carried out over future periods and future 
payments by AstraZeneca to BMS in relation to these arrangements will be expensed as incurred. No amounts have been recognised in 
the initial acquisition accounting in relation to these arrangements but have been separated, at fair value, from the business combination 
accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 185
28 Subsequent events continued
The terms of the agreement partially reflect settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and 
Farxiga collaboration agreements, which have been terminated in relation to the acquisition. The expected value of those pre-existing 
milestones is $0.3bn and has been recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination 
accounting in accordance with IFRS 3. Separate intangible assets will be recognised.
Goodwill of $1.6bn is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these are 
the synergies AstraZeneca expect to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the incremental value 
accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance. 
The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximates the gross contractual amounts receivable. There are no 
significant amounts which are not expected to be collected.
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance will be consolidated into the Company’s results from 
1 February 2014.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period (1 January 2013), on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the 
combined Group for 2013 would have been $26,700m and the profit after tax would have been $1,750m. This pro forma information 
has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects, but does not purport to represent the 
results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2013 and should not  
be taken to be representative of future results.
Given the proximity of the completion of the transaction to the date that the Financial Statements were approved, the finalisation of  
the accounting entries for this transaction has yet to be completed. Our provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities acquired, and of the fair value of the consideration payable, is detailed below. Our assessment will be completed in 2014.

Company Balance Sheet
at 31 December AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 189
Basis of accounting
The Company Financial Statements are 
prepared under the historical cost convention 
in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and UK GAAP . The Group Financial 
Statements are presented on pages 132  
to 186 and have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
the EU and as issued by the IASB and in 
accordance with the Group Accounting 
Policies set out on pages 136 to 140.
The following paragraphs describe the 
main accounting policies under UK GAAP, 
which have been applied consistently.
Accounting standards issued 
but not yet adopted
FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and the Republic of 
Ireland’ has been issued but not yet adopted 
by the Company. It is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
Foreign currencies
Profit and loss account items in foreign 
currencies are translated into US dollars at 
average rates for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the date of 
the Company Balance Sheet. Exchange 
gains and losses on loans and on short-
term foreign currency borrowings and 
deposits are included within net interest 
payable. Exchange differences on all other 
transactions, except relevant foreign currency 
loans, are taken to operating profit.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the 
result for the year and takes into account 
taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and for accounting 
purposes. Full provision is made for the 
effects of these differences. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised where it is more 
likely than not that the amount will be 
realised in the future. These estimates 
require judgements to be made including 
the forecast of future taxable income. 
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to tax audit issues. 
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the 
tax positions will probably be sustained. 
Once considered to be probable, 
management reviews each material tax 
benefit to assess whether a provision should 
be taken against full recognition of that 
benefit on the basis of potential settlement 
through negotiation and/or litigation.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax 
liabilities is provided for in the tax charge. 
All provisions are included in creditors due 
within one year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including 
investments in subsidiaries, are stated at 
cost less any provision for impairment.
Share-based payments
The issuance by the Company to employees 
of its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over 
the Company’s shares represents additional 
capital contributions by the Company to 
its subsidiaries. An additional investment 
in subsidiaries results in a corresponding 
increase in shareholders’ equity. The 
additional capital contribution is based on 
the fair value of the grant issued, allocated 
over the underlying grant’s vesting period, 
less the market cost of shares charged to 
subsidiaries in settlement of such share 
awards.
Financial instruments
Loans and other receivables are held at 
amortised cost. Long-term loans payable 
are held at amortised cost.
Litigation
Through the normal course of business, 
AstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, 
the settlement of which may involve cost  
to the Company. Provision is made where 
an adverse outcome is probable and 
associated costs can be estimated reliably. 
In other cases, appropriate descriptions 
are included.

All loans are at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, the fair values of the loans will change as market rates change. However, since the loans 
are held at amortised cost, changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the Company do not have any effect on the Company’s 
net assets.

7 Litigation and environmental liabilities
In addition to those matters disclosed below, there are other cases where the Company is named as a party to legal proceedings. 
These include the Seroquel IR product liability litigation and the Nexium product liability litigation each of which are described more fully 
in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received 
inquiries from the US Department of Justice and the SEC regarding, among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain 
distributors and interactions with healthcare providers and other government officials in several countries. AstraZeneca is cooperating 
with these inquiries. AstraZeneca is investigating indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. Resolution 
of this matter could involve the payment of fines and/or other remedies. 
Dutch National Competition Authority investigation
The Dutch National Competition Authority (now the ACM, formerly the NMa) investigation into alleged abuse of a dominant position  
is ongoing. The file remains with the Legal Department of the ACM and AstraZeneca expects a decision in 2014.

 Restatement on adoption of IAS 19 (2011) as detailed in Group Accounting Policies.
For the purpose of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of the income from continuing ordinary activities 
before taxation of Group companies and income received from companies owned 50% or less, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges 
consist of interest on all indebtedness, amortisation of debt discount and expense, and that portion of rental expense representative  
of the interest factor.
Group Financial Record
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Throughout the development process, we strive to obtain patent protection consistent with our patent process (as described in the 
Intellectual Property section from page 72). However, until marketing approval in individual countries is obtained, it is not possible to 
accurately predict the maximum period of product protection available from any such patents. While the most significant uncertainties for 
development pipeline products progressing to launch are meeting development targets and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals (as 
detailed in the Risk section from page 199), the date and language of any actual marketing approval will crucially determine the length of 
Patent Term Extension and the full range, if any, of pending patents that will protect the marketed product. Further details of possible 
periods of patent, RDP and related IP protections which may protect pipeline products once marketed are included from page 198.

Additional Information
Patent Expiries In the Strategy section on page 10, we 
provide an overview of the risks we face  
and what we are doing to address them.  
In this section we describe in further detail 
our key risk management and assurance 
mechanisms and the principal risks and 
uncertainties which we consider to be 
material to our business, as they may have  
a significant effect on our financial condition, 
results of operations and/or reputation. 
Specific risks and uncertainties are also 
discussed in the Strategic Report from  
page 2, where relevant. 
Managing risk
As an innovation-driven, global, prescription-
based biopharmaceutical business, we face 
a diverse range of risks and uncertainties 
that may adversely affect our business. Our 
approach to risk management is designed 
to encourage clear decision making as to 
which risks we take and how these are 
managed, based on an understanding of 
the potential strategic, commercial, financial, 
compliance, legal and reputational 
implications of these risks.
We work continuously to ensure that we 
have effective risk management processes 
in place to support the delivery of our 
strategic objectives, the material needs of 
our stakeholders and our core values. We 
monitor our business activities and external 
and internal environments for new, emerging 
and changing risks to ensure that these  
are managed appropriately as they arise.
The Board believes that the processes  
and accountabilities which are in place 
(described below) provide it with adequate 
information on the key risks and uncertainties 
we face. Further information about these 
risks and uncertainties is set out in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
from page 200.
Risk management embedded in 
business processes 
We strive to ensure that sound risk 
management is embedded within our 
strategy, planning, budgeting and 
performance management processes.  
The Board has defined the Group’s risk 
appetite expressing the acceptable levels  
of risk for the Group using three key 
dimensions. These are: (i) earnings and 
cash flow; (ii) return on investment; and (iii) 
potential impact on our reputation. This 
definition provides a clear statement by  
the Board of its position on risk which 
enables the Group, in both quantitative  
and qualitative terms, to judge the level of 
risk it is prepared to take so as to achieve  
its overall objectives. 
Annually, the Group develops a long-term 
business plan to support the delivery of its 
strategy, which the Board reviews to ensure 
that it conforms to its risk appetite. Our risk 
management approach is aligned to our 
strategy and business planning processes. 
Line managers are accountable for 
identifying and managing risks, and for 
delivering business objectives in 
accordance with the Group’s risk appetite. 
Each area for which a SET member is 
responsible (a SET function) is required  
to provide an assessment of its key risks 
annually. Identified risks are mapped to 
AstraZeneca’s risk ‘taxonomy’, providing  
a structured disaggregation of the various 
potential risks facing the Group. SET 
functions are required to provide quarterly 
updates identifying changes to the key risks, 
their mitigation plans, new or emerging 
significant risks and any key events that may 
have occurred. The quarterly updates are 
then aggregated into a Group risk report  
for SET and Audit Committee review. 
Supporting tools are in place to assist the 
managers in this process and we continue 
to work on developing our risk management 
standards and guidelines.
We develop business continuity plans to 
provide for situations where specific risks 
have the potential to severely impact our 
business. These plans are supported by  
the provision of training and crisis simulation 
activities for business managers. 
Key responsibilities 
Internal Audit Services (IA) 
IA is an independent assurance and 
advisory function that reports, and is 
accountable, to the Audit Committee. 
IA’s budget, resources and programme of 
audits are approved by the Audit Committee 
annually and the findings from its audit  
work are reported to, and discussed at, 
each Audit Committee meeting. A core  
part of the audit work carried out by IA 
includes assessing how we are managing 
risk and reviewing the effectiveness of 
selected aspects of our risk control 
framework, including the effectiveness  
of other assurance and compliance 
functions within the business. 
Global Compliance 
Our Global Compliance function has been 
established to drive and embed a culture of 
ethics and integrity within our organisation. 
Our key compliance priorities include:
 > focusing our efforts on important 
compliance risk areas 
 > communicating clear policies to 
employees 
 > improving compliance behaviours through 
effective training and support 
 > ensuring employees can raise concerns 
and that those concerns will be properly 
addressed 
 > ensuring fair and objective investigations 
of possible policy breaches 
 > monitoring and auditing compliance with 
policies 
 > providing key stakeholders with 
assurance and effective reporting of 
material issues.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
199 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Risk These priorities are closely aligned to the 
Group’s strategy and reflect our drive to 
strengthen our efforts for oversight at all 
levels of our business, including risk 
management relating to external parties and 
anti-bribery/anti-corruption. IA and Global 
Compliance work closely with one another 
and both separately provide assurance 
reporting to the Audit Committee. Through 
the Group Compliance Council, Global 
Compliance and IA work with a range  
of specialist compliance functions 
throughout our organisation to co-ordinate 
compliance activities.
When a potential compliance breach is 
identified, an internal investigation is 
undertaken by appropriate staff from our 
Global Compliance, HR and/or Legal teams. 
When appropriate, external advisers are 
engaged to conduct and/or advise on 
investigations. Should an investigation 
conclude that an actual breach has 
occurred, management, in consultation  
with our Legal function, will consider 
whether the Group needs to make a 
disclosure and/or to report the findings  
to a regulatory or governmental authority. 
More information on IA and our overall risk 
management and control framework can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report 
from page 88. 
Management of risk
Day-to-day risk management is delegated 
from the Board to the CEO and through the 
SET to line managers. SET functions are 
accountable for establishing an appropriate 
line management-led process and for 
providing the resources for supporting 
effective risk management.
Line and project managers have primary 
responsibility, within the context of their 
functional area, for identifying and managing 
risk as well as for putting in place 
appropriate controls and procedures to 
monitor effectiveness.
Oversight and monitoring
The SET is responsible for overseeing  
and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes implemented by 
management. The Global Compliance  
and Finance functions, together with IA, 
support the SET by advising on policy and 
standard setting, monitoring and auditing, 
communication and training, as well  
as reporting on the adequacy of line 
management processes as they apply  
to managing our risk. 
Our compliance organisation is comprised 
of the Global Compliance function together 
with a wide range of specialist compliance 
functions. Further information about Global 
Compliance and the Code of Conduct can 
be found in the Corporate Governance 
Report from page 88. 
Management reporting and assurance 
We provide quarterly risk reports to the  
SET and to the Board. Among other things, 
these summarise our current assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including environmental, social and 
governance risks, senior management 
accountability and our expected plans  
in order to address these risks, to the  
extent possible.
The Audit Committee comprises five 
Non-Executive Directors. It reviews and 
reports to the Board following each  
Audit Committee meeting on the overall 
framework of risk management and internal 
controls, and is responsible for promptly 
bringing to the Board’s attention any 
significant concerns about the conduct, 
results or outcomes of internal audits and

Principal risks and uncertainties 
Operating in the pharmaceutical sector 
carries a number of inherent risks and 
uncertainties that may affect our business. 
In the remainder of this section we describe 
the principal risks and uncertainties which 
we consider to be material to our business 
in that they may have a significant effect on 
our financial condition, results of operations 
and/or reputation. 
These risks are not listed in any particular 
order of priority. Other risks, unknown  
or not currently considered material, could 
have a similar effect. We believe that the 
forward-looking statements about 
AstraZeneca in this Annual Report, identified 
by words such as ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, 
‘expects’ and ‘intends’, and that include, 
among other things, the statements made  
in the Chairman’s Statement – Outlook  
on page 7 , and Our strategic priorities – 
Financial expectations on page 17 , are 
based on reasonable assumptions. 
However, forward-looking statements 
involve inherent risks and uncertainties such 
as those summarised below. They relate to 
events that may occur in the future, that may 
be influenced by factors beyond our control 
and that may have actual outcomes 
materially different from our expectations.

Failure to meet development targets Impact
The development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a 
complex, risky and lengthy process involving significant financial, 
R&D and other resources, which may fail at any stage of the 
process due to a number of factors. These include: failure to 
obtain the required regulatory or marketing approvals for the 
product candidate or its manufacturing facilities; unfavourable 
clinical efficacy data; safety concerns; failure of R&D to develop 
new product candidates; failure to demonstrate adequate 
cost-effective benefits to reimbursement authorities; and the 
emergence of competing products. 
Production and release schedules for biologics may be more 
significantly impacted by regulatory processes than other 
products. This is due to more complex and stringent regulation 
on the manufacturing of biologics and their supply chain.
A succession of negative drug project results and a failure to 
reduce development timelines effectively, or produce new 
products that achieve commercial success, could adversely 
affect the reputation of our R&D capabilities, and is likely to 
materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.
Difficulties of obtaining and maintaining 
regulatory approvals for new products 
Impact
We are subject to strict controls on the commercialisation 
processes for our pharmaceutical products, including their 
development, manufacture, distribution and marketing. Safety, 
efficacy and quality must be established before a drug can be 
marketed for a given indication. The criteria for establishing 
safety, efficacy and quality may vary by country or region and  
the submission of an application to regulatory authorities may or 
may not lead to the grant of marketing approval. Regulators can 
refuse to grant approval or may require additional data before 
approval is given, even though the medicine may already be 
launched in other countries. Approved products are also subject 
to regulations, and a failure to comply can potentially result in 
losing regulatory approval to market our products.
Factors including advances in science and technology, evolving 
regulatory science, and changes in benefit/risk tolerance by 
health authorities, the general public, and other third party public 
interest groups influence the initial approvability of new drugs. 
Existing marketed products are also subject to these same 
forces, and new data and meta-analyses have the potential to 
drive changes in the approval status or labelling. Recent years 
have seen an increase in post-marketing regulatory requirements 
and commitments, and an increased call for third party access to 
regulatory and clinical trial data packages for independent 
analysis and interpretation. 
The predictability of the outcome and timing of review processes 
remains challenging due to evolving regulatory science, 
competing regulatory priorities and downward pressure on 
health authority resources.
Delays in regulatory reviews and approvals could impact patient 
and market access. In addition, the increase in post-approval 
activities requires increased resources and could impact the 
labelling and approval status of currently marketed products.
Failure to obtain and enforce effective  
IP protection
Impact
Our ability to obtain and enforce patents and other IP rights  
in relation to our products is an important element of our ability  
to protect our investment in R&D and create long-term value  
for the business. A number of the countries in which we operate 
are still developing their IP laws or may even be limiting the 
applicability of these laws to pharmaceutical inventions. Adverse 
political perspectives on the desirability of strong IP protection  
for pharmaceuticals in certain emerging and even developed 
markets may limit the scope for us to obtain effective IP 
protection for our products. As a result, certain countries may 
seek to limit or deny effective IP protection for pharmaceuticals.
Limitations on the availability of patent protection or the use of 
compulsory licensing in certain countries in which we operate 
could have a material adverse effect on the pricing and sales of 
our products and, consequently, could materially adversely affect 
our revenues from those products. More information about 
protecting our IP is contained in the Intellectual Property section 
on page 72. Information about the risk of patent litigation and the 
early loss of IP rights is contained in the Expiry or loss of, or 
limitations on, IP rights risk on page 204.

201 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Product pipeline risks continued
Delay to new product launches Impact
Our continued success depends on the development and 
successful launch of innovative new drugs. The anticipated 
launch dates of major new products have a significant impact on 
a number of areas of our business, including investment in large 
clinical studies, the manufacture of pre-launch product stocks, 
investment in marketing materials pre-launch, sales force training 
and the timing of anticipated future revenue streams from new 
product sales. These launch dates are primarily driven by the 
development programmes that we run and the demands of the 
regulatory authorities in the approvals process, as well as pricing 
negotiations. Delays to anticipated launch dates can result from  
a number of factors including adverse findings in pre-clinical or 
clinical studies, regulatory demands, price negotiation, 
competitor activity and technology transfer.
Significant delays to anticipated launch dates of new products 
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
and/or results of operations. For example, for the launch of 
products that are seasonal in nature, delays in regulatory 
approvals or manufacturing difficulties may delay launch to the 
next season which, in turn, may significantly reduce the return  
on costs incurred in preparing for the launch for that season.  
In addition, a delay in the launch may lead to increased costs if, 
for example, marketing and sales efforts need to be rescheduled 
or protracted for longer than expected.
Strategic alliances and acquisitions may  
be unsuccessful
Impact
We seek technology licensing arrangements and strategic 
collaborations to expand our product portfolio and geographical 
presence as part of our business strategy. 
Such licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations are 
key, enabling us to grow and strengthen the business. The 
success of such arrangements is largely dependent on the 
technology and other IP we acquire rights to, and the resources, 
efforts and skills of our partners. Also, under many of our 
strategic alliances, we make milestone payments well in advance 
of the commercialisation of the products, with no assurance  
that we will recoup these payments. 
Furthermore, we experience strong competition from other 
pharmaceutical companies in respect of licensing arrangements, 
strategic collaborations, and acquisition targets, and therefore, 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing some of our  
intended projects. 
We may also seek to acquire complementary businesses  
as part of our business strategy. The integration of an acquired 
business could involve incurring significant debt and unknown  
or contingent liabilities, as well as having a negative effect on  
our reported results of operations from acquisition related 
charges, amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and 
charges for the implementation of long-term assets. We  
may also experience difficulties in integrating geographically 
separated organisations, systems and facilities, and personnel 
with different organisational cultures. 
If we fail to complete these types of collaborative projects in a 
timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, this may limit 
our ability to access a greater portfolio of products, IP technology 
and shared expertise. 
Additionally, disputes or difficulties in our relationship with our 
collaborators or partners may arise, often due to conflicting 
priorities or conflicts of interest between parties, which may 
erode or eliminate the benefits of these alliances. 
The incurrence of significant debt or liabilities as a result of 
integration of an acquired business could cause deterioration  
in our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and 
interest expense. 
Further, if, following an acquisition, liabilities are uncovered in the 
acquired business, the Group may suffer losses and may not 
have remedies against the seller or third parties. The integration 
process may also result in business disruption, diversion of 
management resources, the loss of key employees and other 
issues, such as a failure to integrate IT and other systems.

Challenges to achieving commercial success of 
new products
Impact
The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves 
substantial investment in sales and marketing activities, launch 
stocks and other items. The commercial success of our new 
medicines is of particular importance to us in order to replace 
lost sales following patent expiry. We may ultimately be unable  
to achieve commercial success for any number of reasons. 
These include difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities  
of the product candidate for development or commercialisation 
in a timely manner, the impact of price control measures 
imposed by governments and healthcare authorities, the 
outcome of negotiations with third party payers, erosion of IP 
rights, including infringement by third parties and failure to show 
a differentiated product profile. 
As a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently 
under development will achieve success, and our ability to 
accurately assess, prior to launch, the eventual efficacy or safety 
of a new product once in broader clinical use can only be based 
on data available at that time, which is inherently limited due to 
relatively short periods of product testing and relatively small 
clinical study patient samples. 
The commercialisation of biologics is often more complex than 
for small molecule pharmaceutical products, primarily due to 
differences in the mode of administration, technical aspects of 
the product and rapidly changing distribution and reimbursement 
environments.
If a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate of 
sales growth is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that we 
may be unable to fully recoup the costs incurred in launching it, 
which could materially adversely affect our business or results  
of operations. 
Due to the complexity of the commercialisation process for 
biologics, the methods of distributing and marketing biologics 
could materially adversely impact our revenues from the sales  
of products, such as Synagis and FluMist/Fluenz.
Illegal trade in our products Impact
Illegal trade covers the theft, illegal diversion and counterfeiting of 
our products. Illegal trade in pharmaceutical products is estimated 
to exceed $75 billion per year and is generally considered by the 
industry, non-governmental organisations and governmental 
authorities to be increasing. We suffer a commensurate financial 
exposure to illegal trade and there is also a risk to public health. 
Regulators and the public expect us to secure the integrity of our 
supply chain and to co-operate actively in the reduction of illegal 
trade in AstraZeneca products, through surveillance, investigation 
and legal action against others engaged in illegal trade.
Public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical 
products as a result of counterfeiting could materially adversely 
affect our reputation and financial performance. In addition, 
undue or misplaced concern about the issue may induce some 
patients to stop taking their medicines, with consequential risks 
to their health. There is also a direct financial loss where 
counterfeit medicines replace sales of genuine products and 
where genuine products are recalled following discovery of 
counterfeit, stolen and/or illegally traded products in an effort  
to regain control of the integrity of the supply chain.
Developing our business in Emerging Markets Impact
The development of our business in Emerging Markets is a 
critical factor in determining our future ability to sustain or 
increase our global product revenues. This poses various 
challenges including: more volatile economic conditions; 
competition from multinational and local companies with existing 
market presence; the need to identify correctly and to leverage 
appropriate opportunities for sales and marketing; poor IP 
protection; inadequate protection against crime (including 
counterfeiting, corruption and fraud); the need to impose 
developed market compliance standards; the need to meet  
a more diverse range of national regulatory, clinical and 
manufacturing requirements; inadvertent breaches of local and 
international law; not being able to recruit appropriately skilled 
and experienced personnel; identification of the most effective 
sales channels and route to market; and interventions by national 
governments or regulators restricting access to market and/or 
introducing adverse price controls.
The failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in 
Emerging Markets may materially adversely affect our reputation, 
business or results of operations.

203 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Commercialisation and business execution risks continued
Expiry or loss of, or limitations on, IP rights Impact
Pharmaceutical products are only protected from being copied 
during the limited period of protection under patent rights and/or 
related IP rights such as Regulatory Data Protection or orphan 
drug status. Expiry or loss of these rights typically leads to the 
immediate launch of generic copies of the product in the country 
where the rights have expired or been lost. See the Patent 
Expiries section on page 198, which contains a table of certain 
patent expiry dates for our key marketed products. 
Additionally, the expiry or loss of patents covering other innovator 
companies’ products may also lead to increased competition  
for our own, still-patented, products in the same product  
class due to the availability of generic products in that product 
class. Further, there may be increased pricing pressure on  
our still-patented products as a result of the lower prices of 
generic entrants.
Products under patent protection or within the period of 
Regulatory Data Protection typically generate significantly higher 
revenues than those not protected by such rights. Our revenues, 
financial condition and results of operations may be materially 
adversely affected upon expiry or early loss of our IP rights, due 
to generic entrants into the market for the applicable product. 
Additionally, the loss of patent rights covering major products of 
other pharmaceutical companies may materially adversely affect 
the growth of our still-patented products in the same product 
class in that market.
Pressures resulting from generic competition Impact
Our products compete not only with other products approved  
for the same condition, marketed by research-based 
pharmaceutical companies, but also with generic drugs 
marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. These 
competitors may invest more of their resources into the 
marketing of their products than we do, depending on the 
relative priority of these competitor products within their 
company’s portfolio. Generic versions of products are often sold 
at lower prices than branded products, as the manufacturer 
does not have to recoup the significant cost of R&D investment 
and market development. The majority of our patented products, 
including Nexium, Crestor and Seroquel XR, are subject to price 
pressures as a result of competition from generic copies of these 
products and from generic forms of other drugs in the same 
product class (for example, generic forms of Losec/Prilosec  
and Lipitor , and generic forms of Seroquel IR). 
As well as facing generic competition upon expiry or loss of IP 
rights, we also face the risk that generic drug manufacturers 
seek to market generic versions of our products prior to expiries 
of our patents and/or the Regulatory Exclusivity periods. For 
example, we are currently facing challenges in the US from 
numerous generic drug manufacturers regarding our patents  
for Nexium and Pulmicort, two of our key products. Generic 
manufacturers may also take advantage of the failure of certain 
countries to properly enforce Regulatory Data Protection and 
may launch generics during this protected period. This is a 
particular risk in some Emerging Markets where appropriate 
patent protection may be difficult to obtain or enforce. 
If challenges to our patents by generic drug manufacturers 
succeed and generic products are launched, or generic 
products are launched ‘at risk’ on the expectation that 
challenges to our IP will be successful, this may materially 
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
In 2013, US sales for Nexium, Crestor and Seroquel XR  
were $2,123 million (2012: $2,272 million), $2,912 million  
(2012: $3,164 million), and $743 million (2012: $811 million), 
respectively. Furthermore, if limitations on the availability,  
scope or enforceability of patent protection are implemented  
in jurisdictions in which we operate, generic manufacturers  
in these countries may be increasingly able to introduce 
competing products to the market earlier than they would  
have been able to, had more robust patent or Regulatory Data 
Protection been available.
204 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Risk Effects of patent litigation in respect  
of IP rights
Impact
Any of the IP rights protecting our products may be asserted  
or challenged in IP litigation initiated against or by external 
parties. Such IP rights may also be the subject of validity 
challenges in patent offices. We expect our most valuable 
products to receive the greatest number of challenges. Despite 
our efforts to establish and defend robust patent protection for 
our products, we may not succeed in protecting our patents 
from such litigation or other challenges.
Where we assert our IP rights and allege infringement, we bear 
the risk that courts may decide that third parties do not infringe 
our IP rights. This may result in AstraZeneca losing exclusivity 
and/or erosion of revenues. Non-infringement defences are 
typically filed by third parties in response to patent infringement 
lawsuits including in so-called 505(b)(2) cases in the US. Details 
of 505(b)(2) actions can be found in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 176. 
Where we assert our IP rights but are ultimately unsuccessful, 
third parties may seek damages, alleging, for example, that they 
have been inappropriately restrained from entering the market.  
In such cases, we bear the risk that we incur liabilities to those 
third parties.
We also bear the risk that we may be found to infringe patents 
owned or licensed exclusively by third parties, including 
research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies and 
individuals. Infringement accusations may implicate, for example, 
our manufacturing processes, product intermediates or use of 
research tools. Details of significant infringement claims against 
us by third parties enforcing IP rights can be found in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 176.
If we are not successful in maintaining exclusive rights to market 
one or more of our major products, particularly in the US where 
we achieve our highest revenue, our revenue and margins could 
be materially adversely affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful 
in patent litigation, we may incur liabilities to third parties for 
damages incurred after enforcing our IP rights.
Managing or litigating infringement disputes over so-called 
‘freedom to operate’ can be costly. We may be subject to 
injunctions against our products or processes and be liable  
for damages or royalties. We may need to obtain costly licences. 
These risks may be greater in relation to biologics and vaccines, 
where patent infringement claims may relate to discovery  
or research tools, and manufacturing methods and/or biological 
materials. While we seek to manage such risks by, for example, 
acquiring licences, foregoing certain activities or uses, or 
modifying processes to avoid infringement claims and permit 
commercialisation of our products, such steps can entail 
significant cost and there is no guarantee that they will  
be successful.
Price controls and reductions Impact
Most of our key markets have experienced the implementation of 
various cost control or reimbursement mechanisms in respect of 
pharmaceutical products.
For example, in the US, realised prices are being depressed 
through restrictive reimbursement policies and cost control tools 
such as restricted lists and formularies, which employ ‘generic 
first’ strategies and/or require physicians to obtain prior approval 
for the use of a branded medicine where a generic alternative 
exists. These mechanisms can be used by payers to limit the  
use of branded products and put pressure on manufacturers  
to reduce net prices. In addition, payers are shifting a greater 
proportion of the cost of branded medicines to the patient via 
out-of-pocket payments at the pharmacy counter. The patient 
out-of-pocket spend is generally in the form of a co-payment or,  
in some cases, a co-insurance, which is designed, principally,  
to encourage patients to use generic medicines. 
A summary of the principal aspects of price regulation and how 
price pressures are affecting our business in our most important 
markets is set out in the Pricing pressure section from page 15 
and these economic pressures are also further discussed overleaf 
in the following risk factor.
Due to these pricing pressures, there can be no certainty that  
we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular 
country or in the aggregate, enable us to earn an adequate 
return on our product investment. These pressures, including  
the increasingly restrictive reimbursement policies to which we 
are subject, as well as the continued potential of new legislation 
expanding the scope of permitted commercial importation of 
medicines into the US, could materially adversely affect our 
business or results of operations. 
We expect that these pressures on pricing will continue, and  
may increase.

205 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Commercialisation and business execution risks continued
Economic, regulatory and political pressures Impact
We face continued economic, regulatory and political pressures 
to limit or reduce the cost of our products. 
In 2010, the US passed the Affordable Care Act, a 
comprehensive health reform package with provisions taking 
effect between 2010 and 2018. The law expands insurance 
coverage, implements delivery system reforms and places a 
renewed focus on cost and quality. In terms of specific provisions 
impacting our industry, the law mandates higher rebates and 
discounts on branded drugs for certain Medicare and Medicaid 
patients as well as an industry-wide excise fee. Implementation 
of several health system delivery reforms included in the law has 
commenced and will continue until 2018. 
The Affordable Care Act expands the patient population eligible 
for Medicaid and will provide new insurance coverage for 
individuals through state-operated and federal-operated health 
insurance exchanges from 2014. The pharmaceutical industry 
could be adversely impacted by such shifts if the health 
insurance exchanges do not offer a prescription drug benefit that 
is as robust as benefits historically provided by large employers. 
We anticipate further government intervention in the US in 
connection with the recent initiative to contain federal spending. 
For more information see the Regulatory requirements and 
Pricing pressure sections from page 14 and page 15, 
respectively.
In the EU, efforts by the European Commission to reduce 
inconsistencies and to improve standards in the disparate 
national pricing and reimbursement systems have met with  
little immediate success as Member States guard their right  
to make healthcare budget decisions. The industry continues  
to be exposed in Europe to a range of ad hoc cost-containment 
measures and reference pricing mechanisms, which impact 
prices. This pressure is likely to continue for several years as  
the Member States try to re-balance their sovereign debt levels. 
Concurrently, many markets are adopting the use of Health 
Technology Assessment (HTA) to provide a rigorous evaluation  
of the clinical efficacy of a product, at, or post, launch. HTA 
evaluations are also increasingly being used to assess the 
clinical, as well as cost-effectiveness, of products in a particular 
health system. This comes as payers and policymakers attempt 
to drive increased efficiencies in the use and choice of 
pharmaceutical products. 
Further information regarding these pressures is contained in  
the Regulatory requirements and Pricing pressure sections from 
page 14 and page 15, respectively.
It is not possible to accurately estimate the financial impact  
of the potential consequences resulting from the Affordable Care 
Act or related legislative changes when taken together with the 
number of other market-related and industry-related factors that 
can also result in similar impacts. While the overall reduction  
in our profit before tax for the year, due to higher minimum 
Medicaid rebates on prescription drugs, discounts on branded 
pharmaceutical sales to Medicare Part D beneficiaries and an 
industry-wide excise fee was $933 million, this reflects only the 
limited number of known, quantifiable and isolatable effects  
of these legislative developments. Other potential indirect or 
associated consequences of these legislative developments, 
which continue to evolve and which cannot be estimated, could 
have similar impacts. These include broader changes in access 
to, or eligibility for, coverage under Medicare, Medicaid or similar 
governmental programmes.
These continued disparities in pricing systems could lead to 
marked price differentials between markets, which, by way of the 
implementation of existing or new reference pricing mechanisms, 
increases the pricing pressure affecting the industry. The 
importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where 
prices are low due to government price controls, or other market 
dynamics, to countries where prices for those products are 
higher, is already prevalent and may increase. In particular, as 
discussed in the Pricing pressure section on page 15, eurozone 
crisis countries such as Greece and Portugal have introduced 
particularly tough measures to lower healthcare spending, 
including mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing 
rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
or results of operations.
206 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Risk Abbreviated approval processes for biosimilars Impact
While no application for a biosimilar has been made in relation  
to an AstraZeneca biologic, various regulatory authorities are 
implementing or considering abbreviated approval processes  
for biosimilars that would compete with patented biologics. 
For example, in 2010, the US enacted the Biologics Price 
Competition and Innovation Act within the Affordable Care Act, 
which contains general directives for biosimilar applications. The 
FDA issued draft guidance in February 2012 on implementing an 
abbreviated biosimilar approval pathway. However, significant 
questions remain, including standards for designation of 
interchangeability and data collection requirements to support 
extrapolation of indications. In 2012, the FDA also implemented 
user fee programmes to support biosimilar product review  
and policy development. In Europe, the EMA published final 
guidelines on similar biological medicinal products containing 
MAbs and in May 2012, the first MAb biosimilar application was 
made with recommendation for approval made by the EMA. 
Notably, a number of jurisdictions have adopted either the EMA 
guidelines or those set forth by the WHO to enable biosimilars to 
enter the market after discrete periods of data exclusivity.
The extent to which biosimilars would be differentiated from 
patented biologics on price is unclear. However, due to their 
complex nature, it is uncertain whether biosimilars would have 
the same impact on patented biologics that generic products 
have had on patented small molecule products. 
In addition, it is uncertain when any such abbreviated approval 
processes may be fully realised, particularly for more complex 
protein molecules such as MAbs. Any such processes may 
materially and adversely affect the future commercial prospects 
for patented biologics, such as the ones that we produce. 
 
Increasing implementation and enforcement of 
more stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
legislation
Impact
There is an increasing global focus on the implementation and 
enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. 
For example, in the UK, the Bribery Act 2010 came into force in 
July 201 1. It has extensive extra-territorial application, implements 
significant changes to existing UK anti-bribery legislation and 
broadens the scope of statutory offences and the potential 
applicable penalties, including organisational liability for any bribe 
paid by persons or entities associated with an organisation where 
the organisation failed to have adequate preventative procedures 
in place at the time of the offence. In the US, there has been 
significant enforcement activity in respect of the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act by the SEC and DOJ against US companies and 
non-US companies listed in the US. 
We are the subject of current anti-corruption investigations  
and there can be no assurance that we will not, from time to  
time, continue to be subject to informal inquiries and formal 
investigations from governmental agencies. In the context of our 
business, governmental officials interact with us in a variety of roles 
that are important to our operations, such as in the capacity of a 
regulator, partner or healthcare payer, reimburser or prescriber, 
among others. Details of these matters are included in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 176.
We devote significant resources to the considerable challenge  
of compliance with this legislation, including in emerging and 
developing markets, at considerable cost. Investigations from 
governmental agencies require additional resources. Despite 
taking significant measures to prevent breaches of applicable 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws by our personnel and 
associated third parties, breaches may result in the imposition  
of significant penalties, such as fines, the requirement to comply 
with monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or debarment  
or exclusion from government sales or reimbursement 
programmes, any of which could materially adversely affect  
our reputation, business or results of operations.

207 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Commercialisation and business execution risks continued
Any expected gains from productivity initiatives 
are uncertain
Impact
We continue to implement various productivity initiatives and 
restructuring programmes with the aim of enhancing the 
long-term efficiency of the business. However, anticipated cost 
savings and other benefits from these programmes are based  
on estimates and the actual savings may vary significantly. In 
particular, these cost reduction measures are often based on 
current conditions and cannot always take into account any 
future changes to the pharmaceutical industry or our operations, 
including new business developments, wage or price increases.
If inappropriately managed, the expected value of these  
initiatives could be lost through low employee engagement  
and hence productivity, increased absence and attrition levels, 
and industrial action. 
Our failure to successfully implement these planned cost 
reduction measures, either through the successful conclusion  
of employee relations processes (including consultation, 
engagement, talent management, recruitment and retention),  
or the possibility that these efforts do not generate the level of 
cost savings we anticipate, could materially adversely affect  
our business or results of operations.
Failure to attract and retain key personnel  
and failure to successfully engage with  
our employees
Impact
We rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented employees 
with a diverse range of skills and capabilities to meet our 
strategic objectives. For example, the success of our science 
activities is particularly dependent on our ability to attract and 
retain sufficient numbers of high quality researchers and 
development specialists. We face intense competition for well 
qualified individuals, as the supply of people with specific skills 
and significant leadership potential or in specific geographic 
regions may be limited. 
Our ability to achieve high levels of employee engagement  
in the workforce, and hence benefit from strong commitment 
and motivation, is key to the successful delivery of our  
business objectives. 
The inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, in 
particular those in key scientific and leadership positions and in 
our talent pools, may weaken our succession plans for critical 
positions in the medium term, may materially adversely affect the 
implementation of our strategic objectives and could ultimately 
impact our business or results of operations. 
Failure to engage effectively with our employees could lead to 
business disruption in our day-to-day operations, reduce levels  
of productivity and/or increase levels of voluntary turnover, all of 
which could ultimately adversely impact our business or results 
of operations. 
While we are committed to working on improving drivers of 
engagement, such as increasing our employees’ understanding 
of our new strategy and our ongoing efforts to reduce 
organisational complexity, our efforts may be unsuccessful.
Failure of information technology and 
cybercrime
Impact
We are dependent on effective IT systems. These systems 
support key business functions such as our R&D, manufacturing, 
supply chain and sales capabilities, and are an important means 
of safeguarding and communicating data, including critical or 
sensitive information, the confidentiality and integrity of which we 
rely on. The size and complexity of our IT systems, and those  
of our third party vendors (including outsource providers) with 
whom we contract, has significantly increased over the past 
decade and makes such systems potentially vulnerable to 
service interruptions and security breaches from attacks by 
malicious third parties, or from intentional or inadvertent actions 
by our employees or vendors.
Any significant disruption to these IT systems, including  
breaches of data centre security or cybersecurity, or failure to 
integrate new and existing IT systems, could harm our reputation 
and materially adversely affect our financial condition or results  
of operations. 
While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and 
IT, we may be unable to prevent breakdowns or breaches in our 
systems that could adversely affect our business. 
Significant changes in the business footprint and the 
implementation of the new IT strategy including the setting  
up of captive offshore Global Technology Centres could lead  
to temporary loss of capability while the changes are being 
implemented.
The inability to effectively back-up and restore data could lead to 
permanent loss of data that could result in non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
We and our vendors could be susceptible to third party attacks 
on our information security systems, which attacks are of ever 
increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and 
individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including 
criminal groups, ‘hacktivists’ and others. From time to time we 
experience malicious intrusions and computer viruses.
208 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Risk Failure of outsourcing Impact
We have outsourced a number of business critical operations  
to third party providers. This includes certain R&D processes,  
IT systems, HR and finance and accounting services.
A failure to successfully manage and implement the integration  
of IT infrastructure services provided by our outsourcing 
providers could create disruption, which could materially 
adversely affect our business or results of operations. 
Failure of outsource providers to deliver timely services, and to 
the required level of quality, and failure of outsource providers to 
co-operate with each other, could materially adversely affect our 
financial condition or results of operations. In addition, such 
failures could adversely impact our ability to meet business 
targets, maintain a good reputation within the industry and with 
stakeholders, and result in non-compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations.
Supply chain and delivery risks
Manufacturing biologics Impact
Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex 
and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle 
living micro-organisms and facilities specifically designed and 
validated for this purpose, with sophisticated quality assurance 
and control procedures.
Final market release of a biologic depends on a number of 
in-process manufacturing and supply chain parameters to 
ensure the product conforms with its safety, identity and strength 
requirements and meets its quality and purity characteristics. 
Biologics production facilities, especially for drug substance 
manufacture, are very specialised and can take years to develop 
and bring on line as licensed facilities. Predicting demand  
for certain classes of biologics, especially prior to launch, can  
be challenging.
Slight variations in any part of the manufacturing process  
or components may lead to a product that does not meet  
its stringent design specifications. Failure to meet these 
specifications may lead to recalls, spoilage, drug product 
shortages, regulatory action and/or reputational harm.
Difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, 
distribution and sale of our products
Impact
We may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing our 
products, such as: (i) supply chain continuity, including as a result 
of disruptions such as a natural or man-made disaster at one of 
our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor; (ii) delays related to 
the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing 
facilities, including those intended to support future demand for 
our products; (iii) the seizure or recall of products or shutdown of 
manufacturing plants; and (iv) other manufacturing or distribution 
problems, including changes in manufacturing production sites, 
limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, 
changes in the types of products produced, or physical 
limitations or other business interruptions that could impact 
continuous supply.
Manufacturing, distribution and sales difficulties may result  
in product shortages and significant delays, which may lead  
to lost sales.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
209 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Supply chain and delivery risks continued
Reliance on third parties for goods Impact
We increasingly rely on third parties for the timely supply of 
goods, such as raw materials (for example, the API in some of 
our medicines), equipment, formulated drugs and packaging,  
all of which are key to our operations. 
Unexpected events and/or events beyond our control could 
result in the failure of the supply of goods. For example, suppliers 
of key goods we rely on may cease to trade. In addition, we may 
experience limited supply of biological materials, such as cells, 
animal products or by-products. Furthermore, government 
regulations in multiple jurisdictions could result in restricted 
access to, use or transport of such materials. 
Third party supply failure could materially adversely affect our 
financial condition or results of operations. This may lead to 
significant delays and/or difficulties in obtaining goods and 
services on commercially acceptable terms. 
Loss of access to sufficient sources of key goods and biological 
materials may interrupt or prevent our research activities as 
planned and/or increase our costs. Further information is 
contained in the Managing risk section on page 44.
Legal, regulatory and compliance risks
Adverse outcome of litigation and/or 
governmental investigations
Impact
We may be subject to legal proceedings and governmental 
investigations. Litigation, particularly in the US, is inherently 
unpredictable and unexpectedly high awards for damages  
can result from an adverse verdict. In many cases, plaintiffs  
may claim compensatory, punitive and statutory damages  
in extremely high amounts. In particular, the marketing, 
promotional, clinical and pricing practices of pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers 
interact with purchasers, prescribers and patients, are subject  
to extensive regulation, litigation and governmental investigation. 
Many companies, including AstraZeneca, have been subject to 
claims related to these practices asserted by federal and state 
governmental authorities and private payers and consumers, 
which have resulted in substantial expense and other significant 
consequences. Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 
176 describes the material legal proceedings in which we are 
currently involved.
Investigations (for example, the DOJ investigative demand 
 in relation to the Brilinta PLATO trial, described in further detail  
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 176) or legal 
proceedings, regardless of their outcome, could be costly, divert 
management attention, or damage our reputation and demand 
for our products. Unfavourable resolution of current and similar 
future proceedings against us could subject us to criminal 
liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary 
remedies, require us to make significant provisions in our 
accounts relating to legal proceedings and could materially 
adversely affect our business or results of operations.
Substantial product liability claims Impact
Pharmaceutical companies have, historically, been subject to large 
product liability damages claims, settlements and awards for 
injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Adverse 
publicity relating to the safety of a product or of other competing 
products may increase the risk of product liability claims. 
Substantial product liability claims that result in court decisions 
against us or in the settlement of proceedings could materially 
adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, 
particularly where such circumstances are not covered by 
insurance. For more information, see the Limited third party 
insurance coverage risk on page 213.
Failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules 
and regulations
Impact
Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations 
may result in civil and/or criminal legal proceedings being filed 
against us, or in us becoming subject to regulatory sanctions. 
Regulatory authorities have wide-ranging administrative powers 
to deal with any failure to comply with continuing regulatory 
oversight and this could affect us, whether such failure is our 
own or that of our contractors or external partners.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, including ongoing control 
and regulation, could materially adversely affect our business  
or results of operations. For example, once a product has been 
approved for marketing by the regulatory authorities, it is subject 
to continuing control and regulation, such as the manner of its 
manufacture, distribution, marketing and safety surveillance. For 
example, if regulatory issues concerning compliance with current 
Good Manufacturing Practice or safety monitoring regulations for 
pharmaceutical products (often referred to as pharmacovigilance) 
arise, this could lead to loss of product approvals, product recalls 
and seizures, and interruption of production, which could create 
product shortages and delays in new product approvals, and so 
negatively impact patient access, and reputation.
210 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Risk Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations 
relating to anti-competitive behaviour
Impact
Any failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations relating  
to anti-competitive behaviour may expose us to regulatory 
sanctions or lawsuits from governmental authorities and private, 
non-governmental entities. 
Certain of our commercial arrangements with generics 
companies, which have sought to settle patent challenges on 
terms acceptable to both innovator and generics manufacturer, 
may be subject to challenge by competition authorities.  
Where a government authority investigates our adherence to 
competition laws, or we become subject to private party lawsuits 
(for example, the US Nexium settlement anti-trust litigation 
described in more detail in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
from page 176), this may result in inspections of our sites or 
requests for documents and other information. Competition 
investigations or legal proceedings could be costly, divert 
management attention or damage our reputation. 
Unfavourable resolution of such challenges, investigations or 
legal proceedings against us could require us to make changes 
to our commercial practice and could subject us to fines and 
penalties and other sanctions. These could materially adversely 
affect our business or results of operations.
Environmental and occupational health and 
safety liabilities
Impact
We have environmental and/or occupational health and 
safety-related liabilities at some currently and formerly owned, 
leased and third party sites, the most significant of which are 
detailed in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 176. 
While we carefully manage these liabilities, if a significant 
compliance issue, environmental, occupational health or safety 
incident or legal requirement for which we are responsible were 
to arise, this could result in us being responsible for compensation, 
fines and/or remediation costs. In some circumstances, such 
liability could materially adversely affect our business or results of 
operations. In addition, our financial provisions for any obligations 
that we may have relating to environmental or occupational 
health and safety liabilities may be insufficient if the assumptions 
underlying the provisions, including our assumptions regarding 
the portion of waste at a site for which we are responsible,  
prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for additional 
contamination or occupational health and safety-related claims.
Misuse of social media platforms and  
new technology
Impact
We increasingly use the internet, social media, mobile applications 
and other forms of new technology to communicate internally 
and externally. The accessibility and instantaneous nature of 
interactions with such media may facilitate or exacerbate the risk 
of data leakages from within AstraZeneca or false or misleading 
statements being made about AstraZeneca, which may be 
damaging to our reputation. As social media platforms expand, it 
becomes increasingly challenging to identify new points of entry 
and to put structures in place to secure and protect information.
Inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could lead to misuse 
including public disclosure of sensitive information (such as 
personally identifiable information on employees, healthcare 
professionals or patients, for example, those enrolled in our 
clinical trials), which may damage our reputation and expose  
us to legal risks, as well as additional legal obligations. Similarly, 
the involuntary public disclosure of commercially sensitive 
information such as trade secrets through external media 
channels, or an information loss, could adversely affect our 
business or results of operations. In addition, negative posts or 
comments on social media websites about us or, for example, 
the safety of any of our products, could harm our reputation.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
211 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Economic and financial risks
Adverse impact of a sustained economic 
downturn
Impact
A variety of significant risks may arise from a sustained global 
economic downturn. Additional pressure from governments and 
other healthcare payers on medicine prices and volumes of sales 
in response to recessionary pressures on budgets may cause  
a slowdown or a decline in growth in some markets. In some 
cases, those governments most severely impacted by the 
economic downturn may seek alternative ways to settle their 
debts through, for example, the issuance of government bonds 
which might trade at a discount to the face value of the debt. 
In addition, our customers may cease to trade, which may result 
in losses from writing off debts. We are highly dependent on 
being able to access a sustainable flow of liquid funds due to  
the high fixed costs of operating our business and the long and 
uncertain development cycles of our products. In a sustained 
economic downturn, financial institutions with whom we deal 
may cease to trade and there can be no guarantee that we will 
be able to access monies owed to us without a protracted, 
expensive and uncertain process, if at all. 
More than 95% of our cash investments are managed centrally 
and are invested in AAA credit rated institutional money market 
funds backed by institutions in the US and the EU, which, in turn, 
invest in other funds, including sovereign funds. This means our 
credit exposure is a mix of US and EU sovereign default risk and 
financial institution default risk.
While we have adopted cash management and treasury policies 
to manage this risk (see the Financial risk management policies 
section on pages 82 and 83), we cannot be certain that these will 
be as effective as they are intended to be, in particular in the 
event of a global liquidity crisis. In addition, open positions where 
we are owed money and investments we have made in financial 
institution money market funds cannot be guaranteed to be 
recoverable. Additionally, if we need access to external sources 
of financing to sustain and/or grow our business, such as the 
debt or equity capital financial markets, this may not be available 
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a 
severe and/or sustained economic downturn. This may, for 
instance, be the case in the event of any default by the Group  
on its debt obligations, which may materially adversely affect  
our ability to secure debt funding in the future or our financial 
condition in general. Further information on debt funding 
arrangements is contained in the Financial risk management 
policies section on page 83.
Political and socio-economic conditions Impact
We operate in over 100 countries across the world, some of 
which may be subject to political and social instability. There may 
be disruption to our business if there is instability in a particular 
geographic region, including as a result of war, terrorism, riot, 
unstable governments, civil insurrection or social unrest.
Deterioration of, or failure to improve, socio-economic conditions, 
and situations and/or resulting events, depending on their 
severity, could adversely affect our supply and/or distribution 
chain in the affected countries and the ability of customers or 
ultimate payers to purchase our medicines. This could adversely 
affect our business or results of operations.
Impact of fluctuations in exchange rates Impact
As a global business, currency fluctuations can significantly 
affect our results of operations, which are reported in US dollars. 
Approximately 39% of our global 2013 sales were in the US, 
which is expected to remain our largest single market for the 
foreseeable future. Sales in other countries are predominantly in 
currencies other than the US dollar, including the euro, Japanese 
yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. We have a growing 
exposure to emerging market currencies, where some have 
exchange controls in place, but for others the exchange rates are 
also linked to the US dollar. Major components of our cost base 
are located in the UK and Sweden, where an aggregate of 
approximately 23% of our employees are based.
Movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign 
currencies into US dollars may materially adversely affect our 
financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, some  
of our subsidiaries import and export goods and services in 
currencies other than their own functional currency, and so  
the financial results of such subsidiaries could be affected by 
currency fluctuations arising between the transaction dates and 
the settlement dates for these transactions. In addition, there are 
foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of equity 
investments in subsidiaries. See Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 169.
212 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Risk Limited third party insurance coverage Impact
In recent years, the costs associated with product liability 
litigation have increased the cost of, and narrowed the coverage 
afforded by, pharmaceutical companies’ product liability 
insurance. To contain insurance costs in recent years, we have 
continued to adjust our coverage profile, accepting a greater 
degree of uninsured exposure. The Group has not held any 
material product liability insurance since February 2006. In 
addition, where claims are made under insurance policies, 
insurers may reserve the right to deny coverage on various 
grounds. For example, product liability litigation cases relating  
to Crestor and Nexium in the US are not covered by third party 
product liability insurance. See Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 176 for details.
If we are found to have a financial liability as a result of product 
liability or other litigation, in respect of which we do not have 
insurance cover, or if an insurer’s denial of coverage is ultimately 
upheld, this could materially adversely affect our business or 
results of operations. 
For more information, see the Substantial product liability claims 
risk on page 210.
Taxation Impact
The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce 
conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be 
taxed in individual countries. The majority of the jurisdictions in 
which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign 
jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the 
incidence of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. 
The resolution of these disputes can result in a reallocation  
of profits between jurisdictions and an increase or decrease  
in related tax costs, and has the potential to affect our cash flows 
and EPS. Claims, regardless of their merits or their outcome,  
are costly, divert management attention and may adversely affect 
our reputation.
If any of these double tax treaties should be withdrawn or 
amended, especially in a territory where a member of the Group 
is involved in a taxation dispute with a tax authority in relation to 
cross-border transactions, such withdrawal or amendment could 
materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, 
as could a negative outcome of a tax dispute or a failure by the 
tax authorities to agree through competent authority proceedings. 
See the Financial risk management policies section on page 83  
for tax risk management policies and Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements on page 183 for details of current tax disputes.
Pensions Impact
Our pension obligations are backed by assets invested across 
the broad investment market. Our most significant obligations 
relate to the UK pension fund.
Sustained falls in these asset values will put a strain on pension 
fund solvency levels, which may result in requirements for 
additional cash, restricting cash available for strategic business 
growth. Similarly, if the liabilities increase as a result of a 
sustained low interest rate environment, this will reduce pension 
fund solvency ratios. The likely increase in the IAS 19 accounting 
deficit generated by any of these factors may cause the credit 
rating agencies to review our credit rating, with the potential to 
negatively affect our ability to raise debt. See Note 18 to the 
Financial Statements from page 159 for further details of the 
Group’s pension obligations.
Financial expectations Impact
We may from time to time communicate targets or expectations 
regarding our future financial or other performance (for example, 
the expectations described in Our strategic priorities – Financial 
expectations from page 17). All such statements are of a 
forward-looking nature and are based on assumptions and 
judgements we make, all of which are subject to inherent risks 
and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties that we are 
unaware of and/or that are beyond our control.
There can be no guarantee that our financial targets or 
expectations will materialise. Actual results may deviate materially 
and adversely from any such target or expectation, including  
if one or more of the assumptions or judgements underlying any 
such target or expectation proves to be incorrect in whole or  
in part.

Additional Information | Geographical Review 2013 in brief
 > AstraZeneca is the third largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in the US, with a 5.1% market 
share of US pharmaceuticals by  
sales value.
 > AstraZeneca is the ninth largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Europe, with a 2.8% market 
share of sales by value.
 > In the US, sales were down 9% to  
$9,691 million (2012: $10,655 million; 
2011: $13,426 million). Loss of exclusivity 
on Seroquel IR in March 2012, as well  
as the impact of generic competition 
notably on Crestor and Toprol-XL, was 
only partially offset by strong performance 
across our growth platforms, including 
Brilinta, Symbicort and our diabetes 
franchise, which increased by $225 million 
or 62%. In 2013, our diabetes franchise 
included a full calendar year of revenue  
for Bydureon, Byetta and Symlin. 
 > Sales in Europe were down 9% to  
$6,658 million (2012: $7 ,143 million; 2011: 
$9,224 million). Key drivers of the decline 
were the ongoing volume erosion on 
Atacand, Seroquel IR, Nexium, Arimidex 
and Meronem following entry of generic 
competition and the negative price and 
volume impacts primarily related to 
government interventions. Seroquel XR 
faced a difficult year, with loss of market 
share, lower pricing and generic entries. 
These challenges were only partially 
offset by our growth platforms, including 
Brilique growth and the expansion of  
our diabetes offering through the Amylin 
franchise, as well as strong demand for 
Fluenz, particularly in the UK.
 > Established Rest of World sales were 
down 10%. Canada continues to be 
negatively impacted by generic erosion 
on Crestor and Nexium, with total sales 
down 40%. Australian sales were also 
down as Crestor faces competition from 
generics. These trends were partially 
offset by growth in Japan, with sales up 
4% to $2,485 million, as a result of strong 
demand for Nexium following the lifting  
of restrictions on length of prescriptions  
in October 2012.
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 8% 
to $5,389 million (2012: $5,095 million), 
with sales growth in China of 19%.
2012 in brief 
 > AstraZeneca was the fourth largest 
pharmaceutical company in the US,  
with a 5% market share of US 
pharmaceuticals by sales value.
 > AstraZeneca was the eighth largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Europe, with a 3.3% market 
share of sales by value.
 > In the US, sales were down 21% to 
$10,655 million (2011: $13,426 million). 
Loss of exclusivity on Seroquel IR in 
March 2012, as well as the impact of 
increased generic competition 
experienced by our other mature brands, 
was partially offset by strong performance 
from our key brands, Brilinta, Crestor, 
Onglyza, Symbicort and Faslodex. 
 > Sales in Europe were down 15% to  
$7 ,143 million (2011: $9,224 million). Key 
drivers of the decline were the volume 
erosion on Atacand, Seroquel IR, Nexium, 
Arimidex and Meronem following entry  
of generic competition and the negative 
price and volume impact primarily related 
to government interventions, particularly 
in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  
This development was partially offset by 
revenue growth from Brilique, Onglyza, 
Vimovo and Iressa.
 > Established ROW sales were down 14%. 
The entry of generic competition to 
Crestor in Canada, and Seroquel IR and 
Arimidex in Australia, was partially offset 
by the successful first full year of launch  
of Nexium and Faslodex in Japan.
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 4% 
to $5,095 million (2011: $5,040 million) 
with sales growth in China of 17% and 
also in Russia of 17%.

US
AstraZeneca is the third largest  
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in the US, with a 5.1%  
market share of US pharmaceuticals  
by sales value.
Sales in the US decreased by 9% to  
$9,691 million (2012: $10,655 million; 2011: 
$13,426 million), as loss of exclusivity on 
Seroquel IR in March 2012, as well as the 
impact of other generic competition, was 
only partially offset by strong performance 
across our growth platforms, including 
Brilinta, Symbicort and our diabetes 
franchise. Our diabetes franchise increased 
by $225 million or 62%. Brilinta achieved 
sales of $73 million. Brilinta total prescription 
volume growth in 2013 is equivalent to 2.2 
times 2012, while the Oral Antiplatelet (OAP) 
market has declined by 3.5% and all other 
branded OAPs have lost volume. Brilinta’s 
new-to-brand prescription share is 6.8% 
versus 3.9% at the end of 2012. Crestor 
achieved sales of $2,912 million (2012: 
$3,164 million; 2011: $3,074 million) and  
a total prescription share within the statin 
market of 10.6% in December 2013.  
While Crestor sales declined 8% on lower 
demand, with volume decline contributing 
7%, Crestor continued to demonstrate 
resilience in the highly competitive statin 
market, 86% of which is generic. Crestor’s 
existing patient base remained solid, and 
continuing patients represented 95% of 
Crestor’s volume. Crestor’s Commercial/
Medicare preferred access was 84%  
at the end of 2013 (2012: 87%; 2011: 88%). 
In 2013, Crestor was the second most 
prescribed branded pharmaceutical  
in the US. 
Symbicort pMDI continued to deliver  
strong growth in the US, with sales up  
23% to $1,233 million, with volume increase 
contributing 17% (2012: $1,003 million; 2011: 
$846 million) and prescription growth of 
16.4% versus 2012. It achieved a 26.2% 
total prescription share in the month of 
December 2013, up 3.9 percentage points 
over the month of December 2012 in the 
inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 
beta
2-agonist market. 
Onglyza/Kombiglyze revenues in the  
US were up 12% to $265 million (2012:  
$237 million; 2011: $156 million) primarily 
driven by higher average net selling prices 
as volume remained stable over the prior 
year as the DPP-4 market grew by 5.1%  
in 2013 versus 2012.
During 2013, following the completion  
of BMS’s acquisition of Amylin in 2012, 
AstraZeneca and BMS developed and 
commercialised Amylin’s portfolio of 
products related to diabetes (and other 
metabolic diseases). Bydureon revenues in 
the US were $131 million as 2013 included  
a full calendar year of revenue. Bydureon 
captured more than one in five new GLP-1 
patient treatment decisions and achieved  
a 4.5% total prescription market share gain 
in 2013, with a total prescription market 
share of 17 .5% of the rapidly growing  
GLP-1 market in December 2013. Byetta 
achieved sales of $152 million, and Symlin 
sales of $42 million. 
In 2013, sales of Synagis were up 1% to 
$617 million. A key driver of the growth  
was the annual price increase, which  
was partially offset by the continued 
implementation of a more restrictive payer 
policy and Medicaid patient migration  
from Fee For Services to Managed 
Medicaid, resulting in lower volume.  
FluMist Quadrivalent launched in the US  
in 2013 as the first and only FDA-approved 
nasal spray flu vaccine to help protect 
against four strains of influenza. FluMist 
revenues in the US were up 14% to  
$199 million (2012: $174 million; 2011:  
$160 million).
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
217 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Nexium was the third most prescribed 
branded pharmaceutical in the US. In the 
face of continuing generic, OTC and pricing 
pressures, Nexium sales declined 7% to 
$2,123 million (2012: $2,272 million; 2011: 
$2,397 million). Nexium remains the 
branded market leader retaining significant 
prescription market share and volume  
within the proton pump inhibitor class.
The loss of exclusivity for Seroquel IR in 
March 2012 and unfavourable reserve 
adjustments for Medicaid liabilities and 
provisions taken on channel inventories 
resulted in negative sales for 2013 of   
$17 million (2012: +$697 million; 2011:  
+$3,344 million). The presence of generic 
competition has also impacted the 
prescription volume of Seroquel XR.  
Sales of Seroquel XR were down 8%  
to $743 million (2012: $811 million; 2011: 
$779 million) driven by lower volume.  
Other drivers of the sales decline included 
additional generic competition affecting 
sales of Toprol-XL, which were down to  
$131 million (2012: $320 million; 2011:  
$404 million), and the loss of exclusivity 
impact on Atacand with sales down  
to $72 million (2012: $150 million; 2011:  
$182 million).
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act 
came into force. It has had, and is expected 
to continue to have, a significant impact on 
our US sales and the US healthcare industry 
as a whole. In 2013, the overall reduction in 
our profit before tax for the year due to 
higher minimum Medicaid rebates on 
prescription drugs, discounts on branded 
pharmaceutical sales to Medicare Part D 
beneficiaries and an industry-wide excise 
fee was $933 million (2012: $858 million). 
This amount reflects only those effects of 
the Affordable Care Act that we know have 
had or will have a direct impact on our 
financial condition or results of operations 
and which we are therefore able to quantify 
based on known and isolatable resulting 
changes in individual financial items within 
our Financial Statements. There are  
other potential indirect or associated 
consequences of the implementation of  
the Affordable Care Act, which continue to 
evolve and which cannot be estimated but 
could have similar impacts. These include 
broader changes in access to, or eligibility 
for, coverage under Medicare, Medicaid or 
similar government programmes. These 
could indirectly impact our pricing or sales 
of prescription products within the private 
sector. By their nature and the fact that 
these potentially numerous consequences 
are not directly linked to a corresponding 
and quantifiable impact on our Financial 
Statements, it is not possible to accurately 
estimate the financial impact of these 
potential consequences of the Affordable 
Care Act or related legislative changes when 
taken together with the number of other 
market and industry-related factors that can 
also result in similar impacts. Further details 
on the impact of the Affordable Care Act are 
contained in the Pricing pressure section 
from page 15 and the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section from page 200.
Currently, there is no direct government 
control of prices for commercial prescription 
drug sales in the US. However, some 
publicly funded programmes, such as 
Medicaid and TRICARE (Department of 
Veterans Affairs), have statutorily mandated 
rebates and discounts that have the effect 
of price controls for these programmes. 
Additionally, pressure on pricing, availability 
and utilisation of prescription drugs for both 
commercial and public payers continues  
to increase. This is driven by, among other 
things, an increased focus on generic 
alternatives. Primary drivers of increased 
generic use are budgetary policies within 
healthcare systems and providers, including 
the use of ‘generics only’ formularies,  
and increases in patient co-insurance  
or co-payments. In 2013, 86% of the 
prescriptions dispensed in the US were 
generic. While it is unlikely that there  
will be widespread adoption of a broad 
national price control scheme in the near 
future, there will continue to be increased 
attention to pharmaceutical prices and  
their impact on healthcare costs for the 
foreseeable future.
Rest of World
Sales performance outside the US in 2013 
was down by 4% to $16,020 million (2012: 
$17 ,318 million; 2011: $20,165 million), due  
to the ongoing impact of loss of exclusivity 
in 2012 of certain key products, competition 
from generic products and the continuing 
challenging economic environment. This 
trend was partially offset by delivery on  
our growth platforms, with Brilinta up to 
$210 million (2012: $70 million; 2011:  
$10 million), our diabetes franchise up  
to $197 million (2012: $86 million; 2011:  
$55 million) and Symbicort up by 4% to 
$2,250 million (2012: $2,191 million; 2011: 
$2,302 million). Emerging Markets delivered 
a strong performance, up 8% with sales  
of $5,389 million (2012: $5,095 million;  
2011: $5,040 million). 
Europe
AstraZeneca is the ninth largest 
pharmaceutical company in Europe,  
with a 3.1% market share of prescription 
sales by value. 
Despite a slight improvement in conditions, 
the macro-economic situation remains 
challenging, with the ongoing impact of 
austerity measures leading to increased 
pressure on healthcare budgets. Most 
governments in Europe intervene directly  
to control the price, volume and 
reimbursement of medicines. Several 
governments have imposed price 
reductions and increased the use of  
generic medicines as part of healthcare 
expenditure controls. A number of  
countries are applying strict criteria for 
cost-effectiveness evaluations of medicines, 
which has delayed and reduced access  
to medicines for patients in areas of 
important unmet medical need. These  
and other measures all contribute to an 
increasingly difficult environment for 
branded pharmaceuticals in Europe. 
Total sales in Europe were down 9% to 
$6,658 million (2012: $7 ,143 million; 2011: 
$9,224 million). Volume erosion on Seroquel 
IR, Seroquel XR, Nexium and Atacand 
following generic entrants resulted in a 
decrease in sales of 34% to $1,106 million 
(2012: $1,643 million; 2011: $2,660 million). 
Crestor sales declined 3%, with a 2% 
reduction in volumes and 1% reduction  
in prices, as a result of increased statin 
pressure in a number of countries including 
France and Italy. Government interventions 
continue to impact both price and volume 
negatively. Promotion of Vimovo and 
Axanum was discontinued, and sales  
of $36 million (2012: $23 million; 2011:  
$7 million) were achieved.
Our growth platform sales partially  
offset these trends. Brilique sales  
reached $163 million (2012: $57 million; 
2011: $9 million). Our diabetes franchise 
generated sales of $119 million (2012:  
$50 million), reflecting start of marketing  
the Amylin portfolio. Respiratory sales 
included strong Symbicort performance, 
with sales reaching $1,502 million (2012: 
$1,465 million; 201 1: $1,592 million), as 
volumes grew by 3%, while prices fell by 2%.
In Germany, sales fell by 18% to $657 million 
(2012: $775 million; 2011: $1,189 million), 
mainly driven by market entries of generic 
versions in 2012 of Atacand (sales declined 
to $69 million; 2012: $141 million; 2011:  
$255 million), and Seroquel XR (sales 
declined to $42 million; 2012: $93 million; 
2011: $151 million). 
In the UK and Ireland, sales were broadly 
flat at $766 million (2012: $764 million;  
2011: $987 million). FluMist experienced 
volume growth under a new government 
contract with sales increasing to $38 million 
(2012: $1 million; 2011: $nil). The UK and 
Ireland experienced ongoing volume 
erosion on Seroquel IR and Seroquel XR 
following generic entrants, with sales 
declining to $30 million (2012: $72 million; 
2011: $141 million). 
Sales in France decreased by 10% to 
$1,212 million (2012: $1,314 million; 2011: 
$1,740 million), driven largely by volume 
erosion on Nexium, Atacand and Arimidex, 
following generic entrants and subsequent 
government interventions. Increased 
pressure on the statin market has adversely 
affected Crestor , with sales down 2% to 
$428 million (2012: $424 million; 2011:  
$421 million). France experienced launch 
218 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Geographical Review growth of Seroquel XR in 2013 of 52%,  
with sales reaching $59 million (2012:  
$37 million; 2011: $5 million) and Brilique, 
with $18 million of sales (2012: $2 million; 
2011: $nil). 
Sales in Spain and Italy were down by  
3% to $507 million (2012: $510 million; 201 1: 
$708 million) and by 12% to $792 million 
(2012: $876 million; 2011: $1,113 million), 
respectively, mainly driven by generic 
entrants and the implementation of volume 
prescription controls associated with 
existing and new austerity measures.
Established ROW
Established ROW sales decreased by  
10% to $3,973 million (2012: $5,080 million; 
2011: $5,901 million). The entry of generic 
competition to Crestor in Canada, and 
Seroquel XR and Arimidex in Australia was 
partially offset by the successful first full year 
of launch of Nexium and Faslodex in Japan. 
The key products with sales growth in 2013 
were Symbicort, Brilinta, Byetta, Bydureon, 
Faslodex and Iressa.
Japan
Sales in Japan were $2,485 million, 
increasing by 4% at CER but negatively 
impacted on a reported basis by the 
revaluation of the Japanese yen (2012: 
$2,904 million; 2011: $3,064 million). Strong 
launch performance from Nexium and 
Crestor was partially offset by declining 
Losec and established oncology sales. 
Nexium achieved sales of $278 million 
(2012: $78 million; 2011: $90 million), with 
sales accelerating following the lifting in 
October 2012 of the two week prescription 
limit imposed by the Japanese Ministry  
of Health, Labour and Welfare on new 
medicines during the first year from launch. 
We saw Losec sales declining as patients 
moved to the newer brand.
Crestor sales grew by 1 1%, retaining its 
position as the number one brand in the 
statin market in Japan. Symbicort sales grew 
by 9%, achieving market share of 39.4%. 
Our oncology business remains one of the 
leaders in Japan based on the performance 
of established brands including Iressa, 
Arimidex, Zoladex, Casodex and the more 
recently launched Faslodex. In October 
2013, we announced a co-promotion 
agreement with Janssen to promote an 
innovative oral therapy for the treatment of 
patients with prostate cancer to enhance 
our oncology offering in 2014.
Canada
Due to the ‘at risk’ launch of a generic 
version of Seroquel XR in Canada in the first 
quarter of 2013, full year impact from the 
loss of exclusivity for Crestor in April 2012, 
and the continued impact of the ‘at risk’ 
launch of a generic version of Nexium in 
2011, total Canadian sales decreased by 
40% to $637 million (2012: $1,090 million; 
2011: $1,604 million). Combined sales of 
Crestor, Nexium, Symbicort, Seroquel IR 
and Seroquel XR were $385 million  
($742 million; 2011: $1,171 million). Brilinta 
successfully achieved public reimbursement 
across almost all provinces. 
Other Established ROW
Sales in Other Established ROW declined 
by 18% to $851 million (2012: $1,086 million; 
2011: $1,233 million). Australian sales 
declined by 18% to $817 million (2012: 
$1,052 million; 2011: $1,166 million) following 
a legal challenge to the patent and entry  
of generic competitors to Crestor in June 
2013. Sales were also impacted by the 
generic erosion of Atacand following patent 
expiry in July 2013. The respiratory franchise 
in Australia was bolstered in December 
2013 by the launch of Symbicort pMDI, and 
we have seen steady growth of Brilinta.
Emerging Markets
In Emerging Markets, sales increased by 
8% to $5,389 million (2012: $5,095 million; 
2011: $5,040 million), which was principally 
driven by growth in China. 
In many of the larger markets, such as Brazil 
and Mexico, patients tend to pay directly for 
prescription medicines and consequently 
these markets are at less risk of direct 
government interventions on pricing and 
reimbursement. In other markets such as 
South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, where 
governments pay for medicines, we are 
seeing continued efforts to reduce the cost 
of prescriptions in line with the systems in 
Europe, Canada and Australia. We also 
experienced sales erosion from generics as 
our on-market portfolio in Emerging Markets 
continued to age. 
China
Sales in China (excluding Hong Kong)  
grew by 19% to $1,840 million (2012:  
$1,512 million; 2011: $1,261 million) and 
AstraZeneca remained the second largest 
multinational pharmaceutical company in 
China during 2013. We experienced some 
volatility in the Chinese market during  
2013 partly as a result of increased market 
scrutiny following the allegations made 
against one of our competitors. However, 
overall, we achieved a strong growth rate 
relative to our peers. We saw strong sales  
of launch products Crestor and Symbicort, 
with sales growth of 80% and 61% 
respectively, and Nexium and Pulmicort  
are also continuing to grow rapidly. In 2013, 
Brilinta was launched in China, and we  
have made positive progress on the  
listing of Brilinta, Byetta and Onglyza  
into key hospitals. 
Other Emerging Markets
We continued to build our presence in 
Russia, although sales remained broadly  
in line with 2012 at $310 million (2012:  
$314 million; 2011: $284 million) impacted  
by generic entries and tender timings.  
The Russian market saw weak growth 
during 2013, with AstraZeneca slightly 
outperforming the market as a result of 
growth in retail market share. Growth  
of Crestor, Faslodex and Symbicort was 
offset by declines across a number of  
older established products.
The Latin American pharmaceutical market 
continues to grow. However, in many 
countries, growth is being predominantly 
captured by generics, branded generics 
and private label product offerings. 
AstraZeneca sales were down 1% to  
$1,188 million (2012: $1,331 million; 2011: 
$1,455 million) driven principally by declines 
in Mexico, down 18%, with sales also 
slightly down by 1% in Brazil. Mexico has 
been impacted by the increased penetration 
of generic products in the market and 
reduction of inventory held in the supply 
chain by a number of customers. Brazil has 
felt the effects of the loss of exclusivity on 
Nexium which declined by 23%. This was 
partially offset by Argentina (up 22%) and 
sales growth in Venezuela (up 7%).
In the Middle East and Africa, despite 
political challenges arising from the ‘Arab 
Spring’ revolutions of 2012, we continued  
to accelerate our growth, with sales up 6%. 
The impact of government interventions has 
been less than expected, with a delay in the 
implementation of reference pricing across 
a number of markets (South Africa, Algeria 
and Egypt). Turkey saw a slight decline in 
sales of 3% with Nexium impacted by 
generic erosion and a price reference 
reduction. Other key markets in this area 
include Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States 
which grew at 9% and 10% respectively. 
Sales in the Asia Area increased by 8%  
to $900 million (2012: $829 million; 2011:  
$883 million). The increase was driven  
by South Korea, where sales grew 12%  
to $280 million (2012: $239 million; 2011:  
$235 million), due primarily to strong Crestor 
growth. Sales in India grew 12% in 2013  
to $70 million (2012: $67 million; 2011:  
$110 million) following supply limitations in 
2012. Sales in Thailand decreased by 12% 
to $87 million (2012: $97 million; 2011:  
$106 million) as a result of government 
interventions and strong generic penetration 
of Crestor.
Launches in Emerging Markets in 2013 
included: Brilinta in China, Russia, the 
Caribbean, Ecuador and Costa Rica; 
Forxiga in Mexico; and Kombiglyze in Brazil 
and Peru. Following our agreement with 
BMS in 2012, from April 2013 a number  
of our International Region’s markets began 
promotion of the Amylin diabetes products.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
219 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 In this section, we describe our  
approach to delivering business success 
responsibly. Summary information about  
our commitment and performance in  
key areas is integrated into the relevant  
sections of this Annual Report, while  
further information about these and other 
areas is available on our website,  
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Introduction
In the Strategy section from page 10, we 
describe our approach to creating value 
across the life-cycle of a medicine, our 
distinctive capabilities and our strategy.  
All these efforts are underpinned by our 
commitment to operating responsibly  
to ensure the future sustainability of the 
Company in a way that adds value for our 
stakeholders. To that end, our responsible 
business objectives are aligned to, and 
support delivery of, our business strategy. 
Our responsible business framework is the 
vehicle for managing commitments that are 
agreed across the Group, taking account of 
external stakeholder insights and internal 
reputational risk assessment. 
The framework encompasses:
 > Bioethics: Underpinning our accelerated 
drive for innovation with sound bioethics 
worldwide (see page 38). 
 > Access to healthcare: As we expand our 
geographic footprint, exploring ways of 
increasing access to healthcare for more 
people, tailored locally to different patient 
needs (see pages 41 and 42). 
 > Diversity and inclusion: Working to ensure 
that diversity in its broadest sense is 
reflected in our leadership and people 
strategies (see page 67). 
 > The environment: Managing our impact 
on the environment, across all our 
operations, with a particular focus on 
carbon emissions, waste and water use 
(see pages 44 and 45).
 > Patient safety: Maintaining a strong focus 
on patient safety in everything we do, 
minimising the risks and maximising the 
benefits of all our medicines throughout 
R&D, and after launch (see pages 38  
and 39).
 > Sales and marketing: Working to 
consistent global standards of ethical 
sales and marketing practices in all our 
markets as we work to restore growth 
(see page 42).
 > Human rights: Continuing to develop and 
embed a consistent approach to human 
rights across all our worldwide activities 
(see pages 68 and 69).
 > Employee safety, health and wellbeing: 
Promoting the safety, health and 
wellbeing of all our people worldwide as 
we continue to drive a high performance 
culture and achievement of our business 
goals (see page 69).
 > Working with suppliers: Only working  
with suppliers who have standards 
consistent with our own as we increase 
our outsourcing to drive business 
efficiency (see page 44).
 > Community investment: Making a positive 
contribution to our local communities 
around the world, through community 
support programmes consistent with 
improving health and promoting science 
(see pages 70 and 71). 
While we monitor performance in each  
of these areas of our business, we have 
identified three areas of special focus: 
access to healthcare; diversity; and the 
environment. In each case, we believe  
that we have both the capability and the 
responsibility to implement standards that 
accelerate our business strategy while 
delivering wider benefits to society.
A core element of our business strategy  
is value-creating business development 
activity that strengthens our pipeline and 
accelerates growth. This includes targeted 
acquisitions. When we acquire companies 
we aim to work with them to align standards 
of responsible business and incorporate the 
companies into the setting of targets and 
measurement of performance.
Benchmarking
As expectations of stakeholders evolve,  
we continue to engage with them and use 
the feedback to inform the development  
of our responsible business strategy and 
risk management planning.
We also use the insights we gain from 
external surveys to develop our approach  
in line with global best practice. A member 
of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index since 
2001, we were once again listed in the 2013 
World Index (the top 10% of the largest 
2,500 companies). We also retained our 
listing on the DJSI STOXX – European Index 
(the top 20% of the 600 largest European 
companies) for the sixth year running (one  
of only four pharmaceutical companies to 
do so out of 14 assessed). We achieved a 
total score of 85% (2012: 83%) compared 
with a sector best score of 86% (2012: 
87%). We increased individual scores for 
eight out of 22 criteria for 2013 (compared 
to nine out of 22 criteria in 2012) including 
customer relationship management, 
innovation management, labour practice 
indicators and human rights, social 
reporting, occupational health and safety, 
strategy to improve access to drugs or 
products, health outcomes contribution  
and addressing cost burden. While these 
scores are encouraging, we lost ground  
in some areas including corporate 
governance, environmental reporting, 
environmental policy/management  
system, operational eco-efficiency,  
climate strategy, talent attraction and 
retention, and stakeholder engagement.  
To better understand these lower scores, 
we commissioned an in-depth external 
benchmark survey and the analysis will be 
used to inform our improvement planning.
Responsible business governance
The SET is responsible for our responsible 
business framework and Non-Executive 
Director, Nancy Rothwell, oversees 
implementation and reporting to the Board. 
Senior managers throughout the Group  
are accountable for operating responsibly 
within their areas, taking into account 
national, functional, and site issues and 
priorities. Line managers are accountable 
for ensuring that their teams understand  
the requirements and that people are  
clear about what is expected of them  
as they work to achieve AstraZeneca’s 
business goals.
Our Responsible Business Council  
(the Council) is chaired by our Executive 
Vice-President, Human Resources & 
Corporate Affairs, and members include 
senior leaders from each relevant SET  
area. Its agenda is focused on driving 
long-term value creation by agreeing, 
among other things:
 > responsible business priorities for the 
Group in line with strategic business 
objectives
 > managing and monitoring the annual 
process of setting responsible business 
objectives and targets recorded in the 
Responsible Business Plan, as well as 
reviewing performance against KPIs 
 > appropriate policy positions to support 
AstraZeneca’s business objectives and 
reputation management.
Responsible Business
220 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013

2012 revenue decreased by 15% on a CER 
basis and 17% on a Reported basis. More 
than 13 percentage points of the decline at 
CER (approximately $4.5 billion) was related 
to loss of exclusivity on several brands in the 
portfolio. Seroquel IR revenues declined by 
$3 billion and regional losses of exclusivity 
for Atacand, Nexium and Crestor combined 
for a further negative impact of more than 
$1 billion. The disposals of Astra Tech and 
Aptium accounted for a further decrease of 
$562 million, or approximately 1.7 percentage 
points of the year-on-year revenue change 
at CER. Disruptions to our supply chain, 
from the implementation of an enterprise 
resource planning IT system in our plant in 
Sweden early in 2012, negatively impacted 
revenues by approximately 1%. 2012 
revenue in the US was down 21% (Reported: 
21%) with revenue in the Rest of World 
down 11% (Reported: 14%). Emerging 
Markets sales increased by 4%  
(Reported: flat). Further details of our  
sales performance are contained in the 
Geographical Review from page 214.
Core gross margin in 2012 of 82.4% 
decreased 0.2 percentage points 
(Reported: 0.2 percentage points). In 2012, 
benefits from the absence of the lower 
margin businesses of Astra Tech and 
Aptium, and from lower net expense related 
to our accounting for the amendments to 
the Merck exit arrangements (as detailed  
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements from 
page 150), were more than offset by an 
unfavourable impact from product mix.  
Core gross margin in 2011 benefited from  
a $131 million settlement of a royalty  
dispute with PDL Biopharma Inc. 
Core R&D expenditure in 2012 was  
$4,241 million, 4% lower than 2011 
(Reported: 5%). Higher costs from spending 
on in-licensed, acquired or partnered 
projects, including $151 million relating to 
Amylin, Ardea and Amgen, were more than 
offset by reduced spend on other projects. 
Core SG&A costs of $8,389 million in 2012 
were 13% lower than in 2011 (Reported: 
15%), as a result of spending discipline, 
partially offset by amortisation expense 
related to the expansion of our diabetes 
alliance with BMS and increased promotional 
costs in Emerging Markets. The excise  
fee imposed by the enactment of US 
healthcare reform measures amounted  
to 2.8% (2011: 2.2%) of Core SG&A  
expense for 2012.
222 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information
Financials (Prior year) Core other income in 2012 of $1,068 million 
was $223 million higher (Reported growth) 
than 2011, principally as a result of  
$250 million income from an agreement 
with Pfizer for OTC rights for Nexium.
2012 Core operating profit was  
$11,159 million, a decrease of 17% 
(Reported: 20%). Core operating margin  
in 2012 declined by 1.3 percentage  
points (Reported: 1.6 percentage points)  
to 39.9% as a result of an unfavourable 
impact from lower Core gross margin 
combined with higher Core R&D and  
SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue, 
being only partially mitigated by the 
increased Core other income for 2012.
Core EPS was $6.83 in 2012, down 8% 
(Reported: 11%), lower than the decline  
in Core operating profit as a result of the 
benefits from net share repurchases and  
a lower tax rate. 
Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core 
amounted to $3,011 million in 2012 
(2011: $1,137 million). Excluded from  
2012 Core results were: 
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,558 million 
(2011: $1,161 million), incurred as the 
Group commenced the third phase of 
restructuring announced in February 
2012. 
 > Amortisation totalling $1,134 million  
(2011: $771 million), with the increase 
driven by the additional amortisation 
arising from the amendment to the Merck 
exit arrangements during 2012 and  
our collaboration with BMS on Amylin 
products entered into in 2012, as detailed 
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements  
from page 150.
 > $186 million (2011: $553 million) of 
intangible asset impairments, including 
$50 million following the Group’s decision 
not to pursue a regulatory filing for 
TC-5214.
 > $72 million (2011: $135 million) of legal 
provision charges in respect of ongoing 
Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average 
Wholesale Price litigation in the US, the 
Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation and Nexium 
commercial litigation. In line with prior 
years these have been excluded from our 
Core performance and full details of these 
matters are included in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 176.
 > $61 million (2011: $nil) of acquisition- and 
transaction-related expenses in relation  
to our Ardea and new BMS collaboration 
arrangements. Further details of these 
transactions are included in Note 9 and 
Note 22 to the Financial Statements.
 > In 2011, the profit on sale of our subsidiary 
Astra Tech of $1,483 million was also 
excluded from Core results. Further 
details of this disposal are included in 
Note 22 to the Financial Statements  
on page 166. 
2012 Reported operating profit was down 
34% (Reported: 36%) at $8,148 million. 
Reported EPS was $4.95 in 2012, down 
29% (Reported: 32%). The larger declines 
compared with the respective Core  
financial measures were the result of the 
$1,483 million benefit to Reported other 
income in 2011 from the sale of Astra Tech, 
together with higher restructuring and 
amortisation costs in 2012 compared  
with 2011. 
Net finance expense in 2012 was  
$502 million, in line with the $512 million 
expense recorded in 2011. Net fair  
value losses on long-term debt and 
derivatives were $10 million in 2012,  
versus $4 million gains in 2011. This was 
offset by reduced net finance cost on  
the Group’s pension schemes. 
The 2012 Reported taxation charge of 
$1,376 million (2011: $2,333 million) consists 
of a current tax charge of $1,677 million 
(2011: $2,573 million) and a credit arising 
from movements on deferred tax of  
$301 million (2011: $240 million). The 2012 
current year tax charge includes a prior 
period current tax credit of $79 million  
(2011: $102 million). The Reported tax rate 
for 2012 was 18.0% (2011: 19.0%). The  
2012 Reported tax rate benefited from  
a $230 million adjustment to deferred tax 
balances following substantive enactment  
in 2012 of a reduction in the Swedish 
corporation tax rate from 26.3% to 22%, 
which was effective 1 January 2013, and  
a $240 million adjustment in respect of prior 
periods following the favourable settlement 
of a transfer pricing matter. Excluding these 
items, the Reported tax rate for 2012 would 
have been 24.1%; this tax rate was applied 
to the taxable 2012 Core adjustments to 
operating profit, resulting in a Core tax rate 
for 2012 of 19.0%. The Reported tax rate for 
2011 benefited from a non-taxable gain on 
the disposal of Astra Tech and a favourable 
adjustment to tax provisions of $520 million 
following the announcement in March 2011 
that HM Revenue & Customs in the UK and 
the US Internal Revenue Service had agreed 
the terms of an Advance Pricing Agreement 
regarding transfer pricing arrangements for 
AstraZeneca’s US business for the period 
from 2002 to the end of 2014 and a related 
valuation matter. Excluding these benefits, 
the Reported tax rate for 2011 was 26.4%.
Total comprehensive income for 2012 
decreased by $3,065 million from 2011  
to $6,405 million. This was driven by  
the decrease in profit for the year of  
$3,680 million, partially offset by an increase 
of $615 million in other comprehensive 
income, which was principally due to the 
non-recurrence in 2012 of $657 million of 
actuarial losses recorded in 2011 on our 
defined benefit schemes, arising from lower 
discount rates applied to our long-term 
pension obligations reflecting external 
market conditions.
Cash flow and liquidity – 2012
All data in this section is on a Reported 
basis. 
Cash generated from operating  
activities was $6,948 million in the year  
to 31 December 2012, compared with 
$7 ,821 million in 2011. The decrease  
of $873 million was primarily driven  
by lower operating profits, offset by  
lower tax payments.
Investment cash outflows of $5,607 million 
in 2012 included the purchases of Ardea 
($1,187 million) and intangible assets 
associated with our collaboration with  
BMS on Amylin ($3,358 million). The 2011 
investment cash inflow of $577 million 
benefited from the sale of Astra Tech 
($1,772 million). 
Net cash distributions to shareholders 
decreased from $9,370 million in 2011 to 
$5,871 million in 2012, the reduction driven 
by the suspension of our share repurchase 
programme in October 2012. Included in 
2012 net cash distributions to shareholders 
were dividend payments of $3,665 million 
(2011: $3,764 million). 
At 31 December 2012, outstanding gross 
debt (interest-bearing loans and borrowings) 
was $10,310 million (2011: $9,328 million).  
Of this gross debt, $901 million was due 
within one year, including $774 million of 
commercial paper borrowings (2011: $nil) 
with various short-term maturities all within 
90 days. In 2011, amounts due within one 
year included $1,769 million relating to 
current instalments of loans. 
During September 2012, the Company 
issued $2 billion of new long-term debt in 
two tranches; $1 billion maturing in 2019 
with a coupon of 1.95% and $1 billion 
maturing in 2042 with a coupon of 4.00%. 
Net proceeds of $1,980 million from the 
issue were used to repay a $1.75 billion 
bond with a coupon of 5.40%, maturing  
in September 2012 and for general 
corporate purposes. 
Net debt was $1,369 million at the end  
of 2012, decreased from net funds of 
$2,849 million at the end of 2011.
Financial position – 2012
All data in this section is on a Reported 
basis.
In 2012, net assets increased by  
$480 million to $23,946 million. The  
increase in net assets was broadly as a 
result of the Group profit of $6,270 million, 
offset by dividends of $3,619 million and  
net share repurchases of $2,206 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased 
by $336 million to $6,089 million in 2012. 
Additions of $772 million (2011: $807 million) 
were offset by depreciation of $1,023 million 
(2011: $1,086 million) and disposals of  
$224 million (2011: $233 million).
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
223 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Goodwill and intangible assets
Our goodwill of $9,898 million at  
31 December 2012 (2011: $9,862 million) 
principally arose on the acquisition of 
MedImmune in 2007 and the restructuring 
of our US joint venture with Merck in 1998. 
Goodwill of $30 million arising on our 
acquisition of Ardea, as detailed in Note 22 
to the Financial Statements on page 166,  
was capitalised in 2012.
Intangible assets amounted to $16,448 million 
at 31 December 2012 (201 1: $10,980 million). 
Intangible asset additions were $6,916 million 
in 2012 (2011: $442 million), including  
$1,464 million arising on the acquisition  
of Ardea, $3,358 million arising from the 
expansion of our diabetes alliance with BMS 
and $1,475 million in connection with our 
Merck arrangements. Amortisation in  
2012 was $1,296 million (2011: $911 million) 
and impairments totalled $199 million  
(2011: $553 million). Further details of  
our additions to intangible assets, and 
impairments recorded, are included in  
Note 9 to the Financial Statements from 
page 150. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables decreased by  
$934 million to $5,696 million in line  
with lower revenues in 2012. 
2012 other receivables decreased by  
$402 million to $835 million as a result of 
monies being released from externally held 
settlement funds in relation to Seroquel 
franchise legal matters. Prepayments and 
accrued income in 2012 increased by  
$563 million driven, principally, by an 
increase in prepayments related to our 
Amylin transaction (see Note 9 to the 
Financial Statements on page 150).
Trade and other payables increased by 
$862 million in 2012 to $10,222 million,  
with increases in accruals of $1,323 million 
due to our Merck exit commitments,  
as detailed in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 150, being offset  
by a decrease in rebates and chargeback 
accruals of $799 million. The 2012 decrease 
in rebates and chargebacks was principally 
driven by the reduction in US revenues 
recorded in 2012. Further details of the 
movements on rebates and chargebacks 
are included from page 83.
The reduction in provisions of $518 million  
in 2012 included $1,096 million of additional 
charges recorded in 2012, offset by  
$1,476 million of cash payments. Included 
within the $1,096 million of charges for  
2012 was $873 million for our global 
restructuring initiative and $90 million  
in respect of legal charges. 2012 cash 
payments of $1,476 million included a 
reduction in our Seroquel franchise-related 
provisions of $427 million, following release 
of monies from our settlement funds as 
detailed above, and $853 million for our 
global restructuring programmes.
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable in 2012 decreased 
by $275 million to $2,059 million, principally 
due to the settlement of a transfer pricing 
matter as detailed in Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements from page 143. Our 2012  
tax receivable balance of $803 million 
comprised tax owing to AstraZeneca  
from certain governments expected to be 
received on settlements of transfer pricing 
audits and disputes (see Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements on page 183) and 
cash tax timing differences. Net deferred 
tax liabilities increased by $244 million  
in 2012.
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations decreased 
by $409 million in 2012, driven by a lump 
sum payment of £300 million ($463 million) 
made into the UK defined benefit scheme. 
Revised Core financial measures
As detailed in our 2012 Annual Report  
and Form 20-F on pages 97 and 98,  
with effect from our first quarter results  
in 2013, the Group updated its definition  
of Core financial measures to exclude all 
intangible asset amortisation charges  
and impairments, except those for IT-related 
intangibles. 
Our previous definition of Core numbers 
excluded certain significant items, such as 
charges and provisions related to our global 
restructuring programmes, amortisation  
and impairment of the significant intangibles 
relating to our acquisition of MedImmune in 
2007 and our exit arrangements with Merck 
in the US, and other specified items. The 
items excluded from Core results under our 
previous definition remain a constituent part 
of the new definition.
As intangible assets acquired as a result  
of business development transactions 
become an increasing proportion of the 
Group’s asset base, our updated definition 
provides better clarity of the impact from 
amortisation and impairment charges 
included in Reported results and, in addition, 
while recognising that non-GAAP measures 
differ between companies, we consider that 
it aids comparability of our results versus 
our peers.
Further details of adjustments made to  
our Reported performance in arriving at  
our revised Core balances are included  
on page 76.
The adjustments that have been made to 
our 2012 Core numbers in transitioning from 
our previous Core definition to our revised 
Core definition are detailed in the table  
above. These include the adjustment made 
to both our Reported and Core balances 
following the adoption of the amendments 
contained in IAS 19 (2011) as detailed on 
page 136.

 Includes Euroclear and ADR holdings.
At 31 December 2013, the Company had 103,411 registered holders of 1,257 ,170,087 Ordinary Shares. There were 109,767 holders  
of Ordinary Shares held under the Euroclear Services Agreement, representing 11.8% of the issued share capital of the Company and 
approximately 250,000 holders of ADRs, representing 13.4% of the issued share capital of the Company. The ADRs, each of which is 
equivalent to one Ordinary Share, are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan).
In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Company’s share capital 
was redenominated in US dollars. On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid  
on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held. This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the 
sum arising as a result of the share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange 
prevailing on the record date. This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par.  
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the 
option of the Company on the giving of seven days’ written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date,  
21 May 1999. The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astra’s shares and the remaining  
0.4% was acquired in 2000, for cash.
Since April 1999, following the merger of Astra and Zeneca, the principal markets for trading in the shares of the Company are the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE), the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE) and the NYSE. The table below sets out, for 2012 and 2013, the reported 
high and low share prices of the Company, on the following bases:
 > For shares listed on the LSE, the reported high and low middle market closing quotations are derived from the Daily Official List.
 > For shares listed on the SSE, the high and low closing sales prices are as stated in the Official List.
 > For ADSs listed on the NYSE, the reported high and low sales prices are as reported by Dow Jones (ADR quotations).

Shareview
The Company’s shareholders with  
internet access may visit the website,  
www.shareview.co.uk, and register their 
details to create a portfolio. Shareview is  
a free and secure online service from the 
Company’s registrars, Equiniti Limited,

recent dividends.
ShareGift
The Company welcomes and values all  
of its shareholders, no matter how many  
or how few shares they own. However, 
shareholders who have only a small number 
of shares whose value makes it uneconomic 
to sell them, either now or at some stage in 
the future, may wish to consider donating 
them to charity through ShareGift, an 
independent charity share donation 
scheme. One feature of the scheme is  
that there is no gain or loss for UK capital 
gains tax purposes on gifts of shares 
through ShareGift, and it may now also  
be possible to obtain UK income tax relief 
on the donation. Further information about 
ShareGift can be found on its website, 
www.sharegift.org, or by contacting 
ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or at

Taxation for US residents
The following summary of material UK and 
US federal income tax consequences of 
ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held 
as capital assets by the US resident holders 
described below is based on current UK 
and US federal income tax law, including 
the US/UK double taxation convention 
relating to income and capital gains, which 
entered into force on 31 March 2003  
(the Convention). This summary does not 
describe all of the tax consequences that 
may be relevant in light of the US resident 
holders’ particular circumstances and tax 
consequences applicable to US resident 
holders subject to special rules (such as 
certain financial institutions, entities treated 
as partnerships for US federal income  
tax purposes, persons whose functional 
currency for US federal income tax 
purposes is not the US dollar, tax-exempt 
entities, persons subject to alternative 
minimum tax, persons subject to the 
Medicare contribution tax on ‘net 
investment income’, or persons holding 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection  
with a trade or business conducted  
outside of the US). US resident holders  
are urged to consult their tax advisers 
regarding the UK and US federal income  
tax consequences of the ownership and 
disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs  
in their particular circumstances. 
This summary is based in part on 
representations of JPMorgan as depositary 
for ADRs and assumes that each obligation 
in the deposit agreement among the 
Company, JPMorgan and the holders  
from time to time of ADRs and any  
related agreements will be performed in 
accordance with its terms. The US Treasury 
has expressed concerns that parties to 
whom ADSs are released before shares  
are delivered to the depositary (pre-release), 
or intermediaries in the chain of ownership 
between holders and the issuer of the 
security underlying the ADSs, may be  
taking actions that are inconsistent with  
the claiming, by US holders of ADSs, of 
foreign tax credits for US federal income  
tax purposes. Such actions would also  
be inconsistent with the claiming of the 
reduced tax rates, described below, 
applicable to dividends received by certain 
non-corporate US resident holders. 
Accordingly, the availability of the reduced 
tax rates for dividends received by certain 
non-corporate US resident holders could  
be affected by actions that may be taken by 
parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.
For the purposes of this summary, the term 
‘US resident holder’ means a beneficial 
owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that  
is, for US federal income tax purposes,  
a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation 
(or other entity taxable as a corporation) 
created or organised in or under the laws  
of the US, any state in the US or the District 
of Columbia, or an estate or trust, the 
income of which is subject to US federal 
income taxation regardless of its source.
This summary assumes that we are not, 
and will not become, a passive foreign 
investment company, as discussed overleaf.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report
227 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 UK and US income taxation  
of dividends
The UK does not currently impose a 
withholding tax on dividends paid by  
a UK company, such as the Company.
For US federal income tax purposes, 
distributions paid by the Company to a US 
resident holder are included in gross income 
as foreign source ordinary dividend income 
to the extent paid out of the Company’s 
current or accumulated earnings and 
profits, calculated in accordance with US 
federal income tax principles. The Company 
does not maintain calculations of its earning 
and profits under US federal income tax 
principles and so it is expected that 
distributions generally will be reported to US 
resident holders as dividends. The amount 
of the dividend will be the US dollar amount 
received by the depositary for US resident 
holders of ADRs (or, in the case of Ordinary 
Shares, the US dollar value of the pound 
sterling payments made, determined at the 
spot pound sterling/US dollar rate on the 
date the dividend is received by the US 
resident holders, regardless of whether the 
dividend is converted into US dollars), and it 
will not be eligible for the dividends received 
deduction generally available to US 
corporations. If the dividend is converted 
into US dollars on the date of receipt, US 
resident holders of Ordinary Shares 
generally should not be required to 
recognise foreign currency gains or losses 
in respect of the dividend income. They  
may have foreign currency gain or loss if the 
amount of such dividend is converted into 
US dollars after the date of its receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations and the 
discussion above regarding concerns 
expressed by the US Treasury, dividends 
received by certain non-corporate US 
resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
may be taxable at favourable US federal 
income tax rates. US resident holders 
should consult their own tax advisers to 
determine whether they are subject to any 
special rules which may limit their ability to  
be taxed at these favourable rates.
Taxation on capital gains
Under present English law, individuals who 
are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in 
the UK, and companies which are not 
resident in the UK, will not be liable for UK 
tax on capital gains made on the disposal  
of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless 
such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are held  
in connection with a trade, profession or 
vocation carried on in the UK through a 
branch or agency or other permanent 
establishment.
A US resident holder will generally recognise 
US source capital gains or losses for US 
federal income tax purposes on the sale or 
exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an 
amount equal to the difference between the 
US dollar amount realised and such holder’s 
US dollar tax basis in the Ordinary Shares or 
ADRs. US resident holders should consult 
their own tax advisers about the treatment 
of capital gains, which may be taxed at 
lower rates than ordinary income for 
non-corporate US resident holders and 
capital losses, the deductibility of which  
may be subject to limitation.
Passive Foreign Investment Company 
(PFIC) rules
We believe that we were not a PFIC  
for US federal income tax purposes for  
the year ended 31 December 2013. 
However, since PFIC status depends  
on the composition of our income and 
assets, and the market value of our assets 
(including, among others, less than 25% 
owned equity investments), from time to 
time, there can be no assurance that we  
will not be considered a PFIC for any 
taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC 
for any taxable year during which Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs were held, certain adverse 
tax consequences could apply to US 
resident holders.
Information reporting and backup 
withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds 
that are made within the US or through 
certain US-related financial intermediaries 
may be subject to information reporting  
and backup withholding, unless: (i) the US 
resident holder is a corporation or other 
exempt recipient; or (ii) in the case of 
backup withholding, the US resident holder 
provides a correct taxpayer identification 
number and certifies that it is not subject  
to backup withholding. The amount of any 
backup withholding from a payment to  
a US resident holder will be allowed as  
a credit against the holder’s US federal 
income tax liability and may entitle the 
holder to a refund, provided that the 
required information is timely supplied to  
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Certain US resident holders who are 
individuals (and under proposed US 
Treasury regulations, certain entities),  
may be required to report information 
relating to securities issued by non-US 
persons (or foreign accounts through which 
the securities are held), generally on IRS 
Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions 
(including an exception for securities held  
in accounts maintained by US financial 
institutions). US resident holders should 
consult their tax advisers regarding their 
reporting obligations with respect to the 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current Double Taxation (Estates) 
Convention (the Estate Tax Convention) 
between the US and the UK, Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs held by an individual 
shareholder who is domiciled for the 
purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in 
the US, and is not for the purposes of the 
Estate Tax Convention a national of the  
UK, will generally not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax on the individual’s death or 
on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares 
or ADRs during the individual’s lifetime, 
provided that any applicable US federal  
gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless  
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part  
of the business property of a permanent 
establishment of the individual in the UK or, 
in the case of a shareholder who performs 
independent personal services, pertain  
to a fixed base situated in the UK. Where 
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have been 
placed in trust by a settlor who, at the  
time of settlement, was a US domiciled 
shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or  
ADRs will generally not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the  
time of settlement, was a UK national, or  
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of  
the business property of a permanent 
establishment of the individual in the UK or, 
in the case of a shareholder who performs 
independent personal services, pertain  
to a fixed base situated in the UK. In the 
exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares 
or ADRs are subject to both UK inheritance 
tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the 
Estate Tax Convention generally provides  
for double taxation to be relieved by means 
of credit relief.
228 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013
Additional Information | Shareholder Information UK stamp duty reserve tax and  
stamp duty
A charge to UK stamp duty or UK stamp 
duty reserve tax (SDRT) may arise on the 
deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection 
with the creation of ADRs. The rate of stamp 
duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of  
the value of the consideration or, in some 
circumstances, the value of the Ordinary 
Shares. There is no 1.5% SDRT charge  
on the issue of Ordinary Shares (or, where  
it is integral to the raising of new capital,  
the transfer of Ordinary Shares) into the 
ADR arrangement. 
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the 
acquisition or transfer of existing ADRs 
provided that any instrument of transfer or 
written agreement to transfer is executed 
outside the UK and remains at all times 
outside the UK. An agreement for the 
transfer of ADRs will not give rise to a liability 
for SDRT.
A transfer of, or an agreement to, transfer 
Ordinary Shares will generally be subject  
to UK stamp duty or SDRT at 0.5% of  
the amount or value of any consideration, 
provided, in the case of stamp duty, it is 
rounded to the nearest £5.
Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST  
will generally not be subject to stamp duty 
or SDRT, unless such a transfer is made for 
a consideration in money or money’s worth, 
in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, 
usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value  
of the consideration. Paperless transfers  
of Ordinary Shares within CREST are 
generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% 
of the value of the consideration. CREST  
is obliged to collect SDRT from the 
purchaser on relevant transactions  
settled within the system.
Exchange controls and other 
limitations affecting security holders
There are no governmental laws, decrees  
or regulations in the UK restricting the 
import or export of capital or affecting the 
remittance of dividends, interest or other 
payments to non-resident holders of 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
There are no limitations under English law  
or the Articles on the right of non-resident  
or foreign owners to be the registered 
holders of, or to exercise voting rights in 
relation to, Ordinary Shares or ADRs  
or to be registered holders of notes or 
debentures of Zeneca Wilmington Inc.

229 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Corporate Information
History and development of the 
Company
AstraZeneca PLC was incorporated in 
England and Wales on 17 June 1992  
under the Companies Act 1985. It is a 
public limited company domiciled in the  
UK. The Company’s registered number 
is 2723534 and its registered office is  
at 2 Kingdom Street, London W2 6BD 
(telephone +44 (0)20 7604 8000). From 
February 1993 until April 1999, the 
Company was called Zeneca Group PLC. 
On 6 April 1999, the Company changed  
its name to AstraZeneca PLC.
The Company was formed when the 
pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty 
chemical businesses of Imperial Chemical 
Industries PLC were demerged in 1993.  
In 1999, the Company sold the specialty 
chemical business. Also in 1999, the 
Company merged with Astra of Sweden.  
In 2000, it demerged the agrochemical 
business and merged it with the similar 
business of Novartis to form a new 
company called Syngenta AG.
In 2007 , the Group acquired MedImmune,  
a biologics and vaccines business based  
in the US.
The Group’s corporate office is at  
2 Kingdom Street, London W2 6BD.
Articles
Objects
The Company’s objects are unrestricted.
Any amendment to the Articles requires  
the approval of shareholders by a  
special resolution at a general meeting  
of the Company.
Directors
The Board has the authority to manage  
the business of the Company, for example, 
through powers to allot and repurchase  
its shares, subject where required to 
shareholder resolutions. Subject to certain 
exceptions, Directors do not have power  
to vote at Board meetings on matters in 
which they have a material interest.
The quorum for meetings of the Board is a 
majority of the full Board, of whom at least 
four must be Non-Executive Directors. In 
the absence of a quorum, the Directors do 
not have power to determine compensation 
arrangements for themselves or any 
member of the Board.
The Board may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money. Variation  
of these borrowing powers would require 
the passing of a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
All Directors must retire from office  
at the Company’s AGM each year and  
may present themselves for election or 
re-election. Directors are not prohibited, 
upon reaching a particular age, from 
submitting themselves for election or 
re-election.
Within two months of the date of their 
appointment, Directors are required  
to beneficially own Ordinary Shares  
of an aggregate nominal amount of at  
least $125, which currently represents  
500 shares.
Rights, preferences and restrictions 
attaching to shares
As at 31 December 2013, the Company  
had 1,257 ,170,087 Ordinary Shares and 
50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares  
in issue. The Ordinary Shares represent 
99.97% and the Redeemable Preference 
Shares represent 0.03% of the Company’s 
total share capital (these percentages  
have been calculated by reference to the 
closing mid-point US$/GBP exchange  
rate on 31 December 2013 as published  
in the London edition of the Financial  
Times newspaper).
As agreed by the shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM held on 29 April 2010,  
the Articles were amended with immediate 
effect to remove the requirement for the 
Company to have an authorised share 
capital, the concept of which was abolished 
under the Companies Act 2006. Each 
Ordinary Share carries the right to vote  
at general meetings of the Company.  
The rights and restrictions attaching to  
the Redeemable Preference Shares differ 
from those attaching to Ordinary Shares  
as follows: 
 > The Redeemable Preference Shares 
carry no rights to receive dividends.
 > The holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have no rights to receive notices 
of, attend or vote at general meetings 
except in certain limited circumstances. 
They have one vote for every 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares held.
 > On a distribution of assets of the 
Company, on a winding-up or other return 
of capital (subject to certain exceptions), 
the holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have priority over the holders of 
Ordinary Shares to receive the capital 
paid up on those shares.
 > Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company  
has the right to redeem the Redeemable 
Preference Shares at any time on giving 
not less than seven days’ written notice.
There are no specific restrictions on  
the transfer of shares in the Company,  
which is governed by the Articles and 
prevailing legislation.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of shares  
that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of shares or that may result in restrictions  
on voting rights.
Action necessary to change the rights  
of shareholders
In order to vary the rights attached to any 
class of shares, the consent in writing of  
the holders of three-quarters in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class or 
the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a general meeting of such 
holders is required.
General meetings
AGMs and other general meetings, as  
from time to time may be required, where  
a special resolution is to be passed or a 
Director is to be appointed, require 21 clear 
days’ notice to shareholders. Subject to  
the Companies Act 2006, other general 
meetings require 14 clear days’ notice.
For all general meetings, a quorum of  
two shareholders present in person or by 
proxy, and entitled to vote on the business 
transacted, is required unless each of  
the two persons present are corporate 
representatives of the same corporation;  
or each of the two persons present are 
proxy of the same shareholder.
Shareholders and their duly appointed 
proxies and corporate representatives are 
entitled to be admitted to general meetings.
Limitations on the rights to own shares
There are no limitations on the rights to  
own shares.
Property
Substantially all of our properties are held 
freehold, free of material encumbrances  
and are fit for their purpose.

235 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Cautionary statement regarding 
forward-looking statements
The purpose of this Annual Report is to 
provide information to the members of the 
Company. The Company and its Directors, 
employees, agents and advisers do not 
accept or assume responsibility to any 
other person to whom this Annual Report  
is shown or into whose hands it may come 
and any such responsibility or liability is 
expressly disclaimed. In order, among  
other things, to utilise the ‘safe harbour’ 
provisions of the US Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the UK 
Companies Act 2006, we are providing the 
following cautionary statement: This Annual 
Report contains certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to the operations, 
performance and financial condition of the 
Group, including, among other things, 
statements about expected revenues, 
margins, earnings per share or other 
financial or other measures. Forward-
looking statements are statements  
relating to the future which are based  
on information available at the time such 
statements are made, including information 
relating to risks and uncertainties. Although 
we believe that the forward-looking 
statements in this Annual Report are  
based on reasonable assumptions, the 
matters discussed in the forward-looking 
statements may be influenced by factors 
that could cause actual outcomes and 
results to be materially different from those 
expressed or implied by these statements. 
The forward-looking statements reflect 
knowledge and information available at  
the date of the preparation of this Annual 
Report and the Company undertakes no 
obligation to update these forward-looking 
statements. We identify the forward-looking 
statements by using the words ‘anticipates’, 
‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’ and similar 
expressions in such statements. Important 
factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those contained in 
forward-looking statements, certain of 
which are beyond our control, include, 
among other things, those factors identified 
in the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section from page 200 of this Annual 
Report. Nothing in this Annual Report 
should be construed as a profit forecast.
Inclusion of Reported performance, 
Core financial measures and constant 
exchange rate growth rates
AstraZeneca’s determination of non-GAAP 
measures together with our presentation  
of them within our financial information may 
differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
measures of other companies.
Statements of competitive position, 
growth rates and sales
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise 
stated, market information regarding  
the position of our business or products 
relative to its or their competition is based 
upon published statistical sales data  
for the 12 months ended 30 September 
2013 obtained from IMS Health, a  
leading supplier of statistical data to  
the pharmaceutical industry. Unless 
otherwise noted, for the US, dispensed  
new or total prescription data and audited 
sales data are taken, respectively, from  
IMS Health National Prescription Audit  
and IMS National Sales Perspectives for  
the 12 months ended 31 December 2013;  
such data is not adjusted for Medicaid and 
similar rebates. At the time of production  
of this Annual Report, AstraZeneca 
understands that IMS Health intends  
to restate its published US sales data  
for the 12 months ended 30 September 
2013, with such restatement to take place in 
March 2014. While it has not been possible 
to revise the data in this Annual Report 
based on such restated data, AstraZeneca 
understands (had it been possible) that the 
impact on the market information included 
in this Annual Report would not have been 
significant or material. Except as otherwise 
stated, these market share and industry 
data from IMS Health have been derived  
by comparing our sales revenue to 
competitors’ and total market sales 
revenues for that period. Except as 
otherwise stated, growth rates are given  
at CER. For the purposes of this Annual 
Report, unless otherwise stated, references 
to the world pharmaceutical market or 
similar phrases are to the 54 countries 
contained in the IMS Health database, 
which amounted to approximately  
92% (in value) of the countries audited  
by IMS Health.

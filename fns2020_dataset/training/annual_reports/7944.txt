History
In 2008, incadea Holding was 
established as the Group’s new holding 
company, with Real Consulting, a 
provider of systems integration and 
IT services, making an indirect 74.9% 
investment in incadea Holding through 
its subsidiary, Danbury Enterprises 
Limited. 
A company controlled by the owners 
of Real Consulting then acquired the 
remaining 25.1% shareholding in 
incadea Holding in December 2010. 
The Existing Shareholders (“Significant 
Shareholders”), the majority of which 
are under common control with Real 
Consulting, subsequently acquired 
shares in incadea Holding through a 
series of reorganisation transactions 
during 2011 and early 2012. 
On 16 May 2012, the Company 
acquired the entire issued share capital 
of incadea Holding from the Existing 
Shareholders pursuant to the Share 
Exchange Agreement and, accordingly, 
became the Group’s holding company.
Following that, on 25 May 2012 the 
Company completed a successful 
IPO with the admission to AIM 
boosting its reputation, strengthening 
existing relationships with customers 
and partners and accelerating the 
development of new opportunities.
Following the Secondary Placing of 
11,100,000 ordinary shares at 
21.01.2014 raising approximately 
€14 million, the Group acquired RCRBS 
gaining direct presence in Germany.  
In addition, remaining funds will 
support further product development 
and working capital requirements.
incadea Annual Report 2013 05 We aim to address the needs of the retail vehicle 
industry worldwide by offering a global solutions 
with state-of-the-art innovation and local 
execution capabilities. 
The need of the OEMs to offer seamless customer 
experiences, to increase the margins from the 
operations and to understand better the needs  
of their customers is a unique opportunity for  
us. To meet this opportunity we are taking 
advantage of the Microsoft technology stack,  
we offer local delivery capabilities from an 
international organisation.
Market 
Overview – 
Global 
Potential
The latest global economic 
development suggest Mexico, 
Indonesia, Nigeria and 
Turkey – dubbed the MINT 
countries – as the next 
critical areas on the  
global map for business 
development and expansion.
MINT markets already 
showed remarkably signs of 
development and growth 
alarming the new era of what 
called “emerging markets”.
Addressable market
incadea following the latest 
developments for the global economic 
business growth and reacting to OEMs 
perception which consider MINT 
markets as future economic 
powerhouses of the world with 
exponentially growth in terms of 
wealth and population over the next 
few decades has already taken a 
strategic position. The new emerging 
market of Mexico served now by 
incadea Mexico while future investment 
plans include strategic cooperations in 
the Middle-East market, having a start 
the Turkish market.
Management believes that there are 
opportunities for incadea to establish a 
leading global market position over the 
next few years following the successful 
addressing in BRIC markets and 
through new investments and 
penetrating MINT markets, both 
serving the needs of the OEMs for 
globalisation and standardisation.
Following last year recession, in 
Europe, the Group is in a strong 
position to meet successfully the 
growth potential.

06 incadea Annual Report 2013 New generation solutions
During 2013 incadea spent significant 
effort in order to enhance the new 
single enterprise technology platform 
with “cloud” capabilities” and mobile 
integration which based on DMS, CRM 
and BI solutions offer streamlined 
processes across geographies, cost 
optimisation, growth management and 
new automotive retail concepts.
International supplier
Having a strong footprint in the key 
growth areas of the world as well  
as the international cooperation with 
major OEMs, incadea is positioned  
as an international level supplier. 
Through the it`s affiliates network and 
the strong service presence, incadea is 
covering the needs of OEMs expansion, 
by providing a standardised service 
portfolio and international project 
management processes.
SaaS
Following the global trend of 
applications being provided as SaaS 
(software as a service) and aligned 
closely with Microsoft cloud strategy, 
incadea solutions transform from 
traditional on-premise offering to cloud 
offering, eliminating customer CAPEX 
investment, reducing deployment time 
and efforts with predefined industry 
packages and configurations, 
supporting the OEM concepts. incadea 
is experiencing this development very 
rapidly in the Asian growth countries, 
where most customers prefer a rental 
model versus an upfront investment 
model. Although during the year SaaS 
Licences revenues did not have a 
significant contribution in total Group `s 
revenue, there are already contracted 
SaaS license sales which shall have a 
positive impact on the SaaS revenue 
portion over the following years.
Key trends
The Directors believe that product 
standardisation and the 
implementation of global solutions in 
retail networks are major strategic 
priorities for OEMs and perceive that 
the automotive industry is being driven 
by a few key trends, including: 
• pressure on profitability resulting in 
further standardisation in retail 
networks; 
• standardised retail and sales 
processes and solutions; 
• increasing competition in the 
automotive industry leading to a 
growing focus on the customer and 
demand for customer data; and 
• OEM growth plans targeting BRIC, 
MINT, and other emerging markets, 
which necessitate standard, 
off-the-shelf solutions that can be 
implemented in short order.

Overview – 
Global 
Potential
continued
Market presence
Europe
In Europe, the Group has opportunities 
both with existing customers as well as 
with new. With the existing customers 
we aim to capitalise our large installed 
base and upgrade in order sell our 
advanced solutions – CVRM, Mobility 
and BI – while we aim to roll out our 
latest version of DMS to the new OEMs 
we have signed worldwide. We believe 
that the European market, although 
mature, has a big need for advanced 
solutions that can only be covered by 
our portfolio. 
The acquisition of the VAR partner in 
Germany, RC Real Business Solutions 
GmbH (“RCRBS”), completed post 
year-end, provides a strategic entry to 
direct selling in Germany, expands the 
client base and enhances margin 
accordingly. 
Russia and CIS
In the past two years the Russian 
economy has slowed down both in terms 
of GDP growth as well as in terms of car 
sales. Nevertheless, we see new OEMs 
entering the market – mainly Chinese – 
and we also see a strong demand from 
the CIS markets which are not affected 
so much by the Russian economy. Our 
plan is to increase our installed base by 
winning new OEMs either in Russia or in 
CIS countries.
In 2013 overall revenue was weaker 
than 2012 mainly due to the delay of 
two budgeted projects related to BMW. 
Management focus more on the 
business expansion and further 
investments in the Russian market to 
secure growth for the Russian 
subsidiary in the next years. 
As a result, incadea continues to build 
a strong position in these markets and 
continuous cooperation with the major 
OEMs of the area. The Group works 
closely with BMW for DMS and CRM 
projects, while first pilot projects for 
Lada and our strategic partnership 
with PSA provide a valuable entry point 
for the “mass” market in Russia. We 
believe that our strategic partnership 
with PSA will show in the very near 
future significant growth potential in 
the Russian market. Furthermore, 
based on our progress with Mercedes 
the planning for the first pilots is 
in progress.
Asia Pacific region
Currently the Group has installed a 
licence base of approximately 15,365 
users in the Asia Pacific region. In late 
2011 the Group acquired its partner, 
Avanti, headquartered in New Zealand 
with a branch office in Taiwan, which 
will serve as the base for the Group’s 
growing Asia Pacific operations. In 
2013 incadea New Zealand opened 
another branch office in Malaysia. 
Current key projects in the  
region are a rollout of licences and 
implementation services for VW Group 
in Malaysia and Hong Kong.
China
incadea has a current installed licence 
base of approximately 7,443 users 
in China. During 2013, incadea China 
delivered on a contract for VW, rolling 
out incadea.engine to 1,200 end users. 
Subsequently, this rollout contributed 
significantly to the revenue and 
profitability of the Group and will 
continue to contribute from 2014 
onwards through the growth of the 
brand in China.
In 2013 incadea China opened offices 
in Shanghai and grew significantly its 
amount of skilled resource in Beijing 
and Shanghai.
Importantly, in October 2012, incadea 
won its first local contract with a 
Chinese OEM, Qoros, a manufacturer 
of competitively priced mid-size cars 
for the Chinese and European markets. 
Under this contract, which is both for 
licences and services, incadea is 
delivering its next-generation DMS, 
incadea.myengine, to the Qoros dealer 
network across China. The rollout of 
incadea.myengine started in 2013 and 
continues through 2014. Qoros 
announced its plans to enter the 
European market, which provides 
further expansion possibilities outside 
the growth Qoros anticipates in China. 
In 2013 incadea China won another 
important project through signing an 
agreement with Ford China to roll out 
incadea.myengine and incadea.cvrm to 
the luxury brand dealer network of 
Lincoln China.
India
The Group’s current installed licence 
base in India is approximately 1,822 
end users. Originally, this market was 
supported by a local VAR partner. In 
Q3 2011 the Group acquired a 
subsidiary in India with experienced 
and skilled personnel and has since its 
entire business to incadea India. 
incadea India is working with BMW 
Group and VW Group as strategic 
OEMs in the country to provide a 
rollout of the Group’s products and 
services. The subsidiary is already 
directly providing dealer support and 
rolling out incadea.engine to the BMW, 
including Mini, dealer networks. In 
2013 the Group signed an agreement 
with Scania for the development and 
rollout of incadea solution in India.

Iberia/Latin America
While we continue to accelerate our 
Mexican operations we support our 
expansion in Latin America via our 
Spanish and Portuguese offices. This 
strategy combines expertise with local 
presence for the on-site rollouts. We 
plan to continue in 2014 with the 
same strategy while exploring the 
potential of new countries direct or 
through partners.
Mexico is the second largest 
automotive market in South America, 
at the same time being one of the 
fastest growing. As most OEMs have 
significant production plants in Mexico 
to supply South America and the USA, 
management expect Mexico to be the 
next most significant market for 
incadea, after Brazil. In 2011 incadea 
changed from its partner engagement 
in Mexico to direct business. incadea 
Group successfully won a significant 
upgrade project with BMW which will 
be served by the newly established 
subsidiary. The Mexico operations are 
also expected to act as the hub to 
support BMW throughout Latin 
America. incadea has established an 
installed base of approximately 1,345 
users in the Latin America region. 
BMW Mexico upgrade projects are 
successfully implemented at a large 
extend of the BMW network.
In 2013 Mercedes Mexico endorsed 
incadea.myengine for its dealer 
network, which will generate first 
revenues in 2014.
In addition, the Group runs various 
projects for BMW in Colombia and 
Paraguay and has agreed installations 
in other leading OEMs such as Nissan 
and Toyota.
incadea Annual Report 2013 09 We are confident that the conditions 
and prospects in our markets remain 
positive, setting a foundation for the 
further growth of incadea. 
David Hobley 
Chairman
2013 was another milestone year for incadea, in 
which we achieved further growth of the business 
in terms of revenues, clients and geographies 
alongside the successful completion of projects 
and tasks of strategic importance.
Chairman’s 
Letter
Revenues for the year grew by 
approximately 23% to €36.0 million 
(2102: €29.3 million) delivering an 
EBITDA margin of 21.3% (2012: 
21.4%). Of the total revenue, 
approximately 36% was derived from 
licences sold while maintenance 
contributed another 23%. 
Reflecting upon the strategic priorities 
set out at the beginning of the year, 
I am delighted that we managed to 
successfully deliver on all of them. 
We continued our global expansion, 
with incadea now serving more than 
67,000 end users in more than 2,400 
dealerships in 87 countries and across 
all continents. 
We continued to grow operations in 
Asia Pacific, BRIC and Latin America 
and also strengthened our business 
in Turkey and the Middle East.  
We established relationships with 
additional global OEM customers, 
significantly improving the risk profile 
of the business and the pipeline of 
opportunities. The new customer 
relationships and contracts will 
enhance the directly accessible 
installed base by approximately 60,000 
users over the next four to five years, 
with the increase in related recurring 
revenues. This will improve the 
visibility of the Group’s performance as 
the contracts roll out. These 
developments throughout the year 
have gradually led to a considerable 
increase in the number and scale of 
business opportunities. In addition,  
we saw increased demand from clients 
for the Group’s cloud/SaaS business 
model, particularly those outside 
Europe. 
This is reflected by new contracts 
and other opportunities mainly in the 
APAC region.
In parallel with the organic growth and 
in alignment with the stated strategy 
to pursue value-enhancing acquisition 
opportunities in key markets which 
strengthen our direct sales network, 
we undertook an acquisition of our 
partner in Germany, RCRBS, which 
completed subsequent to the year-end. 
We are confident that the conditions 
and prospects in our markets remain 
positive, setting a foundation for  
the further growth of incadea. Our 
state-of-the-art technology and 
product offering fit the ongoing 
requirements of OEMs to standardise 
the operations of their dealership 
networks while our constantly 
increasing geographic reach provides 
us with the necessary scale and 
capacity to serve them globally, as a 
full technology and service provider. 
10 incadea Annual Report 2013 Our strategy to cement our position 
within the enterprise software 
solutions and services sector of the 
global automotive dealership industry 
is shaped around three pillars of 
growth. The first of these is market 
penetration, which we aim to achieve 
by expanding our geographic footprint 
and increasing OEM penetration. 
Secondly, we aim to enhance our sales 
model by improving our SaaS/cloud 
capabilities and enhancing our value-
added services. The final pillar of 
growth will be achieved by selective 
acquisitions which will enlarge our 
direct network and improve time 
to market. 
incadea is now entering an exciting 
phase of further growth and 
investment. In the short term, new 
projects with new OEMs will require 
significant investment in customisation 
and integration in 2014 and 2015 to 
prepare for rollout from 2015 onwards. 
Moreover, product development is a 
continuous process, while our 
agreements with Microsoft help us 
prepare for increase in demand of our 
SaaS/cloud offerings. During the 
financial year, incadea’s relationship 
with Microsoft has strengthened 
significantly. incadea is now ranked 
among the top 22 global partners out 
of 2,000 in the Microsoft Dynamics 
channel. This achievement will enhance 
credibility in the market and help to 
provide the Group with the necessary 
support to roll out large international 
contracts efficiently. 
In support of our expansion plans and 
investment programme, we obtained 
a €23 million, five-year senior facility 
with Citibank which together with the 
cash on the balance sheet will provide 
the necessary financial resources to 
execute our strategic plans.
Current trading and prospects
The Board believes that the 
developments described above signal a 
material, positive shift in scale for the 
prospects of the Group in the medium 
term. We are certain that the steps 
taken during the year under review 
were fully aligned with our goal of 
becoming vendor of choice for global 
OEMs. Our focus remains on exploring 
organic and acquisitive opportunities 
while delivering against an already 
developed pipeline, to scale up the 
business in a profitable and cash 
generative way. The latter remains a 
goal for the medium term, once we 
have achieved full roll out of the key 
contracts recently announced. As we 
grow, both in terms of size and 
geographic reach, one of the key 
challenges is to attract and retain 
talent. The recently announced 
appointments of executives under the 
leadership of the newly appointed CEO 
are supportive to the Group’s strategy 
for global and sustainable growth.
In all aspects, 2013 was a remarkable 
year in terms of commercial and 
corporate development. The Group 
now faces multiple new opportunities 
with existing and new clients, such 
as Mercedes-Benz and PSA Peugeot/
Citroën while the recently announced 
acquisition of RCRBS provides as with 
strategic entry to direct selling in 
Germany, expands client base and 
potential new customers, improves 
scalability internationally and reduces 
time to market. The consolidation of 
RCRBS is expected to be immediately 
earnings enhancing and we are 
extremely satisfied with the 
oversubscribed placing of £11.5 million 
of new shares, to fund its acquisition.  
I am happy to report that trading 
during the first three months is in line 
with our expectations and we remain 
confident about meeting the financial 
performance targets for the year.

are stabilising while major growth trend continues 
to come from the emerging markets.
Business  
Model and  
Strategy
Automotive industry is nowadays 
characterised by a highly competitive 
market environment, profitability 
pressure, markets expansion and 
shifting from the traditional sales to 
e-commerce channels. Automotive 
industry’s growth driver had shifted 
away from traditional to emerging 
markets, which has a huge impact 
on OEMs’ strategic decisions for 
addressing the markets. Traditional 
markets following a recession period, 
are stabilising while major growth 
trend continues to come from the 
emerging markets. Fast-evolving 
dealership landscape is another key 
characteristic of the automotive 
industry where dealers expand their 
range of services and touch points with 
their customers. Technology sets the 
pace on the dealers’ competition, while 
the ability to combine financing and 
leasing services together, the car sale 
is considered a key business 
characteristic. 
The OEMs are quickly adopting into 
this environment by standardising and 
optimising the whole value chain from 
manufacturing to car service for the 
end customer, by personalising the 
consumer`s handling and care and 
targeting a complete offering of 
“satellite” services together with the 
traditional ones of car selling and 
servicing it.
incadea`s solution offering of a single 
enterprise technology platform 
comprising of integrated solutions on 
DMS, CRM, BI, mobile accessibility  
and business-oriented applications 
provides to the OEMs a unified 
environment for managing their whole 
value chain. OEMs can improve the 
dealership experience by optimising 
and automating key operational 
processes; providing workers with 
role-tailored dashboards to manage 
their tasks; better supporting sales 
teams to optimise lead management 
and increase conversion rates; and 
improving business analysis with 
access to specific information and 
reports by individual branch or car 
make across multiple servers, 
databases, companies or entire dealer 
networks.
Cloud enablement solution and 
seamless mobile connectivity, gives to 
the OEMs and dealers the opportunity 
to optimise their car selling and service 
offerings, focusing on improving

incadea Annual Report 2013 15 Consulting services
Our consulting services department 
consists of highly skilled, experienced 
IT consultants having the required 
knowledge to implement our 
specialised products solutions to 
incadea customers around the world. 
The Company’s implementation 
approach is based on very structured 
and well-defined methodology that 
ensures successful implementation 
of our product suite. Most of the 
projects start with the stage of the 
requirements analysis. During this 
stage incadea consultants use FIT/GAP 
analysis methodology, in order to 
gather the customers’ requirements, 
finalise and prioritise the project’s 
specifications.
incadea consultants proceed with the 
implementation of the solution by 
providing training and data-migration 
services based on predefined 
methodologies to ensure successful and 
smooth migration from the legacy to 
the new system. On-site support is 
being provided in the most efficient 
manner in order to ensure that end 
users are confident and capable of 
using the system, and that the project’s 
benefits can be experienced within the 
predefined scope.
incadea’s consulting teams around 
the world are very experienced in 
delivering rollout projects and defining 
the conversion plan, the operations 
instructions and the rollout plan in the 
most efficient and cost effective 
manner. 
Our system implementation 
methodology is being audited in every 
stage the entire project life cycle in 
order to ensure that deliverables fulfil 
the customer’s quality expectations, 
and that all consulting activities adhere 
to the policies and standards of 
incadea Group for solution 
implementation. 
Project management
incadea project managers are assigned 
with the responsibility to present, to 
agree and to establish the project 
standards. They are accountable to run 
the projects on a day-to-day basis on 
behalf of the Steering Committee, 
monitor the project stages against 
the agreed plans, develop high and 
detailed plans, coordinate teams and 
ensure that deliverables meet the 
customer’s stated requirements. Risk 
management and quality assurance 
are key accountabilities of the project 
managers throughout the project life 
cycle in order to ensure that deadlines 
will be achieved and project 
deliverables will fulfill the quality 
expectations. Projects are managed in 
a very structured and process-based 
manner by adopting a tool-box of 
processes and procedures based on 
the PRINCE II project management 
methodology. 
Striving for excellence, we 
continuously improve our services 
quality by identifying areas that 
require improvement and taking the 
necessary corrective actions. Our 
project management activities are 
audited in predefined time intervals to 
ensure compliance with our principles 
and standards. 
Our customers can trust our 
competence in project management to 
run and deliver small, medium and 
large scale projects and therefore 
allow them to focus on core business 
objectives.

Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) 
market, incadea solutions suite has 
incorporated industry best practices.

their extensive product knowledge and 
their experience in providing services 
in different OEM landscapes, have the 
ability to provide a part of the 
products’ installation and consultation 
on industry best practices for each of 
the installations they provide.
OEM compliance assessments and 
optimisation
An important field for SW selection 
and implementation is the compliance 
of the installation to the OEMs’ 
requirements as well as the 
optimisation of the business processes 
reflected in the systems to be 
implemented. incadea’s solutions and 
services address the whole chain of 
the automotive’s ERP landscape (from 
the central OEM installations, to the 
national companies down to the dealer 
and service workshops), providing the 
ability for end users to be compliant 
with the central OEM requirements as 
well as to have an optimum way of 
operating. 
Services
16 incadea Annual Report 2013 Implementation assurance for 
critical business applications;
It is a general requirement in the 
software industry for ERP software to 
inform critical business applications 
for product and services providers. 
incadea provides implementation 
assurance for the critical business 
applications, through its well defined 
implementation methodology. This 
addresses any issues that may occur 
early and provides solutions to ensure 
the continuity of the critical operations.
Operational optimisation to 
maximise return on investments;
A major outcome that customers look 
for when selecting ERP software is 
the optimisation of its operation. 
Specifically, as the introduction of 
a new ERP is accompanied by a 
significant investment in terms of 
capital expenditure as well as 
operating expenditure by the end 
customer, customers want to maximise 
their investment through process 
optimisation that should lead either to 
an increase of turnover or optimisation 
of their costs. incadea products and 
services cover this need by providing 
end-to-end transparency to the 
business processes that run either 
at the local level of a dealer or in 
the whole chain from the central 
OEM down to the service workshop 
(ordering processes, resource 
optimisation, selling, marketing 
activities, vehicles handling etc are 
examples of processes or areas that 
are optimised from incadea products 
and services).
E-learning services
Aiming to provide an innovative and 
best-in-class education experience to 
incadea associates around the world, 
our channel partners and end business 
users of incadea solutions, the Group 
has deployed a modern e-learning/
training platform accessible through 
the web. By deploying this powerful 
solution, the Company has managed 
to reduce the high demand and 
dependency of skilled trainers and 
training related travel expenditures. In 
addition, the Group has achieved to 
standardise quality of the trainings 
and the possibility that the trainees 
validate their knowledge – with no 
time or location limitations. 
Business consulting
The role of business consulting  
within our organisation is to assist 
customers when developing the 
understanding of their needs and 
making sure the solution proposed is 
addressing the business requirements, 
brings expected return of investment 
and benefits. It also supports when 
defining implementation approach and 
change management strategy. The 
Group’s Business Consultants take the 
best out of the automotive market 
experience and convert it into best 
business practices. They are 
automotive retail experts able to 
advise our customers about the trends 
and future of the industry but also 
about the day-to-day operations, 
optimisation of the processes, 
improving efficiency and profitability. 
Business consulting holds an important 
role in improving and enriching the 
Company’s product portfolio, assuring 
competitiveness and innovation. It also 
assures Company recognition on the 
automotive market as a partner for 
the OEMs for the best practice and 
standardisation approach rather than 
IT vendor.

Dynamics” status of incadea.myengine 
all Microsoft subsidiaries have to present 
incadea for the automotive sector.
2013 offered us solid ground for 
expanding and enriching our long-
standing relationship with Microsoft.
During Microsoft’s annual Worldwide 
Partner Conference in July 2013 and as 
a result of the Group’s commitment to 
providing customers with innovative 
solutions and extensive know-how on 
Microsoft’s technologies, incadea was 
appointed as one of Microsoft’s top 22 
global Independent Software Vendors 
“ISVs”. Also, in the second half of 
2013, incadea was named as the 
number one Microsoft Dynamics ISV 
for ERP in terms of licence sales. 
Consequently, with Microsoft Dynamics 
AX providing a modern and powerful 
ERP system, incadea and Microsoft 
have initiated the co-funded 
development of an automotive 
enterprise platform based on AX, in 
order to fulfil the sophisticated needs 
of large dealer groups and importers.
The status, earned in the Microsoft 
Partner Network, demonstrates the 
deep knowledge of incadea in these 
areas. 
incadea has very good connections 
within the Operations Centers of 
Microsoft that allows us to serve our 
customer needs at the best level.
Due to the fact that incadea is 
represented in several partner 
advisory boards, incadea is provided 
with key information before its partner 
channel. That provides a key 
advantage to incadea for developing its 
strategy.
Contractually, the relationship with 
Microsoft is determined by the 
following:
(i) a Solution Provider Agreement 
(“SPA”);
(ii) an Independent Software Vendor 
embed agreement (“ISV”).
(a) Solution Provider Agreement
The SPA is the primary agreement 
between incadea Austria and 
Microsoft, pursuant to which incadea 
Austria is entitled to combine its 
software with Microsoft’s products and 
is appointed as a distribution partner 
of Microsoft. Under the SPA incadea 
Austria is granted a non-exclusive right 
to provide Dynamics NAV software and 
respective services to customers and 
is entitled to: 
(i)  order licences in the Dynamics 
NAV software and related services 
from Microsoft; and 
(ii)  to distribute such licences to third 
parties.
(b) Independent Software Vendor 
Embed Agreement
The ISV enables incadea to integrate 
the Microsoft Dynamics NAV software 
into its software and to distribute such 
software, either, directly or indirectly, 
through resellers, to end users. If the 
software is distributed by resellers, the 
reseller is only entitled to distribute the 
Dynamics NAV software, but to grant 
sublicences to end users. In such case 
the Dynamics NAV software is then 
directly licensed by incadea Austria to 
end users.

(c) Global Independent Software 
Vendor Agreement
The Global Independent Software 
Vendor Agreement (“GISV”) is a 
program within Microsoft to deliver 
vertical solution and expertise on a few 
product lines including Microsoft 
Dynamics AX. Globally, only 22 
partners have been accepted by 
Microsoft to be included in this 
programme, including incadea which 
signed the agreement in June 2013 
and initiated the co-funded 
development of an automotive 
enterprise platform based on AX, in 
order to fulfil the sophisticated needs 
of large dealer groups and importers.
Customer partner
To date, incadea maintains long-term 
relationships with 15 VAR partners, 
based in:
Austria | Belgium | Bulgaria | Cyprus | 
Czech Republic | France | | Hong Kong 
| Hungary | Italy | Kenya | Lebanon | 
Netherlands | Norway | Poland | 
Switzerland
Following the strategy of expansion, 
incadea has continuously facilitated 
direct sales, and to support this 
process acquired a number of 
successful partners over the course of 
2013, thus drastically increasing its 
own share of sales in comparison to 
the previous years:
Approach per region 
Europe 
Europe region is addressed from both 
incadea companies (affiliates and 
headquarters) as well as partner 
channels. In specific:
Germany: 
Addressed through the new subsidiary 
whose acquisition has been completed 
post closing 2013, plus OEM level 
services which are delivered by 
incadea headquarters (invoiced 
through incadea Austria)
Austria:
Addressed through partner channel
Spain:
Addressed through affiliate (incadea 
Spain)
Greece and Southeast Europe:
Addressed through affiliate (incadea 
Greece). incadea Greece is also the 
regional headquarters coordinating 
actions for Turkey
Portugal:
Addressed through incadea Portugal 
(incadea’s affiliate)
Rest of Europe:
Addressed through partner channel. 
Russia
Being one of the most important 
markets for incadea Group, Russia was 
the first region where the change of 
the partner to own affiliate model was 
introduced. 
In Russia there are implementations in 
several OEMs, although the majority of 
the installed base is referred to BMW.
Latin America
Latin America, although with the 
smallest footprint in relation to the 
other regions, consists of a key area 
for the Group.
Until the end of 2011, Latin America 
region was served from partner 
channel. Within the year 2012, major 
activities in the area where shifted 
from partner channel to incadea Spain, 
while in last quarter of 2012, the local 
affiliate incadea Mexico was 
established to further strengthen the 
Group `s presence in the region.
incadea Spain, Mexico and Portugal 
consists of the operational branch of 
Group with focus on the region, 
addressing and targeting LatAm, 
Caribbean and Brazilian markets.
Africa
Africa region is served from partners. 
Asia/Pacific
Asia/Pacific region is approached 
through a hybrid model, depending on 
country, incadea affiliate establishment 
and customer relationships.
incadea Group operates in the region 
through its affiliates (incadea New 
Zealand, India, China) and through the 
partner channel (mainly Tectura). In 
addition, and for the Middle East 
region, incadea is providing services 
through the central service 
organisation of Germany.
Being a high growth area, incadea is 
proceeding fast with its strategy to 
shift from the partner channel to own 
access to the addressed markets either 
through acquisitions (e.g. former 
partner Avanti, acquired as incadea 
New Zealand, China) or establishment 
(i.e. India). In 2013 incadea broadened 
its local presence by opening new 
offices in China (Shanghai) and 
Malaysia. Meanwhile our operation in 
China is the second biggest office.
Middle East/Turkey
Middle East/Turkey is one of the main 
focus areas of the group. Although 
there is not a direct footprint currently, 
incadea is planning to enrich its 
presence in the area and enhance the 
solutions delivery currently offered by 
incadea headquarters and incadea 
Greece.

continued
incadea’s direct footstep in a broad 
range of markets around the world was 
a significant factor for the business 
growth in 2013. Apart from the 
increase of business recorded in the 
traditional European market, the Group 
sustained its growth rates in the Asia 
Pacific area, Latin America, as well as 
addressing the potential of business 
from the Middle East and Turkey.
The Group’s operations in different 
economic environments as well as the 
diversified base of customers assisted 
to overcome in 2013 the temporary 
slowdown of incadea’s business in 
Russia. A major step to strengthen the 
Group’s performance is the acquisition 
of RCRBS (which occurred at the 
beginning of 2014), which is expected 
to further enhance the Group’s 
performance in European markets.
During 2013, Europe`s contribution in 
the Group’s business performance was 
54%, while Asia Pacific area 
contributed 28%, Russia and Latin 
America approximately 6% each and 
the Rest of the World (containing 
mainly Middle East and Turkey 
business) contributed 6%.
Asia Pacific area increased its business 
by 16% to €10.1 million from €8.7 
million in 2012, while Latin America 
increased by 69% to €2 million from 
€1.2 million.
Significant increase was recorded in 
the Rest of the World segment, which 
mainly included the Middle East and 
Turkey, where the revenue contribution 
in the Group’s performance for 2013 
was equal to €2 million.
Regional performance recorded over 
the year was fully aligned with the 
priorites set for the current year, 
during 2013 which were the following: 
• Sustaining for 2013 the regional 
split which initially was expected to 
be succeeded in 2015
• Major revenue contribution coming 
from Asia Pacific and Latin America 
regions
• Strengthening of presence in Europe 
through the acquisition of RCRBS
• Diversification of the Group’s 
operations in different regions 
helps to overcome adverse 
conditions in the markets the 
Group operates in. During 2013 
Russia’s contribution in revenue 
was reduced by 68% in relation to 
the 2012 performance, which 
however did not affect the  
Group’s growth
• Strengthen synergies between the 
different affiliates, leading to 
exploitation of the global know-how 
either in central projects or 
regional ones. This approach, apart 
from strengthening the intragroup 
cooperation, leads to significant 
savings and better utilisation of the 
available resources
Operating areas
With the main commercial entity based 
in Salzburg, Austria, incadea’s 
operational and development hub is 
located in Munich, Germany. Further 
development centres exist in Moscow 
and Athens, along with other 
subsidiaries in Spain, Portugal, China 
(Beijing and Shanghai), India, Taiwan, 
New Zealand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and 
Mexico, focusing on sales and service 
delivery.
Going where the business goes:
Following rapid automotive market 
growth in countries with developing 
market economies, most notably the 
so-called BRIC countries, incadea 
continuously expanded its business to 
new regions.
Synergies exploitation  
within regions 
As in the previous years, synergies 
across the regions is one of the main 
focus areas of the executive 
management and key success factors 
to optimise the delivery and financial 
performance of the Group. Internal 
development of the human resources 
and attraction of skilled, experienced 
personnel that could sustain the 
increased requirements of the global 
growth. Over and above, as human 
resources are the most important 
asset of incadea, the Global Team is 
developed and Cross Boarding Use of 
Resources are a practice to be followed 
in the coming years 
A key focus for 2014 will be to build a 
significant business around the 
integrated incadea solution, and mobile 
applications through regional projects 
covering more than one market. To 
accommodate the business growth 
product development, we will focus in 
2014 on enhancing the products, 
expand the markets and OEM coverage 
through development of the necessary 
product layers, enhance cloud 
presence and mobile applications, and 
scale up incadea solution through the 
AX-based platform.
Priorities for 2014
• In 2014 the majority of growth will 
come out of Asia and Latin America 
• Through acquisitions we are 
planning to further strengthen 
Europe and Latin America 
• Optimise development hubs 
network by expanding into the Asia 
Pacific region to address regional 
customer needs as well as optimise 
the cost base of development 
activities 
• Further strengthen service 
organisation and integration of the 
established affiliates to cover the 
increased customer needs
• Cover Turkey and Middle East region 
with own organisation to further 
grow in the area
Through its own offices and a partner 
network, incadea serves customers in 
87 countries in Europe, Asia Pacific, 
Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

Technology
Our platform is built with a modular, 
distributed architecture which provides 
us considerable flexibility in 
deployment, and enables us to deploy 
individual software modules as a 
package or on a standalone basis. This 
in turn optimises performance under 
various hardware and software 
configurations. Our highly scalable 
software solutions use a proprietary 
combination of commercially licensed, 
open source and custom programmed 
software, to optimise reliability, cost, 
efficiency, performance and scalability. 
In specific, incadea has been as from 
2008 a member of the Microsoft Inner 
Circle, meaning that Microsoft has 
ranked incadea at the top echelon of 
the Microsoft Dynamics global network 
of partners. Inner Circle membership 
is considered to be the highest reward 
for Microsoft partners and is the result 
of demonstrated key investments 
towards customer satisfaction by 
having an active Microsoft Dynamics 
partner service plan and an active ERP, 
CRM or ISV competency in the 
Microsoft Partner Network.
2013 offered us solid ground for 
expanding and enriching our long-
standing relationship with Microsoft. 
During Microsoft’s annual Worldwide 
Partner Conference in July 2013 and as 
a result of the Group’s commitment to 
providing customers with innovative 
solutions and extensive know-how on 
Microsoft’s technologies, incadea was 
appointed as one of Microsoft’s top 22 
Global Independent Software Vendors. 
Also, in the second half of 2013, 
incadea was named as the number one 
Microsoft Dynamics ISV for ERP in 
terms of licence sales and in terms of 
adding new customers, which is a 
priority to Microsoft enlarging the 
market share in the ERP business.
Consequently, with Microsoft Dynamics 
AX providing a modern and powerful 
ERP system, incadea and Microsoft 
have initiated the co-funded 
development of an automotive 
enterprise platform based on AX, in 
order to fulfil the sophisticated needs 
of large dealer groups and importers. 
In China, incadea was strategically 
positioned as a leading partner in 
Microsoft’s first automotive Center of 
Excellence (“COE”) in the world at its 
Shanghai research and development 
centre. The Microsoft Automotive COE 
is designed to showcase the innovative 
solutions of Microsoft’s cutting-edge 
technology.
Our proprietary technology platform, based on 
the latest Microsoft technology is the cornerstone 
of our business and we believe it will continue to 
be a key differentiator for us.
incadea is having access to key 
executives within Microsoft on a 
corporate level, in the EMEA time zone 
team, the APAC time zone team and in 
various countries, as well as to 
industry executives for the automotive 
area. In 2013 especially, the 
cooperation with the APAC team 
improved significantly and contacts to 
the key people within the LatAm team 
were established which will support the 
current activities to broaden our 
presence in this region.
Finally, incadea and Microsoft are 
working together on a fully cloud-
enabled automotive solution platform 
based on Azure, focusing on offering 
global cloud services for mobiles sales 
and after sales.

We recognise the need to do our part 
to reduce the emissions that 
contribute to climate change and to

efforts bring tangible benefits not 
just to the environment, but to our 
business. 
Our environmental choice has three 
main areas:
• good for the environment; 
• attractive for employees; and 
• friendly to our budget.
incadea, following the social 
awareness regarding the 
environmental issues, made a 
strategic choice to centralise its 
headquarters in the centre of Munich, 
Germany within a building that serves 
the environment and respects the 
environmental values.
The Group has started to introduced 
environmental accounting policies

we have learned what it takes to do 
so. We are better positioned to 
design solutions to help our 
customers thrive in a resource-

CEO’s 
Letter
Considering the size of our market 
potential and the tremendous growth 
opportunities ahead, my goal and 
commitment is to take incadea together 
with the incadea leadership team to the 
next level. 
Patrick Katenkamp 
Chief Executive Officer
For the first time, I am addressing 
you as the new Chief Executive 
Officer of incadea plc. I am both 
honoured and excited to report from 
my new position and assure you that 
leading incadea is a mission that I 
embrace with excitement, respect 
and commitment. Having served the 
Group as COO for the last three 
years, I have become increasingly 
aware of the positive dynamics of our 
global operations. Having monitored 
the significant market opportunities 
ahead of us, I am confident that 
incadea will continue to thrive and 
realise its potential in this industry.
Despite the challenging marketing 
conditions and the changes in the 
automotive market, the 2013 financial 
year delivered profitable growth and 
revenues which were in line with 
management’s expectations. We 
benefited from our strategic focus on 
developing, maintaining and 
extending our strong customer 
relationships. 
Our ability to address our clients’ and 
market’s complex issues and deliver 
tangible results have helped us to 
extend customer relationships with 
leading automotive players. 
Strong performance accelerates 
growth strategy 
incadea’s strong financial 
performance for the year ended 
31 December 2013 reflects significant 
progress made in implementing our 
business strategy across the three 
important capacities new OEM wins, 
geographical expansion and new 
innovative solutions. 2013 saw 
significant progress for incadea in 
positioning itself as a dominant player 
within its key markets. We are 
pleased to report that new OEM 
contract wins were also processed 
faster than anticipated. 
Customer demand and innovative 
products in a fast-evolving market 
Today’s car manufacturers are 
increasingly required to respond to 
global competition and market 
pressure on profitability by aiming to 
standardise business processes 
across their dealer networks and at 
the same time, focusing on the 
continuing rise in BRIC and other 
emerging markets. In addition, car 
manufacturers are also facing 
challenges from the changing 
customer behaviour in the buying 
process. Trends show that consumers 
are increasingly buying cars online 
and are visiting dealers less.
Customers now expect to be able to 
find information and services on car 
configurator, comparison between 
cars and models online. Ten years 
ago the percentage of customers 
seeking online information was 
approximately 20% while today is 
close to 100%. They look for 3D 
product presentations, online test 
drive schedules and arrangements 
and, of course, car locators. 
incadea Annual Review 2013 27 Satisfying this consumer demand 
requires new cloud-based retail 
models to manage the complete sales 
cycle through from the OEM websites, 
social media to integrated web-based 
retail solutions, including a large 
trend towards mobile solutions. In 
order to be able to support today’s 
and tomorrow’s market needs, 
incadea has developed a new 
generation of cloud-enabled solutions 
including its next-generation DMS 
incadea.myengine that is currently 
used by leading OEMs in significant 
markets; the automotive CRM 
solution, incadea.cvrm; based on a 
tailor-made customer and vehicle 
relationship management approach 
and incadea.bi, an easy-to-use 
business intelligence solution that 
can be accessed from mobile devices 
including iPhone, iPads and other 
tablet devices. 
A key focus in 2013 was the 
development of a new set of mobile 
solutions for customer facing 
processes. We see the trend moving 
from providing functionality to 
managing data. In 2014, incadea will 
launch incadea.connect – a Microsoft 
Azure powered solution. Acting at the 
“innovation layer” this “service bus” 
solution enables easy integration of 
data (e.g customer or vehicle data) 
across dealers, OEMs, social media or 
third party providers. incadea sees 
its strategic direction in providing 
together with Microsoft an open data 
and solution integration platform for 
the automotive industry to enable 
innovation.

2013 key achievements:
• We are committed to offering 
innovative solutions to the retail 
automotive industry and during 
the year we introduced multiple 
new cloud services, based on 
Microsoft’s Azure. These include 
mobile sales apps for sales and 
services and other new cloud 
offerings.
• incadea secured contract 
initiations with Ford Lincoln China, 
PSA, and Scania on a much 
shorter timescale than originally 
projected. This provided the Group 
with an important boost for its 
OEM expansion portfolio.
• Continuing its success story, 
incadea China experienced strong 
growth in revenues and expanded 
operations through the opening of 
a new office in Shanghai. As the 
largest market in the world 
(measured by automobile unit 
production since 2008) and 
through our successful direct 
presence, incadea China now 
forms a significant part of the 
Group and is our second largest 
operation worldwide. Today 
incadea China serves leading OEMs 
such as VW, Lexus, Ford, Porsche 
and Qoros.
• Achieving direct presence in the 
German market through the 
acquisition of RCRBS is a 
significant milestone for the 
Group. Following this acquisition, 
incadea now has direct access to a 
leading automotive market and an 
extensive client base. Specifically, 
the DMS business of RCRBS has 
over 1,400 customers and will 
deliver direct access to customers 
in Germany including BMW, GME 
(Opel) and PSA.
28 incadea Annual Review 2013 RCRBS acquisition
As already announced in January 
2014, incadea raised approximately 
£11.5 million (approximately €14 
million) by the issue of 11,100,000 
ordinary shares at 104 pence each in 
order to partially fund the acquisition 
of RCRBS, to support the Group’s new 
product development based on 
Microsoft Dynamics AX and also to 
provide working capital for the 
enlarged Group. The Group’s stated 
strategy since it was admitted to 
trading on AIM in May 2012 has been 
to augment organic growth through 
selective acquisitions as the Group 
continues to increase its direct sales 
routes and international presence. 
The RCRBS business develops and 
sells the German version of 
incadea.engine and has more than 
50 years’ experience in the middle 
market business in Germany. It serves 
more than 12,500 users at over 1,400 
customers and has 109 employees. 
This particular acquisition provides 
incadea with a direct presence in one 
of the most important automotive 
markets, Germany, and access to a 
well-connected sales team which is 
anticipated to lead to improvements in 
margin through an extension of the 
value chain. The combination of the 
Group’s existing business with the 
RCRBS business is anticipated to 
provide various synergies estimated 
to be a minimum of €0.8 million within 
18 months of closing of the proposed 
acquisition. 
OEM-led customer expansion
During 2013, incadea’s success in 
supporting existing OEM customers in 
their global expansion and 
implementation of their strategic 
goals, as well as winning new OEM 
customers in key territories, resulted 
in a record growth in our installed 
base. Specifically, for the first time in 
the history of incadea, we sold 11,048 
new licences, resulting to a total 
install base of 67,797 at 31 December 
2013 (1 January 2013: 56,749). In 
2013, we experienced solid growth 
with our established OEMs’ customer 
relationships as a series of new 
significant wins, including winning 
Peugeot/Citroën, Ford China,  
Scania and Mercedes. 
BMW Group 
BMW Group and incadea can look back 
on more than 12 years of cooperation. 
Today, the Group serves more than 
17,000 BMW end users across 665 
dealerships in 38 countries. Total 
users increased during 2013 by 13% 
to 18,661 at 31 December 2013.  
With the next-generation DMS 
incadea.myengine already installed in 
Mexico, Lebanon and Colombia, we are 
now working on innovative projects to 
best tackle challenges, harness the 
power of mobile devices, and enable 
BMW to implement its future retail IT 
strategy through incadea’s cloud 
solution suite. 
Volkswagen Group 
incadea is one of two global strategic 
partners of VW. During 2013, we made 
significant progress with a roll out to 
more than 1,800 users in several 
Asian countries (including India and 
China). New contracts have been 
signed in Malaysia and Hong Kong 
which will be implemented over the 
next two years.
 
Opel/General Motors 
incadea is a strategic partner for 
Opel/General Motors covering 
approximately 546 dealers in 20 
countries with approximately 16,555 
users. We believe that there is 
potential to generate incremental 
revenues with Opel in Russia with 
scope for further growth with GM in 
Asia by extending our partnership 
with GM International Operations 
based in Shanghai. 
Qoros 
In September 2012 we announced a 
strategic partnership with Qoros, the 
joint venture between Chery 
Automobile, one of the largest 
Chinese OEMs, and Israel 
Corporation. In 2013, we have 
continued and further expanded our 
strategic partnership with Qoros, by 
developing some innovative mobile 
business solutions. Qoros is also 
planning to use incadea as the 
strategic software partner for its 
planned entry into the European 
market in 2015. This partnership has 
significant strategic importance for 
the Chinese market and incadea is 
the first international provider in this 
area to win a major deal with a 
Chinese OEM. 
incadea Annual Review 2013 29 China and Asia Pacific
Since 2009 annual production of 
automobiles in China has exceeded 
that of the European Union and that 
of the United States and Japan 
combined. In 2010, both sales and 
production topped 18 million units, 
with 13.76 million passenger cars 
delivered, in each case the largest by 
any nation in history. Estimates by 
international research companies 
state that China will control 40% of 
the world’s luxury auto market by 
2020. In 2013, two years after 
establishing a strong position in the 
market, incadea opened a new office 
in Shanghai to better serve its 
customers located in the city and 
nearby areas. In financial year 2013, 
revenues reached €5.5 million 
(2012: €3.3 million), while the 
Company increased its workforce 
from 16 to 50 people. incadea China 
supports leading automotive players 
like Ford Lincoln, Lexus, Porsche, 
VW and Qoros. With China and APAC 
(served by incadea New Zealand) 
being key drivers for incadea growth, 
the Group decided to split the two 
regions and address them individually 
for an even more focused approach in 
these markets. 
In the APAC region, incadea has 
increased its installed customer base 
from 7,170 in 2012 to 9,206 in 2013, 
with €3 million revenues in financial 
year 2013. The Group is examining 
significant expansion plans in Japan, 
Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.

New strategic OEM wins
Ford Lincoln China 
As announced on 2 May 2013, 
through its wholly owned subsidiary 
in China, incadea has signed a 
five-year agreement with the global 
US car manufacturer. The contract is 
worth several million US dollars for 
software licences and services and 
covers the full incadea product 
portfolio from incadea.myengine, 
CVRM, BI and mobile services 
provided out of a private-cloud 
environment. This is a strategic win 
which has the potential to be an 
entry point into an Asia-wide strategy 
with Ford.
PSA Peugeot Citroen 
As announced on 11 February 2014, 
incadea has signed a five-year 
agreement with the car manufacturer 
PSA Peugeot Citroën. Through this 
agreement incadea has been 
appointed as a global DMS software 
vendor to cover both Peugeot and 
Citroën Automobile networks globally. 
As is common for these large, 
multi-year deals, the first year of the 
agreement will see integration work 
ahead of deployment in later years. 
In this instance, software rollout will 
materially commence from 2015 over 
a period of several years. Under the 
terms of this agreement, incadea will 
develop a full integration layer based 
on its next-generation DMS, 
incadea.myengine. The agreement is 
currently focusing on 12 European 
countries with approximately 2,000 
dealer sites and about 30,000 DMS 
users. We are delighted to have 
signed this global agreement with 
PSA Peugeot Citroën and feel 
confident that we will extend our 
cooperation in additional geographical 
markets and through further state-
of-the-art IT projects.
Mercedes-Benz Mexico
incadea.myengine will be one of two 
officially certified DMS systems for 
Mercedes-Benz dealerships in Mexico. 
incadea.myengine has been enhanced 
with an International Make Layer, so 
that it is optimised to meet the 
specific needs of this OEM, and will 
be localised and adapted to the 
business and market requirements of 
Mexico. There are 22 Mercedes-Benz 
dealerships in Mexico. Mexico 
represents Mercedes-Benz’s second 
fastest growing market with a growth 
rate of 29.9%, behind only Japan at 
38.5%. Over several years incadea 
has expanded its relationship with 
Mercedes-Benz, to now serve more 
than 4,000 Mercedes-Benz end users 
across 140 dealerships in 16 
geographical markets, including 
countries such as Greece, Austria, 
Belgium and Slovakia.
Europe 
Despite challenging marketing 
conditions and the unprecedented 
changes in the European automotive 
market over the last few years, the 
car market has started to recover. 
Car sales overall in Europe fell at a 
slower rate than in previous years 
and there was an increase in vehicle 
sales in Southern Europe. Through 
our new agreement with PSA, latest 
wins across the Mercedes network 
and significant projects with BMW in 
Germany and France, incadea 
accelerated business in Europe. In 
parallel, through the acquisition of 
RCRBS, incadea now has the 
opportunity to play a leading role 
within the German market, which still 
remains the largest one in Europe.
30 incadea Annual Review 2013 India, Middle East and Turkey
As at 2010, India had 40 million 
passenger vehicles. More than 3.7 
million automotive vehicles were 
produced in India in 2010 (an 
increase of 33.9% (on 2009), making 
the country the second (after China) 
fastest growing automobile market in 
the world in that year. It is projected 
that by 2015, India will exceed every 
major European market including 
Germany, France and the UK in 
automotive sales, making India the 
fourth largest automotive market by 
volume in the world. Through its 
direct subsidiary, incadea supports 
BMW and VW across various projects. 
In 2013, the Group managed to 
strengthen its presence in this 
market, with €0.9 million revenues 
and 3,289 new users. In addition, 
through its channel partners the 
Group benefited from a variety of 
projects in Turkey, the Middle East 
and Egypt, contributing significantly 
to the regional revenues by €2 
million. The goal for 2014 is to 
establish direct presence in both 
Turkey and the Middle East.
Latin America
Mexico and Latin America has 
displayed remarkable economic 
recovery in recent years and the 
automotive industry has been a large 
contributing factor towards that end. 
Today it continues to be a primary 
factor in the region’s economic growth. 
It has become so lucrative that many 
big-name manufacturers have 
expanded into Mexico as part of their 
global developmental strategies, 
investing heavily in their facilities, with 
nothing but highly positive results. 
Through our direct presence in Mexico, 
incadea has established a strategic 
relationship with Mercedes-Benz for 
incadea.myengine. Mexico is 
Mercedes-Benz’s second fastest 
growing major market with a growth 
rate of 29.9%. In addition, the Group 
runs various projects for BMW in 
Columbia, and Paraguay and has 
agreed installations in other leading 
OEMs such as Nissan and Toyota. In 
2013 incadea Mexico achieved €1.2 
million of revenue, with an additional 
€0.85 million of revenue generated 
from incadea Spain and Portugal in 
Latin America region. Currently, we 
are investigating several opportunities 
for further potential market entries in 
Latin America through targeted 
acquisitions and are in initial 
discussions with an OEM in Brazil.

Russia and CIS
Russia remains one of the most 
attractive markets in Europe due to 
low light vehicle density and 
advanced age of car fleet while 
Belarus and Ukraine posted the 
highest sales growth in the CIS 
region during 2012. 
In 2013 overall revenue was weaker 
than 2012, mainly due to the delay of 
two budgeted projects related to 
BMW. Management focus more on the 
business expansion and further 
investments in the Russian market to 
secure growth for the Russian 
subsidiary in the next years. 
As a result, incadea continues to 
build a strong position in these 
markets and continuous cooperation 
with the major OEMs of the area. The 
Group works closely with BMW for 
DMS and CRM projects, while first 
pilot projects for Lada and our 
strategic partnership with PSA 
provide a valuable entry point for the 
“mass” market in Russia. We believe 
that our strategic partnership with 
PSA will show in the very near future 
significant growth potential in the 
Russian market. Furthermore, based 
on our progress with Mercedes the 
planning for the first pilots is in 
progress.
incadea Annual Review 2013 31 Taking incadea to the next  
level/People and organisation
incadea is a strong international player 
with a strong multi-cultural diversified 
team present in many geographical 
markets (e.g. incadea HQ in Munich 
has more than 50% international staff 
and more than 17 nationalities) and 
believe our people are one of our 
differentiating factors. One of my 
strongest beliefs is that everything 
can be achieved with the right people 
and the right corporate culture; a 
culture that inspires people for 
innovation, to challenge the 
established and willingly go the extra 
mile. Our key strength is to integrate 
different skills, backgrounds and 
cultural diversity and to perform as 
one team. It was very encouraging to 
hear from new hires from leading 
international companies over the last 
month how impressed they have been 
about the commitment, enthusiasm 
and passion of our people about our 
business. This is a clear sign that we 
are on the right path and this is what 
will bring incadea to the next level. 
Considering the size of our market 
potential and the tremendous growth 
opportunities ahead, my goal and 
commitment is to take incadea, 
together with the incadea leadership 
team, to the next level.
In order to achieve its global strategy, 
the Group has strengthened its 
executive team to further support the 
Group’s growth and geographical 
expansion through key industry hires 
from leading international companies. 
These are:
• Eric Sentuc, VP of Sales and 
Marketing
• Panos Gikas, VP Operations
• Dirk de Beer, VP Strategy and 
Acquisitions
Strategic outlook
Despite challenging market conditions 
and the unprecedented changes to the 
automotive market, we benefited from 
our ability to address our clients’ and 
market’s complex issues and delivered 
tangible results. This has helped us 
extend relationships with leading 
automotive players in the emerging 
markets. 
Our view on this industry is that this 
very fragmented segment will 
consolidate rapidly under the 
pressure of the OEM for globalisation 
and rapid technology changes by 
establishing cloud models. We believe 
that incadea has a great competitive 
advantage to outperform and take 
advantage of this trend to capture a 
large segment of this market over 
future years. We see the three areas 
for a winning position in the fast-
changing industry are broad 
international footprint, innovative 
new products and providing an open 
standard data integration 
environment and large global 
partnerships with leading OEMs.
incadea has driven its global 
expansion at a much higher speed 
then originally forecasted at the time 
of the IPO. We have established 
incadea in Russia, China, India and 
grown incadea to an international 
player with 14 subsidiaries. To 
complete the Asia go-to-market 
strategy incadea will establish its 
footprint in Japan, Korea and 
Australia as it seeks to establish itself 
as the number one DMS provider in 
Asia within the next three years. 
Establishing incadea in the Middle 
East is high on the agenda in 2014 
and, in the next 12 months, 
establishing operations in Turkey will 
also be a focus of the Group in order 
to acknowledge the recent business 
wins in this region and manage the 
growth. One strategic move which 
incadea will undertake in 2015 is the 
market entry into the UK to gain 
significant market share in one of the 
leading European car markets. After 
the expansion in Asia, the focus over 
the next 12-24 months will shift 
towards South America. After a 
successful market entry into Mexico 
and a growing number of projects in 
this region the focus will be on a 
stronger footprint in Central America 
and market entry into Brazil to 
complete the coverage of the BRIC 
markets. Then the only region not 
covered from incadea will be North 
America.
The original business plan at the IPO 
was to win one additional OEM per 
year. By gaining Qoros, Ford Lincoln, 
PSA and Mercedes Mexico in the last 
12 months, incadea’s ambitions in this 
area have significantly increased and 
our target is to have a significant entry 
over the next two to three years in 
every major global OEM, which is an 
ambitious but achievable target.
As a solutions Group our key mission 
is the innovation of new solutions. 
This has been the focus of incadea in 
the past and will be the key focus in 
the future. incadea will accelerate its 
solution portfolio in close cooperation 
with Microsoft by launching new 
mobile sales and aftersales solutions, 
strategic partnerships with highly 
specialised third party providers and 
will establish an automotive cloud app 
store with automotive solutions 
bundling the size of Microsoft and the 
expertise of incadea and its partners. 
A clear focus area for incadea will be 
the complete provision of an 
automotive cloud model and this shift 
to a higher subscription model with an 
increasing level of recurring revenue.
Our ambitions are to go far beyond 
the traditional retail solutions. We at 
incadea want to use the fast-changing 
market environment with the 
increasing influence of cloud solutions 
and internet business models to take 
a leading role in this industry over  
the next few years, supported by 
Microsoft. We know this is an 
ambitious goal but we have proven 
over the last three years that we can 
grow from a solely German Group,  
to one with 14 subsidiaries, including 
in three of the four BRIC markets,  
with a six-fold increase in revenues. 
We believe that the two key success 
factors to achieve our goal are focus 
and competent leadership in our 
segment combined with executing 
business globally. This is the target 
that we always will have in our focus.

Although the investment phase 
necessary to cope with the increased 
financial requirements has not 
finished, the investments made so far 
have started to perform, indicating 
that the strategic growth model 
followed over the last few years is a 
successful one.
During the year, incadea managed to 
deliver the profitability expected, and 
sustain at the same time its growth 
rate, recording an increase of 23.0% 
in its revenue, to €36 million (2012: 
€29.3 million). 
Although operating profits decreased 
in relation to 2012 by 14%, to €3.9 
million (2012: €4.5 million), EBITDA 
increased by 24% to €7.7 million 
(2012: €6.2 million). The decrease in 
the operating profit is attributed to 
the increased amortisation charges 
for the period. This is generated from 
incadea has delivered financial performance in 
line with management’s expectations, being the 
result of the former year’s expansion in markets 
and customers coverage.
the capitalised software development 
intangible assets which are deemed 
ready for use. By excluding 
extraordinary costs associated with 
the sizeable acquisition of the 
German partner, RCRBS (occurred 
within 2014), the normalised EBITDA 
was increased in relation to the 
normalised EBITDA of 2012 by 17% 
to €8.1 million (2012: €6.94 million).
To serve the growth and to ensure 
that the Group has sufficient funds to 
further expand its activities in new 
customers, markets and to deliver 
enhancements to its products 
portfolio, incadea agreed a debut 
senior loan facility for the Group with 
Citibank NA branch in London. The 
€23 million bilateral facility comprises 
of a €2 million revolving facility 
commitment and an aggregate of €21 
million term facility commitments. 
Funds for the facility have already 
been used for the corporate activities 
of the Group to further expand its 
product portfolio and expansion in 
new customers and markets either by 
organic growth or selected smaller 
acquisitions. In more detail, these 
facility funds will be used for the 
development of products that will 
serve new big contracts and existing 
customer demands. Although facility 
funds were available to also fund 
working capital requirements, cash 
generated from operations was 
positive being increased by 55% in 
relation to 2012 to the amount of 
€1.8 million (2012: €1.158 million), 
leading to a cash position of the 
Group at €8.4 million (2012: €2.263 
million) and a net cash (debt) position 
for the Group of €(1.4) million. 
During the year , incadea managed 
to deliver the profitability expected, 
and sustain at the same time its 
growth rate, recording an increase of 
23.0 % in its revenue, to €36 million 
(2012: €29.3 million).

Revenue by segment 
The Group’s growth for year 2013 
was a result of increased 
performance in the key strategic 
regions (Asia Pacific and Latin 
America) as well as in the Group’s 
traditional market in Europe, which 
compensated a reduction of sales 
performed in Russia. 
The Asia Pacific region contributed 
28.1% of total Group revenue. This 
represented an increase by 16% to 
€10.1 million (2012: €8.7 million) 
while the Latin America region 
increased by 69% to €2.0 million 
(2012: €1.2 million).
Increased revenue in the 
aforementioned regions indicates the 
successful establishment of the 
Group’s affiliates and the increased 
penetration in both the traditional 
customers of incadea (BMW and 
VW Group) as well as new OEMs 
addressed (Qoros and Ford). The Asia 
Pacific region was mainly served by 
incadea China and New Zealand 
where the former has served the 
local Chinese market, and the latter 
the broader Asia Pacific region.
The Latin American region was 
primarily served by incadea Mexico, 
while significant support in the region 
came from incadea Spain and 
Portugal.
Growth in Europe came primarily 
from direct sales from incadea 
Austria, with revenues in Germany 
increasing by 130% to €9.0 million 
(2012: €3.9 million) supporting the 
Group’s M&A strategy. 
The main growth area though was 
the licences sales, which increased by 
69% to €13.0 million (2012: €7.7 
million) mainly driven from licence 
sales of the new products 
(incadea.myengine) to old and new 
Group customers.
Maintenance sales increased by 7% to 
€8.4 million (2012: €7.8 million), while 
services grew by 7% to €14.7 million 
(2012: €13.7 million). Although 
services revenue in the Russian 
market declined mainly due to the 
delays on the BMW rollout 
implementation, the Group’s 
diversification of operations into 
different markets and OEMs lead to 
total service revenue increasing, 
demonstrating a significant increase 
in the other key markets of the Group 
as well as its home market, Germany.
Revenue direct/indirect 
As a result of the increased licence 
sales through the partner channel, 
direct sales as a percentage of total 
sales declined to 62% in relation to 
74% of 2012.
Out of the direct sales though, 
services revenue increased to 65% 
from 61% of 2012, to €14.6 million 
(2012: €13.1 million).
Operating expenses/EBITDA
Total operating expenses before 
depreciation and amortisation 
increased by 22.5% to €29.3 million 
(2012: €23.882 million) being in line 
with the increase of the revenue. 
Cost of sales (excluding depreciation 
and amortisation charges) increased 
at a slightly higher rate than 
revenues, by 26%, being the result of 
the increased revenue as well as 
increased preparatory costs for 
services new contracts and 
customers included in the cost of 
sales.

34 incadea Annual Review 2013 Selling, General and Administrative 
Expenses (“SG&A”) increased in total 
by 16.5% to €11.8 million (2012: 
€10.16 million) mainly being the 
result of increased administration 
structures in specific markets, 
presales expenses included in the 
Group’s results for 2013 and referring 
to expected new contracts 
acquisitions, administration costs in 
incadea Russia, as well as costs 
associated with the major acquisition 
performed (RCRBS) in early 2014.
EBITDA was increased by 24% to 
€7.7 million (2012: €6.2 million). 
EBITDA was affected by costs 
associated with the acquisition of 
RCRBS and incorporated into the 
operating expenses. By excluding 
these expenses, normalised EBITDA 
was increased by 17% to €8.1 million 
(2012: €6.9 million).
Depreciation and amortisation/
finance income expense
Depreciation and amortisation 
charges increased due to increased 
amortisation of internally generated 
assets associated with the new 
product releases (which started to be 
amortised on December 2012). The 
total depreciation and amortisation 
charges have increased by 119% to 
€3.75 million (2012: €1.71 million).
The Group has recorded a net finance 
expense of €0.7 million mainly 
related to currency exchange 
differences and other financial 
expenses.
Interest expenses (capitalised) 
associated with the borrowing 
facilities were equal to €0.145 million 
for the period.
Cash flow and financing 
Despite the increased working  
capital requirements necessary to 
accommodate the growth in its 
business, as well as the increased 
collection circle being the result of 
extended payment terms associated 
with business performed with new 
customers, the Group demonstrated 
a positive cash flow from operations 
of €1.8 million being significantly 
increased by 54% (2012: €1.1 
million). Operating cash flows for the 
financial year 2013 were also affected 
by the one-off expenses for the 
acquisition of RCRBS. 
Cash flow from investments was 
reduced to €5.2 million (2012: €5.5 
million) mainly attributed to less 
expenditure for internal product 
development (€3.1 million versus 
€3.4 million of 2012). Investments in 
new products were mainly related to 
enhancements of the international 
versions of the incadea products, as 
well as specific development activities 
for customising the products to serve 
the coming markets and OEMs. 
Although internal generated assets 
expenditure has been reduced, the 
expenditure for other assets was 
increased to €2.1 million from €1.1 
million in 2012, being the result of 
the increased requirements for IT 
and product specific assets to serve 
the growing business of the Group.
Cash flow from financing was equal to 
€9.5 million mainly generated from 
the borrowings secured from the 
Group. From the facility secured with 
Citibank, up to 31 December 2013, 
there were utilised €10 million, 
having being used to fund the 
Group’s growth plans. incadea 
Holding GmbH and incadea GmbH act 
as guarantors to incadea plc as 
borrower. Net proceeds from loans 
(excluding associated costs) 
accounted for €9.3 million. 
The Group had declared a scrip 
dividend of €0.904 million which lead 
to the distribution of €0.241 million of 
cash dividend to its shareholders. A 
remaining amount of €0.663 million 
was distributed in shares through the 
issuance of 522,962 new shares.

Report
Activities
incadea is the leading provider of 
enterprise software solutions and 
services to the global automotive 
retail and wholesale market. The 
Group is an international provider of 
software as a service (“SaaS”) 
solutions to the automotive 
dealership industry, with products 
including dealer management, 
business intelligence and customer 
and vehicle relationship management 
systems, which are used by 
multinational car manufacturers such 
as BMW Group and VW Group and 
their dealership networks. In the 
current period Group managed to win 
contracts with several other “Big 
OEMs” like Ford, Peugeot, Scania, 
Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz.
incadea’s primary product is its DMS 
system, incadea.engine, which 
provides automotive dealers with 
solutions to integrate departmental 
functions and business processes 
with the aim of increasing 
productivity and efficiency. During 
the current period new products 
related to cloud services 
(incadea.cloud) were released to our 
markets as a response to our 
customers’ demand. After a number 
of years of significant investment in 
its products and building relationships 
with major OEMs, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed 
to benefit from the current and 
expected expansion of OEMs’ dealer 
networks in high growth countries 
such as Brazil, Russia, India and 
China (BRIC countries) as well as to 
Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey 
(dubbed the “MINT” countries). These 
are assumed from the Group’s 
management as the next crucial 
locations on the global map for brand 
expansion.
Business and financial review
For the review of the business and 
the accompanied figures during the 
year please refer to the Chairman’s 
Letter, Chief Executive Officer’s 
Letter and Chief Financial Officer’s 
Letter included within the Annual 
Report.
Dividend policy
The Company intends to offer a scrip 
dividend alternative for this 
distribution for those ordinary 
shareholders who wish to receive 
additional ordinary shares in lieu of a 
cash payment. Shareholders holding, 
as at 31 December 2013, of 
approximately 57% (including those 
members of the Board who hold 
ordinary shares) have informally 
indicated their willingness to take up 
a scrip alternative. Both payment of 
the proposed dividend and the offer 
of a scrip alternative are subject to 
approval by the Company’s 
shareholders at the Company’s 
annual general meeting. Accordingly, 
a further announcement will be 
issued and a circular will be sent to 
shareholders along with notice of the 
Company’s annual general meeting 
explaining the proposed record and 
payment dates for this dividend and 
the terms of the scrip alternative as 
soon as practicable.
Employee involvement 
The Group operates an environment 
which encourages that the working 
place is a learning setting. We value 
transparent and open communication 
and support the advancement and 
sharing of information related to 
economic, human and financial 
matters affecting performance 
through the Group’s electronic 
workspace. The workspace is also a 
location where employees are 
encouraged to share their 
suggestions, views, or ideas across 
the entire organisation. The 
transparent and open flow of ideas is 
further maintained through regular 
work group meetings held between 
management, where they are 
encouraged to ask questions and feel 
part of the strategy of the Group. 
Social awareness
We are committed to operating 
responsibly in all aspects of our 
business, including enriching the 
communities where we operate and 
creating an inclusive, safe and 
healthy workplace. The core of our 
Corporate and Social Responsibility 
(CSR) efforts is expertise, technology 
and partnerships. We believe that 
CSR is both our responsibility and an 
essential part of good management. 
As we navigate through our growth 
transition, we remain committed to 
integrating CSR initiatives into our 
business, not only to enrich and 
contribute to the lives of the 
communities we work and live in, but 
also to create tangible value for our 
employees, customers and 
shareholders.

Financial measures cited in this report (KPIs)
The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain liquidity in the 
incadea Group at a level that is adequate to meet our obligations at all times. 
Finance may be required to proactively sustain liquidity at that level. It may 
also be necessary to enter into financing transactions when additional funds 
are required that cannot be wholly sourced from free cash flow (for example, 
to finance large acquisitions). Further on this, financial management related 
also to other qualitative indicators which are measured through the below Key 
Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).

Directors’ 
Report

38 incadea Annual Review 2013 Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. The Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted for use in the European Union. The Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the profit or loss of the Group for that period covered by the financial 
statements and the state of affairs of the Group at the end of that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS (as adopted in the EU) have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.

incadea Annual Review 2013 41 Corporate 
Governance 
Policy
General outline
There are no specific corporate 
governance guidelines which apply 
generally to companies incorporated 
in Jersey, however the Directors 
recognise the value and importance 
of high standards of corporate 
governance. Accordingly, whilst the 
Corporate Governance Code does not 
apply to AIM companies, the 
Directors intend to observe the 
requirements of the Corporate 
Governance Code to the extent they 
consider appropriate in the light of 
the Group’s size, stage of 
development and resources. The 
Directors make no statement of 
compliance with the code overall and 
do not explain in detail any aspect of 
the code which they do not comply. 
The Board also proposes, so far as 
practicable, to follow the 
recommendations set out in the 
corporate governance guidelines for 
smaller quoted companies published 
by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board
The Board is responsible for the 
overall management of the Group 
including the formulation and 
approval of the Group’s long-term 
objectives and strategy, the approval 
of budgets, the oversight of Group 
operations, the maintenance of sound 
internal control and risk management 
systems and the implementation of 
Group strategy, policies and plans. 
Whilst the Board may delegate 
specific responsibilities, there is a 
formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for decision by 
the Board; such reserved matters will 
include, amongst other things, 
approval of significant capital 
expenditure, material business 
contracts and major corporate 
transactions. The Board meet on a 
regular basis to review performance. 
In the current year we had eight 
meetings of the Board of Directors.
Cooperation between the Board 
and other committees
The Board has established an Audit 
Committee, a Remuneration 
Committee and a Disclosure 
Committee with formally delegated 
duties and responsibilities, as 
described below. 
The work of the committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements, reviewing 
significant financial reporting issues, 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems, monitoring  
the effectiveness of the internal  
audit function and overseeing the 
relationship with the external  
auditors (including advising on their 
appointment, agreeing the scope of the 
audit and reviewing the audit findings).
Further details regarding the Audit 
Committee are presented in the Audit 
Committee’s Report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
agreeing with the Board the framework 
for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors and other 
designated senior executives and, 
within the terms of the agreed 
framework, determining the total 
individual remuneration packages  
of such persons including, where 
appropriate, bonuses, incentive 
payments and share options or other 
share awards. The remuneration of 
Non-executive Directors is a matter  
for the Chairman and the executive 
members of the Board. No Director  
is involved in any decision as to his  
or her own remuneration.
Further details regarding the 
Remuneration Committee are 
presented in the Remuneration 
Committee’s Report.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee has as its 
primary responsibility ensuring 
compliance with the AIM Rules and 
disclosure of information, in 
particular under AIM Rules 11, 17, 18 
and 19. The Disclosure Committee 
works closely with the Board to 
ensure that the Company’s 
nominated adviser is provided with 
any information it reasonably 
requests or requires in order for it to 
carry out its responsibilities under 
the AIM Rules and the AIM Rules for 
Nominated Advisers.
The Disclosure Committee comprises 
of David Hobley, Werner Leinauer 
(being replaced by Patrick Katenkamp) 
and Alexandros Tsaparas and is 
chaired by David Hobley. The 
Disclosure Committee meets as 
frequently as needed and in this 
current year we  
had two meetings.
Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share 
dealing code for Directors and 
applicable employees of the Group  
for the purpose of ensuring 
compliance by such persons with the 
provisions of the AIM Rules relating 
to dealings in the Company’s 
securities (including, in particular, 
Rule 21 of the AIM Rules). The 
Directors consider that this share 
dealing code is appropriate for a 
company whose shares are admitted 
to trading on AIM.
The Company will take proper steps 
to ensure compliance by the 
Directors and applicable employees 
with the terms of the share dealing 
code and the relevant provisions of 
the AIM Rules (including Rule 21). 
42 incadea Annual Review 2013 Audit 
Committee 
Report
The role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by 
the Board of Directors and operates 
to Terms of Reference defined in the 
Group’s Admission Documents and 
are available from the Company 
Secretary.
The Terms of Reference cover:
• Constitution and Authority of the 
Committee
• Duties of the Committee
• Financial Reporting
• Internal Controls and Risk 
Management
• Compliance, Whistleblowing and 
Fraud
• Internal audit
• External audit
• Committee membership
The Audit Committee has an annual 
schedule that determines its agenda 
at committee meetings. Meetings are 
supported where appropriate by 
papers in advance and minutes are 
produced.
The Board is dependent on the Audit 
Committee to review the Group’s 
internal financial controls, to assess 
the work and independence of the 
external auditor, the effectiveness of 
risk management processes and to 
ensure integrity of the financial 
reporting. As such it is crucial that 
the Committee conducts itself in an 
informed and efficient way. This 
Report of the Audit Committee 
provides an overview of the make-up 
of the Committee and the matters it 
considered during the year. 
Composition of the 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises  
of Philip Lawler, David Hobley, 
Nikolaos Vardinoyannis and Pantelis 
Papageorgiou (from 05 November 
2013) and chaired by Philip Lawler. 
The Audit Committee meets as 
frequently as needed and in this 
current year we had four meetings  
of which two for approving the 
Interim and Annual Financial 
Statements of the Group.
The Board review membership of the 
Committee as part of the review 
overall Board effectiveness. This 
year’s review concluded that the 
current mix of financial and 
commercial experience of the Audit 
Committee is such that the 
Committee can effectively exercise 
its responsibilities to the Group in 
relation to risk and controls. 
Cooperation with the External 
Group Auditor
The Committee has met the external 
auditor both with and without Group 
management during the year. This is 
the third year end BDO LLP has 
audited and collaboration and 
understanding between the 
respective teams has increased 
significantly through experience now 
gained. The Committee has reviewed 
the areas of significant risk identified 
by the auditors and discussed their 
report on these matters with them. 
As a result of regulatory or similar 
requirements, we may need to 
employ the external auditors for 
certain non-audit services. The Board 
has agreed policies on what non-audit 
services can be provided by the 
external auditors and the relevant 
approval process. This safeguards the 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors. Non-audit services 
are not to be offered to the external 
auditors unless there are clear 
efficiencies and value-added benefits 
for the Group. BDO LLP provide some 
additional services although these 
are not exclusive. The Committee 
confirms the external auditor is 
independent and objective.
Internal controls and risk 
management
Risk management
The Audit Committee is not 
responsible for the identification of 
key risks and reviewing the adequacy 
of arrangements to mitigate those 
risks, which remains the 
responsibility of the main Board. 
However the committee has overseen 
a Risk Register framework for 
identifying and mitigating key risks 
that the Group has adopted.
Internal controls
During the year, the Board has 
formally reviewed the Group’s risk 
profile and reported on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls and management 
of Group risk, following Committee’s 
recommendations. This review is 
required to address not only internal 
financial controls but other risks and 
controls of the business. The 
directors acknowledge that they are 
responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate 
business risks and which provides 
reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material mis-
statement or loss.
incadea Annual Review 2013 43 Audit 
Committee 
Report
continued
The Group has established risk 
management procedures, which the 
directors consider appropriate to a 
group of incadea’s size and 
complexity, and during the year, the 
internal controls and risk 
management procedures were 
reviewed by the directors. This is 
achieved through a series of reports 
and meetings of specific committees 
(those that presented above). The 
Group developing a “Group Risk 
Manual”, which sets out the key risks 
by region and by function and the 
controls in place to manage the risks 
and identifies actions to be taken to 
improve risk management processes. 
The risk review process focuses on 
adopting enterprise wide risk 
management techniques on a 
consistent basis and improving risk 
reporting and management. 
Each senior executive is responsible 
for managing risks in his or her 
region or function and making regular 
reports on risk issues to Board. This 
risk analysis covers all business risks 
including commercial, financial, 
operational, legal and environmental 
risks. The Board is thus able to 
monitor the risk profile for all 
significant business risks. 
Recommendations on internal 
controls and risk improvement are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
the Board.
Budgetary process
Each year the Board approves the 
annual budget and key risk areas are 
identified, following recommendations 
from the Committee. Performance is 
monitored and relevant action is 
taken throughout the year through 
regular reporting to the Board of 
variances from the budget, updated 
forecasts for the year together with 
information on the key risk areas.
Internal audit
The Group currently does not have an 
internal audit function as the 
Directors consider this to be 
inappropriate given the current size 
of the Group. However, this situation 
is reviewed by the Board annually. An 
element of internal audit assurance is 
achieved by use of internal staff 
working on specific projects, for 
example, to review the policies and 
procedures relating to information 
security, including the effectiveness 
of related internal controls.
The UK Bribery Act
Given some of the developing 
territories that the Company operates 
in the Committee considered that a

Report
Directors’ remuneration
The Board recognises that Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate interest to the shareholders. The Group operates 
within a competitive environment, performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and employees 
and it believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
The Remuneration Committee aligns the remuneration policy to our Group strategy and main business objectives. 
Performance-based incentives are earned through achieving demanding targets for short-term business and individual 
performance, as well as creating long-term shareholder value.
Policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain 
Directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group’s position and to reward them, enhancing shareholder value

About this Report 48 incadea Annual Review 2013
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of incadea plc
We have audited the Financial Statements of incadea plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the 
consolidated statement of income, the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated 
statement of cash flows and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Financial Statements in accordance with the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view in accordance with 
IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. The Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; 
and 
• prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that:
• show and explain the company’s transactions;
• disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
company’s financial position; and
• enable you to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Law.
The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities and for 
the preparation of the directors report which complies 
with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 amended. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the company 
complies with laws and regulations that applies to its 
activities and for preventing non-compliance and 
detecting any that occurs. 
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (as issued by the 
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)). Those 
standards require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the Financial 
Statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit includes performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
Financial Statements. The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgement, including the risks of material 
misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to 
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the 
auditor considers the internal control relevant to the 
entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a 
true and fair view in order to design appropriate audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the Financial Statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If 
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implication for our 
report. The other information comprises the Chairman’s 
Letter, Chief Executive’s Letter and Chief Financial 
Officer’s Letter. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Financial Statements:
• give a true and fair view of the Group’s financial 
position as at 31 December 2013 and the Group’s 
financial performance and cash flows for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union,
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. incadea Annual Review 2013 49
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion the information given in the Annual Report 
for the financial year for which the Financial Statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires 
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept, or 
proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Financial Statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.

believe that the Group is already well placed in BRIC 
countries and now looking forward for expansion in other 
emerging markets. 
The current economic and business developments suggest 
Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey – dubbed the MINT 
countries – as the next crucial locations on the global map 
for brand expansion. 
Already within 2013 MINT markets showed remarkable 
signs of development and growth alarming the new era of 
what are called “emerging markets”.
MINT markets have been singled out by the majority of 
the OEMs as future economic powerhouses of the world, 
predicted to grow exponentially in terms of wealth and 
population over the next few decades. OEMs are already 
expanding their dealer networks in MINT and other 
emerging markets where demand for new vehicles is 
predicted to be strong for the future mid period. incadea 
has already taken a strategic position within these 
markets with the foundation of incadea Mexico and future 
investment plans include strategic cooperations in the 
Middle East market, having as start the Turkish market.
2. Significant events and transactions
The Group’s Management believes that the Group is well 
positioned despite the continuing difficult economic 
circumstances in some of the Group’s markets. Factors 
contributing to the Group’s strong position are:
• no significant decline in order intake experienced on 
large projects. Further, the Group has several long-
term contracts with a number of its customers;
• the Group will not require further borrowing facilities in 
the next 12 months as a result of its significant 
financial resources, existing facilities and strong 
liquidity reserves. Any additional debt is not essential 
for financing the current operations. The Group has 
significant headroom to comply with its debt as and 
when they fall due; and
• the Group’s major customers have not experienced 
financial difficulties. Credit quality of trade receivables 
as at 31 December 2013 is considered to be good.
Overall, the Group is in a strong position despite the 
current economic environment, and has sufficient capital 
and liquidity to service its operating activities and working 
capital. The Group’s objectives and policies for managing 
capital, credit risk and liquidity risk are described below in 
summary.
Exposure to economic cycle
The Group could be affected by unforeseen events outside 
its control including economic and political events and 
trends, inflation and deflation or currency exchange 
fluctuation. The combined effect of these factors is 
difficult to predict and an investment in the Group could 
be affected adversely by changes in economic, political, 
administrative, taxation or other regulatory factors in any 
jurisdiction in which the Group may operate.
Litigation risks
All industries, including the software industry, are subject 
to legal claims, with and without merit. The Group may 
become involved in legal disputes in the future. Defence 
and settlement costs can be substantial, even with 
respect to claims that have no merit. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty of the litigation process, there can be no 
assurance that the resolution of any particular legal 
proceeding will not have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial position or results of operations.
Operations in emerging markets
A large portion of the future growth of the Group is 
expected to come from emerging markets. Emerging 
markets generally may not operate as efficiently as those 
in developed countries. Companies based in emerging 
markets are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting 
and financial reporting standards, practices and 
requirements comparable to those applicable to 
companies based in developed countries, thereby 
potentially increasing the risk of fraud or other deceptive 
practices. Moreover, the quality and reliability of official 
data published by the government or securities exchanges 
in emerging markets may not accurately reflect the actual 
circumstances being reported.
3. General information and Basis for preparation
The consolidated financial statements of incadea plc have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union. The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on Management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates (Note 6 details the critical accounting estimates 
and judgements that Management take on). The Group 
and its subsidiaries undertaking are referred to in this 
report as the Group.
The financial information is presented in € and amounts 
are rounded to the nearest (€k) except when otherwise 
indicated.

4. Changes in accounting policies
New standards, interpretations, revisions and 
amendments to existing standards that are 
effective and have been adopted by the 
European Union
The following amendments and interpretations of the IFRS 
have been issued by the IASB and their application is 
mandatory from or after 01 January 2013. The most 
significant Standards and Interpretations are as follows:
Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial 
Statements” – Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income
In June 2011, the IASB issued the amendment to IAS 1 
“Presentation of Financial Statements”. The amendments 
pertain to the way of other comprehensive income items 
presentation. Management estimate that these 
amendments do not affect, in a material way, the 
consolidated financial statements. 
IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” 
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement”. IFRS 13 defines fair value, sets out in a 
single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and 
requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The 
measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 13 
apply when another IFRS requires or permits the item to 
be measured at fair value. IFRS 13 does not determine 
when an asset, a liability or an entity’s own equity 
instrument is measured at fair value. Neither does it 
change the requirements of other IFRSs regarding the 
items measured at fair value and makes no reference to 
the way the changes in fair value are presented in the 
Financial Statements. The standard does not affect the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”
In June 2011, the IASB issued the amendment to IAS 19 
“Employee Benefits”. The amendments aim to improve the 
issues related to defined benefit plans. The revised 
version eliminates the “corridor method” and requires the 
recognition of remeasurements (including actuarial gains 
and losses) arising in the reporting period in other 
comprehensive income. Furthermore, this version 
changes the measurement and presentation of certain 
components of defined benefit cost. Under the revised 
standard, the Group/Group restates its reported results 
throughout the comparative periods in accordance with 
the prescribed transitional provisions of IAS 19 and in 
accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors”. The amendments do 
not affect the consolidated financial statements from the 
difference when recognising actuarial earnings/(losses). 
Amendments to IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures” – Offsetting Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities
In December 2011, the IASB published new requirements 
for disclosures that enable users of Financial Statements 
to make better comparison between IFRS and US GAAP 
based financial statements. 
This Amendment introduces disclosures intended to 
enable users of financial statements to evaluate the effect 
or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s 
financial position. This includes the effect or potential 
effect of rights of set-off associated with the entity’s 
recognised financial assets and recognised financial 
liabilities that are either off-set as a result of the 
application of the requirements of IAS 32.42 or that are 
subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or 
similar agreement, which is outside of the scope of that 
paragraph.
The amendments do not affect the consolidated financial 
statements. 
Amendment to IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards” – 
Government loans 
In March 2012, the IASB issued amendment to IFRS 1, 
which gives IFRS first-time adopters the option, on a loan 
by loan basis, of applying the IFRS requirements 
retrospectively provided that the necessary information to 
apply the requirements to a particular government loan 
was obtained at the time of initially accounting for that 
loan. The amendment does not affect the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Annual Improvements 2009–2011 Cycle
In May 2012, the IASB issued Annual Improvements 
2009–2011 Cycle, a collection of amendments to 5 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as its 
latest set of annual improvements. Specifically, includes 
improvements for IFRS 1, IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 32 and IAS 
34. The amendments are not significant and have not a 
material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
New Standards, Interpretations and amendments to 
existing Standards which have not taken effect yet 
or have not been adopted by the European Union
Τhe following new Standards, Revised Standards as well 
as the following Interpretations to the existing Standards 
have been publicised but have not taken effect yet or have 
not been adopted by the European Union. In particular:
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” (removal of 
mandatory effective date)
In November 2009, the IASB issued the new Standard, 
the revised IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement” which is the first step in the IASB 
project to replace IAS 39. In October 2010, the IASB 
expanded IFRS 9 to add new requirements for classifying 
and measuring financial liabilities, derecognition of 
financial instruments, impairment, and hedge accounting. 
IFRS 9 defines that all financial assets are initially 
measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs. Subsequent measurement of financial assets is 
made either at amortised cost or at fair value, depending 
on how an entity manages its financial instruments (its 
business model) and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial assets. IFRS 9 generally 
prohibits reclassification between categories, however, 
when an entity changes its business model in a way that 
is significant to its operations, a re-assessment is required 
of whether the initial determination remains appropriate. 
The standard requires all investments in equity  58 incadea Annual Review 2013
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
instruments to be measured at fair value. However, if an 
equity investment is not held for trading, an entity can 
make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to 
measure it at fair value through other comprehensive 
income with only dividend income recognised in profit or 
loss. Fair value profit and loss is  
not subsequently carried forward to income statement 
while dividend income shall still be recognised in the 
income statement. IFRS 9 abolishes “cost exception” for 
unquoted equities and derivatives in unquoted shares, 
while providing guidance on when cost represents fair 
value estimation. In November 2013, the IASB issued 
amendments to IFRS 9. These amendments make three 
important changes to IFRS 9. Firstly, a new chapter on 
hedge accounting has been added to IFRS 9. This 
represents a major overhaul of hedge accounting and puts 
in place a new model that introduces significant 
improvements principally by aligning the accounting more 
closely with risk management. There are also 
improvements to the disclosures about hedge accounting 
and risk management. The second amendment makes the 
improvements to the reporting of changes in the fair value 
of an entity’s own debt contained in IFRS 9 more readily 
available. The third change is the removal of the 
mandatory effective date of IFRS 9, because the 
impairment phase of the IFRS 9 project is not yet 
completed that would allow sufficient time for entities to 
prepare to apply the Standard. Entities may however still 
choose to apply IFRS 9. The Group’s management is going 
to adopt the requirements of IFRS 9 earlier following the 
relevant approval of the Standard by the European Union, 
but it cannot be foreseen at the current time a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements. The current 
Standard has not been adopted by the European  
Union yet.
IFRS 10 “consolidated financial statements”, IFRS 
11 “Joint Arrangements” and IFRS 12 “Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities”, IAS 27 “Separate 
Financial Statements” and IAS 28 “Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures” (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014)
In May 2011, the IASB issued three new Standards, 
namely IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. IFRS 10 
“consolidated financial statements” sets out a new 
consolidation method, defining control as the basis under 
consolidation of all types of entities. IFRS 10 supersedes 
IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” 
and SIC 12 “Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities”. 
IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” sets out the principles 
regarding financial reporting of joint arrangements 
participants. IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 “Interests in 
Joint Ventures” and SIC 13 “Jointly Controlled Entities – 
Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers”. IFRS 12 
“Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” unites, improves 
and supersedes disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in subsidiaries, under common audit, associates 
and non-consolidated entities. As a result of these new 
standards, the IASB has also issued the revised IAS 27 
entitled IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements” and 
revised IAS 28 entitled IAS 28 “Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures”. The Standards are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014, 
with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will assess the 
impact of new standards in its consolidated financial 
statements, although it cannot be foreseen at the current 
time a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. The Standards have been adopted by the 
European Union in December 2012.
Transition Guidance: consolidated financial 
statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities (Amendments to IFRS 
10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12) (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 01 January 2013)
In June 2012, the IASB issued consolidated financial 
statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance 
(Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12) to clarify 
the transition guidance in IFRS 10 consolidated financial 
statements. The amendments also provide additional 
transition relief in IFRS 10, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, 
limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative 
information to only the preceding comparative period. 
Furthermore, for disclosures related to unconsolidated 
structured entities, the amendments will remove the 
requirement to present comparative information for 
periods before IFRS 12 is first applied. The Transition 
Guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 01 January 2013, but in practice is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014 
when the relevant Standards will be effective. The Group 
will assess the impact of transition guidance in its 
consolidated financial statements, although it cannot be 
foreseen at the current time a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements. This transition guidance has 
been adopted by the European Union in April 2013.
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 
12 and IAS 27) (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 01 January 2014)
In October 2012, the IASB issued Investment Entities 
(Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27). The 
amendments apply to a particular class of business that 
qualifies as investment entities. The IASB uses the term 
“investment entity” to refer to an entity whose business 
purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital 
appreciation, investment income or both. An investment 
entity must also evaluate the performance of its 
investments on a fair value basis. Such entities could 
include private equity organisations, venture capital 
organisations, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and 
other investment funds. The Investment Entities 
amendments provide an exception to the consolidation 
requirements in IFRS 10 and require investment entities 
to measure particular subsidiaries at fair value through 
profit or loss, rather than consolidate them. The 
amendments also set out disclosure requirements for 
investment entities. The amendments are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014, 
with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will assess the 
impact of amendments in its consolidated financial 
statements. The amendments have been adopted by the 
European Union in November 2013.

Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: 
Presentation” – Offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 01 January 2014)
In December 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 
32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”, which provides 
clarification on some requirements for offsetting financial 
assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 01 January 2014, with earlier 
adoption permitted. The Group will assess the impact of 
amendments in its consolidated financial statements, 
although it cannot be foreseen at the current time a 
material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
These amendments have been adopted by the European 
Union in December 2012.
Amendments to IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” – 
Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial 
Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 01 January 2014)
In May 2013, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 36 
“Impairment of Assets”. These narrow-scope amendments 
address the disclosure of information about the 
recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is 
based on fair value less costs of disposal. Earlier 
application is permitted for periods when the entity has 
already applied IFRS 13. The amendments are effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014, 
with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will assess the 
impact of amendments in its consolidated financial 
statements, although it cannot be foreseen at the current 
time a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. These amendments have been adopted by 
the European Union in December 2013.
Amendments to IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement” – Novation of 
Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2014)
In June 2013, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 39 
“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. 
The narrow-scope amendments will allow hedge 
accounting to continue in a situation where a derivative, 
which has been designated as a hedging instrument, is 
novated to effect clearing with a central counterparty as a 
result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met. 
Similar relief will be included in IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments. The amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014, with 
earlier adoption permitted. The Group will assess the 
impact of amendments in its consolidated financial 
statements. These amendments have been adopted by 
the European Union in December 2013.
Interpretation 21: Levies (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 01 January 2014)
In May 2013, the IASB issued Interpretation 21 that is an 
interpretation of IAS 37 Provisions “Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets”. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the 
recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement 
for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a 
past event (known as an obligating event). The 
Interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives 
rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in 
the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the 
levy. The Interpretation is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 01 January 2014, with earlier 
adoption permitted. The Group will assess the impact of 
interpretation in its consolidated financial statements.  
The Interpretation has not been adopted by the European 
Union yet.
Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” – 
Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 
(effective from 1 July 2014)
In November 2013, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 
19 “Employee Benefits”. The narrow-scope amendments 
apply to contributions from employees or third parties to 
defined benefit plans. The objective of the amendments is 
to simplify the accounting for contributions that are 
independent of the number of years of employee service, 
for example, employee contributions that are calculated 
according to a fixed percentage of salary. The 
amendments are effective from 1 July 2014 with earlier 
adoption permitted. The Group will not be affected by the 
above changes. These amendments have not been 
adopted by the European Union yet.
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle 
and 2011–2013 Cycle (effective from 1 July 2014)
In December 2013, the IASB issued Annual improvements 
to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle and 2011–2013 Cycle. The 
Cycle 2010–2012 includes improvements for IFRS 2, IFRS 
3, IFRS 8, IFRS 13, IAS 16, IAS 24 and IAS 38 and in the 
Cycle 2011–2013 improvements are relating to IFRS 1, 
IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40. The improvements are 
effective from 1 July 2014 with earlier adoption permitted. 
The Group will assess the impact of the improvements in 
its consolidated financial statements. These improvements 
have not been adopted by the European Union yet.
5. Summary of accounting policies
Overall considerations
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
using the accounting policies and measurement bases 
summarised below:
5.1 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified 
as the Board of Directors that makes strategic decisions.
5.2 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose 
entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies, generally accompanying  
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights 
or with less than half of the voting rights but reasonable 
documentation that the Group maintain the control over 
this entity (“control” as defined by the IFRS framework). 
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that  
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered 
when assessing whether the Group controls another  
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date  
on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.  60 incadea Annual Review 2013
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group. 
(b) Transactions and non-controlling interest
All transactions and balances between Group companies 
are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains 
and losses on transactions between Group companies.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, 
represent the portion of a subsidiary’s profit or loss and 
net assets that is not held by the Group.
Purchases of additional interest in subsidiary undertakings 
where the Group already has control, are treated as 
transactions with owners and result neither in profits or 
losses in the income statement, nor in the recognition of 
additional goodwill.
(c) Business combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
results of business combinations using the purchase 
method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition 
is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement.
For business combinations completed prior to 01 January 
2010, the Group initially recognised any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
For business combinations completed on or after 01 
January 2010 the Group has the choice, on a transaction 
by transaction basis, to initially recognise any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree which is a present 
ownership interest and entitles its holders to a 
proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event 
of liquidation at either acquisition date fair value or, at the 
present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the 
recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets.
Other components of non-controlling interest such as 
outstanding share options are generally measured at fair 
value. The group has not elected to take the option to use 
fair value in acquisitions completed to date.
(d) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% 
of the voting rights. Investments in associates are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting and 
are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in 
associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net 
of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition 
profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, 
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is 
recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of 
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an 
associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 
including any other unsecured receivables, the Group 
does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and 
its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of associates have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the 
Group. Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in 
associates are recognised in the income statement.
(e) Merger accounting
The accounting treatment in relation to the addition of 
incadea plc as a new UK holding Group of the Group falls 
outside the scope of the IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. 
The Share Scheme arrangement constituted a 
combination of entities under common control as defined 
by IFRS 3. The relative rights of the original shareholders 
remain unaltered post transaction. 
Paragraph 10 of IAS8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors requires Management to 
use its judgement in developing and applying a policy that 
is relevant, reliable, represents faithfully the transaction, 
reflects the economic substance of the transaction, is 
neutral, is prudent, and is complete in all material 
respects when selecting the appropriate methodology for 
consolidation accounting. Taking this into consideration, 
Management look to the most appropriate standard which 
is under UK GAAP. 
Paragraph 13 of the Financial Reporting Standard 6 (FRS) 
Acquisitions and Mergers (UK) permits merger accounting 
as a result of a Group reconstruction when an addition of 
a new parent Group does not alter the relative rights of 
the shareholders and is facilitated entirely by a share for 
share exchange. 
Management believes that it has met the criteria as 
defined by paragraph 13 of FRS6 and has treated the 
insertion of incadea plc as the ultimate parent entity as a 
Group reconstruction and have applied the FRS6 merger 
accounting principles to prepare the consolidated financial 
statements and treated the reconstructed Group as if it 
had always been in existence.
incadea plc is incorporated in Jersey and therefore falls 
under the Jersey Corporations act. Unlike the UK 
Companies Act 2006 the Jersey Corporations Act does not 
require a Group balance sheet to be present in the Annual 
Report. There is also no require under the AIM listing 
rules to present a Group balance sheet. 
5. Summary of accounting policies continued incadea Annual Review 2013 61
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
In applying merger accounting the Group does not need 
to incorporate into its financial statements the fair value 
of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities. No goodwill arises 
on the merger and the Group incorporates incadea GmbH 
assets and liabilities at the amounts at which they were 
recorded in the books pre combination. The results and 
cash flows of the combining entities will be brought into 
the combined entity’s consolidated financial statements 
from the beginning of the financial year – i.e. 01 January 
2012. Consolidation effectively occurs as if incadea GmbH 
has always been part of the new group. In terms of the 
comparatives there will be no change as incadea plc did 
not exist pre 01 January 2012.
The Earnings Per Share (EPS) comparative for 2011 has 
been adjusted for the share exchange agreement 
completed on 16 May 2012, whereby, the entire share 
capital of incadea Holding was exchanged for 32m 
Ordinary shares.
(f) Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs 
or group of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from 
synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units 
to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of 
goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is 
the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to 
sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an 
expense and is not subsequently reversed.
5.3 Currency translation
(a) Functional and reporting currency
Items included in the financial information of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated 
financial information is presented in € (“reporting 
currency”), while the functional currency of the parent 
Group and some of the subsidiaries is their local currency 
– corresponding to the currency in which the majority of 
their transactions are denominated.
(b) Foreign currency transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency of the respective Group entity, using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the remeasurement of monetary 
items denominated in foreign currency at year-end 
exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items are not retranslated at year-end and 
are measured at historical cost (translated using the 
exchange rates at the transaction date), except for 
non-monetary items measured at fair value which are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair 
value was determined.
(c) Foreign operations
In the Group’s financial statements, all assets, liabilities and 
transactions of Group entities with a functional currency 
other than the € are translated into € upon consolidation. 
The functional currency of the entities in the Group has 
remained unchanged during the reporting period.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities have been translated 
into € at the closing rate at the reporting date. Goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity have been treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated into € at the closing rate. 
Income and expenses have been translated into € at the 
average rate over the reporting period. Exchange 
differences are charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income and recognised in the currency translation reserve 
in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the related 
cumulative translation differences recognised in equity are 
reclassified to profit or loss and are recognised as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal.
5.4 Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different 
useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The 
depreciation policies for each class of asset are as follows:
Transport equipment 20%
Furniture and office equipment 10%–33%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are 
recognised within “Other income/(expenses)” in the 
income statement.
5.5 Intangible assets
(a) Trademarks
Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical 
cost. Trademarks acquired in a business combination are 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The 
acquired trademark “incadea” is linked to the name of the 
Group and does not have any constraints in relation to its 
ownership or usage, however as it is related to a 
technological product which will be replaced, the 
assumption of a finite useful life of 10 years has been 
used. The trademark “incadea” is carried forward at cost 
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method over the expected life of 
the trademark. 62 incadea Annual Review 2013
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
(b) Internally generated software
Expenditure associated with developing and maintaining 
the Group’s software products is recognised as incurred. 
Where, however, new product development projects are 
technically feasible, production and sale is intended, a 
market exists, expenditure can be measured reliably, and 
sufficient resources are available to complete such 
projects, development expenditure is capitalised until 
initial commercialisation of the product, and thereafter 
amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life. Staff costs and specific third party costs 
involved with the development of the software are 
included within amounts capitalised. Development costs 
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised 
as an asset in a subsequent period.
(c) Other intangible
Software acquired in a business combination is recognised 
at fair value at the acquisition date. Software acquired in 
a business combination has a finite useful life of 5 years 
and is carried forward at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the expected life of the 
software.
Computer software and licensed to-use technology are 
capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is 
expected to benefit from them, which is typically three to 
five-years.
(d) Customer relationships
Customer relationships (contractual and non-contractual) 
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have 
a finite useful life, of 10 years and are carried forward at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method over the 
expected life of the customer relationships.
5.6 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which 
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are 
reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date.
5.7 Financial assets
At each reporting date included in the Financial 
Statements, the Group held only items classified as loans 
and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the 
balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current 
assets. Loans and receivables are classified as “trade and 
other receivables” in the statement of financial position.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairments. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivables. Significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, 
and default or delinquency in payments (more than 180 
days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use 
of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account for trade receivables. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against other income in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
5.8 Financial liabilities – Trade and Other Payables
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the 
future for goods and services received, whether or not 
billed to the Group. Trade and other payables are initially 
measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, Interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in profit or loss over the period of the 
borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
5.9 Financing Cost
Financing costs are calculated using the effective interest 
method and include interest, amortisation of discounts or 
premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of 
ancillary costs incurred in connection with arrangement of 
borrowings and foreign exchange differences arising from 
foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are 
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
Financing costs are expensed as incurred unless they 
relate to qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets 
which take a substantial period of time to get ready for 
their intended use or sale. Where funds are borrowed 
specifically for the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset, the amount of borrowing costs 
capitalised is the amount incurred in relation to that 
borrowing, net of any interest earned on those 
borrowings.
Where funds are borrowed generally, borrowing costs are 
capitalised using a weighted average capitalisation rate.
5. Summary of accounting policies continued incadea Annual Review 2013 63
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
5.10 Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net 
amount reported in the statement of financial position 
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
5.11 Inventories and Work in progress
Inventories consist of materials on hand (e.g. licences) 
and production costs relating to contracts that as at the 
yearend have yet to be signed but Management deemed 
there is a high chance of success.
Materials on hand are stated at the lower of their 
purchase cost, including costs incurred in bringing the 
materials to their present location and condition, and their 
corresponding net realisable value. Net realisable value is 
the estimated re-sale value of the materials, reduced by 
the costs of disposal.
Production costs consist primarily of the labour and other 
costs of personnel directly engaged in providing the 
service, including supervisory personnel, and attributable 
overheads. Labour and other costs relating to sales and 
general administrative personnel are not included but are 
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are 
incurred. The cost of inventories does not include profit 
margins or non-attributable overheads. Net realisable 
value is the estimated contract value for the work won 
and to be performed. 
5.12 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits 
held with banks and short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  
in value. 
5.13 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental 
costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds.
5.14 Taxation
Tax is calculated on the profit for the year (adjusted for 
appropriate reliefs, allowances, non-deductible expenses 
and timing differences) at the expected prevailing rate. 
Deferred tax is recognised (at the current rates of 
taxation) in respect of all material temporary differences 
in the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen but have not 
reversed by the reporting date. Recoverable deferred tax 
is recognised as an asset (at the expected future tax rate) 
only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available to utilise it. It is reviewed annually.
5.15 Employee benefits
There is a bonus-plan in place, which depends on 
achievement of Group and personal or department-related 
targets. This bonus plan is agreed in accordance with the 
work council. General framework of the targets defined 
year by year in advance. Bonuses are accrued per month 
based on the Group’s and individual employee targets and 
re-assessed from Management at the end of each 
reporting period whether and to which point the Group’s 
targets have been achieved.
5.16 Earnings/(losses) per share
Basic earnings/(losses) per share are computed by 
dividing net profit or loss attributable to equity holders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding during each year, excluding the 
average number of common shares purchased by the 
Group as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity 
holders of the parent (after deducting interest on 
convertible shares, net of tax), by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the year (adjusted 
for the effect of dilutive convertible shares).
The weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period and for all periods 
presented shall be adjusted for events that have changed 
the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a 
corresponding change in resources.
5.17 Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
are transferred to the buyer. Revenue is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of software licence sales, 
maintenance sales, professional services (including 
installation), support services and distribution 
agreements. Revenue is recognised when: (i) persuasive 
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has 
occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales 
price has been fixed and determinable; and (iv) 
collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not 
modified to meet the specific requirements of each 
customer is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the product are transferred to the customer.
Revenue from maintenance sales is invoiced quarterly or 
yearly in advance and is recognised on a monthly basis in 
line with the terms of the maintenance contract.
Revenue from rendering of services is based on the stage 
of completion determined using the percentage of 
completion method where revenue is matched with the 
costs incurred in reaching the stage of completion. The 
stage of completion is determined by comparing the 
proportion that costs incurred for work performed to date 
bear to the budgeted total cost of the services to be 
performed. The Group recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the 
entity. Amounts recoverable on such long-term contracts 
are included in Other Current Assets.
The excess of amounts invoiced and future invoicing over 
revenue recognised is included in deferred income. If the 
amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts 
invoiced the excess amount is included within accounts 
receivable. 64 incadea Annual Review 2013
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
5.18 Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. The costs of operating 
leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the 
duration of the leases in arriving at operating profit.
5.19 Dividend distribution
Dividends are recorded in the accounts of the year in 
which they are approved by the shareholders, meaning at 
the time the right to receive payment is established.
5.20 Government grants
Government grants are considered after payment from 
the government, as soon as the Group fulfils all the 
necessary requirements to obtain such a grant.
5.21 Share-based options
The Group operates equity-settled share-based 
remuneration plans for its employees. None of the Group’s 
plans feature any options for a cash settlement.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant 
of any share-based payment are measured at their fair 
values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based 
payments, the fair value of employees’ services is 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the 
equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at 
the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market 
vesting conditions (for example profitability and sales 
growth targets and performance conditions). All share-
based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an 
expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to 
reserves (Share capital under share-based payment). If 
vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the 
expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options 
expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are 
subsequently revised if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest differs from 
previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to 
vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment 
is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if 
share options ultimately exercised are different to that 
estimated on vesting. Upon exercise of share options, the 
proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs up to the nominal value of the shares 
issued are allocated to share capital with any excess being 
recorded as share premium.
5.22 Provisions, contingent assets and 
contingent liabilities
Provisions for product warranties, legal disputes, onerous 
contracts or other claims are recognised when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic 
resources will be required from the Group and amounts 
can be estimated reliably, however, the timing or amount 
of the outflow may still be uncertain.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure 
required to settle the present obligation, based on the 
most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, 
including the risks and uncertainties associated with the 
present obligation. Where there are a number of similar 
obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required 
in settlement is determined by considering the class of 
obligations as a whole. Provisions are discounted to their 
present values, where the time value of money is 
material.
Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually 
certain to collect from a third party with respect to the 
obligation is recognised as a separate contingent asset. 
However, this asset may not exceed the amount of the 
related provision.
No liability is recognised if an outflow of economic 
resources as a result of present obligations is not 
probable. Such situations are disclosed as contingent 
liabilities unless the outflow of resources is remote.
5.23 Borrowing cost
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset are 
capitalised during the period of time that is necessary to 
complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or 
sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in 
which they are incurred and reported in finance costs.
Borrowing costs that are related to the Senior Loan 
Agreement with Citibank (London Branch) have been 
capitalised and for presentation purposes they have been 
netted of versus borrowings.
6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
When preparing the Financial Statements, Management 
undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about recognition and measurement of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The actual results 
may differ from the judgements, estimates and 
assumptions made by Management, and will seldom equal 
the estimated results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Significant management judgement
(a) Intangible assets 
On acquisition of a business the Group is required to value 
the assets acquired and recognise possible intangible 
assets on the balance sheet. The valuation of these assets 
relies on various assumptions, including future revenues 
and costs derived from those assets and the selections of 
an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of their expected cash flows. 
5. Summary of accounting policies continued incadea Annual Review 2013 65
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
(b) Taxation 
The Group recognises taxation assets and liabilities based 
upon estimates and assessments of many factors 
including past experience, advice received on the relevant 
taxation legislation and judgements about the outcome of 
future events. To the extent that the final outcome of 
these matters is different from the amounts recorded, 
such differences will impact on the taxation charge made 
in the consolidated income statement in the period in 
which such determination is made.
(c) Provision impairment for doubtful receivables
The Group performs allowance for doubtful receivables 
regarding specific customers for which certain evidence is 
shown that the collection of the relevant receivable is 
doubtful. The Group’s Management periodically reassess 
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful receivables in 
conjunction with its credit policy, taking into account 
reports from its legal department, following the 
processing of historical data and recent developments of 
the cases they are assigned to.
(d) Capitalisation of development expenditure
The Group capitalises development costs provided the 
conditions have been met. Consequently the Directors are 
required to continually assess the commercial potential of 
the product in development and its useful life following 
launch. Impairment of the capitalised development cost 
depends of the sales potential, market readiness and 
delivery in time of the new software products. Details of 
impairment tests are given in Note 8. Any significant 
alteration of the parameters used in the impairment tests 
could also affect them.
(e) Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment based on the future 
cash flows of the CGUs under consideration, discounted by 
the weighted average cost of capital determined per CGU. 
The Directors are evaluating the business prospects of the 
CGUs and take into account business plans established as 
well as historical information to define key indexes for the 
future cash flows determination.
Discounting factors are determined by taking into account 
the risk conditions of the region that each CGU operates 
as well as relevant information from the industry the 
Group operates in. 
Estimation uncertainty
(a) Impairment 
In assessing impairment, Management estimates the 
recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating 
units based on expected future cash flows and uses an 
interest rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty 
relates to assumptions about future operating results and 
the determination of a suitable discount rate.
(b) Useful lives of depreciable assets 
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of 
depreciable assets at each reporting date, based on the 
expected utility of the assets. Uncertainties in these 
estimates relate to technical obsolescence that may 
change the utility of certain software and IT equipment. 
(c) Inventories 
Management estimates the net realisable values of 
inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence 
available at each reporting date. The future realisation of 
these inventories may be affected by future technology or 
other market-driven changes that may reduce future 
selling prices. 
(d) Business combinations 
Management uses valuation techniques in determining the 
fair values of the various elements of a business 
combination. Particularly, the fair value of deferred 
consideration is dependent on the outcome of many 
variables that affect future profitability. 
(e) Estimation of contract income
Estimated income receivable on contracts is judged by 
Management through the application of their experience 
and knowledge of the industry in which the Group 
operates. Income for each individual contract is 
determined according to the stage of completion 
determined by reference to the cost of services performed 
to date as a percentage of the total cost of services to be 
performed. Management consider that the cost of services 
performed under each contract at any stage of completion 
when compared to total budgeted cost is an accurate 
measure of the work performed under those contracts. 
Total budgeted costs are continually reviewed throughout 
the contract for accuracy and costs incurred are closely 
monitored against budget. 66 incadea Annual Review 2013

as part of the acquisition of RC Real Business Solutions GmbH (RCRBS), which was announced on 27 January 2014 following the conditional 
placing of 11 million ordinary shares. 
8. Segment Reporting
The Group has identified its reportable segment based on the financial reports that internally are provided to the 
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors. The 
information reported regularly to the CODM presents the Group as a single segment supplying licences, maintenance 
and services to customers. The Group’s software products share a common sales, development and implementation 
resource. Consequently, the Group has determined that there is one operating segment and therefore one reportable 
segment. Segment performance is measured based on segment profit before tax.
Management review the performance of the Group by reference to Group-wide profit measures and the revenues 
derived from three main product groupings:
• licences;
• maintenance; and
• services. incadea Annual Review 2013 67

incadea New Zealand. More detail regarding these items 
has been included in Note 39.
The recognised provisional goodwill in the Group financial 
statements for the previous period for incadea Beijing was 
€696k. During the current period the Group finalised the 
initial accounting for the goodwill arising from this 
transaction and as a result €541k recognised as intangible 
assets minus the related deferred tax of €135.1k which 
was treated versus the goodwill from the above 
transaction.
For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations 
in which the goodwill arises, as follows:

Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was determined based on value-in-use calculations, covering a 
detailed five-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for the remaining useful lives using 
growth rates determined by Management. None of the CGUs were impaired. The present value of the expected cash 
flows of each segment is determined by applying a suitable discount rate.

incadea Greece 3.50% 15.30% 3.50% 13.30%
Growth rates
The growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates for the product lines and industries of the cash generating 
units. 
Discount rates
The discount rates reflect appropriate adjustments relating to market risk and specific risk factors of each segment.
Cash flow assumptions
Management’s key assumptions include stable profit margins, based on past experience in this market. The Group’s 
Management believes that this is the best available input for forecasting this mature market. Cash flow projections 
reflect stable profit margins achieved immediately before the budget period. No expected efficiency improvements have 
been taken into account and prices and wages reflect publicly available forecasts of inflation for the industry.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the 
earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and there 
is no intention for these entities to pay dividends, no tax is 
expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.0125 or £0.01. 
All shares are equally eligible to receive dividends and the 
repayment of capital and represent one vote at the

The Group adopted a Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)  
on 21 May 2012, which will be administered under the 
direction of the Board. The LTIP will allow the grant of 
rights to acquire fully paid ordinary shares to eligible 
employees, save that no LTIP awards can be granted more 
than 10 years after adoption of the LTIP. Certain Directors 
have been granted LTIP awards with a vesting date of the

Total option shares awarded 499,485
The fair values of options granted were determined using a variation of the binomial option pricing model that takes into 
account factors specific to the share incentive plans, such as the vesting period. The performance condition related to 
the LTIP, being a market condition, has been incorporated into the measurement by means of actuarial modeling.
The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation:
Current share price 75.000
Exercise price 0.000
Continuous growth rate 1.88%
Dividend yield 0.00%
Volatility 67.00%
Time to maturity (years) 2
The underlying expected volatility was determined by reference to historical data of the Group’s shares over a period of 
time since its flotation on the London Stock Exchange Market (AIM).
On 21 May 2012 the Group issued warrants to Cenkos Securities to subscribe at the Placing Price for up 502,338 
ordinary shares (the “Warrants”). The Warrants, which were issued for services provided during the IPO, are exercisable 
in whole or in part at any time in the five-year period following the date of admission.

Share capital issued in the period refers to the issue of 522,962 ordinary shares following the declaration of a scrip 
dividend to the shareholders by the Group. The dividend declared, being equal to 1.8 Euro cent per share, i.e. equal to 
€904k, was given to shareholders in cash for an amount of €241k while the remaining amount of €663k was given in 
exchange of shares.
18. Equity continued incadea Annual Review 2013 73
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
18.4 Other components of Equity
The other components of equity consist mainly of the 
result from the accounting treatment in relation to the 
addition of incadea plc as a new UK holding group of the 
Group. The Share Scheme arrangement constituted a 
combination of entities under common control as defined 
by IFRS 3. The relative rights of the original shareholders 
remain unaltered post transaction. 
In applying merger accounting the Group does not need 
to incorporate into its financial statements the fair value 
of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities. No goodwill arises 
on the merger and the Group incorporates incadea GmbH 
assets and liabilities at the amounts at which they were 
recorded in the books pre combination. Merger accounting 
application during 2012 and the Group’s IPO led to the 
creation of the special reserves amounted of €15,654.

€2 million revolving facility commitment and an aggregate 
of €21 million term facility commitments. Up to 31 
December 2013, the Group had utilised an amount of €10 
million. The total balance of €9,793 thousands consists of 
the total borrowing utilised excluding external costs 
directly associated to the facility and increased by the 
accrued effective interest rate.
Borrowings at amortised cost
The above bank borrowings are secured by the IP rights of 
the Group and carrying variable interest rate at an 
average of 6% (6M EURIBOR +5.75%). The carrying 
amount of the bank borrowings is considered to be a 
reasonable approximation of the fair value.

of the second anniversary of admission, the total amount of which is equal to €262k. Further analysis is presented in 
Note 18.2.
34. Contingent liabilities
During the current period some warranty and legal claims were brought against the Group. Unless recognised as a 
provision (see Note 23), Management considers these claims to be unjustified and the probability that they will require 
settlement at the Group’s expense to be remote. This evaluation is consistent with legal advice. Further information on 
these contingencies is omitted so as not to seriously prejudice the Group’s position in the related disputes.
35. Financial instruments risk and Management
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities by 
category are summarised in Note 22. The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Long-term financial investments are managed to generate lasting returns.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it write options. 
The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
35.1 Market risk analysis
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest 
rate risk and certain other price risks, which result from both its operating and investing activities.
Price risk
The pricing policy, because of the specialised field, both at Group and Group level will not change
Foreign currency sensitivity (exchange rate risk)
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Under IFRS, 
foreign currency exchange rate risks arise on account of monetary financial instruments denominated in currencies 
other than the functional currency where the non-functional currency is the respective risk variable; translation risks 
are not taken into consideration.
As a globally active enterprise, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies with regard  
to our ordinary operations. Since the Group’s entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own functional 
currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered significant. 
However, occasionally we generate foreign-currency-denominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items by 
transacting in a currency other than the functional currency.
33. Related party transactions continued incadea Annual Review 2013 81
(All amounts are presented in €000s, except where otherwise stated)
Most of the Group’s transactions are carried out in €. Nevertheless, exposures to currency exchange rates arise from 
the Group’s overseas revenues and expenses, which are primarily denominated in Roubles (Russian currency), Yuan 
(Chinese currency) and Pound Sterling (GBP).
Generally, the Group’s risk management procedures distinguish short-term foreign currency cash flows (due within six 
months) from longer term cash flows (due after six months). Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific 
currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken.
The Group does not enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency risk on the 
Group’s foreign currency transactions.
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency risk are disclosed 
below. The amounts shown are those reported to key management translated into € at the closing rate:

Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. Longer-term borrowing 
is at EURIBOR 6M +5,75%. At 31 December 2013, the Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through 
bank borrowings at variable interest rates. 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of 
+/–1% (2012: +/–1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market 
conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial 
instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held 
constant.

35.2 Credit risk analysis
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Group. The Group is exposed to this risk 
for various financial instruments, for example by granting loans and receivables to customers, placing deposits, 
investment in bonds etc. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial 
assets recognised at 31 December, as summarised below:
 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 
Cash and cash equivalents 8,440 2,263
Trade and other receivables 21,050 12,520
 29,490 14,783
The Group continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identified either individually or by 
group, and incorporate this information into its credit risk controls. Where available at reasonable cost, external credit 
ratings and/or reports on customers and other counterparties are obtained and used. The Group’s policy is to deal only 
with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group’s Management considers that all of the above financial assets that are not impaired or past due for each of 
the 31 December reporting dates under review are of good credit quality.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single 
counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large number 
of customers in various industries and geographical areas. Based on historical information about customer default rates 
Management consider the credit quality of trade receivables that are not past due or impaired to be good. The credit 
risk for cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable 
banks with high quality external credit ratings.
35.3 Liquidity risk analysis
Liquidity risk is that the Group might be unable to meet its obligations. The Group manages its liquidity needs by 
monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities as well as forecast cash inflows and 
outflows due in day-to-day business. The data used for analysing these cash flows is consistent with that used in the 
contractual maturity analysis below.

* Depending on the drawdown of the loan facilities.
**  The split for the trade and other payables based on Management’s estimations in accordance with historic data analysis (trade payables trend).
Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis of 
a rolling 30-day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day lookout period are identified 
monthly. Net cash requirements are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to determine headroom or any 
shortfalls. This analysis shows that available borrowing facilities are expected to be sufficient over the lookout period.
The Group’s objective is to maintain cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements for 30-day 
periods at a minimum. This objective was met for the reporting periods. Funding for long-term liquidity needs is 
additionally secured by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Group considers expected cash flows from financial assets in assessing and managing liquidity risk, in particular its 
cash resources and trade receivables. The Group’s existing cash resources and trade receivables significantly exceed 
the current cash outflow requirements. Cash flows from trade and other receivables are all contractually due within 
various periods, depending on the partner/end customer agreement.

36. Fair value measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into 
three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the 
measurement, as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly.
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the Group’s consolidated financial statements include liabilities 
that fall into Level 3 category and related to the contingent liability for the acquisition of incadea New Zealand. 
Measurement of fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes. Valuation techniques 
are selected based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of 
market-based information. The finance team reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and to the Audit 
Committee.
Contingent consideration (Level 3)
The contingent consideration in relation to the incadea New Zealand acquisition estimated using Management’s 
assessments whether the Group is possible to exercise the one-off payment option related to the perpetual profit share 
within the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments falling within Level 3 category:
• the fair value of the financial instrument as prescribed from the Sales and Purchase Agreement of incadea 
New Zealand; and
• other techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis used to determine the present value for the financial 
instrument above.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and all other 
items included in the consolidated statement of financial position approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of 
those instruments.
37. Capital Management policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating with its banks and suppliers 
in order to support the expansion of the business and maximise shareholder value. The Group manages its capital 
structure according to economic conditions and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to those conditions. 
Furthermore the Group is continuously reviewing its working and investment capital needs in order to secure cash flows 
and financing facilities to support them. The Group is using debt and equity to finance its product development and 
infrastructure needs. In situations where new capital requirements are imposed by new projects that the Group is 
aiming to engage, careful planning is undertaken to ensure optimum spending within the project’s resources and within 
existing and/or new financing facilities.
Management assesses the Group’s capital requirements in order to maintain an efficient overall financing structure 
while avoiding excessive leverage. This takes into account the subordination levels of the Group’s various classes of 
debt. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic 
conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or 
sell assets to reduce debt. 84 incadea Annual Review 2013

During the current period the Group remeasured the goodwill arising from the investment in incadea New Zealand due 
to a material omission in the initial accounting of the transaction. According to the Sale and Purchase Agreement 
(“SPA”) for Avanti Solutions Ltd. (dated 14 November 2011) there is a contingent consideration for incadea GmbH 
arising from the buy-out option of the perpetual profit share paid to the old shareholders. Since at the initial recognition 
of the transaction this had not been taken into account, within the current period the Group decided to restate previous 
year statements by including the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of the above contingent 
consideration amounted to €350k as prescribed in the SPA of the transaction.

40. Post-reporting date events
Business transaction with RC Real Business 
Solutions GmbH (“RCRBS”) and finalisation of initial 
accounting
The Group on 24 January 2014 acquired from a related 
party 100% of the share capital of RCRBS following the 
Conditional Placing of 11 million ordinary shares. 
The initial accounting for the RCRBS acquisition has not 
been finalised at the date that the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements have been authorised for issue due to 
the fact that the consolidated financial statements of 
incadea Deutschland GmbH (which will include RCRBS’s 
financial statements), being prepared in accordance with 
the German law on a fair value basis, have not yet been 
finalised and reviewed by an independent professional. 
The reformed incadea Deutschland that will be structured 
after the finalisation of the above transaction will be part 
of the Group with an effective date 01 January 2014.
RCRBS develops and sells the German version of 
incadea.engine and has more than 50 years’ experience in 
the middle market business in Germany. It serves more 
than 12,500 users at over 1,400 customers and has 109 
employees. The majority of RCRBS’ customers are 
dealerships. It has an installed base for GME (Opel), BMW, 
VW, PSA and Renault dealerships, but also markets to Ford 
and Kia. RCRBS also provides services which are performed 
on behalf of OEMs (including VW and GME (Opel)). 
RCRBS business financials reflect a solid customer base 
with long-term customer relationships. There is a strong 
recurring revenue stream in relation to maintenance and 
support contracts with 46% of total revenue of the 
business (for the ten months from 01 January 2013 to 31 
October 2013) coming from this source. 
The preliminary consideration payable for the issued 
share capital of RCRBS is €12.5 million (approximately 
£10.3 million), €5 million (approximately £4.1 million) of 
which was paid to the seller in cash on completion of the 
acquisition agreement and €7.5 million (approximately 
£6.2 million) of which is payable to the seller following 
receipt of the proceeds of the placing.
The book values of incadea Deutschland as incorporated 
in the Group’s financial statements do not include any of 
the assets of RCRBS and consequently the figures are 
considered immaterial.
No other adjusting or significant non-adjusting events 
have occurred between the 31 December reporting date 
and the date of authorisation. 
41. Authorisation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2013 (including comparatives) were 
approved by the Board of Directors on 28 April 2014. 88 incadea Annual Review 2013

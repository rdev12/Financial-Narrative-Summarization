*Underlying is defined as excluding the impact of
goodwill amortisation and, for 2003, the disposal of
Westwind and integration costs. Your directors have recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 21.8p per share 
(2003 - 19.8p). Together with the interim dividend of 9.2p per share (2003
- 8.36p) which was paid in December 2004, this represents an increase of
10.1% compared to 2003. Subject to shareholders’ approval, the ﬁnal
dividend will be paid on 4 July 2005 to all shareholders on the register at 
3 June 2005. For a decade Cobham has been one of the few UK quoted
companies to offer increased annual dividends at 10% or more.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
During the year the Group successfully pursued its strategy of sustained
development through organic growth and acquisition. Six acquisitions were
completed for a total consideration of £61m. In addition, in December,
agreement was reached to acquire H Koch and Sons (Koch) for a cash
consideration of US$63m and Remec Defense & Space Inc. (Remec) for 
a cash consideration of US$260m. Both of these acquisitions are expected
to complete in the second quarter of 2005, subject to certain approvals.
Remec, in particular, positions the Group well in the network enabling
capability market. Three further small acquisitions for the Chelton group
were announced in February of 2005.
As always, the strength of the Group is based on the skill and dedication of
all of its employees and, on behalf of the Board, I thank them sincerely.

INTRODUCTION
We continue to operate in a demanding and ever
changing business environment. 2004 was
challenging but successful for the Group. Since
2000 we have increased our revenues by £415m
and underlying earnings per share have grown by
31p. With businesses extending over five
continents, Cobham has become a truly global
company.
MARKET IN CONTEXT
The aerospace and defence markets have
continued to develop and grow during 2004. In
the military market the key priorities now include
increased interoperability, rapid reaction, precision
strike and information superiority. These priorities
have driven technology insertion into systems
and sub-systems for network enabling capability
and for the development of unmanned aerial
vehicles.
More traditional but equally important
equipment such as air refuelling (AR), antennas
and life support systems have also shown
considerable growth.
Intelligence is key to defeating terrorism and
predicting threats. The USA and NATO continue
to invest in the development of capabilities for
collecting, producing, ﬁltering and communicating
intelligence between space, air, land and sea
operations.
In the commercial market, airline traffic has
returned to levels seen in 2000, and 2005 is
expected to see a further increase. Our two
major commercial customers, Airbus and Boeing,
are forecasting higher levels of output for 2005 
with further potential increases in 2006. Three
new commercial aircraft are on the horizon -
Airbus A350, Boeing B787 and, potentially, the
Bombardier C Series.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Cobham performed robustly in 2004 with record
order intake and strong revenue growth. The fall
in the dollar has slowed proﬁt growth, but this
has been partially offset by our currency hedging
programme.
It has been a year of transition and investment in
the Aerospace Systems Group. Improved
performances in air refuelling and auxiliary
equipment and life support sectors have been
overshadowed by poor operational performances
in countermeasures and ﬂuid and air distribution
sectors. The loss of a major bid at our US
countermeasures business in Milan, Tennessee

Cobham performed robustly in 
2004 with record order intake 
and strong revenue growth.
•
In the military market the Group’s
products and services address key
priorities which now include
increased interoperability, rapid
reaction, precision strike and
information superiority.
Chief Executive’s Review
ALLAN COOK and continued technical challenges on the A380 fuel pump system were
the major reasons for this reduction in operational performance.
Chelton had another good year of organic growth. US businesses
performed strongly driven by increased opportunities in the defence
market. Margins reduced slightly due to the dilution effect of acquisitions.
Order intake improved in antennas, avionics, microwave and law
enforcement and national security (LENS) product lines. Requirements for
increased capability on many platforms will beneﬁt Chelton. Network
enabled capability opportunities are increasing – caused by the
requirement for faster, more secure data transfer.
Flight Operations & Services had an excellent year, exceeding all its
ﬁnancial targets and winning important new business in the UK and
Australia. Proﬁt margins have continued to improve and the Group is well
placed to seek further growth opportunities.
The order book is £1.3bn. In the last twelve months a number of signiﬁcant
long-term contracts have been won or successfully renewed. In February
2005 the UK Ministry of Defence announced that the AirTanker
consortium, in which the Group is a shareholder, had been awarded
Preferred Bidder status on the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA)
programme. This is a signiﬁcant milestone in this 27 year programme to
provide the Royal Air Force with a new tanker/transport service based on
the Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Our bid cost has been £2.3m (2003 - £1.2m).
The cost incurred on this Cobham wide programme is not attributable to
any particular division, and is excluded from the segmental proﬁts shown
in the Business Review.
PROSPECTS
After more than a year of negotiations between the European
manufacturers of the Euroﬁghter Typhoon and the governments of the four
partner nations, UK, Germany, Italy and Spain, agreement was ﬁnally
reached on 14 December 2004 for the second production tranche of 236
combat aircraft. The announcement brought a guarantee of production
continuity through to 2013. This is a major boost for Cobham as tranche 2
production commences.
In the ﬁeld of avionics, combat aircraft require ever higher data acquisition
rates to support improved capabilities. This will require further upgrades of
new and existing aircraft in both Europe and the USA. Chelton is well
placed to support this requirement as part of its network centric capability
programme.
The Group now has a strong worldwide presence in LENS including
offshore and onshore surveillance and advanced multi-mode
communication systems. This area of activity is expected to expand
signiﬁcantly in the years ahead.
In addition, the Group’s products and services address the current military
priorities of countries with the largest defence budgets. In recent years the
Group has greatly increased its industrial presence in the USA and has
continued to invest in research and development and improved facilities 
in its US businesses. The Group is actively involved in bilateral
government/industry discussions to facilitate the secure interchange of
technologies between the USA and the UK.
Group companies are pursuing further opportunities worldwide and the
outlook for further success is encouraging.

AEROSPACE SYSTEMS GROUP
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Aerospace Systems Group reported revenue up 20.6% and underlying
operating profit down 6.0%. This result reflects strong growth in air
refuelling, UK countermeasures and life support. Proﬁt margins have fallen
due to A380 development costs, start-up losses in the US countermeasures
business, lower revenues from Euroﬁghter Typhoon production, US dollar
exchange rates and restructuring costs.
The Life Support Division has enhanced its reputation as a leader in
aviation oxygen systems. The development and qualiﬁcation of the suite of
components for the A380 oxygen system has been achieved.
In AR and Auxiliary Mission Equipment, Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL)
and Sargent Fletcher Inc (SFI) are leaders in the design and manufacture of
AR and auxiliary mission equipment. Production of refuelling pods to meet
United States Air Force Special Operations Command requirements
continues. Refuelling pods for both German Air Force and Royal Canadian
Air Force A310 tankers and for Sukhoi for integration with an AR capable
SU-30 ﬁghter were delivered in 2004. FRL and SFI are also engaged in the
production and supply of weapon carriage and release systems.
In Fluid and Air, deliveries of the ﬁrst fuel tubes and couplings for the
Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were made in the year.
FR-HiTEMP has made good progress on the development of the A380 fuel
pump system with initial deliveries of development and production
hardware and was successful in winning the B787 fuel pumps and inerting
system.
In Countermeasures,Wallop Defence Systems’ new state-of-the-art
production facility began operations in February 2005. A ﬂare order is in
production for the US Navy at FR Countermeasures (FRC), Milan,
Tennessee. Following the loss of a major countermeasures order and a
review of the US countermeasures market, Cobham is exploring a range of
strategic options for FRC.

CHELTON
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Chelton Group reported revenue up 29.4% and underlying operating
proﬁt up 18.1%. This reﬂects strong growth in microwave, antennas and
avionics. The acquisitions in antennas and avionics contributed strongly,
but overall proﬁt margins have been diluted by recent acquisitions.
The Antenna business achieved strong growth. Increased sales were
recorded for interference cancellation systems. As Chelton focuses more 
on army communications and the digital battleﬁeld, it has increased
output of its products. Chelton vehicle intercom systems are ﬁtted to all
the US Army’s improved armour light vehicles, and sales are buoyant in
Europe and the Middle East.
Investment was rewarded with satcom antenna and system selection for
Gulfstream and Embraer Legacy aircraft.
In Avionics,growth continues with additional FAA certiﬁcations for its
synthetic vision electronic ﬂight instrument system (EFIS) and its selection
for the South African C-130 ﬂeet. Delivery of production radio and audio
management systems for the A380 is underway alongside the supply of
intercom systems for the Rafale ﬁghter.
LENS is an area of increasing importance within Homeland Security.
GPS tracking made inroads into the US market place and the introduction
of an advanced internet protocol based capability to track individual
members of a group promises continued strong performance in 2005.
In Microwave, the US defence C4ISR market is particularly strong. Our 
US microwave companies received development contracts for a service 
life extension for all US air route surveillance radar rotary couplers, for a
real-time precision targeting radar, and for the waveguide assemblies for
AEGIS Weapon Systems and the F/A-22 Raptor.
In Europe, the group beneﬁted from sustained space waveguide equipment
sales. At the end of 2004 the microwave and diode division of Temex SA
was acquired. Chelton is now the only major European manufacturer of 
p-i-n diodes used in many core antenna products.
In Composites, the recent approval of the Euroﬁghter Typhoon tranche 2
programme will provide substantial work for the future.

Following the Tsunami disaster in December 2004 Flight
Operations & Services companies have taken part in
disaster relief activity:
A National Air Support contracted Super Puma arrived in
Phuket, Thailand on 22 January 2005, after a two-day ferry
ﬂight from Bristow Helicopters International Operations
in China. The helicopter is under contract to the Australian
Federal Police. Its mission was to assist with transport of
Australian and New Zealand Disaster Victim Identiﬁcation
personnel from Phuket to the main morgue at T aku Pa - 35
minutes ﬂight time north of Phuket. The aircraft ﬂew 
its ﬁrst mission on 23 January. It has now returned to
China.
Two of FBH’s Bell 212 helicopters based with the UK Army
Air Corps in Brunei were detached to Indonesia on
11 January and remained there until 12 February. The
helicopters, along with ﬁve FBH maintenance personnel
and six Army pilots, were transported to Banda Aceh in a
Royal Air Force C17 aircraft. FBH’s engineers were
accommodated under canvas and lived on military rations
in what was ofﬁcially described as ‘austere conditions’.The
camp was located alongside the main runway at Banda
Aceh with an attendant stream of aid ﬂights around the
clock. The helicopters were primarily being used to
transport emergency supplies of food and water to areas
that remained cut off from other means of supply. They
ﬂew a total of 246 hours during this period.
National Jet Systems Boeing 727: following an offer to
CARE Australia by Australian air Express, a Boeing 727
freighter ﬂew from Melbourne to Jakarta via Darwin on 
8 January with a volunteer crew. The main issue facing
people in Indonesia was not a lack of water but containers
to put the water in. Several hundred empty water bottles
with puriﬁcation caps were delivered.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Flight Operations & Services’ order book grew by £50m. Revenue increased
by 4.8% and underlying operating proﬁt by 9.1%. This reﬂects growth in all
segments. Profit margins have benefited from enhanced programme
management and the elimination of BASCO losses.
In Military Training, the UK MoD awarded FR Aviation a £140m ﬁve year
extension to its partnering agreement for the provision of electronic
warfare aerial training services to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force from
2009 to 2014.
In Special Mission Flight Operations, the Australian businesses continue
to trade strongly. The Coastwatch contract for the Australian Customs
Service was extended to June 2007.
In Outsourced Aviation Services,preferred bidder status was awarded by
Qantas for operation of eight B717 aircraft which will replace eight BAe
146 aircraft. In the resource industry market, our position as a major
supplier of air transport services has continued to strengthen. The scope of
activities in support of listed mining companies Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and
Minara Resources has also been increased.
FR Aviation and Bristow Helicopters announced in November the
expansion of their existing joint venture, FB Heliservices (FBH), to provide,
operate and support helicopters worldwide for military and government
customers. A further seven helicopters were acquired bringing the ﬂeet to
59, together with a £10m four year contract in Brunei, which began in
October 2004.
In Large Military Aircraft Engineering, FR Aviation Services, working with
BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman, has been selected to provide 
21 year whole life support at RAF Waddington for the Sentry airborne early
warning aircraft. A £50m contract award is anticipated in 2005. 20 COBHAM PLC

Innovation is arguably the most important facet of Cobham’s strategy.
Expenditure in this area increased by over 20% to £48.7m in 2004,
representing 22.5% Compound Annual Growth Rate since 2000. This
continues a 6% level of investment related to the revenues generated by
Aerospace Systems and Chelton.
Air separation and pneumatic actuation remain key areas for technology
investment in Aerospace Systems. A unique implementation of ceramic
oxygen generation has been developed by Carleton Life Support Systems:
Dräger Aerospace and Carleton have combined to develop a new oxygen
storage and distribution system for commercial aircraft emergency
applications.
FRL continues development of the successful 900 series refuelling pods
and a contract for the supply of these units as part of the Australian A330
multi-role Tanker Transport aircraft was signed in December 2004. FRL is
also working with EADS-CASA to develop the optimum control system
and refuelling interface for the KC330.
SFI is part of the team selected by the US Department of Homeland
Security to develop a state-of-the-art infrared missile protection system for
commercial aircraft. This programme strengthens SFI’s position as a world
leader in airborne mission equipment enclosure pods.
Chelton continues to invest heavily in technology, in particular growing
ERA Technology as a science and technology centre for the Group whilst
retaining its position as a provider of third party technology services to
industry.
Projects undertaken by Chelton in 2004 included the development of DSP
software driven radios, a derivative of the mINCAN© RF interference
cancellation system and a new family of GPS/satellite linked personal
locator beacons.
A signiﬁcant number of new antenna designs for land, sea and air were
introduced for diverse markets and investment continued in the
revolutionary synthetic vision aircraft display systems characterised by
Chelton’s EFIS technology.

Cobham’s Commitment to 
Corporate Social Responsibility
2004 HIGHLIGHTS
•
A seminar was organised for Cobham Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) representatives in the UK & the rest
of Europe. With representatives attending from all sectors,
the seminar started with an introduction by the Chief
Executive, Allan Cook, and covered the drivers and key
elements of CSR. The seminar gave the attendees the
chance to develop their CSR network, discuss common
issues and review Cobham’s CSR Key Performance
Indicators. Attendees were also given an update on
environmental legislation.
•
FR Aviation Ltd achieved the British Safety Council’s 
5-Star Award for the Company's Safety & Environment
Management System. This prestigious award for safety,
health and environment management performance is
recognised nationally and internationally.
•
A further six companies in the Group achieved
certiﬁcation to ISO 14001 for their environmental
management systems, making a total of twelve
representing 39% of the Group by turnover.
In September 2004, Cobham plc published its ﬁrst CSR report on the
corporate website. This report contains details of the Group’s CSR policies,
a summary of 2003 performance and includes case studies associated with
subsidiary companies.
The Group’s second CSR report, with details of 2004 performance, will be
published on the Cobham website in May 2005.
Progress has been made against each of the goals set out in the 2003
Annual Report & Accounts.
REFINEMENT OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING SYSTEM
Improvements have been implemented to aid those completing the
information and those responsible for collating and verifying the data.
VERIFICATION OF CSR PERFORMANCE AS PART OF THE COBHAM
ASSURANCE PROCESS
The processes used to obtain and report CSR data were reviewed at a
number of subsidiaries during the year as part of the internal assurance
programme. Further work will be performed in this area in 2005.
EXPANSION OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) AND THE
SETTING OF PERFORMANCE TARGETS
Progress towards achievement of this goal has been slow. The range of KPIs
has been increased but subsidiaries are still developing the data collection
and reporting processes to meet the requirement.
The Global Reporting Initiative is currently being used to guide future
Corporate Responsibility reporting strategy. As part of this review the
measures reported will be validated against the Group’s operations, its
strategic goals and risk proﬁle. This review will also assist in preparing for
the requirements of the Operating and Financial Review. Once this phase
is complete consideration can be given to the setting of targets.
COMPLETION OF A REVISED ORGANISATION-WIDE CORPORATE
FRAMEWORK AND THE SETTING OF POLICIES IN THE CSR AREA
The revision of the corporate framework is complete. The Group’s policies
on CSR are included on the Cobham plc website.
USING THE COBHAM INTERNET WEBSITE TO COMMUNICATE WITH
STAKEHOLDERS AND FACILITATE CSR AWARENESS AND CONTINUAL
IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE GROUP
Including a CSR report on the website has been seen as a useful addition
by stakeholders. Suggestions as to how the report can be improved 
have been received and these will be incorporated in the next CSR report
where practical.
A message board has also been created on the employee section of the
website where queries can be raised and details of achievements posted. 22 COBHAM PLC
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Board has reviewed the accounting policies in
accordance with FRS 18 and determined they are the
most appropriate for the Group.
TRANSITION TO IFRS
As of 1 January 2005 Cobham is required to prepare its
consolidated accounts in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Work has been
underway for some months to ascertain the likely impact
of this transition and signiﬁcant progress has been made.
A high level assessment of the likely key impacts on
Cobham’s ﬁnancial statements is as follows:
•
Under IFRS goodwill created on acquisition is no
longer amortised but reviewed annually for
impairment. This is likely to increase our basic
operating proﬁt as we charge in the order of £20m to
£25m of amortisation per annum. However, we
exclude this expense for the purpose of determining
underlying proﬁtability.
•
The requirement under IFRS 3 to recognise a broader
range of purchased intangible assets on acquisition
will reduce future goodwill assets, but have no
impact on overall assets acquired. Amortisation of
these assets will generally be over a shorter period
than the 20 years previously adopted for goodwill.
This amortisation may also be excluded from
underlying proﬁtability.
•
The changes required to the accounting for employee
share based incentives will increase operating costs,
assuming utilisation of this type of beneﬁt continues
at the rate incurred in 2004. Due to the transitional
arrangements, this increased cost will not come into
full effect until 2005.
•
The Group does not intend to change the
fundamental tenet of its foreign exchange hedging
policy. IFRS requires all hedges to be strictly
designated and the hedge effectiveness tested. Up
until now the nature of Cobham’s use of this form of
derivative instrument is to take broad hedges against
the anticipated net position of a portfolio of foreign
exchange risks. Meeting the strict hedge criteria for
all contracts may therefore not be practicable. If this
were the outcome, forward foreign currency
contracts would be recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet and movements in these fair values
booked to the income statement as they arise,
resulting in potential volatility in the reported proﬁt
and loss account. The Group will identify the
underlying proﬁt impact of the hedging policy.
FINANCIAL RECORD
•
In 2004 the share price increased by 6.0% and Cobham
delivered total shareholder return of 8.5%.
•
Operating cash ﬂow of £123.4m (2003 - £108.6m),
is a conversion rate of 82% (2003 - 76%) of operating
proﬁt (excluding goodwill amortisation and proﬁts 
from joint ventures and, for 2003, the exceptional 
impact of the loss on disposal of Westwind and
integration costs).
•
Free cash ﬂow £92.9m (2003 - £77.3m).
•
Underlying proﬁt before tax up 8.6% to £146.9m 
(2003 - £135.3m).
•
Underlying earnings per share rose 1.4% to 94.8p.
•
Recommended dividends per share increased by 10.1%.
Financial Review
WARREN TUCKER •
Other changes are expected to affect the Group’s ﬁnancial statements
to a lesser degree. These include the capitalisation of development
costs, the reclassiﬁcation of leases and employee beneﬁt provisions.
ACQUISITIONS
During the year the company completed six acquisitions for a total cash
consideration of £60.4m and deferred consideration of £0.4m.
In December agreement was reached to acquire two further businesses for
a cash consideration of US$323m. These transactions are likely to be
completed in the first half of 2005. Three further acquisitions were
completed in February 2005 for a total cash consideration of £10m and
£3m of contingent consideration.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
In May 2004 the Group sold 21% of the shares in BASCO to ST Aero,
retaining a 19% shareholding in the company. This holding is now
accounted for as an investment for Group reporting.
In November 2004, the Group expanded the scope of its existing helicopter
joint venture, FBH, investing a further £4.3m.
RESULTS
Group turnover increased by 18.1% to £983.0m (2003 - £832.6m).
Excluding amortisation of goodwill of £20.9m (2003 - £15.8m) and the
Group’s share of joint venture and associate results and for 2003 the
impact of the disposal of Westwind and integration costs, operating proﬁt
increased by 5.6% to £150.5m (2003 - £142.5m). The share of operating
proﬁt from joint ventures and associates before goodwill amortisation 
of £0.1m (2003 - £0.1m) rose from £5.2m in 2003 to £6.4m in 2004.
Selling, distribution and administration costs were 11.9% of turnover
(2003 - 12.7%).
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation increased to £125.9m (2003 -
£54.5m). Profit on ordinary activities before tax, excluding goodwill
amortisation and, for 2003, the loss on the sale of Westwind and
integration costs amounted to £146.9m (2003 - £135.3m). This
represented a 8.6% increase.
Net interest costs, including those of joint ventures, fell from £11.5m to
£10.5m as a result of more effective use of overseas borrowing facilities to
optimise interest rates and the share issue in July 2003.
TAXATION
The tax charge of £40.9m (2003 - £36.0m) on the proﬁt before tax of
£125.9m (2003 - £54.5m) represents a rate of 32.5% (2003 - 66.1%).
Excluding goodwill amortisation of £21.0m (2003 - 15.9m) and, for 2003,
the exceptional loss on the disposal of Westwind and integration costs, the
effective rate for the year would be 27.8% (2003 - 26.6%). This adjusted
tax charge is lower than the prevailing tax rates across the various countries
in which the Group operates, primarily because part of the goodwill charge
is an allowable expense for taxation and a beneﬁt has arisen from the tax
credit for research and development. Further details on the tax charge can
be found in Note 4 of Notes to the Financial Statements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share was 76.0p (2003 - 17.2p) whilst the fully
diluted earnings per share amounted to 75.5p (2003 - 17.1p). After
adjusting for goodwill amortisation and, for 2003 integration costs and the
loss from the disposal of Westwind, underlying earnings per share increased
by 1.4% to 94.8p (2003 - 93.5p).
DIVIDENDS
The directors are recommending a ﬁnal ordinary dividend of 21.8p (2003 -
19.8p) which represents an increase of 10.1% on last year. If approved by
shareholders, this will result in a total dividend of 31.0p per share (2003 -
28.16p), also an increase of 10.1%.
The total ordinary dividend for the year will absorb £34.6m (2003 -
£31.3m), leaving proﬁt/(loss) retained of £50.1m (2003 - £(13.1)m).
FINANCING
During 2004, the Group continued to generate funds and at the year end
the net debt as deﬁned by FRS 1 was £166.1m (2003 - £154.4m). Included
in this ﬁgure are all amounts owing under bank loans, debenture loans,
ﬁnance leases and other borrowings. This level of debt represents a gearing
level of 32.7% (2003 - 33.9%). Net interest cover is at a prudent level of
14.9 times (2003 - 12.8). 2004 net debt is 0.8 times 2004 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The Australian subsidiaries have a number of operating leases for the
provision of aircraft which are used to provide services to third parties
under back to back contracts. During the year the Group converted 15
aircraft utilised for Coastwatch under operating leases to ﬁnance leases.
The Group had three main borrowings outstanding at the end of the year
under the following facilities:
•
The March 1996 private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior notes
which raised US$50m. These notes carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 6.28%
for the seven year notes and 6.42% for the ten year notes. Principal
repayments to date amount to US$25m.

Financial Review continued
•
The October 2002 private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior
notes which raised US$225m. The facility comprises two series of notes
repayable in seven and ten years. As a result of an interest swap the
interest expense varies with LIBOR.
•
The £200m club multi-currency credit agreement which was entered
into in December 2002. The borrowings carry a variable rate of interest.
At the end of 2004 £78.4m had been drawn under this agreement. The
facility reduced to £150m after the ﬁrst year of operation and is
repayable in full in January 2008.
•
In January 2005 the Group entered into a 12 month US$200m facility
to provide short-term ﬁnance for the purchase of Remec and Koch.
CASH FLOW
The Group gives high priority to cash management. It is therefore
particularly pleasing to highlight the operating and free cash flow
generated in 2004 shown in the following summary. The operating cash
ﬂow amounted to £123.4m (2003 - £108.6m), which is 82% (2003 - 76%)
of operating proﬁt (excluding the impact of goodwill amortisation, the
proﬁts from joint ventures and associates and, for 2003, the impact of the
disposal of Westwind and integration costs). £92.9m (2003 - £77.3m) of
free cash ﬂow was generated.
Control over working capital continues to be a major focus within the
operating companies. As was the case in recent years, a substantial
proportion of the year’s business was invoiced in the latter part of 2004
due, in part, to the defence procurement cycle.
Stock turns at the end of 2004 were 3.7 times (2003 - 3.2 times).
Trade debtor days at the end of 2004 were 56 days (2003 - 54 days).
The impact of acquisitions was to increase debtors by £7.9m and stocks 
by £8.9m.
Further detail relating to the cash ﬂows and movements in net debt of the
Group is given in Notes 22, 23 and 24 of Notes to the Financial Statements.
PENSIONS
The Group adopted FRS 17 during 2003 as it is regarded as being a more
prescriptive accounting treatment than SSAP 24 and we consider that the
greater transparency and consistency offered are signiﬁcant beneﬁts.
During 2004 the Group made contributions to its deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
of £7.3m in excess of the operating proﬁt charge as assessed under FRS 17.
Cobham remains committed to the support of the pension schemes within
the Group and has worked with the trustees of those schemes to ensure
that funding issues are dealt with appropriately.
During 2004 triennial actuarial valuations were completed for both the
main Cobham scheme and the Chelton multi-employer scheme. The
outcomes of these reports have been reviewed with the relevant scheme
trustees and appropriate action plans developed.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
The Group’s aim has been to reduce, or eliminate where practical, foreign
exchange risk. The pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate is the most
important as far as the Group is concerned.This is primarily due to the level
of US dollars which the UK and European subsidiaries expect to receive
from their business activities, as certain global aerospace and defence
contracts are denominated in US dollars. Equally, some exposure arises
from operating companies based in the USA, offset partially by dollar
denominated borrowings. All signiﬁcant foreign exchange transactions are
approved by the parent company. In addition to the structured borrowing,
a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign
exchange exposure, such as forward rate contracts and options.
Details of the most signiﬁcant of these are described in note 26 of Notes
to the Financial Statements. At the end of 2003, the Group adopted a
policy of managing its potential exposure on a twelve month rolling basis.
As a consequence, the majority of the anticipated exposure to US dollars in
the UK and European subsidiaries is hedged at an average rate of 1.68 for
sterling and 1.23 for Euros respectively for 2005.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s ﬁnances are sound and the balance sheet remains strong.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement
at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements that there is a reasonable
expectation that the company and the Group as a whole have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements.

The Group’s employment policies include a commitment to equal opportunities regardless of sex, race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin, disability, and
other forms of discrimination.With regard to employees who become disabled, the policy is to take all reasonable steps, including retraining, to ensure that
they can remain in employment wherever practicable.
The importance of employee development and training is recognised and Group businesses are required to encourage employees to take advantage of
available and relevant training programmes and opportunities for advancement.
The Group encourages employee participation and consultation at all levels and also the sharing of relevant business information. Such an approach
facilitates the development of new ideas and practices that add value to the business, promotes team member commitment and helps to focus company
and employee expectations. In-house newsletters, intranet, extranet and internet communications, company announcements and team meetings all play
a part in this process.
UK employees are given the opportunity to become shareholders in the company through the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2004).
In addition, a new share scheme, the Cobham Share Incentive Plan, is being implemented which will enable employees of UK participating companies to
buy Cobham shares out of pre-tax income.

Corporate Governance
This part of the annual report, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 34 to 40, describes how the company has both applied
the principles contained in the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in July 2003 (the Code) and complied with the provisions

BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board comprises a non-executive chairman (Gordon Page), a chief executive (Allan Cook), four other executive directors and four other non-executive
directors of whom Mike Smith is recognised as the senior independent director. Mike Smith, who has been a non-executive director since 1996 and is
coming to the end of his third three year term, will retire at the forthcoming AGM and will not seek re-election. His replacement will be announced in due
course. All non-executive directors, with the exception of the chairman, are considered to be independent. Biographies of the directors, giving details of their
experience and other main commitments, are set out on page 27 of the annual report and in relation to those directors offering themselves for 
re-election at the AGM, in the accompanying shareholder circular.The wide ranging experience and backgrounds of the non-executive directors enable them
to debate and constructively challenge management in relation to both the development of strategy and the performance of the Group. Attendance at
Board and committee meetings is set out in the following table:

All directors attended the AGM in June 2004. In the few instances where a director was unable to attend a Board or committee meeting, his comments on the papers to be
considered at that meeting were passed in advance to the relevant chairman.
1
Allan Cook did not attend a meeting of the nomination committee which resulted in a recommendation to re-elect him.
2
Geoff Cooper, by prior agreement, represented the company at an important event and was, as a result, unable to attend one Board meeting.
3
Peter Hooley did not attend one Board meeting as the date clashed with a Smith & Nephew plc board meeting.
4
Marcus Beresford joined the Board on 1 March 2004. He was unable to attend one Board meeting as a result of commitments which he had made prior to joining the Board.
Non-executive directors are appointed for speciﬁed terms of three years which can be extended by agreement provided that the individual’s performance
continues to be effective. All non-executives have conﬁrmed they will have sufﬁcient time to meet what is expected of them and copies of their
appointment letters are available on request to the company secretary. Under the company’s articles of association, directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM after their appointment. Under the articles at each AGM one third of the directors who are subject to retirement by rotation
must retire and any director must retire if he was not elected or re-elected at either of the previous two AGMs. The nomination committee report on 
page 31 explains the process for selection of directors and succession planning.
The chairman is, among other things, responsible for chairing Board meetings and leading the Board. The chief executive’s responsibilities include
operational performance and the achievement of strategic aims. The Board’s policy is that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be performed
by different people. The division of responsibilities between the chairman’s role and that of the chief executive is documented and clearly understood and
no conﬂicts arise, in the directors’ view, from the fact that the chairman held, until 2001, the position of chief executive. The senior independent director’s
responsibilities include the provision of an additional channel of communication between the chairman and the non-executive directors and another point
of contact for shareholders if they have reasons for concern which communication through the normal channels of chairman, chief executive or group
ﬁnancial director has failed to resolve, or where these contacts are inappropriate.
Directors and ofﬁcers of the company and its subsidiaries have the beneﬁt of a directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance policy. All directors can take
independent legal advice at the company’s expense within set limits in furtherance of their duties. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   31
THE BOARD AND ITS PROCEEDINGS
Scheduled meetings of the Board take place eight times a year and otherwise as required.There is regular contact between meetings to progress the Group’s
business. Whilst meetings take place primarily at Wimborne they are also held at other operational locations in the UK. In addition, meetings take place
between the non-executives in the absence of the chairman and/or the executive directors.
The Board’s role is to lead the Group with a view to the creation of a strong, sustainable ﬁnancial performance and long-term shareholder value. In doing
so, it reviews and agrees Group strategy, ensures that the necessary resources are in place, monitors management performance and supervises the conduct
of the Group’s activities within a framework of prudent and effective internal controls.
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its speciﬁc approval. The schedule provides the framework for those decisions which can be made
by the Board and those which can be delegated either to committees or otherwise. Among the key matters on which the Board alone may make decisions
are the Group’s business strategy, its ﬁve year plan, its consolidated budget, Group policies, dividends, acquisitions and disposals, and all Board
appointments and removals. Authority is delegated to management on a structured basis in accordance with the provisions of the Corporate Framework
ensuring that proper management oversight exists at the appropriate level. Matters delegated in this way include, within deﬁned parameters, the approval
of bids and contracts, capital expenditures and ﬁnancing arrangements.
The Board has adopted procedures relating to conduct of its business, including the timely provision of information, and the company secretary is
responsible for ensuring that these are observed and for advising the Board on corporate governance matters.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board is supported in its work by a number of committees. Information relating to the nomination and audit committees appears below and the
activities of the remuneration committee are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 40. John Pope, company secretary, acts as
secretary to all Board committees. The appropriate committee chairman provides an oral report on the work undertaken by his committee at the following
Board meeting and committee meeting minutes are circulated to all Board members. The executive committee meets on eight occasions during the year
and develops the Group’s strategy for Board consideration and approval, makes recommendations as to acquisitions and disposals, reviews operational
activities and manages the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. Membership of the committee comprises all the executive directors and the chief executive
is the committee’s chairman.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Gordon Page, chairman of the company, is the chairman of this committee. The other members of the committee are Mike Smith, Jeff Edington, Allan Cook,
Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford (appointed 1 March 2004). The majority of the members of the committee are independent. Details of their
qualiﬁcations and experience are set out on page 27. During the year the committee met formally on two occasions.
The committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are available on the company’s website or on application to the company
secretary. The committee’s main duties are to review the structure, size and composition of the Board, to consider succession planning for directors and
other senior executives and to identify and nominate for Board approval candidates to ﬁll Board vacancies. The committee dealt with all of these matters
during the year and, in addition, made recommendations regarding the re-election of certain directors at the 2004 AGM, directors’ time commitments and
was engaged in the recruitment of new independent non-executive directors with the assistance of external recruitment consultants.
Marcus Beresford was appointed a director during the year after a referral by external recruitment consultants followed by meetings with committee
members and, subsequently, the other members of the Board.
DIRECTORS’ PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On appointment, directors undertake a structured induction programme where they receive information about the operations and activities of the Group,
the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its decision, the company’s corporate governance practices and procedures and their duties,
responsibilities and obligations as directors of a listed public limited company. This is supplemented by visits to key locations and meetings with senior
executives.
Training for directors is available as required through attendance at externally provided courses or in-house seminars. In addition, directors’ knowledge of
the legal and regulatory environment is updated through the provision of information by the Group’s advisers and by means of reports from the company
secretary.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the year, performance evaluations of the Board, the major Board committees and individual directors were carried out with the assistance of 
Edis-Bates Associates. The evaluation process involved interviews with all directors and the company secretary, the completion of questionnaires and the
preparation of a Board performance evaluation report which focused on the Board’s role, people issues affecting the Board, processes and the Board
committees.
The report was considered by the Board and speciﬁc recommendations were agreed and are being implemented. 32 COBHAM PLC
Corporate Governance continued
FINANCIAL REPORTING
In the directors’ view, the Annual Report and Accounts for 2004, together with the Interim and other reports made during 2004, present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The Directors’ Report on going concern is included in the Financial Review on page 24.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group operates under a system of internal controls which has been developed and reﬁned over time to meet its needs and the risks and opportunities
to which it is exposed. These controls are contained in the Corporate Framework, which was revised and reissued during the year, and the Group Finance
Manual. They include a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget which is approved by the Board and monitored monthly, the regular
revision of forecasts for the year, a strategic planning process involving the preparation of a ﬁve year plan and the appropriate delegation of authorities to
operational management.
Risk management is an integral part of the system of internal control and is considered to be key to the Group’s success. Divisional managing directors are
required to ensure that appropriate processes exist to identify and manage risks and, as part of the ﬁve year planning exercise, to carry out formal risk
assessments regularly. The executive committee undertakes a top-level review of signiﬁcant risks and reports regularly to the Board on their mitigation. In
addition, the audit committee monitors the adequacy of internal ﬁnancial controls and compliance with Group standards through a self-assessment
process involving all subsidiaries, supplemented by regular risk assurance reviews and visits.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control the aim of which is to manage risks that are signiﬁcant to the fulﬁlment of the Group’s
business objectives and to contribute to the safeguarding of shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets. It is also responsible for reviewing the
effectiveness of the system. However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. This process, which
has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and ﬁnancial statements, is regularly reviewed and accords
with the guidance for directors on internal control issued by the Turnbull committee.
The Board receives reports on a regular basis from the executive and the audit committee in relation to the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal
control and has, accordingly, reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control in respect of 2004.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The chairman of the committee is Peter Hooley. He is an independent director and the Board is satisﬁed, since he is also a ﬁnance director of a FTSE 100
company and a chartered accountant, that he has ‘relevant and recent ﬁnancial experience’ as required by the Code.
The other members of the committee, all of whom are independent directors, are Mike Smith, Jeff Edington and Marcus Beresford (appointed 1 March
2004). Details of their qualiﬁcations and experience are set out on page 27. During the year the committee met on three occasions.
The committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are available on the company’s website or on application to the company
secretary. The committee’s main duties are to monitor the integrity of the company’s ﬁnancial statements and any formal announcements relating to its
ﬁnancial performance, to consider the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems, to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
audit activities, to make recommendations as to the appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors and to monitor and
review the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process.
Meetings of the committee are normally attended by the company chairman, the group ﬁnancial director, senior employees with responsibilities in relation
to ﬁnance and internal control, and the external auditors. In addition, the committee regularly holds sessions with the external auditors in the absence of
executive management. Attendance of non-members is at the discretion and by invitation of the committee.
At each of its meetings the committee considered reports from the external auditors and also on internal controls and risk assurance. Management
generated reports were also considered on a number of matters including the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, taxation, banking
facilities, corporate governance and whistleblowing procedures.
The committee believes that the current arrangements comprising a programme of internal ﬁnancial control review visits to subsidiaries by head ofﬁce
personnel, business reviews carried out by the chief executive and group ﬁnancial director and a process of self assessment of internal ﬁnancial controls by
all subsidiaries provides appropriate internal audit coverage of the Group’s activities. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   33
The committee and the external auditors have safeguards to avoid the possible compromise of the auditors’ objectivity and independence. These include
the adoption by the committee of a policy regarding the supply of audit and non-audit services and of a policy on the employment of external audit staff.
Non-audit services involving the review of interim ﬁnancial information, tax services and accounting advice, and acquisition-related due diligence can be
supplied subject to pre-approval by the committee where the cost of any individual engagement exceeds a pre-deﬁned limit. The committee has also
received reports from the external auditors conﬁrming their independence and objectivity.
Fees paid to the external auditors during the year ended 31 December 2004 are set out in Note 2 of Notes to the Financial Statements.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
During the year the chief executive and group ﬁnancial director held regular meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and investors to discuss
information made public by the Group and in June they, along with divisional managing directors, held an investor day, at which presentations were given
on strategy, programmes and ﬁnancial performance.
Presentations were made on the announcement of the preliminary and interim results. The slides used and web casts were made accessible 
on-line at www.cobham.com. A conference call with analysts was made following the announcement of the agreement to acquire Remec Defense and
Space just before the year end.
The chairman wrote to a number of major shareholders during the year reminding them of his availability, and that of Mike Smith, the senior independent
director, should there be issues which they might wish to raise. They were also offered the opportunity to meet Marcus Beresford, the non-executive
director appointed during the year.
The Board is kept informed of investors’ views through the distribution of analysts’ circulars, the receipt of regular reports from the company’s brokers and
updates from the chief executive and group ﬁnancial director. Correspondence with shareholders is also made available and, following the year end, a survey
of shareholder opinion was commissioned.
Communication with shareholders takes place via RNS announcements, the company’s website, the annual and interim reports and the AGM. The AGM is
attended by all directors and shareholders have the opportunity to hear a statement as to progress made during the year, to question the Board on its
stewardship of the company and to meet directors informally.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENTS
Statements by the directors and the auditors relating to their responsibility for preparing the accounts and reporting respectively are set out on pages 41
to 43.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Independent non-executives, excluding the chairman, made up less than half of the Board. Accordingly, the Board did not fully comply with the provisions
of the Code in 2004. The company is currently seeking additional independent non-executives with a view to achieving equality with the executive
directors. 34 COBHAM PLC
Directors’Remuneration Report
This report provides the information required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). It also describes how the company
applies the principles of the Code in relation to remuneration. The report has been approved by the Board and shareholder approval will be sought at the
forthcoming AGM.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Mike Smith is the chairman of this committee. The other committee members are Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford (appointed 1 March
2004). All members are independent non-executives. Details of their qualiﬁcations and experience are set out on page 27. The committee met on ﬁve
occasions during 2004 and information on director attendance is set out in the table on page 30.
The committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are available on the company’s website or on application to the company
secretary. The committee’s main duties are to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policies on executive directors’ remuneration and to
determine, on the Board’s behalf, the speciﬁc remuneration packages of the chairman, executive directors and a number of senior executives. The
committee consults with the chief executive, but not in respect of his own remuneration, and has access to professional advice from New Bridge Street
Consultants (NBSC) and reports in relation to total shareholder return monitoring from Inbucon. NBSC, who were appointed by the committee, also
provided advice during the year to the company in relation to a new share incentive plan for UK employees generally and in relation to a new executive
share option scheme.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Board’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain executive directors of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive salary and beneﬁt packages,
increasingly linked to performance. In particular, the executive pay policy for the current and subsequent ﬁnancial years is designed to retain those
executives with the skills and experience necessary to enable the Group to achieve its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations. More speciﬁcally, the
current strategy is to position base salaries around the median of the market and to provide an opportunity to enhance cash remuneration through a
competitive bonus plan if performance so warrants through the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions. The committee conﬁrms that a
signiﬁcant element of potential remuneration is performance linked. Remuneration is also linked to performance through participation in share incentive
schemes, which ensures that executive directors’ interests are closely aligned with shareholders’ interests. The chairman of the company ensures that the
company, through the committee, maintains contact with its principal shareholders about remuneration matters. To this end, the committee consulted
during the year in connection with the introduction of the new executive share option scheme which was duly approved at the 2004 AGM.
BASE SALARY
The committee reviews base salaries annually, generally in November, to take effect from 1 January of the following year. When reviewing salaries the
committee assesses individual responsibilities, experience, performance and personal objectives and considers external market data, internal relativities and
other factors relevant to the company and the industry. No increase to Andy Stevens’s base salary was made during the year in view of his appointment in
November 2003.
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS
The company operates an annual cash bonus scheme for its executive directors. Bonuses are awarded by the committee having regard for the performance
of the Group, the individual and, in the case of directors with speciﬁc subsidiary company responsibilities, the performance of the relevant subsidiaries.
Bonuses in respect of 2004 were capped at 60% of base salary, 75% of which was determined by ﬁnancial performance. For 2005, the committee, as part
of its review of the effectiveness of the company’s remuneration policy, has decided that the maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors
should be increased to 80% of base salary to bring it into line with market practice. Of this, 81% will be determined by ﬁnancial performance.
In the cases of Allan Cook and Warren Tucker the constituent elements of their bonus plans relate to earnings per share (EPS) growth, cash generation
against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives. In the cases of Geoff Cooper, Andy Stevens and Alex Hannam, the constituent elements of
their bonus plans relate to EPS growth, proﬁt against budget for the group of subsidiary companies for which they are operationally responsible, cash
generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives.
In changing the bonus scheme, the committee took the opportunity to increase the potential awards for growth in EPS and toughened the targets for cash
and proﬁt generation.
Personal objectives for the other executive directors are set by Allan Cook. Personal objectives for Allan Cook are set by Gordon Page. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   35
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Following a review of long-term incentive arrangements, the committee changed its approach to the provision of long-term incentives during the year. As
a result, a combination of share awards under the Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan and grants of share options under the Cobham Executive Share Option
Scheme (2004) may be made to directors and other senior executives. In order to ensure that the aggregate award levels are not excessive, the aggregate
value of shares awarded to any individual (excluding senior executives in the US) under the above share schemes in any year is not to exceed 1.5 times base
salary unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example, the recruitment or promotion of a senior executive.
COBHAM LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Under the LTIP, which was approved by shareholders in 1997, awards to acquire Cobham ordinary shares at nil cost are made to participants up to a
maximum annual value of 75% of base salary. During 2004, awards were made to 22 main Board and subsidiary company directors and senior executives.
The extent to which awards vest under the LTIP is based on the company’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a comparator group comprising
companies in the FTSE engineering and machinery sector and the aerospace and defence sector. The committee believes that the use of TSR as a
performance measure is justiﬁed because it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared to those
companies in the comparator group (see below). Awards vest in full at upper quartile performance over the three year performance period and 30% of
awards vest at median performance. There is a sliding scale vesting between median and upper quartile performance and no awards vest if performance is
below median. In addition, no awards vest unless the company’s EPS growth has exceeded inﬂation by an average of 3% p.a. over three years. That part of
an award which has not satisﬁed the performance conditions over the three year performance period will lapse i.e. there is no re-testing of the performance
condition.
The committee will ensure that EPS is calculated on as consistent basis as is feasible following the transition to International Accounting Standards and that
any arbitrary results are avoided.
In assessing whether performance conditions have been met, the committee relies upon performance status and veriﬁcation reports prepared by Inbucon.
In 2004, the company achieved sixteenth position out of a total of 30 companies in its comparator group and, as a result, the awards made in 2001 did not
vest. The companies which comprise the comparator group for the LTIP award made to directors in 2004 are as follows:
AGA Foodservice Group plc; Alvis plc; BAE SYSTEMS PLC; Bodycote International plc; Castings PLC; Charter plc; Chemring Group PLC; Cookson Group plc;
domnick hunter group plc; Enodis plc; Fenner PLC; FKI plc; Halma p.l.c.; Hill & Smith Holdings PLC; IMI plc; Kidde plc; Meggitt PLC; Metalrax Group PLC;
Molins PLC; The Morgan Crucible Company plc; Rolls-Royce plc; Rotork p.l.c.; Senior plc; Severﬁeld-Rowen Plc; Smiths Group plc; Spirax-Sarco Engineering
plc; Tomkins plc; Ultra Electronics Holdings plc; UMECO plc; The Vitec Group plc; VT Group plc and The Weir Group PLC.
The committee is considering whether the current way of identifying membership of the comparator group for LTIP awards remains appropriate.
COBHAM EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME (2004) (ESOS)
The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM and includes an ‘Approved’ part, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, and an
‘Unapproved’ part which is not designed for Inland Revenue approval. Options to acquire Cobham ordinary shares may be made to participants up to a
maximum annual value of 100% of base salary. Options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the company’s ordinary shares on, or shortly
before, the date an option is granted. During 2004, options were granted to 98 directors and senior executives. The exercise of options will be conditional
upon the company’s underlying EPS growth exceeding inﬂation by a speciﬁed margin over a three year period. No part of an option will become exercisable
unless the company’s EPS growth over the period exceeds inﬂation by at least 3% per annum on average. If average growth in EPS in excess of inﬂation
over three years is between 3% and 5% per annum, calculated on a compound basis, shares under option with a value between 50%–100% of the
participant’s base salary will become exercisable. If average EPS growth exceeds 5% per annum, the option will become exercisable in full. There will be no
provision for re-testing of the performance condition if it is not met after three years. EPS growth is considered by the committee to be an appropriate
measure of the company’s performance for the purposes of the ESOS as it is based upon underlying ﬁnancial performance.
The committee will ensure that EPS is calculated on a consistent basis following the move to International Accounting Standards as mentioned above.
OTHER SHARE SCHEMES AND HEADROOM
A new savings related share option scheme was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM and was operated during the year. Executive directors are
permitted to participate in this scheme on the same terms as other UK employees. The scheme operates within speciﬁc tax legislation (including a
requirement to ﬁnance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract).
The company is in the course of implementing a new Inland Revenue approved all-employee share scheme, the Cobham Share Incentive Plan. Executive
directors are permitted to participate in this scheme, which has been approved by shareholders, on the same terms as other UK employees. This scheme
operates within speciﬁc tax legislation and enables participants to buy Cobham ordinary shares out of pre-tax income.
Consistent with the legislation and normal practice, neither of these schemes requires the imposition of pre-vesting performance conditions.
There are limits relating to the issue of shares in any ten year period in connection with the all employee share schemes and also the discretionary
employee share schemes (i.e. the LTIP and the executive share option schemes). These are 10% and 5% of the company’s issued share capital respectively.
As at the year end, 7.6m (6.8%) and 3.2m (2.9%) shares have been, or may be, issued pursuant to awards made in the previous ten years. 36 COBHAM PLC

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
This graph illustrates the performance of the company against a ‘broad equity market index’ over the past ﬁve years.As the company has been a constituent
of the FTSE 350 index throughout this period, that index is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index against which performance
should be graphed. Performance is measured by reference to TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid).
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
This graph looks at the value, by the end of 2004, of £100 invested in Cobham on 31 December 1999 compared with that
of £100 invested in the FTSE 350 Index. The other points plotted are the values at interim ﬁnancial year-ends.
DIRECTORS’ PENSIONS
Executive directors, with the exception of Geoff Cooper, participate in the Cobham Executives’ Pension Plan (the Plan). The Plan provides beneﬁts on ﬁnal
pay principles against a normal pension age of 60 subject to actuarial reduction for earlier retirement. Pension accrues at 1/30th of pensionable earnings,
i.e. base salary, for each year of service and participants contribute at the rate of 7% of pensionable earnings.
All pensions in payment relating to post April 1997 rights are increased in line with the retail prices index, subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a
maximum of 5% per annum, with the balance of pension being increased at 3% per annum. On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable
earnings is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two thirds of the member’s prospective pension. On death after retirement, a spouse’s pension is
paid at the rate of two thirds of the member’s pre-commutation pension. Similar spouse’s pensions are payable on the death of a deferred pensioner prior
to retirement.
The pension beneﬁts of directors who are members of the Plan are restricted by the Inland Revenue’s earnings cap. Contributions in respect of such
members, with the exception of Warren Tucker, are paid into funded unapproved retirement beneﬁt schemes (FURBS) and details of the amounts paid are
set out in table 2(B) on page 38. Cash payments in lieu of contributions to a FURBS are made to Warren Tucker as mentioned in the notes to table 1 on
page 37. Following Gordon Page’s retirement as an executive director, no further contributions have been paid into his FURBS.The policy in respect of newly
appointed directors is that contributions should normally be 2% of annual basic salary per month.
The committee will review the current pension arrangements in the light of the tax changes due to come into effect in April 2006. In undertaking the review
the committee will consider all relevant factors, including the views of institutional investors.
Details of directors’ pension beneﬁts as required by the Regulations are set out in table 2(A) on page 38.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Board’s policy on setting notice periods for new directors is that these should not normally exceed one year. It recognises, however, that it may be
necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer a longer initial notice period which would subsequently reduce to one year. The service
contracts of Allan Cook (dated 13 June 2001), Geoff Cooper (dated 1 June 1989) and Alex Hannam (dated 13 February 2003) are terminable on one year’s
notice by either party. Warren Tucker’s and Andy Stevens’ service contracts (both of which are dated 1 January 2004) are terminable on one year’s notice
by,and six months’ notice to, the company. With the exception of Geoff Cooper’s contract, these contracts provide for automatic termination on the
director attaining retirement age, i.e. 60. Geoff Cooper’s contract does not contain an expiry date.
The company may elect to terminate directors’ service contracts by making payments in lieu of notice. Such payments are calculated by reference to the
base salary otherwise payable during the notice period. Payments in respect of annual bonus for the relevant periods may also be payable. In the case of
Warren Tucker, any payment in lieu of notice shall include a sum equal to the value of his annual beneﬁts. The company recognises and endorses the
obligation of departing directors to mitigate their own losses.
No executive director currently holds a non-executive directorship with any other company.
PERSONAL SHAREHOLDING
Executive directors are encouraged to acquire and hold, over time, Cobham ordinary shares to the value of at least one year’s salary.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The independent non-executive directors do not have service contracts. Mike Smith, Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford have been appointed
pursuant to letters dated 14 March 1996, 12 August 1996, 10 May 2002 and 29 January 2004 respectively. Subject to appointment or re-appointment by
shareholders in the interim, the current terms will expire at the 2005 AGM, 30 September 2005, 12 June 2005 and 28 February 2007 respectively. No
compensation is payable in the events of their appointments being terminated. Each of them has, together with Gordon Page, given an undertaking that
he will have sufﬁcient time to meet what is expected of him as a director. Under Gordon Page’s letter of appointment, six months’ notice of termination is
required to be given by either party.
A committee of the Board comprising Allan Cook and Warren Tucker is responsible for determining the remuneration of the independent non-executives.
With effect from 1 January 2005, and in recognition of the increasing demands being placed on them, the annual fee was increased from £20,000 to
£25,000, per annum. In addition, the additional fee payable to the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees was increased from £2,000 to
£5,000 per annum. Fees in respect of the services of Peter Hooley are paid to Smith & Nephew plc. Gordon Page receives an annual fee of £160,000 which
is ﬁxed until 30 November 2006. Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the company’s share schemes, pension schemes or bonus
arrangements with the exception of Gordon Page who has deferred beneﬁts under the Plan.

Gordon Page reached normal retirement age in 2003 but has yet to receive any beneﬁt from the Plan. The accrued pension shown reﬂects his entitlement at normal
retirement age increased by an actuarial factor to allow for the deferment of beneﬁts.
The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the ﬁnancial year. The transfer values
represent the present value of future payments from the pension plan rather than remuneration currently due to the individual and cannot be meaningfully
aggregated with annual remuneration. Members of the pension plan have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions. Neither the contributions
nor the resulting beneﬁts are included in the above.
Under Inland Revenue regulations, members’ retirement beneﬁts may be reduced on account of retained beneﬁts from previous employments.
Inﬂation during 2004 has been taken to be 2.8% being the statutory increase to deferred pensions from 2003 to 2004.
Transfer values payable are calculated in accordance with Section 4 ‘Minimum Cash Equivalent’ of Guidance Note 11 issued by the Institute and Faculty 
of Actuaries.

J D M Smith Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
10 March 2005 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   41
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the auditors set out overleaf, is made with a view to distinguishing for
shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and the Group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss for the ﬁnancial year.
The directors consider that in preparing the ﬁnancial statements on pages 44 to 74 the company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently
applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have
been followed. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the ﬁnancial position of
the company and which enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 42 COBHAM PLC
Independent Auditors’ Report
TO THE MEMBERS OF COBHAM PLC
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the Consolidated Proﬁt and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds, the related notes and the
accounting policies set out in the statement of Accounting Policies. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report (‘the auditable part‘).
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ Remuneration
Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the Directors' Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, the Business Review, the statement on Corporate Social Responsibility, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the statement on
Corporate Governance and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
We review whether the statement on Corporate Governance reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. It also includes
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   43
OPINION
In our opinion:
•
the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the Group at 31 December 2004 and of the proﬁt and cash
ﬂows of the Group for the year then ended;
•

Accounting Policies
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by
the revaluation of certain ﬁxed assets. Compliance with SSAP 19 ‘Accounting for Investment Properties’ requires departure from the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and an explanation of the departure is given in the tangible ﬁxed assets accounting policy note below.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the parent company and of all its subsidiaries made up to the end of the ﬁnancial year.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method in accordance with FRS 9 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’. Associates are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting.
Businesses acquired are accounted for as acquisitions, with effect from the date control passes. Those disposed of are accounted for up until the point of
their disposal.
TURNOVER
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration and is generally recognised when goods are despatched or services delivered and
excludes intercompany sales, value added tax and other sales taxes. In the case of long-term contracts, turnover is recognised based upon the fair value of
work performed to date.
PENSIONS
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes the amounts charged to operating proﬁt are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁt and loss account if the beneﬁts have vested. If the
beneﬁts have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. The interest cost and expected return on assets are
shown as a net amount of other ﬁnance costs or credits adjacent to interest.Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
Other than mainland Europe schemes, deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in
separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the
scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting deﬁned beneﬁt asset
or liability, net of the related deferred tax is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
For deﬁned contribution schemes the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement beneﬁts is the
contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on all timing differences which have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date calculated at
rates of tax expected to apply, based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences represent accumulated differences between the company's taxable
proﬁt and its ﬁnancial proﬁt and arise primarily from the recognition of the provision for the deﬁcit on the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes and
the difference between accelerated capital allowances and depreciation. Deferred tax liabilities have not been discounted.
INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures made after 1 January 1998 and expenditure on other intangible ﬁxed assets
comprising patents, licences and trade marks is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 20 years. These periods
have been determined after taking into account the nature of the intangible assets acquired and the markets in which these intangible assets operate.
In accordance with the Group's accounting policy prior to the introduction of FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 has been
written off to reserves, but will be charged to the proﬁt and loss account on any subsequent disposal of the business to which it is related. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   45
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Freehold land and investment properties are not depreciated. Other ﬁxed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis to their estimated residual values
over their estimated useful lives. These lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold properties – The period of the lease
Other ﬁxed assets – 3 to 15 years.
In accordance with SSAP 19, investment properties are held at open market value. Any aggregate surplus or deﬁcit on revaluation is transferred to a
revaluation reserve, and no provision is made for depreciation of freehold properties. This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985,
which requires all properties to be depreciated, is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the ﬁnancial statements to show a true and fair view in
accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The depreciation (which would, had the provisions of the Act been followed, have reduced proﬁt for the year) is only one of the factors reﬂected in the
annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identiﬁed or quantiﬁed.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
AIRCRAFT ENGINE OVERHAUL EXPENDITURE
Expenditure is capitalised when it is incurred on aircraft engine overhauls and this ﬁxed asset addition is depreciated over its useful economic life.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenditure not chargeable to customers is written off as incurred.
FINANCE LEASES
Where assets are ﬁnanced by lease agreements that give rights approximating to ownership (ﬁnance leases), the assets are treated as if they had been
purchased outright and the corresponding leasing commitments are shown as an obligation under ﬁnance leases. The relevant assets are depreciated on
the basis of expected utilisation over the shorter of the life of the contract on which they are employed or the life of the lease. Lease payments are treated
as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the proﬁt and loss account in proportion to the outstanding capital
commitment.
OPERATING LEASES
Operating lease payments for assets leased from third parties are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on an accruals basis.
STOCKS
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost, which includes an appropriate proportion of productive overheads, and net realisable value.
Payments received and receivable on account of work in progress are deducted from the cost of the work carried out at the balance sheet date to the extent
of the valuation of the work done. 46 COBHAM PLC
Accounting Policies continued
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward cover contracts have been
arranged, at the contracted rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denoted in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance
sheet date or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences arising are taken to the proﬁt and loss account.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Proﬁt and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year. Exchange differences arising on these
translations are taken to reserves.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements and forward currency contracts.
Receipts and payments on ﬁnancial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instruments. Finance costs associated with debt
issuances are charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the life of the instruments. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004   47

4TAX ON PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES 
£m 2004 2003
Current tax:
UK corporation tax on profits of the year 21.9 18.1
Share of joint ventures’ and associates’ tax 1.3 1.0
Overseas tax on profits of the year 15.3 14.7
Adjustments in respect of previous years (2.1) (0.5)
Total current tax 36.4 33.3
Deferred tax:
Origination and reversal of timing differences 4.4 5.1
Adjustments in respect of previous years 0.1 (2.4)
Total deferred tax 4.5 2.7
Tax on profit on ordinary activities 40.9 36.0
Excluding goodwill amortisation of £21.0m (2003 - £15.9m), the prior year tax credit of £2.0m (2003 - £2.9m) and the exceptional loss on disposal relating to 2003 of £nil
(2003 - £64.1m), the effective rate for the year is 29.2% (2003 - 28.9%). This adjusted tax charge is lower than the prevailing rates principally because part of the goodwill
charge is an allowable expense for tax purposes and some Group expenditure on research and development qualifies for additional tax credit.
The tax assessed for the year is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% (2003 - 30%). The differences are explained below:
£m 2004 2003
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 125.9 54.5
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate in the UK 30% (2003 - 30%) 37.8 16.3
Effects of:
Tax disallowed items (2004 – primarily goodwill amortisation; 2003 – primarily exceptional loss and goodwill amortisation) 3.5 21.3
Capital allowances for year in excess of depreciation (1.0) (0.2)
Other timing differences (3.4) (4.9)
Overseas tax rates higher than UK rates 2.7 2.0
Expenditure qualifying for additional R&D tax deduction (1.1) (0.7)
Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years (2.1) (0.5)
Current tax charge for the year 36.4 33.3
Factors that may affect future tax charges:
The Group’s effective rate of current tax on underlying profits is expected to be lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK primarily because of timing differences
arising on fixed assets and because some of the goodwill amortisation is an allowable deduction for tax purposes. The group expects that this will remain broadly unchanged
in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value. Also, no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of
overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, being 111,448,271 (2003 - 105,941,221). The weighted average number of ordinary shares used 
for the fully diluted earnings per share is 112,222,295 (2003 - 106,622,128).

Pensions
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world mainly with assets held in separate trustee
administered funds.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme. In the USA, both the Carleton Technologies and Stanley Aviation
defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members from 31 December 2003 and 31 January 2004 respectively. Since the majority of the defined benefit schemes
operated by the Group are closed to new entrants, the age profile of the schemes’ in service membership will increase over time. Under the funding method prescribed by
FRS17, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

FRS 17 assumptions 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan (CPP). A full valuation of the CPP scheme was undertaken as
at 1 April 2004 and updated to 31 December 2004 by a qualified independent actuary. During the period, the employer contributions to the CPP were 17.3% and this rate
will continue in 2005.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries of the Group schemes in respect of FRS 17 were as follows:

Defined contribution schemes
Contributions paid by the Group to defined contribution schemes in the year amounted to £5.7m (2003 - £6.4m). There were no significant contributions outstanding at the
end of either 2003 or 2004.
Parent Company 
The contributions paid by the company are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities
of the scheme. The cost of contributions to the Group scheme for 2004 amounted to £1.8m (2003 - £0.9m), comprising £0.2m (2003 - £0.2m) of funding related to benefits
accruing in the year and £1.6m (2003 - £0.7m) of additional funding in order to reduce the scheme deficit. Contributions for current benefit accruals represent 18.8% of
pensionable salary (2003 - 12.5%). No contributions to the scheme were outstanding at the end of either 2003 or 2004.

Included within the £10.9m fair value of assets acquired are assets relating to the Spectronic acquisition of £2.6m for which the valuation is provisional. This provisional
valuation is due to the size of the acquisition and its proximity to the year end. As a result, further fair value adjustment may be required in 2005.
Fair value adjustments
Revaluations
The adjustments to stocks represent the increase in provisions against excess stocks and demonstration stocks. The adjustment to creditors and provisions reflects accruals for
dilapidation expense and provision for warranty claims offset by the deferred tax implications of the fair value adjustments made. The adjustment to pension liabilities reflects
pension deficits acquired.
Accounting policies 
The adjustment to intangible fixed assets reflects the write-off of items in line with Group policy.
26 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Set out below are the narrative disclosures relating to financial instruments. The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 27 to 30. The group has taken advantage of the
exemption available under FRS 13 “Derivatives and other financial instruments” not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short term debtors and creditors, other than
currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments 
The Group primarily finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings. The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments. Where it
does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group’s
financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the group’s operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest
rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. 26 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk
and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The policies have remained unchanged throughout
the year.
Foreign currency risk 
The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU countries,
Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to reduce,
or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk. Where significant, currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency
borrowings. Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
The pound/US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive
from their normal business activities. In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position,
such as forward contracts. As at 31 December 2004, US$221m of forward contracts were in place and stretching out to 2014. These contracts are at an average exchange rate
of $1.68: £1. It is the Group’s current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency.
The Group’s policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries’ non operating currencies. However, where this is impractical the Group will seek to reduce its exposure through the
use of forward contracts.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures. Generally, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against
overseas assets.
Interest rate risk 
The Group has various long and short term borrowings principally in sterling and US dollars at fixed and floating rates of interest. The Group is continually monitoring its
exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs. Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to
fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions, including instances where interest rate swaps are used.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit. These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk 
The Group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis. For short term working capital purposes
in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement. In the USA a central treasury function is maintained which all 
US subsidiaries use. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders. The private placement
of Cobham guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m in October 2002 enabled the Group to reduce short term and increase long term borrowings. Short-term flexibility
is achieved by overdraft facilities. Details of the year end position, which is in accordance with this policy, are given in note 29. It is, in addition, the Group’s policy to maintain
undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity; details are also given in note 29.

Hedges of foreign currency transactions 
As described above, it is the Group’s policy to partially hedge foreign currency denominated net assets by currency borrowings. As these are not formally matched, the Group
recognises all gains and losses on these in the period they are incurred.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is the amount at
which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes
accrued interest.Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting
expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. For floating rate loans, fair values closely approximate to cost.

Positive results
Summary
Your Board is pleased to report a set of 
encouraging results for 2015 which reflects 
the reduced risk profile of the Group and a 
focus on increasing the capital available to 
the Group to fund a number of advantageous 
acquisitions of corporate members. 
Accordingly the profits before tax, goodwill 
and impairment for the year were £609,000 
(2014: £1,351,000), whilst the adjusted net 
asset value of the Group (Humphrey’ s 
Valuation) has increased to £1.97 per share 
(2014: £1.72) – an increase of 15%.
Helios has been reducing its exposure to the 
underwriting risk on the portfolio for the last 
two years and this reduction is reflected in 
the reduction in profitability this year . Underwriting 
profits of £1.4m (2014: £0.7m) have been ceded 
to reinsurers. In addition the premiums paid for 
Stop Loss cover increased by £300,000.
The net aggregate contribution made from 
acquiring companies at above and below fair 
value reduced from £785,000 to £108,000 
reflecting the more competitive environment 
for the buying of corporate members. The 
Board is committed to being selective on 
the acquisitions made in the future.
• Adjusted net asset value 
increases 15% to £1.97p per 
share (£1.72p) 
• Six acquisitions in 2015 
adding £6.3m of capacity 
to 2015 underwriting year 
– 31% increase
• Two acquisitions agreed 
in 2016 adding £4.6m of 
capacity to 2016 underwriting 
year – 16% increase
• 5.0p per share total 
dividend payable (2014: 5.1p)
Acquisition strategy continues to build the 
fund of capacity.

Strategy
We have continued to implement our strategy 
of building the portfolio of syndicate capacity. 
During the year the key developments were:
 » The profit for the year reflects the 
additional reinsurance cover bought to 
reduce the group exposure to large losses.
 » We have changed the accounting policy 
relating to the amortisation of capacity 
value to hold the capacity at fair value 
in the balance sheet in the future.
 » The management team has been 
strengthened by the appointment 
of an experienced Finance Director, 
Arthur Manners.
Capacity acquired
During the year a further six corporate members 
were acquired that increased the capacity for 
2013 to 2015 years of account, and a further 
two corporate members have been bought 
since 31 December 2015, adding a further 
£4.6m of capacity to the open years. These 
companies have increased the capacity 
underwritten on 2013 to 2016 underwriting 
years as shown below.
2                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 These acquisitions in 2015 and 2016 to date 
were purchased for a total consideration of 
£11m, of which £3m was satisfied by the 
issue of new shares to certain vendors. We 
continue to grow and manage the quality of 
the portfolio of participations on the leading 
Lloyd’s syndicates. 
Underwriting result
The calendar year profits for 2015 have 
been generated from profits recognised in the 
portfolio from the 2013 and 2014 underwriting 
years. During 2015, the 2013 underwriting 
year mid-point estimates increased from 8.1% 
return on capacity to a final result of 14.1%. The 
mid-point estimate for the 2014 underwriting 
year is currently 8.7% and this year has made 
a healthy contribution to the 2015 result. 
As expected, the 2015 underwriting result has 
not made a significant contribution during the 
first 12 months but given the benign claims 
environment for the 2015 underwriting year 
to date, it should provide additional 
recognised profits for the next two 
financial years.
Capacity value
The Board has taken the view that it is 
appropriate to carry the value of the capacity 
acquired on the balance sheet at fair value 
at the date of acquisition. The building of a 
portfolio of participations on leading Lloyd’s 
syndicates remains the strategic objective. 
Therefore the Board decided that it was not 
appropriate to amortise the cost of the capacity 
acquired and instead to change the accounting 
policy to include an impairment test will be 
carried out at each reporting date to assess 
whether the current value exceeds the value 
carried in the balance sheet. The 2014 results 
have been restated for this accounting policy.
Reinsurance 
The proportion of the portfolio supported by 
the reinsurance market has increased and 
now the participants in the panel include private 
capital. By broadening the access to the Helios 
portfolio to private capital, we have expanded 
the potential pool of capital available to support 
the growth of the portfolio in the future. We 
expect to continue to use this source of financing 
in the future.
The reinsurers assist in the financing of their 
share of the underwriting capital required for 
the corporate members by providing letters 
of credit as Funds at Lloyd’s amounting to 
£11m at 31 December 2015. 
Dividend
Following another successful year, the 
Board is pleased to recommend that the 
final dividend remains the same as last year 
at 1.5p per share which, together with a special 
dividend of 3.5p per share (2014: 3.6p), totals 
5p per share (2014: 5.1p). The special 
dividend equates to approximately 20% of 
the 1.8m cash released from the 2013 year 
of account. These dividends will be payable to 
shareholders on the register on 10 June 
2016. As last year, the Board will put in 
place a Scrip Dividend Scheme to give 
shareholders the opportunity to elect receive 
dividends in the form of new ordinary shares 
instead of cash. If approved the dividend will 
be paid in a single payment or share issue 
on 6 July 2016.

Continuing to grow
Highlights
Growth in capacity through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of underwriting 
capacity at Lloyd’s has continued through the 
purchase of further corporate members. There 
remains a steady flow of vehicles for sale as 
existing owners wish to cease underwriting due 
to a change of circumstances. This acquisition 
strategy has increased the portfolio from £13m 
at the start of the 2013 underwriting year to 
£33m currently. Since 1 January 2015 over 
£10m of capacity has been acquired. We 
remain selective on the purchases and have 
encountered increasing competition from other 
potential purchasers. There remains a risk to 
the implementation of our strategy if suitable 
vehicles are not available at attractive prices.
Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the 
quality syndicates. So participations on weaker 
syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to 
• 70% of the portfolio managed 
by leading managing agents 
at Lloyd’s 
• Helios portfolio underwriting 
results outperform Lloyd’ s 
average return on capacity by 3%
• Helios cedes 70% of portfolio at 
the start of the underwriting year
• Helios expects to retain 
approximately 50% of 
overall underwriting result 
Maintaining the quality of the portfolio.
Nigel Hanbury
Chief Executive
maintain the overall quality. The seven largest 
syndicate participations account for over 70% 
of the portfolio. These syndicates are managed 
by the leading managing agents at Lloyd’s 
and represent shares in the better managed 
businesses at Lloyd’s. 
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio 
have consistently outperformed the Lloyd’s 
market average. Helios’ average return on 
capacity over the last four years is 11% and 
is on average 3% higher than the average 
of the Lloyd’s market. 
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before 
Helios corporate costs) has been 4% higher 
on average over the last four calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the 
diversity and the breadth of underwriting 
expertise within the businesses comprising 
the portfolio of syndicate capacity.

4                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 Reinsurance quota share
The use of quota share reinsurance to provide 
access to the Lloyd’s underwriting exposures 
for reinsurers and private capital has been 
expanded. For the 2016 underwriting year the 
panel of reinsurers was expanded to include 
private capital, a potential significant source 
of underwriting capital in the future. The core 
of the panel of reinsurers remains XL Group plc 
and Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure of 
the portfolio and assists in the financing of 
the underwriting capital. Helios will seek 
to reinsure a significant proportion of the 
capacity at the start of the underwriting 
year to mitigate the open year underwriting 
exposures. For corporate members acquired 
during the year, a proportion of the “on-risk” 
capacity will be ceded to reinsurers whilst 
the capacity on older years will be retained 
100% by Helios. Therefore the proportion 
of the overall capacity that Helios retains is 
expected to rise as further corporate members 
are acquired in the future. The profits earned 
after the company has been acquired will be 
recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained capacity 
increases significantly in Years 2 and 3 as 
further corporate members are acquired 
and the older years are not reinsured. 
Capacity on underwriting years after 18 months 
of development is substantially “off risk” as 
the underlying insurance contracts have 
mostly expired. Therefore the profits from 
the capacity on the older years are retained 
100% by Helios. The proportion of overall 
capacity retained by Helios for the 2015 
and 2016 underwriting years is expected 
to increase to approximately 50% as further 
corporate members are acquired.

Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
on which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing 
agents have traditionally been conservative 
in the estimation of the profitability of a year 
of account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk years” 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Helios 
benefits from the conservative nature of 
the managing agents.
Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the 
portfolio is well diversified across classes of 
businesses and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 
70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years which has remained consistent for the 
last three years. The market conditions 
continue to soften as the incidence of insured 
natural disasters and large loss events has 
been below normal expectations. This has 
allowed the insurance industry to generate 
adequate returns on capital and thereby 
attract new capital to the industry. 
There is today a strong consensus in 
the insurance industry that it would take a 
catastrophe, or series of catastrophes, on a 
very large scale to materially turn the market 
for short tail lines of business. The high 
aggregation of coastal exposures in the US 
and other developed markets is one reason 
why such massive dislocations cannot be 
ruled out.
The biggest single risk faced by insurers 
arises from the possibility of mispricing 
insurance on a large scale. This is mitigated 
by the diversification of the syndicate portfolio 
and by the depth of management experience 
within the syndicates that Helios supports. 
These management teams have weathered 
multiple market cycles and the risk management 
skills employed should reduce the possibility 
of substantial under-reserving of previous 
year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event 
of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing 
agents to realistic disaster scenarios (“RDSs”) 
prescribed by Lloyd’ s. The RDS events comprise 
16 compulsory events to assess the potential 
impact across the portfolio from the type of 
event proscribed. The nature and the size of 
the prescribed events have remained similar 
and the individual syndicate net exposures 
will depend on the business underwritten 
during the year and the reinsurance 
protections purchased at syndicate level.

6                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 The estimated aggregate net largest exposure 
for the Helios portfolio, before quota share 
and stop loss reinsurance, remains two separate 
hurricanes to affect the US Northeast Coast. 
The aggregate net loss has reduced to 
23% (2015: 28%) of stamp capacity as the 
syndicates have reduced both their gross 
and net exposures. All the largest natural 
catastrophes would be substantial insured 
losses in excess of US$100bn, events that 
would generate a great deal of publicity.
Helios continues to buy stop loss reinsurance 
that will reduce the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio. 
Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The Enterprise 
value, being the value of the net tangible assets 
of the Group, together with the current value 
of the portfolio capacity, is a key management 
metric in determining growth in value 
to shareholders. 
The Board recognises that the average 
prices derived from the annual capacity 
auctions managed by the Corporation at 
Lloyd’s could be subject to material change 
if the level of demand for syndicate capacity 
reduces. Notwithstanding the average prices 
derived from the auction process, each of the 
syndicates will have a track record of trading 
profitability and generating cash.
The impairment charge for this year of £63,000 
indicates a small reduction in the fair value 
of the syndicate capacity as a result of the 
fluctuations in the auction values of the 
syndicates in the portfolio.
Capital position 
The underwriting capital for the Helios 
portfolio is supplied as follows:

£m
Reinsurance panel 10.8
Helios 3.9
Total 14.7
Helios has generated free cash of £1.8m 
in 2016 from the distribution of its share of 
the final underwriting profits for the 2013 
underwriting year and early releases from 
the 2014 and 2015 years. These profits have 
assisted in funding the recent acquisitions 
and will provide working capital for the next 
12 months. A bank facility is in place to fund 
cash shortfalls. 
Corporate costs
Given the reduction in risk assumed and 
the associated reduction in underwriting 
profits, it remains essential to manage the 
central costs of Helios effectively. The fees 
and profit commissions receivable from the 
reinsurance panel offset a proportion of the 
costs incurred. 
Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of its 
shareholders and other stakeholders in 
recognising, measuring and managing the 
impacts of its business activities. As Helios 
manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s syndicate 
capacity, it has no direct responsibility for 
the management of those businesses. 
Each managing agent has responsibility 
for the management of those businesses, 
their staff and employment policies and the 
environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to 
corporate, social or environmental matters.

Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2015  Helios Underwriting plc                  7 Lloyd’s Advisers’ report – Hampden Agencies
With the closure of the 2013 Account at 
31 December 2015 Lloyd’s has now reported 
twelve consecutive years of underwriting 
profits for private capital. The 2013 three year 
account result for the Helios portfolio was 
14.2% of capacity, which compares with 
the average for the portfolio of syndicates 
supported by private capital of 12.5% 
of capacity. 
Underwriting profitability is set to continue for 
both the 2014 and 2015 Accounts with the 
mid-point estimate for the Helios portfolio at 
Q8 on 2014 being 8.9% of capacity, a 0.4% 
improvement on 2013 at the same stage. 
The 2013 result and estimates for 2014 and 
2015 have benefited from below average 
major loss activity. Global insured major 
losses, according to Swiss Re Sigma, were 
$37bn in 2015, $44bn in 2014 and $45bn 
in 2013; these were significantly below the 
ten year average of $62bn a year. For 2016 
Hampden has a target profit, excluding prior 
years, of 0% to 5% of capacity assuming a 
long term average for catastrophe losses.
The Insurance Market in 2016
So far in 2016 the trend of rate reductions 
have continued in most classes of business 
other than motor. Overall, market conditions 
are the most competitive in Lloyd’s since 
the late 1990s when Lloyd’s reported four 
consecutive years of underwriting losses 
on a three year account basis. 
Property catastrophe reinsurance rates 
at 1 January 2016 have now declined for 
four years in succession. Guy Carpenter 
estimates rates reduced by 5% to 8% 
compared with reductions of over 11% 
a year earlier.
Property and casualty insurance rates in the 
United States began to decline during the 
first quarter of 2015. This has continued for 
a fifth successive quarter with the Council of 
Insurance Agents and Brokers reporting rate 
reductions of 3.7% in Q1 2016, the largest 
fall since reductions started in Q1 2015. The 
impact of rate reductions has reduced net 
written premium growth for the full year 2015 
to only 2.7%, which is lagging nominal GDP 
growth of 3.5%. 
We are now at the ‘soft market’ stage in 
the insurance cycle when we expect the 
outperformance of quality syndicates relative 
to the Lloyd’s average to increase compared 
with the ‘hard market’ years. Key success 
characteristics of quality syndicates include a 
focus on conservative reserving, often above 
the best estimate recommended by external 
actuaries, and a willingness to walk away 
from under-priced business rather than 
chase growth in premium income. 
The Investment Environment
Our view is that disciplined underwriters can 
make a profit in today’s market. Importantly, 
underwriting discipline is reinforced by two 
key factors which were not present in the late 
1990s. First, the investment environment. 
Low and declining bond yields now offer little 
protection to sub-par underwriting. We think 
it is no coincidence that the US industry 
made underwriting profits in eight years out 
of ten in the 1950s when the US Treasury 
10-year yield averaged 3.2% and so far 
this decade the average yield is 2.5% with 
underwriting profits being made three years 
out of six. 
Second, the process of setting regulatory 
capital for insurers has become much more 
robust with the introduction by the Prudential 
Regulatory Authority of the Solvency II regime 
which was fully implemented by Lloyd’s for 
the 2016 year. Syndicates are required to 
calculate their own capital requirements to 
Solvency II standards. Capital requirements 
are therefore a risk sensitive measure with 
the two most important risks of insurers 
being underwriting risk and reserving risk. 
The Lloyd’s capital requirements have been 
on an upward trend as a percentage of net 
earned premiums as the margin for achieving 
underwriting profitability has reduced as rates 
have declined.
Outperformance expected 
by quality syndicates 
The Helios portfolio 
continues to provide a 
good spread of business.
Market conditions are the most competitive in Lloyd’s 
since the late 1990s.
8                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 Supply of Capital Close to All Time Highs
Good underwriting results continue to attract 
capital to the insurance industry searching 
for yield. Much of this is ‘alternative capital’ 
and focused on reinsurance business through 
short-term structures such as catastrophe 
bonds and collateralised reinsurance. During 
2015 alternative capital continued to grow 
and now accounts for 19% of total dedicated 
reinsurance capital according to broker, 
Guy Carpenter. The market share of alternative 
capital has increased by 138% since 2008 
and has exacerbated the level of rate 
reductions in particular for property 
catastrophe reinsurance business. Since 
2008 Aon Benfield estimates that total 
reinsurance capital has increased by 55% 
although it fell back marginally by 2% to 
$565bn at 31 December 2015.
Balance of Power Shifting  
to Net Buyers of Reinsurance
With net written premium growth slowing down 
and underwriting margins being squeezed by 
a combination of reducing rates and increased 
expenses, one way to mitigate downside risk 
is to buy more reinsurance. The balance of 
power has continued to shift to net buyers 
of reinsurance from the sellers of reinsurance. 
One benefit of current market conditions is that 
syndicates have been able to secure a fuller 
reinsurance programme at more reasonable 
cost than in previous years in 2016.
Reserve Strength is Becoming 
Increasingly Important
Bottom line results in the current rating 
environment are becoming increasingly 
dependent on conservative reserving, 
given the modest forecast for pure year 
underwriting return. We consider the Helios 
portfolio of syndicates to be conservatively 
reserved overall with the last three year 
account closed result for 2013 including a 
prior year release of 4.7% of capacity from 
the 2012 and prior years. 
We have analysed the reserve strength of the 
2016 Helios portfolio of freehold syndicates 
(excluding Special Purpose Syndicates which 
have a limited tenure) at the closure of the 
2013 Account into the 2014 Account of 
those syndicates. The ratio of Incurred but 
Not Reported reserves to Net Outstanding 
Claims reserves was 115% at the closure of 
the 2013 Account of these syndicates into 
the 2014 Account. There will be two further 
calendar years of development before the 
2016 Account receives its share of 2015 and 
prior year reserves so this measure is a proxy 
for future reserve strength. The 115% ratio 
compares favourably with an equivalent figure 
for private capital syndicates of 72% in 2007 
and only 45% in 2004. However, over this 
period, we would expect part of the increase 
in IBNR to be due to the “tail” of claims 
settlement getting longer; Lloyd’s reports that 
coverholder business which has a longer “tail” 
has increased from 25% to 32% of Lloyd’s 
income between 2002 and 2015.
Conservative reserving we believe 
has an additional benefit in that it 
reinforces pricing discipline in today’s 
more challenging underwriting conditions. 
This is particularly important in liability 
business where under-reserving can lead 
to under-pricing business which in turn 
becomes under-reserved. A relatively modest 
pure year underwriting loss can then be 
magnified by prior year deteriorations 
which on liability business can be for 
three or more years.
Our Approach in This Market –  
A Focus on Quality
Our approach in this market is to focus 
syndicate portfolios on quality syndicates. 
The Helios portfolio for 2016 continues to 
provide a good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of business. 
The two largest classes of business remain 
reinsurance at 28.6% and US dollar property 
insurance at 17.7% shown in the ‘doughnut’ 
chart below. Liability and motor exposures 
provide balance against the more volatile 
property catastrophe exposures as well as 
contributing through diversification to lower 
capital requirements.
The measure of quality assessed by Hampden 
is the grading we assign each year to 
syndicates. Syndicates graded ‘D’ are not 
recommended for support while the four positive 
gradings range from ‘AA’ (Excellent), ‘A’ (Very 
Good), ‘B’ (Good) and ‘C’ (Market Average). 
Helios continues to focus its portfolio on the 
quality syndicates which have traditionally 
outperformed in difficult times. The Helios 
portfolio contains 55% by underwriting capacity 
in syndicates graded ‘AA’ and ‘A’ by Hampden.

The information set out below is a summary of the key items that the Board assesses in estimating the financial position of the Group. 
Given the Board has no active role in the management of the syndicates within the portfolio, the following approach is taken.
A) It relies on the quarterly syndicate forecasts to assess its share of the underlying profitability of the syndicates within the portfolio.
B)  It calculates the amounts due to / from the quota share reinsurers in respect of their share of the profits/losses as well as fees and commissions due.
C) An adjustment is made to exclude pre-acquisition profits on companies bought in the year.
D) Costs relating to stop loss reinsurance and operating costs are deducted.

14                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare 
the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 » make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 » state whether IFRS adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the Financial Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Annual report and financial statements 2015  Helios Underwriting plc                  15
Governance We have audited the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and 
Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial 
Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 » the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 » the Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 » the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

22                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 1. General information
The Company is a public limited company listed on AIM. The Company was incorporated in England, is domiciled in the UK and its registered 
office is 40 Gracechurch Street, London EC3V 0BT. The Company participates in insurance business as an underwriting member at Lloyd’s 
through its subsidiary undertakings. 
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Change in accounting policy
As of 1 January 2015 the Group changed its accounting policy for the accounting for intangible assets, syndicate capacity. The new accounting 
policy has been applied retrospectively. For details of this change, refer to this accounting policy as disclosed further below and Note 21.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as endorsed by the 
European Union (“EU”), IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
No statement of comprehensive income is presented for Helios Underwriting plc, as a parent company, as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss. A summary of the principal Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The Group participates in insurance business through its Lloyd’s member subsidiaries. Accounting information in respect of syndicate 
participations is provided by the syndicate managing agents and is reported upon by the syndicate auditors.
Going concern
The Group and the Company have net assets at the end of the reporting period of £16,423,000 and £21,966,000 respectively.
The Company’ s subsidiaries participate as underwriting members at Lloyd’ s on the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account and they have continued 
this participation since the year end on the 2016 year of account. This underwriting is supported by funds at Lloyd’s totalling £5,341,000 
(2014: £1,535,000), letters of credit provided through the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements totalling £9,378,000 (2014: £8,728,000) 
and solvency credits issued by Lloyd’s totalling £3,645,000 (2014: £3,181,000).
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to meet their underwriting and other 
operational obligations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards

and Nomina No 372 LLP are prepared for the year ended 31 December 2015 under UK GAAP . Consolidation adjustments are made to convert 
the subsidiary Financial Statements prepared under UK GAAP to IFRS so as to align accounting policies and treatments.
No income statement is presented for Helios Underwriting plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax 
for the year of the Parent Company was £7,819,000 (2014: £724,000).
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding 
or partnership participation of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
In the Parent Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and are reviewed for impairment annually or when 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value to be impaired.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised and recorded 
as goodwill. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired and recognised directly in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the Consolidated Income Statement. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated.

24                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 2. Accounting policies continued
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified 
as Nigel Hanbury.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Financial Statements are presented in thousands of Pounds Sterling, which is the 
Group’s functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions and non-monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred acquisition costs and unearned premiums, are translated 
into the functional currency using monthly average rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction as a proxy for the transactional 
rates. The translation difference arising on non-monetary asset items is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Monetary items are translated at period-end rates; any exchange differences arising from the change in rates of exchange are recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement of the year.
Underwriting
Premiums
Gross premium written comprises the total premiums receivable in respect of business incepted during the year, together with any differences 
between booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, and includes estimates of premiums due but not yet receivable or notified 
to the syndicates on which the Group participates, less an allowance for cancellations. All premiums are shown gross of commission payable 
to intermediaries and exclude taxes and duties levied on them.
Unearned premiums
Gross premium written is earned according to the risk profile of the policy. Unearned premiums represent the proportion of gross premium 
written in the year that relates to unexpired terms of policies in force at the end of the reporting period calculated on a time apportionment 
basis having regard, where appropriate, to the incidence of risk. The specific basis adopted by each syndicate is determined by the relevant 
managing agent.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance premiums
Reinsurance premium costs are allocated by the managing agent of each syndicate to reflect the protection arranged in respect of the 
business written and earned.
Reinsurance premium costs in respect of reinsurance purchased directly by the Group are charged or credited based on the annual accounting 
result for each year of account protected by the reinsurance.
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share
Claims incurred comprise claims and settlement expenses (both internal and external) occurring in the year and changes in the provisions for 
outstanding claims, including provisions for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and settlement expenses, together with any other adjustments 
to claims from previous years. Where applicable, deductions are made for salvage and other recoveries.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises amounts set aside for claims notified and IBNR. The amount included in respect of IBNR is 
based on statistical techniques of estimation applied by each syndicate’s in-house reserving team and reviewed, in certain cases, by external 
consulting actuaries. These techniques generally involve projecting from past experience the development of claims over time to form a view 
of the likely ultimate claims to be experienced for more recent underwriting, having regard to variations in the business accepted and the underlying 
terms and conditions. The provision for claims also includes amounts in respect of internal and external claims’ handling costs. For the most 
recent years, where a high degree of volatility arises from projections, estimates may be based in part on output from the rating and other 
models of the business accepted, and assessments of underwriting conditions.
The reinsurers’ share of provisions for claims is based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR, net of estimated 
irrecoverable amounts, having regard to each syndicate’s reinsurance programme in place for the class of business, the claims experience for 
the year and the current security rating of the reinsurance companies involved. Each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to assist in 
making these estimates.
Accordingly, the two most critical assumptions made by each syndicate’s managing agent as regards claims provisions are that the past is a 
reasonable predictor of the likely level of claims development and that the rating and other models used, including pricing models for recent 
business, are reasonable indicators of the likely level of ultimate claims to be incurred.

Financial statements 2. Accounting policies continued
Underwriting continued
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share continued
The level of uncertainty with regard to the estimations within these provisions generally decreases with time since the underlying contracts 
were exposed to new risks. In addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within 
a short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may 
be several years before claims are fully advised and settled. In addition to these factors if there are disputes regarding coverage under policies 
or changes in the relevant law regarding a claim this may increase the uncertainty in the estimation of the outcomes.
The assessment of these provisions is usually the most subjective aspect of an insurer’s accounts and may result in greater uncertainty within 
an insurer’s accounts than within those of many other businesses. The provisions for gross claims and related reinsurance recoveries have been 
assessed on the basis of the information currently available to the directors of each syndicate’s managing agent. However, ultimate liability will 
vary as a result of subsequent information and events and this may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided. Adjustments to 
the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the Financial Statements for the period in which the adjustments 
are made. The provisions are not discounted for the investment earnings that may be expected to arise in the future on the funds retained to 
meet the future liabilities. The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Quota share reinsurance
Under the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements, 50% of the 2013 underwriting year of account and 70% of the 2014 and 
2015 underwriting year of account insurance exposure is ceded to the reinsurers. Amounts payable to the reinsurers are included within 
“reinsurance premium ceded” in the Consolidated Income Statement of the year and amounts receivable from the reinsurers are included 
within “reinsurers share of gross claims paid” in the Consolidated Income Statement of the year. 
Unexpired risks provision
Provision for unexpired risks is made where the costs of outstanding claims, related expenses and deferred acquisition costs are expected 
to exceed the unearned premium provision carried forward at the end of the reporting period. The provision for unexpired risks is calculated 
separately by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. The provision 
is made on a syndicate-by-syndicate basis by the relevant managing agent.
Closed years of account
At the end of the third year, the underwriting account is normally closed by reinsurance into the following year of account. The amount of the 
reinsurance to close premium payable is determined by the managing agent, generally by estimating the cost of claims notified but not settled 
at 31 December, together with the estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at that date and an estimate of future claims 
handling costs. Any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities of the closed year of account is borne by the underwriting year into which it 
is reinsured.
The payment of a reinsurance to close premium does not eliminate the liability of the closed year for outstanding claims. If the reinsuring 
syndicate were unable to meet any obligations, and the other elements of Lloyd’s chain of security were to fail, then the closed underwriting 
account would have to settle any outstanding claims.
The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a failure of the reinsurance to close is extremely remote and consequently the reinsurance to 
close has been deemed to settle the liabilities outstanding at the closure of an underwriting account. The Group will include its share of the 
reinsurance to close premiums payable as technical provisions at the end of the current period and no further provision is made for any potential 
variation in the ultimate liability of that year of account.
Run-off years of account
Where an underwriting year of account is not closed at the end of the third year (a “run-off” year of account) a provision is made for the estimated 
cost of all known and unknown outstanding liabilities of that year. The provision is determined initially by the managing agent on a similar basis 
to the reinsurance to close. However, any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities for that year remains with the corporate member participating 
therein. As a result, any run-off year will continue to report movements in its results after the third year until such time as it secures a reinsurance 
to close.
Net operating expenses (including acquisition costs)
Net operating expenses include acquisition costs, profit and loss on exchange and other amounts incurred by the syndicates on which the 
Group participates.
Acquisition costs, comprising commission and other costs related to the acquisition of new insurance contracts, are deferred to the extent 
that they are attributable to premiums unearned at the end of the reporting period.

Intangible assets: syndicate capacity
Syndicate capacity is an intangible asset which represents costs incurred in the Corporation of Lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights to 
participate on syndicates’ years of account.
At the individual subsidiary company level, the syndicate capacity is stated at cost, less any provision for impairment at initial recognition, and 
amortised on a straight line basis over the useful economic life, which is estimated to be five years (up to 2014: estimated to be seven years). 
No amortisation is charged until the following year when underwriting commences in respect of the purchased syndicate participation.
At the consolidation level, the Group’s accounting policy for the year 2014 was consistent with the accounting policy of the subsidiaries as 
described above. As of 1 January 2015, the Group changed its accounting policy for accounting for the intangible asset, syndicate capacity, 
as set out below:
The syndicate capacity represents the cost of purchasing the Group’s participation in the combined syndicates. The capacity is capitalised at 
cost in the statement of financial position. It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment. It is annually tested 
for impairment by reference to the weighted average value at Lloyd’s auctions and expected future profit streams to be earned by those syndicates 
in which the Group participates and provision is made for any impairment in the Consolidated Income Statement.
This change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively as if the new policy had always been in place. The effects of this change are 
disclosed in Note 21.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits at bank.
Investment income
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable are accrued to the end of the period.
Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to 
receive payments is established.
Syndicate investments and cash are held on a pooled basis, the return from which is allocated by the relevant managing agent to years of 
account proportionate to the funds contributed by the year of account.
Dividend distribution policy
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised in the Group’s and the Parent Company’s Financial Statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Other operating expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financial assets
(a) Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, and loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The Group does not make use of the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
All financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are categorised as designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition 
because they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Company’s documented investment 
strategy. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the Group’s key management. 
The Group’ s investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their performance with reference to their fair values. Assets in this category are classified as 
current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current.
(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans 
and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost less any impairment 
losses. They are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period. The latter ones are classified 
as non-current assets.
The Group’ s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables, including insurance and reinsurance receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents”.
The Parent Company’s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables, including insurance and reinsurance receivables” and “cash and 
cash equivalents”.
(b) Recognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to the 
purchase or sale of the asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs 
incurred expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments 
has expired or are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all its risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables are recognised as described in (ii) above.

Financial statements 2. Accounting policies continued
Financial assets continued
(b) Recognition continued
(i) Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the 
end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, 
industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regular occurring market transactions on an arm’s 
length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on 
entity-specific estimates.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, are presented in the 
income statement within “net investment income”.
The fair values of short-term deposits are assumed to approximate to their book values. The fair values of the Group’s debt securities have 
been based on quoted market prices for these instruments. 
Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company 
and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management establishes provisions when appropriate, on the basis of amounts 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements. 
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the nominal value of the share capital issued is taken to the share premium 
account. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
3. Key accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties
In applying the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. These judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the best and most reliable evidence 
available at the time when the decisions are made, and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be applicable. 
Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements, estimates and assumptions, the actual results and outcomes may differ. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects 
both current and future periods. 
Notes to the financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2015
28                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 3. Key accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties continued
The measurement of the provision for claims outstanding is the most significant judgement involving estimation uncertainty regarding amounts 
recognised in these Financial Statements in relation to underwriting by the syndicates and this is disclosed further in Note 4.
The management and control of each syndicate is carried out by the managing agent of that syndicate, and the Company looks to the managing 
agent to implement appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls to manage each syndicate. 
The key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty set out below therefore relate to those made in respect of the Company 
only, and do not include estimates and judgements made in respect of the syndicates.
Purchased syndicate capacity
Estimating value in use
Where an indication of impairment of capacity values exists, the Directors will carry out an impairment review to determine the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the capacity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Assessing indicators of impairment
In assessing whether there have been any indicators of impairment of assets, the Directors consider both external and internal sources of information 
such as market conditions, counterparty credit ratings and experience of recoverability. 
Recoverability of receivables
The Company establishes a provision for receivables that are estimated not to be recoverable. When assessing recoverability, factors such as 
the ageing of the receivables, past experience of recoverability and the credit profile of individual or groups of customers are all considered. 
4. Risk management
The majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from each subsidiary’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s syndicates. As detailed 
below, these risks are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction with 
its subsidiaries and members’ agent, is limited to selection of syndicate participations, monitoring the performance of the syndicates and the 
purchase of appropriate member level reinsurance.
Syndicate risks
The syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. The managing agent is responsible for managing the 
syndicate’s exposure to these risks and, where possible, introducing controls and procedures that mitigate the effects of the exposure to risk. 
For the purposes of setting capital requirements for the 2015 and subsequent years of account, each managing agent will have prepared a 
Lloyd’s Capital Return (“LCR”) for the syndicate to agree capital requirements with Lloyd’s based on an agreed assessment of the risks impacting 
the syndicate’s business and the measures in place to manage and mitigate those risks from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. The 
risks described below are typically reflected in the LCR and typically the majority of the total assessed value of the risks concerned is attributable 
to insurance risk.
The insurance risks faced by a syndicate include the occurrence of catastrophic events, downward pressure on pricing of risks, reductions in 
business volumes and the risk of inadequate reserving. Reinsurance risk arises from the risk that a reinsurer fails to meet its share of a claim. 
The management of the syndicate’s funds is exposed to investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, leading to 
financial loss. The syndicate is also exposed to regulatory and operational risks including its ability to continue to trade. However, supervision 
by Lloyd’s and the Prudential Regulation Authority provides additional controls over the syndicate’s management of risks.
The Group manages the risks faced by the syndicates on which its subsidiaries participate by monitoring the performance of the syndicates it 
supports. This commences in advance of committing to support a syndicate for the following year, with a review of the business plan prepared 
for each syndicate by its managing agent. In addition, quarterly reports and annual accounts, together with any other information made available 
by the managing agent, are monitored and if necessary enquired into. If the Group considers that the risks being run by the syndicate are excessive, 
it will seek confirmation from the managing agent that adequate management of the risk is in place and, if considered appropriate, will withdraw 
support from the next year of account. The Group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by purchasing appropriate member level reinsurance.
Reinsurance risk
Reinsurance risk to the Group arises where reinsurance contracts put in place to reduce gross insurance risk do not perform as anticipated, 
result in coverage disputes or prove inadequate in terms of the vertical or horizontal limits purchased. Failure of a reinsurer to pay a valid claim 
is considered a credit risk, which is detailed separately below.
The Group currently has reinsurance programmes on the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account.
The 2013 year of account has a strategic collateralised quota share arrangement in respect of 50% of its business with Bermudan reinsurer 
XL Re Limited (part of global NYSE-quoted insurer XL Group plc) through Hampden Insurance Guernsey PCC Limited – Cell 6, a special 
purpose vehicle.
The 2014 and 2015 years of account have strategic collateralised quota share arrangement in respect of 50% of their business with XL Re Limited, 
12.45% with Bermudan reinsurer Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited (part of global NYSE-quoted insurer Everest Re Group Limited) and 7.55% 
with Guernsey reinsurer Polygon Insurance Co Limited, through Hampden Insurance Guernsey PCC Limited – Cell 6.

Financial statements 4. Risk management continued
Investment, credit, liquidity and currency risks
The other significant risks faced by the Group are with regard to the investment of funds within its own custody. The elements of these risks 
are investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. To mitigate this, the surplus Group funds are deposited with 
highly rated banks and fund managers. The main liquidity risk would arise if a syndicate had inadequate liquid resources for a large claim and 
sought funds from the Group to meet the claim. In order to minimise investment risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Group’s funds are invested 
in readily realisable short-term deposits. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2015 is £8.1m (2014: £6.2m), being the 
aggregate of the Group’s insurance receivables, prepayments and accrued income, financial assets at fair value, and cash and cash equivalents, 
excluding any amounts held in the syndicates. The syndicates can distribute their results in sterling, US dollars or a combination of the two. 
The Group is exposed to movements in the US dollar between the balance sheet date and the distribution of the underwriting profits and 
losses, which is usually in the May following the closure of a year of account. The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage 
risk and, as such, no hedge accounting is applied.
As a result of the specific nature and structure of the Group’s collateralised quota share reinsurance arrangements through Cell 6, the 
Group’s funds at Lloyd’s calculation benefits from an aggregate £9.4m (2014: £8.7m) letter of credit (“LOC”) acceptable to Lloyd’s, on behalf 
of XL Re Limited, Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited and Polygon Insurance Co Limited (the reinsurers). The LOC is pledged in aggregate 
to the relevant syndicates through Lloyd’s and thus Helios Underwriting plc is not specifically exposed to counterparty credit risk in this matter. 
Should the bank’s LOC become unacceptable to Lloyd’s for any reason, the reinsurer is responsible under the terms of the contract for making 
alternative arrangements. The contract is annually renewable and the Group has a contingency plan in place in the event of non-renewal 
under both normal and adverse market conditions.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market and liquidity risk in respect of its holdings of syndicate participations. Lloyd’s syndicate participations are traded 
in the Lloyd’s auctions held in September and October each year. The Group is exposed to changes in market prices and a lack of liquidity in 
the trading of a particular syndicate’s capacity could result in the Group making a loss compared to the carrying value when the Group disposes 
of particular syndicate participations.
Regulatory risks 
The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a member of a Lloyd’s syndicate. The risk of this approval being 
removed is mitigated by monitoring and fully complying with all requirements in relation to membership of Lloyd’s. The capital requirements to 
support the proposed amount of syndicate capacity for future years are subject to the requirements of Lloyd’s. A variety of factors are taken 
into account by Lloyd’ s in setting these requirements including market conditions and syndicate performance and, although the process is intended 
to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may constrain the volume of underwriting a subsidiary 
of the Company is able to support. 
The Company is subject to the AIM Rules. Compliance with the AIM Rules is monitored by the Board.
Operational risks
As there are relatively few transactions actually undertaken by the Group, there are only limited systems and operational requirements of the 
Group and therefore operational risks are not considered to be significant. Close involvement of all Directors in the Group’s key decision making 
and the fact that the majority of the Group’s operations are conducted by syndicates provide control over any remaining operational risks.
Capital management objectives, policies and approach
The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to managing the risks that affect its capital position:
 » to maintain the required level of stability of the Group, thereby providing a degree of security to shareholders;
 » to allocate capital efficiently and support the development of the business by ensuring that returns on capital employed meet the requirements 
of the shareholders; and
 » to maintain the financial strength to support increases in the Group’s underwriting through acquisition of capacity in the Lloyd’s auctions or 
through the acquisition of new subsidiaries.
The Group’s capital management policy is to hold a sufficient level of capital to allow the Group to take advantage of market conditions, 
particularly when insurance rates are improving, and to meet the funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) requirements that support the corporate member 
subsidiaries’ current and future levels of underwriting.
Approach to capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists entirely of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued share capital, 
share premium and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statements of Changes in Equity on page 20.
At 31 December 2015 the corporate member subsidiaries had an agreed FAL requirement of £16,844,000 (2014: £13,136,000) to support their 
underwriting on the 2016 year of account (2015 year of account). The funds to support this requirement are held in short-term investment funds 
and deposits or provided by the quota share reinsurance capital providers by way of a LOC. The FAL requirements are formally assessed and 
funded twice yearly and must be met by the corporate member subsidiaries to continue underwriting. At 31 December 2015 the agreed FAL 
requirements for the Group were 51% (2014: 64%) of the capacity for the following year of account.

Assumptions, changes in assumptions and sensitivity
As described in Note 3, the majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from its subsidiaries’ participation in the results of 
Lloyd’s syndicates and are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in 
conjunction with the Group’s members’ agent, is limited to a selection of syndicate participations and monitoring the performance of the 
syndicates and their managing agents.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are calculated by the managing agents of the syndicates, derived from 
accounting information provided by the managing agents and reported upon by the syndicate auditors. 
The key assumptions underlying the amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are:
 » the claims reserves calculated by the managing agents are accurate; and
 » the potential deterioration of run-off year results has been fully provided for by the managing agents.
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2015.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are sensitive to various factors as follows:
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of gross claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by 
£3,299,000 (2014: £2,618,000);
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by 
£2,733,000 (2014: £2,150,000); and 
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the run-off year net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by £1,000 (2014: £nil).
The 10% movement has been selected to give an indication of the possible variations in the assumptions used.

The results of the Group’s participation on the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account and the calendar year movement on 2012 and prior 
run-offs will not be assessed for tax until the years ended 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, being the year after the calendar year result 
of each run-off year or the normal date of closure of each year of account. Full provision is made as part of the deferred tax provisions 
for underwriting profits/(losses) not yet subject to corporation tax.
New legislation was passed on 18 November 2015 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. 
The government further announced on 16 March 2016 as part of its Budget that a rate of 17% will apply from 1 April 2020 instead of 18%. 
This is not expected to have a material impact on the closing deferred tax liability.
The Group has £2,184,000 (2014: £1,270,000) taxable losses carried forward, to which £1,009,000 has been recognised as a deferred tax 
asset and has been offset against deferred tax liabilities as disclosed in Note 14.
The Company has £1,175,000 (2014: £610,000) of tax losses to carry forward to which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the 
uncertainty of the future taxable profits, as disclosed in Note 14.
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after tax by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The Group has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 “Earnings per share”.
The earnings per share and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below:

Weighted average number of shares in issue 9,411,794 8,526,948
Basic and diluted earnings per share 8.38p 24.11p
The basic and diluted earnings per share as originally reported for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 12.23p, based on a profit for 
the year after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of £1,043,000. The weighted average number of shares in issue for the year ended 
31 December 2014 remained unchanged.

of £926,000. Nameco (No. 311) Limited is incorporated in England and Wales and is a corporate member of Lloyd’s.

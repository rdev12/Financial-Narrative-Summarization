We continue to grow

The principle drivers of this growth in 
ﬂ exible workplace outsourcing, and 
ﬂ exible working in general, are technology, 
which enab bles us to work anywhere, and 
the signiﬁ cant cost savings associated 
with contrac a ting to a specialist sup pport 
service prov ovider like Regus. As outlined 
in more de detail opposite, other drivers 
include demographics, sustainability 
and the growing societal importance 
of of w wor o k- k-life b bal alan ance ce. 
As a result, ﬂ ﬂe exible wo working has co ome m

When a business looks to outsource its 
workplace requirements, location is
typically the primary consideration. It is 
for this reason that we continue to invest 
heavily in expanding and strengthening 
national networks across all the markets 
in which we operate, taking the products 
and services we provide to where our 
customers need us to be. Expansion, in 
our core business centre network and into 
third place locations such as airports, retail 
outlets and community centres, is a key 
objective for the Group. Financial growth 
also allows us to realise signiﬁ cant scale 
beneﬁ ts through cost reductions and 
gains in efﬁ ciency. 
Our aim is to provide our customers 
with the best possible help and support 
in deciding how and where they structure

Cost:
Using traditional ﬁ xed 
property can be expensive 
– all the more so since 
more ﬂ exible working 
leaves desks empty for 
much of the week. Flexible 
workplace outsourcing can 
be more cost effective than 
ﬁ xed alternatives.
Technology:
Technological advances, 
from new devices to 
technologies and services, 
allow us to work and 
connect to colleagues, 
customers and suppliers 
from anywhere. 
Technological change will 
only continue to make us 
more mobile, connected 
and accessible.
Demographics: 
There are now four 
generations in the 
workforce from the over 
65’s and Baby Boomers to 
Gen-X and lastly Net-Gens 
born into an always-on, 
always-connected world. 
Each has very different 
work styles and 
expectations which ﬂ exible 
working helps them meet.
Sustainability: 
Sustainability is a core 
strategic priority for 
businesses, governments 
and individuals, and 
includes concerns around 
environmental impact, for 
example through carbon 
emissions. Flexible working 
helps address this is an 
efﬁ cient and simply way 
by allowing our customers 
to cut the carbon 
emissions associated 
with commuting.
Work-life balance: 
A harmonious work-life 
balance often tops 
professionals’ deﬁ nition of 
career success, ahead of 
both money and 
recognition. Flexible 
working is a major 
contributor to a better 
work-life balance, and is 
increasingly used by 
employers to attract and 
retain staff.

Our purpose is to provide 
businesses with a network 
of high quality workplaces 
that help them be more 
effective and successful. 
To achieve this we have 
developed a proven, 
robust and high performing 
business model.
Over nearly 25 years we have continually 
invested in improving and developing our 
business assets, the most important of 
which is our network of locations. We now 
operate in 100 countries across almost 
2,000 locations (business centres and third 
place locations), an unrivalled proposition.
As the illustration opposite demonstrates, 
our business model is aligned with 
realising our strategy and creating 
long-term value for both our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Network strength
Regus invests in strengthening and 
expanding its national networks so as to 
best serve the needs and demands of 
its customers, both current and new. 
Expanding in this way enables Regus to 
interact with an increasing number and 
variety of customers across all industry 
segments and geographical locations. 
Regus is in a ﬁ nancially strong position – in 
particular, the strong cash ﬂ ow generation 
from our mature centres allows us to 
continue to invest in the business, growing 
the network and investing in Research & 
Development. This allows us to improve 
and develop our business to meet 
changing customer needs. 
Good people, systems and processes
Developing our people, processes and 
systems is core to delivering excellent 
customer service. Successful delivery of 
our strategy by our people has driven 
strong revenue growth. All countries have 
detailed development plans and in-country 
management structures support this on 
the ground. By investing in our people to 
develop their capabilities, particularly at 
a country level, and devolving decision 
making, we are witnessing a marked 
operational improvement which is reﬂ ected 
in our strong business performance. 
Cash generative
An attractive feature of our business model 
is the strong conversion of proﬁ t into cash. 
This supports continued investment in 
expanding our core expertise delivered 
through multiple national business centre 
networks whilst delivering tangible cash 
returns to our shareholders through the 
Group’s progressive dividend policy.
Constantly innovating
To better serve our customers we invest 
signiﬁ cantly in developing our products 
and services. We also champion a better 
understanding of the beneﬁ ts of workplace 
outsourcing through substantial marketing 
investment. The ofﬁ ce remains the primary 
workspace and our business centres 
continue to be at the core of our network. 
However, ﬂ exible working now embraces 
an expanding range of convenient places 
to work between the ofﬁ ce and the home. 
We are developing our network, through 
both business centre and third place 
locations, to directly meet this need.

Companies outsource their 
workplace needs to Regus 
so that they can focus on 
their core activities. The 
more convenient our 
locations become, the more 
attractive our offer is as an 
alternative to owning or 
leasing property directly, 
especially for larger 
businesses that cover 
diverse geographies. 
We provide this convenience by 
establishing and then deepening national 
networks that are linked together into one 
global network of 1831 business centre 
and 98 third place locations across 100 
countries. The reach of our network is 
unrivalled and a major differentiator.
For our customers – from global 
corporates such as Google, Tata and 
Toshiba to numerous businesses small 
and large – our network is critical to their 
success. They use it to work more 
efﬁ ciently and effectively, reduce ﬁ xed 
costs and meet a growing employee 
demand for more ﬂ exible work

New countries and cities
The scope and strength of our network 
is a key differentiator for Regus – we
therefore continuously invest in developing
and strengthening it further. In 2013, we
opened in our 100th country – Nepal – and 
extend our reach to 684 cities including 
new markets such as Beverly Hills, USA, 
Naples, Italy and Pretoria, South Africa. 
Network growth strengthens our
relationships with customers, and 
attracts new business. It also drives up 
shareholder returns: the more centres
we have, the more we beneﬁ t from
economies of scale and lower unit costs.
Building national networks
Launching in new markets is one key 
aspect of network growth. But deepening 
our presence in existing ones is also
critical. Thus, in China we increased our
network to 66 locations in 2013, in key 
business districts of up-and-coming cities 
such as Ningbo and Suzhou, as well 
as the longstanding business hubs of 
Shanghai and Beijing. In Germany we
more than doubled the size of our 
business centre network whilst also 
opening many third place locations.
Extending our reach further
Expanding into new locations is an 
important part of our strategy: we aim 
to be everywhere our customers need 
us to be. Regus now caters to mobile 
workers: peopl le e who work r whi ilst on the

Regus allows our customers to focus 
more clearly on their core business

The scale of the opportunity is signiﬁ cant. 
Our network will remain at the core of

a workplace ecosystem around which we 
provide, facilitate and deliver a wide range

We believe our ability to innovate is crucial

As the examples opposite describe, we 
have already made the initial steps in 
broadening what we do, exploring and 
testing various offers in different markets, 
some further in the future than others. 
We are conﬁ dent that investing in 
such development will increase the

Strategy and key performance indicators
Strategic objectives Our approach
Improve proﬁ tability
Revenue growth achieved through the 
addition of new locations, the development 
of incremental revenue streams and active 
management of the existing network to drive 
efﬁ ciency: all contribute to improvements in 
gross proﬁ t. Combined with strong overhead 
cost control this drives operating proﬁ t and 
cash ﬂ ow.
Develop national 
networks
Growth is demand-led as we respond to 
companies looking to outsource more of their 
workplace needs. By expanding our networks 
we expand our addressable audience and 
provide our existing customers with additional 
convenience. We continue to be mindful of 
growing only in locations where the investment 
opportunity meets our stringent returns criteria. 
We are also focused on developing more capital 
efﬁ cient ways of expanding the network.
Lead market 
innovation
Innovation is core to Regus’ strategy and 
allows us to retain our market-leading position. 
We invest in Research & Development to ensure 
we stay on top of (and even help shape) trends, 
by developing products and services that meet 
our customer’s needs and help them work 
more efﬁ ciently and effectively. New product 
development provides existing customers with 
additional reasons to use Regus and also opens 
up new revenue opportunities.
Control cost
Cost control is achieved through operational 
excellence and the signiﬁ cant economies of 
scale and operational leverage that network 
growth brings.

Chairman’s statement
For the period, Group revenues grew 
23.3% to £1,533.5m (2012: £1,244.1m), 
while operating proﬁ ts were marginally 
ahead at £90.8m (2012: £90.2m), a 
strong result in light of the increased 
drag from the accelerated pace of new 
centre additions. 
We continue to position the business for 
the future, with over £300m invested in 
growing our high quality network. In total 
we increased our business centre network 
by 30% to 1,831 (2012: 1,411) and 
opened 76 third place locations. 
The performance of our Mature business 
continues to be a strength. On a like-
for-like basis, revenues in our Mature 
business improved by 3.7% to £1,226.3m 
(2012: £1,182.0m), while operating 
proﬁ t increased by 33% to £205.3m 
(2012: £154.6m) with the mature operating 
margin improving to 16.7% (2012: 13.1%). 
Our mature centres continue to be highly 
cash generative, with free cash ﬂ ow (after 
tax, ﬁ nance costs and maintenance capital 
expenditure) of £156.5m, representing a 
mature free cash ﬂ ow margin of 12.8% or 
16.6p per share.
Our New Centres business has also 
performed well, progressing in line with 
our expectations. Management remain 
focused on ensuring all new centres 
achieve the required ﬁ nancial returns. 
Strategy
Over the last 25 years Regus has evolved 
to meet the changing work needs of 
business, providing our customers with 
superior space and support regardless of 
when, where or how they work. We believe 
that now is the right time to expand and 
lay the foundations for a much larger and 
more proﬁ table business. 
Our growth strategy is based upon 
increasing the proﬁ t generation and cash 
ﬂ ows from our mature centres which 
enables us to invest in our network and 
thereby generate attractive returns and 
increased earnings per share over the 
long term. 
While pursuing our strategy, we also strive 
to be good corporate citizens. We are 
committed to sustainable business 
practices and dedicated to promoting and 
enabling the shift to ﬂ exible working in the 
economy. By doing so, we strengthen our 
business and help our customers improve 
their productivity while reducing both 
costs and carbon emissions through 
more effective use of space and reducing 
the need for travel. We are also committed 
to reducing our own impact on the 
environment, implementing systems and 
processes to ensure we use resources in 
a suitable and responsible way. We also 
actively back our team members’ initiatives 
to support the local communities in which 
we operate.
Board update 
During the year Florence Pierre joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director, 
complementing its existing skills and 
diversity. Following an external evaluation 
in 2012, an internal Board review was 
conducted in 2013. The results of this 
evaluation were used to improve the 
processes and effectiveness of the Board. 
No reportable matters were identiﬁ ed and 
we continue to have full conﬁ dence in the 
Board’s members and processes. 
Our people
Each of the Non-Executive Directors was 
able to attend a portion of the Group’s 
annual planning conference in November 
in which more than 150 senior managers 
from around the world actively participated. 
It was clear from observation of the 
participants’ plans that management’s 
focus on the people in these key roles 
is paying off in terms of our ability to 
innovate and deliver results as we execute 
our strategy.
I would like to thank each and every one 
of our team members for their unrelenting 
passion and commitment. Building Regus 
is a challenging and rewarding endeavour 
which is only achieved through their hard 
work and dedication.
Dividend
Given the continued strong performance of 
the business the Board is recommending 
a ﬁ nal dividend of 2.5p. Subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the 2013 
AGM this will be paid on 30 May 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 2 May 2014. This represents 
an increase in the full year dividend of 13% 
to 3.6p (2012: 3.2p).

The Group had an active and successful year. We have 
again demonstrated our ability to deliver a strong ﬁ nancial 
performance while expanding our global network and 
deepening our local in-country networks. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
MARK DIXON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Following a record year of growth we 
have ﬁ rmly established ourselves with an 
unrivalled global network. At the same 
time we also strengthened our presence at 
both a local and national level across the 
100 countries in which we now operate. 
As we embed our business more deeply 
into local communities, we take seriously 
our commitment to support them. The 
endeavours of our team members, with 
the backing of the business, have helped 
thousands of individuals around the world 
and I thank them for their efforts. 
Group revenues increased by 23.3% to 
£1,533.5m (2012: £1,244.1m) reﬂ ecting 
the signiﬁ cant expansion of our network. 
In total £301.1m was invested in growth 
(2012: £178.4m), the result of which 
was a 30% increase in business centre 
locations to 1,831 (2012: 1,411). At the 
same time operating proﬁ t was marginally 
up at £90.8m (2012: £90.2m). Given the 
scale, pace and costs of growth, this is a 
strong result.
Our Mature business remains the 
proﬁ t and cash engine of the Group. 
Operating proﬁ ts rose by 33% to £205.3m, 
in part due to further improvements to 
yield management, with free cash ﬂ ow 
(after tax, ﬁ nance costs and maintenance 
capital expenditure) at £156.5m (16.6p 
per share), on the back of revenues up 
3.7% to £1,226.3m. Mature EPS also 
increased by 34% to 17.0p (2012: 12.7p).
Costs remain ﬁ rmly under control, 
notwithstanding the signiﬁ cant investment 
required to support growth. Improved 
efﬁ ciency and scale continued to deliver 
beneﬁ ts, with overheads (excluding 
Research & Development) on a per-
available-workstation basis down by 3.8%.
We have been able to deliver this 
performance in large part due to the 
fundamental improvements to our country 
management structure. These results 
clearly reﬂ ect the quality of our team 
and their skill in making the right, often 
tough, decisions to drive performance 
in what remained a challenging 
macro environment.
We continue to respond to the 
fundamental changes affecting how we 
all work, namely the shift from a ﬁ xed to 
a ﬂ exible mode of working. Our fortunes 
are inextricably linked to progress and 
developments in this high-growth market. 
Among the core drivers of growth for 
Regus are the signiﬁ cant cost savings 
associated with moving to more ﬂ exible 
workplace arrangement and outsourcing 
this to specialist providers such as Regus, 
as well as continued technological 
advances, which allow us to work 
from anywhere. Other drivers include 
demographic changes, sustainability 
and the growing societal importance of 
work-life balance. As a result, ﬂ exible 
working has come to be viewed as a 
core element of the way organisations 
operate and conduct business.

Our business model has continually 
evolved to reﬂ ect the changing work 
needs of business and individuals. 
Our over-arching aim has always been to 
provide our customers with the best 
possible help and support in deciding 
where and how they work. In doing so we 
have created a strong and vibrant business 
which generates signiﬁ cant long-term 
shareholder returns.
I will now review the performance of 
our business. 
It has been another year of signiﬁ cant achievement for 
Regus. These strong results underline the fundamental 
strengths of our business and its forward momentum in 
a growing market. 16 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Performance against our strategic 
objectives
Improve profi tability
The performance of our core Mature 
Centres business (centres opened on or 
before 31 December 2011) underpins 
all growth activity within the Group. 
We remain pleased with the levels of 
occupancy, averaging 83.8% through the 
year, and the improvement of REVPOW 
to £7,750, an increase of 4.3% (up £321), 
a sign of robust yield management. 
This healthy occupancy and increased 
REVPOW drove incremental revenue 
growth which, with operational gearing, 
is then reﬂ ected in the improvement in 
mature gross proﬁ t margin to 29.3% 
(2012: 27.8%).
The 2011 new centres, which joined the 
mature estate in 2013, signiﬁ cantly closed 
the gap with the existing mature estate 
and are now performing at a similar 
gross proﬁ t before depreciation and 
amortisation margin. 
Our New Centres business (centres 
opened on or after 1 January 2012) has 
equally performed well and in line with 
expectations. Our primary objective is to 
ensure that all new centres perform in line 
with the rest of the mature estate as soon 
as possible.
• The ﬁ nancial maturity proﬁ le of our 2012 
centres is in line with expectations. 
These generated £139.4m of revenue 
and made a positive centre contribution 
of £6.9m. This translated into a gross 
proﬁ t margin before depreciation and 
amortisation of 15.1%.
• The 448 centres that we added during 
2013 generated revenues of £159.4m 
and made a centre contribution of 
£7.3m, in line with our expectations. 
Within this the acquisition of MWB has 
contributed strongly at the gross 
proﬁ t level.
• The heavy overhead investment required 
to open and support these new centres 
resulted in a drag of £114.0m on the 
Group’s operating proﬁ t (2012: £62.6m). 
Develop national networks
This has been a record period of growth 
for Regus. We have opened more than 
500 locations – 448 business centres and 
76 third place. In doing so we expanded 
our reach and enhanced our long-term 
earnings potential.
It is a testament to the fundamental 
strength of our business model, the 
robustness of our systems and processes 
and the skill and determination of our 
teams around the world that we have been 
able to execute this part of our strategy 
whilst also maintaining our day-to-day 
operational performance at such a 
consistently high level.
When a business looks to outsource its 
workplace requirements, location is 
typically the primary consideration. It is 
for this reason that we are investing in 
local and national networks, taking the 
products and services we provide closer 
to where business needs us to be. 
Growth, therefore, both in our core 
business centre network and into third 
place locations such as airports, retail 
outlets and community centres, is a key 
objective for the Group. 
This year we expect to add at least 300 
new business centres, and many new 
third place locations. We continue to ﬁ nd 
plenty of opportunities, both organic 
and through acquisition, to grow our 
network on terms that meet our stringent 
investment criteria and which are capable 
of delivering long-term sustainable returns. 
The integration of MWB into our UK 
business, achieving all identiﬁ ed synergies, 
provides a clear demonstration of 
our ability to deliver value through 
incremental acquisitions.
As we grew we also continued to improve 
the composition of our business with 84% 
of leases now either ﬂ exible or variable 
(2012: 82%).
Our growing network is attractive to the 
increasing numbers of businesses looking 
to outsource their workplace needs and 
adopt more ﬂ exible working practices in 
general. As a consequence, end user 
demand for Regus products and services 
remains strong. Over the course of 2013 
customer numbers increased by more than 
200,000 to 1.58m. 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s review
continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 17
Attracting more large corporate customers 
to our business remains a key priority. 
We believe our network scale and reach is 
an important and crucial differentiator as 
these organisations seek to rationalise their 
small-ofﬁ ce networks, move towards more 
ﬂ exible work arrangements and reduce 
ﬁ xed costs. Notable new wins and contract 
extensions amongst many include: Twitter, 
whom we helped open in 12 new countries 
over the year; Toshiba, supporting 1,000 
of their Retail Point-of-Sales team across 
14 countries; and, Electronic Arts, 
supporting them in markets such as China 
and Russia as well as opening in new ones 
across Europe and Asia. We also extended 
our relationships with Apple, Accenture, 
EDF Energy and RBS amongst others.
Industry leading innovation
The quality and breadth of Regus locations 
and associated products and services 
are core to our differentiation and, are 
why customers choose to work with us. 
We recognise that innovation is at the core 
of maintaining our market-leading position 
– we invest in Research & Development 
to ensure we stay ahead of the curve 
and continue to develop the locations, 
products and services that attract 
customers to Regus. Over the period 
we invested £7.2m in Research & 
Development (2012: £4.5m). This ensures 
we are best placed to anticipate and 
respond to the needs of our customers. 
It also helps us deﬁ ne the workplace 
sector, thereby enhancing our leadership 
position.
During 2013 we continued development in 
a number of important areas, not least with 
regards to the IT and telephony services 
we provide to customers. One of the core 
attractions of Regus to mobile workers 
is the way that we can improve their 
productivity while they are on the move; 
our cloud printing solution DocStation has 
proved popular and continues to be rolled 
out globally. We also concluded market 
testing of the WorkBox concept. This is 
a self-contained, fully resourced private 
workspace with a footprint of four square 
metres, ideal for locations with high 
transient footfall such as airports and 
service stations. We intend to begin 
deployment in 2014.
Third place continues to make encouraging 
progress and is a fundamental part of our 
growth strategy. Over the last year we 
extended our relationship with Shell and 
signed agreements to add additional 
locations to the UK motorway network. 
Since year-end we signed our ﬁ rst deal 
outside Europe with the Singapore 
Government for the placing of facilities 
in public libraries. We have also signed 
agreements to open drop-in business 
lounges at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. 
Given the scale of the market opportunity 
we are encouraged by both end user 
adoption and interest from potential new 
partners. This is driving rapid growth; 
however, in the context of our signiﬁ cant 
business centre operation it remains small 
at this stage.
Cost control
One of the fundamental strengths of 
our business is its ability to grow and 
leverage the beneﬁ ts of additional scale. 
Despite signiﬁ cant investment in growth, 
total overheads (excluding investment in 
Research & Development) as a percentage 
of revenue reduced marginally to 18.0%. 
Against an increase in the network of 30%, 
total overheads (excluding investment 
in Research & Development and MWB 
related transaction and restructuring costs) 
increased by 19.0%. In addition to the 
scale beneﬁ ts mentioned earlier two 
other factors are driving this improvement, 
namely the delayering and strengthening 
of management and automation of our 
back-ofﬁ ce processes. The standardisation 
of repeatable tasks in our back ofﬁ ce 
allows us to concentrate activities within 
our single service centre in Manila and 
harmonise service levels, bringing 
signiﬁ cant productivity gains and freeing up 
centre teams for higher-value-add tasks.
A high performing team
No commentary on our business 
performance would be complete without 
reference to our dedicated workforce, 
without whose efforts we could not have 
achieved the progress we have made 
so far. Our ability to deliver at the local 
level becomes ever more dependent 
on the strength of our local, in-country 
management teams. In many respects 
this performance is a direct result of the 
management and structural improvements 
we have made at both a Group and a 
country level and the devolution of 
day-to-day operational decision making. 
This process continues and we are 
making signiﬁ cant hires within all country 
management teams as we expand.
As a service-based business the strength 
and capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team are critical to 
achieving our objectives. We recognise the 
importance of people development and the 
Regus Online Learning Academy together 
with a wide range of additional initiatives 
gives our team members the opportunity 
to learn and enhance the skills that will 
ensure they are capable of achieving their 
career ambitions. We are committed to a 
fair approach and equal opportunities in all 
areas of our business.
Culturally we employ more than 100 
nationalities and, with regard to gender, we 
aim to achieve broadly equal outcomes for 
women and men. For the Group as 
a whole our workforce is 70% female: 
30% male; at a Group operational level 
the breakdown is broadly equal, and at a 
senior management level 30% of positions 
are held by women. We successfully 
recruit, train, promote and retain skilled 
and motivated team members with very 
diverse backgrounds. This is a core 
strength and critical to the successful 
development of our business.
Operational Review
Over the year the Group added 448 new 
centres (2012: 243) with the total number 
as of 31 December 2013 standing at 1,831 
(2012: 1,411). This growth resulted in an 
increase in total workstation capacity 
(including non-consolidated workstations) 
of 26.9% to 304,774 and the number 
of consolidated workstations as at 31 
December 2013 by 27.5% to 292,655.
To review our business more meaningfully, 
we will concentrate on our Mature 
business performance development, 
which represents like-for-like business.

196 centres. This increased our network 
to 875 business centre locations and 
took us into 83 new cities and markets 
including: Beverly Hills, California; 
St Pauls, Minnesota; and Langley, 
Canada. This growth contributed to a 
27% increase in the average number 
of consolidated workstations from 
90,617 in 2012 to 114,984 in 2013.

This geographically diverse business 
also delivered a strong performance in 
spite of challenges in some markets. 
Mature revenues were up 2.2% at constant 
currency to £298.3m (up 5.2% at actual 
rates), and achieved an average mature 
occupancy of 81.4% (2012: 80.9%). 
Mature gross margin remained stable at 
27.7% (2012: 27.6%). During the year, 
we added 126 centres, increasing our 
network to 450 business centre locations, 
and opening in 23 new cities including: 
Pretoria, South Africa; Naples, Italy; and 
Dortmund, Germany. This contributed to 
a 13% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 41,531 in 
2012 to 46,973 in 2013.
Asia Pacifi c
Our APAC business continued its robust 
performance delivering mature revenues of 
£181.6m, up 3.2% on constant currency 
(down 1.7% at actual rates) and achieved 
an average mature occupancy of 83.5% 
(2012: 83.3%). Mature gross margins 
improved to 32.3% (2012: 31.2%). 
During the year we added 58 new centre 
openings, increasing the network to 290 
business centre locations, and opening in 
ten new cities, including: Ningbo, China; 
Penang, Malaysia; and Kathmandu, Nepal, 
our 100th country. This contributed to a 
37% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 34,557 in 
2012 to 47,188 in 2013. 
UK
Our UK business made further strong 
progress delivering mature revenues of 
£210.7m, up 3.8% on 2012. Mature gross 
margins improved to 23.9% (2012: 18.5%) 
and average mature occupancy remained 
healthy at 82.8% (2012: 83.1%). Including 
the acquisition of MWB, 68 new business 
centre locations were added increasing 
the network to 216. This resulted in a 
34% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 37,754 in 
2012 to 50,630 in 2013. It is important to 
note that the integration of MWB went as 
planned and we remain on track to achieve 
the identiﬁ ed synergy savings.
Outlook
Our business is in a strong position. We 
are well positioned to continue to grow our 
networks, customer base and earnings 
in 2014.
Strengthening and expanding our network 
is core to ensuring we continue to generate 
incremental returns over the medium term. 
At this early point in the year it is difﬁ cult to 
predict precisely how many locations we 
will add, but we expect to grow by at least 
300 new business centres during 2014 as 
well as add more third place locations.
Growth, when coupled with increased 
investment in innovation, will create 
additional demand for Regus’ products 
and services, especially from large 
corporates as they seek help in 
transitioning from ﬁ xed to ﬂ exible working. 
The overriding focus, therefore, remains on 
ﬁ nding opportunities that meet our strict 
ﬁ nancial returns criteria and are consistent 
with our strategic objectives.
Current trading is good, although the 
strengthening of sterling in recent months 
will affect the translation of our results. 
Notwithstanding this, we remain conﬁ dent 
in our business model and our prospects 
for the year ahead.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
DOMINIQUE YATES, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
We have added 448 new centres, slightly 
ahead of revised guidance in October, 
and delivered full year results in line with 
management expectations. It is also 
important to highlight that this was 
achieved as sterling strengthened 
signiﬁ cantly in the ﬁ nal quarter. It is 
testament to the strength of our core 
mature business that, while we grew the 
network by 30%, and incurred £7.4m 
of transaction and restructuring costs 
related to the acquisition of MWB 
Business Exchange and carried signiﬁ cant 
incremental overhead in MWB in the ﬁ rst 
half of the year, we nevertheless marginally 
increased Group statutory operating proﬁ t 
to £90.8m (2012: £90.2m).
To fully appreciate the underlying 
performance of the Group it is important 
to look at the Mature and New businesses 
separately. We have consistently 
highlighted mature proﬁ tability as being 
more representative of the performance 
of the business – mature, like-for-like 
operating proﬁ t increased 33% to £205.3m 
(2012: £154.6m).
A record investment of £301.1m in growing 
our business moved us from a net cash 
position of £120m at 31 December 2012 
to a net debt position of £57.2m at 
31 December 2013. This was a more 
favourable closing position than we 
originally anticipated due mainly to timing 
differences, particularly in relation to growth 
capital expenditure payments. We continue 
to monitor the appropriate level of ﬁ nancial 
capacity to grow our business and support 
our strategy whilst ensuring we maintain a 
prudent capital structure. 
In recognition of the Group’s continued 
ﬁ nancial and operational progress, the 
Board declared a 14% increase in the 
ﬁ nal dividend from 2.2p to 2.5p. This 
represents a 13% increase in the total 
dividend to 3.6p (2012: 3.2p).
Improving performance of our Mature 
Centres business (centres opened on 
or before 31 December 2011) 
At the end of December 2013, we had 
1,144 centres in the Mature business. 
Reﬂ ecting the recent scale of our new 
opening programme, the mature network 
represented approximately 62% of our 
global portfolio at the end of 2013. 
We remain clearly focused on enhancing 
the proﬁ t performance of our Mature 
Centres business at centre level (gross 
proﬁ t), whilst delivering further overhead 
efﬁ ciencies to generate a higher 
operating margin.
We are pleased with the performance of 
our Mature Centres business. Revenue 
grew 3.7% on a like-for-like basis to 
£1,226.3m and mature REVPOW improved 
to £7,750, an increase of 4.3% (£321). 
This is a strong performance and continues 
the trend of incremental yield improvement 
experienced since the second half of 2011.  
Average mature occupancy for 2013 
remained strong at 83.8% (2012: 84.5%).
Gross proﬁ t (centre contribution) 
increased to £359.0m from £328.3m, an 
improvement of 9%. Accordingly the gross 
margin increased from 27.8% to 29.3% 
reﬂ ecting the operational leverage beneﬁ t 
of higher revenue (in part from the further 
maturation of the 2011 centre additions) 
and our strong discipline over managing 
centre costs.

Overheads allocated to the Mature Centres 
business reduced from £173.4m in the 
corresponding period to £153.8m as 
the Group continues to beneﬁ t from 
economies of scale, reducing overhead 
costs per available workstation. 
Correspondingly, overheads as a

from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.5% for 2013 
as we make further progress towards our 
target of 12%. 
As a result, our mature operating proﬁ t 
increased 33% from £154.6m to £205.3m, 
improving the operating margin from 
13.1% to 16.7%. Mature EBITDA 
increased from £216.8m to £272.1m 
with the EBITDA margin improving from 
18.3% to 22.2%.
The following table sets out the EPS 
calculation for our Mature business. 
In management’s view, this provides 
a more representative picture of the 
underlying operating performance of 
the business.

Mature proﬁ t

Mature EPS (p) 17.0 12.7 34%
Commensurate with the strong advance in 
operating proﬁ t, mature EPS improved by 
34% to 17.0p.
Cash generation remains an attractive 
characteristic of the Mature business. 
Once more, the conversion of mature 
proﬁ tability into cash has been strong, 
thereby continuing to contribute to the 
funding of our new centre growth.

The Mature business experienced a 
£21.3m working capital outﬂ ow in 2013 
which represents 1.6% of Group gross 
working capital balances and is mainly 
due to timing differences. Maintenance 
capital expenditure for the year was 
£53.2m (2012: £58.0m), representing 
4.3% of mature revenues (2012: 4.9%); 
in line with our guidance of 4-5%.
The resulting 4.5% increase in mature 
free cash ﬂ ow to £156.5m represents 
16.6p per share or a free cash ﬂ ow 
margin of 12.8%.
Total overheads (SG&A and R&D) allocation methodology 
We constantly monitor the 
appropriateness of the assumptions 
underlying our cost allocation 
methodology. As the business continues 
to beneﬁ t from economies of scale, 
we reviewed the original estimation 
of the cost of getting a new centre to 
the point of opening and considered it 
appropriate to reduce our estimation 
to approximately £110,000 compared 
with the previous cost of £130,000.
Accordingly, we therefore applied this 
new cost to additions from 1 January 
2013. This estimate adjustment and 
the treatment of the actual overhead 
costs of MWB in the ﬁ rst half of the year 
aside, the methodology by which we 
have allocated overheads by maturity 
is consistent with that used in previous 
years and continues to reﬂ ect the 
activity drivers in each part of the 
business.
There are four elements to the 
allocation methodology:
• It is estimated that 90% of property 
team costs are spent on supporting 
our growth programme;
• As revised, each new centre costs 
approximately £110,000 to get to 
the stage of opening (£130,000 per 
centre for 2012 and earlier periods). 
This reﬂ ects the cost of management 
time, sales and marketing set-up 
costs (these costs are deducted 
before the allocation of sales and 
marketing costs as outlined below), 
human resources recruitment and 
training costs, and administrative and 
ﬁ nance set-up costs;
• For the remainder of the sales and 
marketing costs the principle is that 
the allocation is made on the basis of 
new workstation sales as the nature 
of the spend is to generate new 
enquiries and convert these into 
new sales; and,
• For all other overhead costs we follow 
the principle of allocating the costs 
pro-rata by reference to available 
workstation numbers.
As we noted with our interim results, 
the acquisition in February of MWB 
resulted in signiﬁ cant transaction and 
restructuring costs and it also came 
with a signiﬁ cant overhead base (to 
support its 64 centres). This acquisition 
therefore generated an initial cost proﬁ le 
fundamentally different to that more 
normally associated with our new centre 
opening and acquisition programme.
Therefore we felt it inappropriate to 
apply the overhead cost allocation 
methodology to MWB in the ﬁ rst half of 
2013 and instead reﬂ ected the actual 
reported overhead cost base of the 
business, including all transaction and 
restructuring-related expenses, in new 
centre overheads.
In the second half of the year, we 
applied the normal allocation 
methodology as the business was fully 
absorbed into the UK business and 
supported by a single overhead cost 
base. Consequently these reported 
results for 2013 show the performance 
of the MWB centres within the new 
2013 centre additions on an actual cost 
basis for the ﬁ rst half and as part of the 
normal cost allocation exercise for the 
second half. We believe this blended 
approach provides shareholders with 
the best representation of the underlying 
performance of both the New Centre 
and Mature Centre businesses.

Building the returns from our New 
Centres business (centres opened on 
or after 1 January 2012)
In total there were 687 new centres at the 
end of 2013. Overall, these represented a 
material investment and, with the notable 
increase in the pace of openings, provide 
a signiﬁ cant drag on the Group’s income 
statement. This arises from the substantial 
investment in central overheads to support 
this growth and the initial negative gross 
margin while occupancy builds. More 
importantly, the performance of our new 
centres continues to be in line with 
management’s expectations. However, it is 
important to remember that the way new 
centres develop ﬁ nancially is inﬂ uenced 
by factors such as, but not limited to, 
geography, the timing of opening, and 
by deal type. 
The table below illustrates the material 
impact on the income statement of these 
new additions.
New Centre performance
£m 2013 2012
2012 openings 139.4 39.0
2013 openings 159.4 –
Revenues 298.8 39.0
2012 openings 6.9 (8.7)
2013 openings 7.3 –
Gross proﬁ t (centre 
contribution) 14.2 (8.7)
Overheads (120.8) (53.9)
MWB transaction 
and restructuring 
related costs (7.4) –
Operating proﬁ t (114.0) (62.6)
EBITDA (83.7) (56.8)
The 2012 openings are progressing to 
maturity in line with management’s 
expectations. With the large number of 
openings in 2012 towards the end of the 
year, these centres weighed on proﬁ tability 
in the ﬁ rst half of 2013. As expected, 
however, they continued to ﬁ ll rapidly and 
reversed the £1.6m negative contribution 
in the ﬁ rst half to a positive contribution 
for the year overall of £6.9m, achieving 
a gross proﬁ t margin before depreciation 
and amortisation of 15.1% for the year. 
Inclusion of MWB in the results for the 
2013 new centre additions, following its 
acquisition at the end of February, resulted 
in a positive gross proﬁ t contribution from 
this year group in 2013. Overall, these new 
centre additions remain on track to deliver 
the anticipated performance.
The allocation of central overheads to 
support the new 2012 and 2013 centres, 
together with the actual costs relating to 
the MWB centres for the six months to 
30 June 2013, increased signiﬁ cantly to 
£128.2m (2012: £53.9m) as the overall 
number of new centres increased to 
687 (2012: 243) and the pace of 
openings accelerated.
Consequently the negative contribution 
to Group operating proﬁ t in 2013 from 
the new centres increased to £114.0m 
(2012: £62.6m) 
Developing the network through our 
New Centres business 
We signiﬁ cantly expanded the network 
during 2013, adding a record 448 centres. 
This level of activity is slightly ahead of the 
420-440 new additions guidance we 
provided in our Q3 Interim Management 
Statement. Growth on such a scale means 
it is challenging to gauge precisely when 
centres will open or an acquisition will 
complete. As we did in 2012, we had an 
active fourth quarter in 2013 when, in total, 
we added 156 centres, more than the total 
number of centres opened in the whole 
of 2011. At the end of December 2013 
we had 687 net new centres, comprising 
38% of the total number of centres. 
On 1 January 2014, 239 of the centres 
added in 2012 graduated into our 
Mature Centre business.
We continue to have a good pipeline of 
new openings. Customer demand for 
more convenient and ﬂ exible workplaces 
continues to be strong and, whilst 
attractive investment opportunities 
delivering above our hurdle rate of internal 
return are available, we will continue to 
grow our network. We expect to add 
at least 300 business centre locations 
this year. This will take us through our 
previously stated target of at least 
2,000 centres by 2014, which served its 
purpose in demonstrating the scale of the 
Group’s growth aspirations over the last 
three years.
We will complement this centre growth 
with a signiﬁ cant number of additional 
third place locations, further increasing the 
convenience of our network in a capital 
efﬁ cient manner. Our third place business 
continues to develop and while we are 
encouraged with progress made to date, 
it still remains too early to provide any 
meaningful representation of performance.
Every potential investment is rigorously 
evaluated by the Investment Committee 
and has to meet stringent ﬁ nancial hurdles 
before being approved. This is a process 
to which we apply maximum focus, given 
how critical the original investment decision 
is to our ultimate success. The integration 
of MWB into our UK business achieved 
all identiﬁ ed synergy beneﬁ ts, providing a 
clear demonstration of our ability to deliver 
value through acquisitions.
We set out below the signiﬁ cant cash ﬂ ow 
impact of the investment in new centres: 
£m 2013 2012
EBITDA (83.7) (56.8)
Working capital 
(estimated) 85.4 25.9
Growth capital 
expenditure (320.6) (161.3)
Finance costs (4.1) (0.6)
Tax 21.9 14.4
Net investment in new 
centres (301.1) (178.4)
During 2013 the amount invested in 
growth increased materially to £301.1m 
(2012: £178.4m) adding 448 centres 
which represented a 30% increase in the 
network. The new centres continue to 
have a signiﬁ cant positive impact on 
working capital.
Closures
During 2013 we closed, relocated or 
resized 28 centres (2012: 26). These 
centres contributed a modest operating 
loss of £0.5m, against a loss of £1.8m 
in the corresponding period.
Overheads
Increased R&D (including Third Place 
overheads) investment
We consistently invest in areas which 
improve our competitive advantage and 
help differentiate us from other market 
participants within a highly fragmented 
but competitive landscape. Expenditure 
on Research & Development for 2013 
increased 60% to £7.2m (2012: £4.5m). 
Maintained discipline on Selling General 
and Administrative expenses (SG&A) 
2013 has been another period of 
signiﬁ cant expansion for Regus and we 
have continued to invest to support our 
growing business. We have done this 
whilst maintaining a resolute focus on cost 
discipline. Total Group SG&A costs 
(excluding Research & Development) as a 
percentage of revenues declined modestly 
to 18.0% compared with 18.1% in 2012. 
As well as investing to support the 
resource hungry new centre growth, 
2013 also included £7.4m of transaction 
and restructuring costs related to the 
acquisition of MWB as well as a level 
of associated overheads during the  22 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s review
continued
integration phase well above the 
incremental overhead now required to 
support the combined UK business. 
Notwithstanding this, total SG&A 
(excluding Research & Development) 
costs per available workstation reduced 
by 3.8% reﬂ ecting further underlying 
improvement in overhead efﬁ ciency. 
Furthermore, investment in people, as well 
as increased automation, have improved 
efﬁ ciency and is reﬂ ected in the increase 
in number of workstations supported per 
full time equivalent overhead employee to 
97.6 (2012: 76.9)
Net fi nance costs
As anticipated, the signiﬁ cant investment in 
New Centre growth moved the Group into 
a net debt position. As a consequence the 
net ﬁ nance charge increased to £9.3m 
(2012: £5.1m). Within this year’s charge 
is £3.8m of fees relating to the loan and 
guarantee facilities, of which approximately 
£0.5m resulted from the extension and 
amendment in September of our loan 
facility by £120m to £320m. 
Utilisation of this facility has resulted in 
additional interest payments of £1.6m.
The Group also incurred a notional, 
non-cash, interest charge of £2.1m 
(2012: £1.4m) relating to the accounting 
treatment of fair value adjustments on 
various acquisitions. The fair value 
adjustment relating to the acquisition of 
MWB during 2013 added approximately 
£0.9m to the notional charge for 2013.
Tax 
The tax charge for the year was 17.9% 
(2012: 16.7%). This tax rate is consistent 
with our anticipated long-term effective 
tax rate of 20% as it continued to beneﬁ t 
in 2013 from the accounting changes 
implemented in 2012.
Earnings per share
Group earnings per share, after costs 
associated with the acquisition and 
integration of MWB, were 7.1p (2012: 
7.5p), primarily reﬂ ecting the higher 
interest costs associated with growing 
the business. 
The weighted average number of shares in 
issue for the year was 943,775,413 (2012: 
941,921,816), as shares were issued to 
satisfy the exercise of a number of share 
grants by employees during the year.

new centres compared to £178.4m in 
the corresponding period, with 448 and 
243 centres added in 2013 and 2012 
respectively. Although the free cash ﬂ ow 
from the Mature Centre business continues 
to fund a sizeable proportion of this 
growth, the step up in expansion in 2013, 
together with the dividend distributions, 
has resulted in a signiﬁ cant net cash 
outﬂ ow for the business. We ended the 
year with a net debt position of £57.2m. 
This was slightly better than expected, 
mainly due to timing differences, 
particularly in relation to growth capital 
expenditure payments.
As our business grows in scale so does 
our ability to fund future growth from 
internal cash generation. We believe that, 
all other things being equal, we are able 
to support approximately 15% annual 
business centre growth from internally 
generated funds. Currently we anticipate 
adding at least 300 business centres and a 
signiﬁ cant number of third place locations 
in 2014. Accordingly, during 2014 we may 
further utilise our revolving credit facility 
which was amended and extended by 
£120m to £320m in September 2013. 
It has a ﬁ nal maturity date in September 
2017 with conditions that are substantially 
unchanged from last year. The facility is 
provided by a consortium of nine banks 
including all six of our original banking 
partners. We continue to maintain a 
prudent approach to balance sheet 
funding while ensuring the Group has 
the appropriate ﬁ nancial headroom to 
execute its strategy. 
The Group is driven by risk-adjusted 
returns and will only continue to invest 
if the macro environment is favourable 
and investment performance meets our 
exacting returns criteria. Accordingly, 
we have always indicated that we can 
quickly curtail growth in the event that 
we determine a need to do so.
Foreign exchange
The Group’s results are exposed to 
translation risk from the movement in 
currencies. Overall for 2013 the movement 
in exchange rates during the period was 
marginally beneﬁ cial and increased 
reported revenue, gross proﬁ t and 
operating proﬁ t by £20.2m, £4.9m, and 
£1.2m respectively over the corresponding 
period last year, with the weakening of 
sterling against the US dollar having the 
greatest impact.
Whilst sterling remained weak for much 
of the year, it strengthened considerably 
in the ﬁ nal quarter against many of the 
currencies we operate in. Set out in the 
table below are some of the principal 
exchange rates affecting the Group’s 
overseas proﬁ ts and net assets.
The average rates for these three 
major currencies for the nine months to 
30 September 2013 were 1.54, 1.17 and 
149 respectively. By the end of the year 
sterling had strengthened against the 
US dollar by 7.1%, against the euro by 
2.6% and 16.8% against the Japanese 
yen when compared to the nine 
month averages.
This appreciation of sterling has continued 
so far into the current ﬁ nancial year and 
will impact the ﬁ nancial results of our 
operations when translated into sterling.
Related parties
There have been no changes to the type of 
related party transactions entered into by 
the Group that had a material effect on the 
ﬁ nancial statements for the period ended 
31 December 2013. Details of related party 
transactions that have taken place in the 
period can be found in note 29 to the 2013 
Annual Report and Accounts (page 101).
Dividends
Consistent with Regus’ progressive 
dividend policy and subject to shareholder 
approval, we will increase the ﬁ nal dividend 
for 2013 by approximately 14% to 2.5p 
(2112: 2.2p). This will be paid on Friday 
30 May 2014, to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 
Friday 2 May 2014. This represents an 
increase in the full year dividend of 13%, 
taking it from 3.2p for 2012 to 3.6p 
for 2013.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Effective risk management requires awareness and 
engagement at all levels of our organisation. It is for this 
reason that risk management is incorporated into the 
day-to-day management of our business, as well as being 
reﬂ ected in the Group’s core processes and controls. The 
Board oversees the risk management strategy and the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control framework.
Risk Management
The successful delivery of Regus’ strategy 
depends on our ability to identify and 
manage the risks associated with 
our business. 
Risk management is at the heart of 
everything we do, particularly as we look 
to grow across multiple markets around 
the world. For this reason, we conduct 
risk assessments throughout the year 
as part of our business review process 
and all our investment decisions. 
These activities include:
• Monthly business reviews of all countries 
and Group functions 
• Individual reviews of every new centre

Risk Mitigation Progress in 2013
Strategic
Lease obligations – The single 
greatest ﬁ nancial risk to Regus 
is represented by the ﬁ nancial 
commitments deriving from the 
portfolio of leases held across 
the Group.
Whilst Regus has demonstrated 
consistently that it has a 
fundamentally proﬁ table business 
model which works in all 
geographies, the proﬁ tability of 
centres is impacted by 
movements in market rents, 
which, in turn, impact the price 
at which Regus can sell to 
its customers.
The fact that the outstanding 
lease terms with our landlords 
are, on average, signiﬁ cantly 
longer than the outstanding 
terms on our contracts with our 
customers creates a potential 
mismatch if rentals fall 
signiﬁ cantly which can impact 
proﬁ tability and cash ﬂ ows.
This risk is mitigated in a number of ways:
1)  84% of our leases are ‘ﬂ exible’, meaning that they are 
terminable at our option within six months and are structurally 
independent. In this way, individual centres are sustained by 
their own proﬁ tability and cash ﬂ ow. During the recent downturn 
this ﬂ exibility enabled us to negotiate revised lease terms with 
our landlords to reﬂ ect downward movements in market rental 
rates and return affected centres to proﬁ tability.
2)  Around a quarter of our leases with landlords are variable in 
nature, which means that payments to landlords vary with the 
performance of the relevant centre. In this way the ‘risk’ to 
proﬁ tability and cash ﬂ ow of that centre from ﬂ uctuations in 
market rates is softened by the consequent adjustment to rental 
costs. In a growing number of cases, we take no risk at all since 
the lease is signed by a partner who also undertakes all of the 
capital investment and pays us a ﬁ xed percentage of revenues 
as well as a share of centre proﬁ t.
3)  The sheer number of leases and geographic diversity of our 
business reduces the overall risk to our business as the 
phasing of the business cycle and the performance of the 
commercial property market vary from country to country 
and region to region.
During 2013, the number 
of ‘ﬂ exible’ leases as a 
percentage of the total 
increased from 82% to 84%. 
At the end of 2013, we were 
operating 1,831 centres 
(up from 1,411 at the end 
of 2012) in 684 cities.
Economic downturn – An 
economic downturn could 
adversely affect the Group’s 
operating revenues thereby 
reducing operating performance 
or, in an extreme downturn, 
result in operating losses.
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
1)  Almost a quarter of our leases are performance-related to a 
greater or lesser extent and our rental payments, if any, vary 
with revenues earned by the centre.
2)  Lease contracts include break clauses when leases can be 
terminated at our behest. The Group also looks to stagger 
leases in locations where we have multiple centres so that we 
can manage our overall inventory in those locations.
3)  We review our customer base to assess exposure to a particular 
customer or industry group.
4)  The increasing geographic spread of the Group’s network 
increases the depth and breadth of our business and provides 
better protection from an economic downturn in a single market 
or region.
We increased the number 
of centres operating on 
performance related leases 
by 25%.
We also increased the scale 
of our network by 30% to 
1,831 business centre 
locations.
Our monthly business 
performance reviews provide 
early warning of any impact 
on our business performance 
and allows management to 
react with speed. More 
generally, investment in our 
management team has also 
led to improved decision-
making at a country and 
area level.
Shifting demand and technology 
trends – Demand for ﬂ exible 
working which has been aided 
by advancements in technology.
Regus continually invests in R&D to develop new products and 
services to increase its competitive advantage, protect current 
revenues and unlock potential new sources of revenue.
The Group increased spend 
on R&D by 60% in 2013. 26 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2013
Financial
Exchange rates – The Group has 
signiﬁ cant overseas operations 
whose businesses are generally 
conducted in the currency in 
which they operate. The principal 
exposures of the Group are to 
the US dollar and the euro 
with approximately 58% of 
the Group’s revenues being 
attributable to the US dollar 
and 16% to the euro.
The translation into sterling of 
overseas proﬁ ts and net assets 
will be affected by prevailing 
exchange rates. Any depreciation 
or appreciation would have an 
adverse or beneﬁ cial impact 
on the Group’s reported 
performance and position 
respectively.
1)  Given that transactions generally take place in the functional 
currency of Group companies, the Group’s exposure to 
transactional foreign exchange risk is limited.
2)  Where possible, the Group attempts to create natural hedges 
against currency exposures through matching income and 
expenses, and assets and liabilities, in the same currency.
Overall in 2013 the 
movement in exchange rates 
during the period was 
marginally beneﬁ cial and 
increased reported revenue, 
gross proﬁ t and operating 
proﬁ t by £20.2m, £4.9m 
and £1.2m respectively.
Funding – The Group relies on 
an element of external funding 
to support a net debt position 
of £57.2m at the end of 2013. 
The loss of these facilities 
would cause a liquidity issue 
for the Group.
The Group constantly monitors its cash ﬂ ow and ﬁ nancial 
headroom development and maintains a 12-month rolling forecast. 
The Group also monitors the relevant ﬁ nancial ratios against the 
covenants in the facility to ensure the risk of breach is 
being managed.
The Group also stresses these forecasts with downside scenario 
planning to assess risk and determine potential action plans.
Part of the annual planning process is a debt strategy and action 
plan to ensure that the Group will have sufﬁ cient funding in place 
to achieve its strategic objectives.
During 2013, the Group 
extended and amended its 
banking facility, which 
increased from £200m to 
£320m. The facility is 
committed until September 
2017 and there is signiﬁ cant 
headroom on each of the 
covenant ratios.
Operational
Loss of critical systems – 
The Group’s systems and 
applications are housed in a 
central data centre. Should the 
data centre be impacted as a 
result of circumstances outside 
the Group’s control there could 
be an adverse impact on the 
Group’s operations and therefore 
its ﬁ nancial results.
Regus manages this risk through:
1) Business continuity plans which are regularly tested.
2)  A detailed service agreement with our external data centre 
provider which incorporates back-up procedures and controls.
3) We have appropriate business interruption insurance.
During 2013, we undertook 
regular testing of business 
continuity procedures to 
ensure that they were 
adequate and appropriate.
Ensuring demand is there to 
support our growth – Regus has 
undertaken signiﬁ cant growth 
to develop local and national 
networks. Adding capacity 
carries the risk of creating 
overcapacity. Failure to ﬁ ll 
new centres would create a 
negative impact on the Group’s 
proﬁ tability and cash generation. 
Regus mitigates this risk as follows:
1)  Each investment or acquisition proposal is reviewed and 
approved by the Investment Committee which is composed 
of the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer.
2)  Part of the monthly business review process is the monitoring 
of new centre development against their investment case to 
ensure that the anticipated business progression and returns 
are being generated.
3)  As part of the annual planning process, a growth plan is agreed 
for each country which clearly sets out the growth objectives 
for the coming year in the context of a strategic plan. This plan 
includes the assessment of risks and the ideal mix of deal types 
to manage the risk.
In aggregate, our new 
centres continue to perform 
in line with management 
expectations and are 
delivering attractive returns.

Human Resources
Ability to recruit at the right level 
– Our ability to increase our 
management capacity and 
capabilities through the hiring 
of experienced professionals 
not only supports our ability to 
execute our growth strategy 
but also enables us to improve 
succession planning throughout 
the Group.
Mitigating actions include:
1)  Succession planning discussions as an integral part of our 
business planning and review process.
2)  The Human Resources Plan as part of the annual planning 
process. Performance against this plan is reviewed through 
the year.
3)  Regular external and internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board.
The strengthening of our 
senior management team 
and country management 
teams has been an ongoing 
activity over recent years. 
This investment in people is 
delivering a return, reﬂ ected 
in the ﬁ nancial performance 
of the Group.
During 2013, we also 
increased the size and 
diversity of our Board with 
the addition of Florence 
Pierre in May.
Training and employee 
engagement – As we are a 
service based business the 
performance and future 
capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team 
are critical to achieving our 
strategic objectives.
One of the key items in the Human Resources Plan is the Global 
Induction & Training Plan, which sets out the key objectives for 
the forthcoming year. Performance against these objectives is 
reviewed through the year.
Our employee survey also provides an insight into employee issues 
which are then used to improve the Plan.
During 2013 we successfully 
increased our headcount by 
1,508, including 108 senior 
hires at leadership level.
All General Managers, who 
run our business centres, 
undertake a week long 
training programme as 
part of their comprehensive 
induction. This is run by the 
Regus training team and 
our new General Managers 
are then supported by a 
coaching General Manager. 28 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Corporate responsibility
OUR VISION IS TO BE RECOGNISED 
AS A COMMITTED SUPPORTER 
OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES
As a business that works 
across nearly 2,000 
locations, we have a 
responsibility to the local 
communities of which we 
are a part. In 2013, we 
worked hard to impact 
positively the communities 
in which our team 
members, stakeholders 
and suppliers reside.
At the same time there is a clear business 
case for our engagement with local 
communities and efforts to improve their 
welfare, because we are a major source 
of business for the local community and 
it for us. We help develop local business 
ecosystems – recruiting and purchasing 
locally. This helps improve the local 
business environment, which then attracts 
other businesses to the area, some of 
which may decide to use Regus. The 
deeper our engagement across multiple 
levels, the greater this symbiotic effect. 
Because our community support is 
spread over a wide geographical area, 
it’s important that we adhere to speciﬁ c 
selection criteria, ensuring our support 
goes to areas in which we can make the 
largest positive contribution. Therefore, 
our community engagement work in 2013 
focused on supporting local community 
groups in the vicinity of one of our 
centres and which correspond with 
one of the following:
• helping businesses get started and 
enabling them to reach their full potential
• education and health
Within these areas, our team members 
offered different types of support in 
2013: mentoring, volunteering, helping 
organisations to raise their proﬁ le, 
equipment support, entrepreneurial 
development, and arranging business 
opportunities such as networking events. 
In addition, we do much to increase 
awareness of those in need within our 
communities, and encourage our 
customers to join our centres in taking 
an active supporting role. 
All activities are co-ordinated, monitored 
and evaluated by the Corporate 
Responsibility team. This ensures that all 
activities are aligned and help us achieve 
our goals, but also that we learn from our 
initiatives and that best practice is shared 
and replicated.
Here is a small selection of some of 
those activities.
Fundraising
Regus team members across the network 
raised funds for local community groups, 
charities and other organisations, ranging 
from our team in the Philippines collecting 
donations to support emergency relief 
measures for typhoon and earthquake 
victims, to team members in the USA 
raising funds for the breast cancer charity 
Susan G. Komen “Race for the Cure”.
In Hong Kong, Philippines and Mexico, 
Regus supported the Make-a-Wish 
Foundation’s Wishing Season, raising 
funds, volunteering and selling Christmas 
cards to help create memorable moments 
for ill children in those countries.
Regus teams around the world have 
also run marathons and triathlons, 
skydived, raced up the stairs of 
skyscrapers, and slept out overnight 
to raise sponsorship funds.
Networking events
Many Regus centres hosted networking 
events, bringing together local customers 
and stakeholders. In addition to 
encouraging participation in community 
development activities, these events 
help local entrepreneurs to develop their 
own businesses.
Events ranged from networking activities 
in Nevada, USA to support the Northern 
Nevada Children’s Cancer Foundation, to 
team members in Newcastle, UK, joining 
forces with the Wallace and Gromit 
Children’s Charity to host a Big Breakfast 
event for customers and other local 
business people. A networking evening 
for business women in Brno, Czech 
Republic raised funds for the Modry 
Hroch Foundation which supports 
children’s hospitals.
These events all help to raise awareness of 
the social needs within our communities as 
our involvement in the Melbourne, Australia 
campaign to end violence against women, 
and the São Paulo, Brazil campaign raising 
awareness of breast cancer have shown.
Gifts in kind
Since 2012 Regus has supported the 
Start Up Loans initiative, a UK government 
backed venture which helps young 
entrepreneurs set up a business. Regus 
offers the entrepreneurs a virtual ofﬁ ce for 
a six-month period. To date almost 1,000 
new businesses have been supported.
In a number of centres in the UK and North 
America, Regus facilitated collections of 
unwanted business technology, working 
with Computers for Charities and World 
Computer Exchange to bring refurbished 
IT to public education facilities in Africa.
Other gifts in kind from Regus teams 
ranged from children’s toys donated by 
our teams in Argentina, Romania and 
Australia to arranging donations of 
blankets on Mandela Day for a homeless 
shelter in South Africa.
Volunteering
In Munich, Germany, team members joined 
with Regus customers to help clean up 
after severe ﬂ ooding in some parts of the 
city. Those who could not join the clean-up 
donated refreshments, gloves and bin 
liners. Meanwhile, in South Africa, Regus 
staff supported the 2013 “Santa Cause” 
Children’s and Orphans Christmas Party, 
both volunteering at and co-sponsoring 
the event. Our team in India formed a 
partnership with Enactus – an organisation 
which uses entrepreneurial action to 
strengthen communities.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Christmas charitable activities
In 2013, the team at a Group operational 
level donated the Company’s contribution 
to its Christmas party to charity. The 
monies were then distributed to a variety 
of organisations, nominated and selected 
by the team
Regus centres in the UK supported 
Operation Christmas Child, acting as 
collection points for shoeboxes ﬁ lled with 
small gifts for disadvantaged children 
around the world. Through their efforts, 
more than 5,000 disadvantaged children 
received a Christmas gift.
Our team in Hong Kong also supported 
the Concordia Welfare and Education Fund 
which provides education to children in 
parts of Asia.
Those activities are just a few examples 
of our community engagement in 2013. In 
addition to making a positive contribution 
to local communities, the examples are an 
illustration of the engagement, dynamism 
and creativity of Regus team members 
across the world.
Environmental impact
We continue to improve our environmental 
performance for our traditional centres 
and, as stated in our environmental policy, 
are still committed to a 50% reduction in 
CO
2
 emissions for our UK business by 
2020 based on our 2007 base year.
In 2013 we achieved an average 31% 
reduction (target 29%) from our 2007 base 
in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
for our UK Regus centres (see Chart 
below). To meet our 2020 target we will 
need to achieve a 5% year-on-year 
reduction from now until then. This may 
prove challenging due to the acquisition 
of MWB, whose locations are signiﬁ cantly 
less efﬁ cient than our existing centres. 
However, our teams are currently working 
hard putting in place carbon reducing 
policies and measures to improve their 
energy efﬁ ciency. Once this work has 
been completed we will review our 
overall progress and revise our 
targets accordingly. 
Regus are full participants in the UK 
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efﬁ ciency Scheme (CRC) and have 
successfully completed the registration 
for Phase 2. We are delighted to report 
an ongoing reduction in our purchased 
allowances of nearly 9% from the start 
of Phase 1 for the existing UK portfolio 
indicating that our carbon reduction 
policies are working. However, due to the 
timing of the MWB acquisition, under the 
CRC rules Regus automatically became 
responsible for the whole of MWB’s CRC 
year. We had to subsequently purchase 
15,227 additional CRC allowances at a 
cost of £182,724 to cover all of MWB’s 
emissions. In carbon allowance terms this 
is nearly half as much again as the existing 
Regus portfolio.
In the past year, as part of our ongoing 
maintenance programme, we have 
undertaken many hundreds of small 
projects across our portfolio. These 
improve our energy efﬁ ciency and in 
aggregate help to reduce carbon 
emissions overall. Typical projects 
include building controls upgrade, 
heating and chiller upgrades and 
lighting improvements.
Finally, we will be refreshing our 
behavioural change programme in 2014 
to further embed Greener Working 
across our centres. Our Greener Working 
Champions will be encouraging staff and 
clients alike to help Regus reduce its global 
environmental impact. This will include 
further practical measures to improve the 
efﬁ ciency of energy and water usage in 
centres and reduce the amount of general 
waste by making more use of our mixed 
recycling facilities.

AN EXPERIENCED TEAM Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 33
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance as set out in the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code published in September 2012 (the ‘Code’). The Code is 
available at www.frc.org.uk. The Board is accountable to the 
Company’s shareholders and this report describes how the  
Board applied the principles of good governance. 
The Board 
At 31 December 2013, the Board of Directors was made up  
of seven members comprising the Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. Biographical details  
of the Directors are set out on page 32. 
The Board is mindful of the benefits of strength and diversity on  
the Board. Our aim is to have a Board which is reflective of the 
broad range of skills, backgrounds and experience necessary to 
properly serve our shareholders. We have pursued this objective 
by engaging Board members who have had broad executive 
responsibilities and bring very different and complementary 
personal experiences and approaches to matters including the 
evaluation of opportunities and management of risks. Our Board 
members represent five different nationalities and six countries of 
residence. Along with their international operational experience, 
they also bring a depth of working knowledge covering multiple 
industries, business models, corporate cultures, organisational 
models, functional areas and business issues. During the year  
we were pleased to add Florence Pierre to the Board as a  
Non-Executive Director, contributing to the skillset and diversity  
of the Board. 
The Nomination Committee’s decisions are based on merit  
while reflecting our intent to increase diversity, including gender 
diversity. Our Board is now 14% female. The Board considers that 
its current balance ensures that no individual or group dominates 
its decision making process. 
Role of the Board 
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial 
leadership and to review the overall strategic development of  
the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan and the 
annual budget and reviews performance at every meeting. 
Capable management and relevant technical expertise in the 
business are critical to the implementation of the strategy.  
Individuals with strategic responsibilities are invited to present  
to and discuss with the Board on a rotating periodic basis. 
Through the Audit Committee, the Directors ensure the integrity  
of financial information and the effectiveness of financial controls 
and the internal control and risk management system. The Board 
has delegated authority to the Remuneration Committee to set  
the remuneration policy for Directors and senior management.  
The Nomination Committee recommends the appointment of 
Board Directors and has responsibility for succession planning at 
Board level. The various Board Committees (the ‘Committees’) 
have authority to make decisions in their areas of expertise. 
Frequency of meetings 
There were eight main Board meetings during 2013. 
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and 
individual attendance by the Directors are shown below  
(Florence Pierre having joined the Board and its Committees  
on 21 May 2013).

Matters reserved for the Board 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers 
of decision. These include:  
• approval of regulatory announcements including the interim  
and annual financial statements; 
• terms of reference and membership of the Board and  
its Committees; 
• changes to the Group’s capital structure; 
• changes to the Group’s management and control structure; 
• capital investment in excess of £5m; and 
• material contracts (annual value in excess of £5m). 
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions and decisions and  
all Directors are encouraged to request inclusion in the Board 
minutes of any unresolved concerns that they may have. 
Roles of Board members 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman 
Douglas Sutherland is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures 
effective communication with shareholders and that the Board  
is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates  
both the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and 
constructive relations between the Executive Directors and  
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for ensuring all Directors are properly briefed on 
issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and  
timely access to relevant information. 
The Chairman is considered by the Board to be independent in 
character and judgement. 
Corporate governance 34 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Chief Executive 
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its 
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework  
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the 
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision making 
and responsibilities accordingly. 
Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors each bring their own senior level of 
experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent counsel 
brought to the Group by the Non-Executive Directors enhances 
the overall decision making of the Board. Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for an initial three-year term and are subject to 
election by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
after their appointment. 
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for advising 
the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters  
and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken of all Board 
meetings and discussions. The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board. 
Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain of its governance responsibilities 
to the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the Board 
Committees and minutes of meetings are circulated to all  
Board members.

Group structure 
As a Jersey-incorporated company having its place of central 
administration (head office) in Luxembourg and being tax resident 
in Luxembourg, the Company is required to comply with both 
Jersey law and Luxembourg law, where applicable. In addition, 
the Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the Official List of the 
UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the main market 
of the London Stock Exchange. It is possible that conflicts may 
arise between the obligations of the Company under the laws of 
each of these jurisdictions or between the applicable laws and the 
Listing Rules. If an irreconcilable conflict were to occur then the 
Company may not be able to maintain its status as a company tax 
resident in Luxembourg. 
The Group manages the risk that a significant tax liability could 
arise by taking appropriate advice, both in carrying out the Group 
reorganisation and on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Group 
believes that under current laws and regulations the risk of 
irreconcilable conflicts between current laws and regulations 
impacting Regus plc is also low.

All shareholders are paid dividends directly from Regus plc SA 
(‘plc’). All dividend payments are made without deduction of 
Luxembourg withholding tax, regardless of the residence of  
the recipient. 
In general terms, UK resident shareholders receiving dividends 
from plc should be taxed in the same way as if they had received 
a dividend from a UK company. Tax outcomes do, however, 
depend on the specific circumstances of shareholders and  
any shareholder in doubt about their tax position (including, in 
particular, UK-resident but non-UK-domiciled individuals who  
have elected to be taxed on a remittance basis) should consult 
their own professional advisor. 
Centrally managed applications and systems  
All of the Group’s systems and applications are housed in a 
central data centre. Should the data centre be impacted as a 
result of circumstances outside the Group’s control there could  
be an adverse impact on the Group’s operations and therefore  
its financial results. This risk is managed through a detailed  
service arrangement with our external data centre provider which 
incorporates appropriate back-up procedures and controls. 
Strategy  
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic 
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, plans and 
performance targets for 2014 have been set by the Executive 
Directors and are regularly reviewed by the Board in the context  
of the Group’s overall objectives. 
Control environment 
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at all  
levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place to 
support this: 
• A clearly defined organisation structure with established 
responsibilities. 
• An induction process to educate new team members on the 
standards required from them in their role, including business 
ethics and compliance, regulations and internal policies. 
• Provision to all team members of a copy of the ‘Team Member 
Handbook’ which contains detailed guidance on employee 
policies and the standards of behaviour required of staff. 
• Policies and procedure manuals and guidelines that are readily 
accessible through the Group’s intranet site. 
• Operational audit and self-certification tools which require 
individual centre managers to confirm their adherence to  
Group policies and procedures. 
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the Group’s policy 
to recruit and develop appropriately skilled management and staff 
of high calibre and integrity and with appropriate disciplines. 
Control processes 
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the year 
and up to 4 March 2014, the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, which accord with the Revised Internal Control Guidance 
for Directors in the Code. These include the following: 
• There are comprehensive reviews every six months of Group 
and regional financial performance, business development 
opportunities, Group infrastructure and general Group 
management issues. The results of these reviews are presented 
to the Board. 
• Formal country level business reviews are performed monthly  
by regional and Group management covering performance  
and management issues with country management.  
Significant matters arising from these reviews are presented  
to the Board. 
• The annual budget process is driven from senior management 
meetings. Budgets are prepared at a detailed level by business 
centre and roll-up at country and regional level. The Executive 
Directors review regional budgets to ensure consistency with 
regional strategic objectives and the final budget is reviewed 
and approved by the Board. The approved budget forms the 
basis of business management throughout the year. 
• Operational reports and financial reports are prepared and 
distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results are 
reviewed against budget and forecast, and explanations are 
received for all material movements. 
• Key policies and control procedures (including finance, 
operations, and health and safety) are documented in manuals 
having Group-wide application. These are available to all staff 
via the Group’s intranet system. 
• The Board has formal procedures in place for the review and 
approval of investment and acquisition projects. The Group 
Investment Committee (comprising the Executive Directors) 
reviews all investments prior to approval by the Board where 
required. Additionally the form and content of investment 
proposals are standardised to facilitate the review process. 
• The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard to 
the approval of transactions. 
• Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales and 
operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to 
provide management at all levels with performance data for 
their area of responsibility which helps them to focus on 
operational issues that may require their input. 
Information and communications processes 
The senior management team is integrally involved in the business 
and to this extent regularly discuss and address issues and 
opportunities with regional and functional teams. Formal business 
review meetings are held with the regional teams and functional 
heads on a monthly basis. 
   36 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Regular staff communications include general information on  
the business from senior management as well as operational 
guidance on changes in policies and procedures. 
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend 
regional sales or management conferences at which information 
on operational issues is shared. Delegates present the key 
messages to employees who did not attend the event. 
Monitoring effectiveness 
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board at 
various times during the year in the conduct of its review of 
internal controls: 
• review of the Group’s monthly management accounts which 
contain detailed analysis of financial performance for the Group 
and each of the Group’s geographic reporting segments; 
• an ongoing process of review, through Board meetings, senior 
management meetings and divisional reviews as well as other 
management meetings, for the formal identification of significant 
operational risks and mitigating control processes; 
• delivery of a centrally-coordinated assurance programme by the 
Internal Audit department that includes key business risk areas. 
• reporting the findings and recommendations of each review to 
management and the Audit Committee to support the Board in 
its role of ensuring a sound control environment; 
• monthly reporting on the development of the profitability of new 
centres to allow appraisal of the effectiveness of investment 
activity; and 
• annual internal control self-assessment and management 
certification exercise covering the effectiveness of financial  
and operational controls. This is based on a comprehensive 
internal control questionnaire collated and reviewed by Internal 
Audit. Results and any necessary mitigating action plans are 
presented to senior management and the Board. 
Succession 
Our efforts to increase our management capacity and capabilities 
through continuing development of our people, supplemented  
by the hiring of experienced professionals, not only supports  
our ability to execute our growth strategy but also enables us to 
address succession in a more robust way throughout the Group. 
Succession planning discussions are an integral part of our 
business planning and review processes. 
In view of the future development of the Group and our objective 
to continue to enhance diversity and succession planning for 
Board roles, the Nomination Committee maintains an ongoing 
programme of engagement with highly qualified potential  
Non-Executive Directors of varied backgrounds and gender.  
Other matters 
Board performance evaluation 
Following an external evaluation in 2012, an internal evaluation of 
Board performance was conducted for 2013. 
The results of the 2013 evaluation were reviewed and are being 
addressed in our efforts to continuously improve the processes 
and effectiveness of the Board. There were no reportable matters 
identified from the evaluations and we continue to have full 
confidence in the Board’s members and processes. 
Training and resources 
Appropriate training is made available for all new Directors to 
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training is 
provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with the 
emphasis on governance and accounting developments. 
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided 
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst  
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting 
developments through presentations from management, internal 
audit and the external auditors. The Board programme includes 
presentations from management in addition to the Executive 
Directors which, together with site visits, increase the Non-
Executive Directors’ understanding of the business and sector. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures, corporate governance and regulatory compliance  
are followed and complied with. Should a Director request 
independent professional advice to carry out his duties,  
such advice is available to him at the Company’s expense. 
Directors and officers insurance  
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually and 
appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the Directors 
and senior management in the event of a claim being brought 
against any of them in their capacity as Directors and officers of 
the Company. 
Dialogue with shareholders 
The Company reports formally to shareholders twice a year,  
with the half year results typically announced in August and the 
preliminary final results announced normally in March. There are 
programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to 
give presentations of these results to the Company’s institutional 
investors, analysts and media in London and other key locations. 
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer maintain a  
close dialogue with institutional investors on the Company’s 
performance, governance, plans and objectives. These meetings 
also serve to develop an ongoing understanding of the views and 
any concerns of the Company’s major shareholders. 
  
Corporate governance
continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 37
 
The Non-Executive Directors are given regular updates as to  
the views of the institutional shareholders, and the Chairman  
is available and meets with these shareholders on request.  
The principal communication with private shareholders is  
through the Annual Report, the half year results and the AGM. 
The Company continues to engage the services of Brunswick  
as its investor relations adviser. 
AGM 
The AGM each year is held in May in Luxembourg and is 
attended, other than in exceptional circumstances, by all 
members of the Board. In addition to the formal business of the 
meeting, there is normally a trading update and shareholders  
are invited to ask questions and are also given the opportunity  
to meet the Directors informally afterwards. 
Notice of the AGM together with any related documents is 
required to be mailed to shareholders at least 30 clear days before 
the meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on each issue. 
The voting in respect of all resolutions to be put to the AGM is 
conducted by means of a poll vote. 
The level of proxy votes cast and the balance for and against  
each resolution, together with the level of abstentions, if any,  
are announced to the meeting following voting on a poll. 
Financial and other information is made available on the 
Company’s website: www.regus.com. 
Re-election of the Board 
As required by the Code, all Directors submit themselves for  
re-election by shareholders annually and Directors appointed 
during the period since the last AGM are required to seek election 
at the next AGM under the Company’s articles of association. 
Non-Executive Directors are also subject to the re-election 
requirements and serve the Company under letters of 
appointment, which have an initial three-year term. 
Compliance statement 
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in section 
E of the Code throughout the year ended 31 December 2013, 
with the exception of the following: 
• Provision E.1.1 – The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director Lance Browne does not have regular meetings with 
major external shareholders. 
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to be the 
main conduit with investors, rather than the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Chairman participates in investor 
meetings and makes himself available for questions, in person,  
at the time of major announcements as well as upon request.  
The Chairman regularly updates the Board and particularly the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director on the results of his 
meetings and the opinions of investors. On this basis, the Board 
considers that the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is 
able to gain full awareness of the issues and concerns of major 
shareholders. Notwithstanding this policy, all Directors have a 
standing invitation to participate in meetings with investors. 38 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Audit Committee has, via delegated authority from the Board, 
the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal 
control and compliance; accurate external financial reporting, 
fulfilling its obligations under law, the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the Financial Reporting 
Council’s report on Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code (the ‘FRC Revised Guidance’), 
as well as managing the relationship with the Company’s  
external auditors. The Committee therefore acts on behalf of the 
Board, meaning that the matters reviewed and managed by the 
Committee remain the responsibility of the Board as a whole.  
The Committee is comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors 
as detailed on page 34 of the Corporate Governance report.  
All of the members are considered by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement, and are competent in 
accounting and/or auditing. Furthermore, and in compliance with 
the Code, the Board regards Elmar Heggen as the Committee 
member possessing recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee normally meets at least three times a year 
and during the year to 31 December 2013 met five times. 
Attendance at those meetings is shown on page 33 of the 
Corporate Governance report. At the request of the Chairman,  
the external auditors, the Executive Directors, the Company 
Secretary (acting as secretary to the Committee) and the  
Business Assurance Director may attend each meeting. 
The Audit Committee also routinely meets independently, without 
the presence of management, with the Company’s external 
auditors and with the Business Assurance Director to informally 
discuss matters of interest. 
Summary terms of reference of the Committee, the full text of 
which is freely available on the Company’s website, are:  
• financial reporting – to provide support to the Board by 
monitoring the integrity of financial reporting and ensuring  
that the published financial statements of the Group and any 
formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance comply fully with the relevant statutes and 
accounting standards. 
• Internal control and risk systems – to review the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems. 
• Internal audit – to monitor and review the annual internal  
audit programme ensuring that the internal audit function  
is adequately resourced and free from management  
restrictions, and to review and monitor responses to the 
findings and recommendations of the internal auditors. 
• External audit – to advise the Board on the appointment, 
reappointment, remuneration and removal of the  
external auditors. 
• Employee concerns – to review the Company’s arrangements 
under which employees may in confidence raise any concerns 
regarding possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other 
matters. The Audit Committee ensures that these arrangements 
allow proportionate and independent investigation and 
appropriate follow-up action. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee routinely reports to  
the Main Board on how the Committee has discharged its 
responsibilities, as well as highlighting any concerns that have 
been raised as and when they arise. 
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year 
The Committee has a number of standing agenda items which it 
considers at each of its meetings, as well as any other specific 
matters which arise during the year. During the year, amongst 
other items, the Committee reviewed and discussed: 
• the control observations from the previous year’s Group  
audit cycle;  
• internal controls and risk management (as further particularised 
within this report);  
• the Group tax report;  
• the interim and final dividends;  
• the integrity of the half year results and annual financial 
statements, alongside the formal announcements relating  
to them; and 
• the Group audit strategy for the year.  
Risk management 
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee oversees and 
reviews an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks  
and their financial implications are appraised by the responsible 
executives as a part of the planning process and are endorsed  
by regional management. Key risks are reported to the Audit 
Committee, which in turn ensures that the Board is made aware 
of them. The appropriateness of controls is considered by the 
executives, having regard to cost, benefit, materiality and the 
likelihood of risks crystallising. Key risks and actions to mitigate 
those risks are regularly considered by both the Audit Committee 
and the Board, and are formally reviewed and approved by the 
Board annually.  
Principal risks 
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have 
an impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group  
has a risk management structure in place designed to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment and 
evaluation is an integral part of the annual planning process,  
as well as the Group’s monthly review cycle. 
The Group’s principal risks, together with an explanation of how 
the Group manages these risks, are presented on pages 24 to 27 
of this Annual Report. 
Internal control 
The Committee has a delegated responsibility from the Board for 
the Company’s system of internal control and risk management 
and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system. Such a system 
is designed to identify, evaluate and control the significant  
risks associated with the Group’s achievement of its business 
objectives with a view to safeguarding shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets. Due to the limitations that are inherent  
in any system of internal control, this system is designed to meet 
the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which it is 
exposed, and is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk. 
Accordingly, such a system can provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
  
Audit Committee report Strategic report Governance Financial statements

In accordance with the FRC Revised Guidance, the Committee 
confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. 
During the year under review, the Committee continued to revisit 
its risk identification and assessment processes, inviting Board 
members and senior management to convene and discuss the 
Group’s key risks and mitigating controls. 
A risk-based approach has been adopted in establishing the 
Group’s system of internal control and in reviewing its 
effectiveness. To identify and manage key risks: 
• a number of Group-wide procedures, policies and standards 
have been established;  
• a framework for reporting and escalating matters of significance 
has been set up;  
• reviews of the effectiveness of management actions in 
addressing key Group risks identified by the Board have been 
undertaken; and 
• a system of regular reports from management setting out key 
performance and risk indicators has been developed. 
The above process is designed to provide assurance by way  
of cumulative assessment and is embedded in operational 
management and governance processes. 
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control which have 
operated throughout the year under review are as follows: 
• The risk assessments of all significant business decisions at the 
individual transaction level, and as part of the annual business 
planning process. A Group-wide risk register is developed 
annually whereby all Company inherent risks are identified and 
assessed, and appropriate action plans developed to manage 
the risk per the Company’s risk appetite. The Board reviews  
the Group’s principal risks register annually and management 
periodically reports on the progress against agreed actions to 
keep a close watch on how we are managing our key risks. 
• The annual strategic planning process, which is designed to 
ensure consistency with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The final budget is reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Performance is reviewed against objectives at each  
Board meeting. 
• Comprehensive monthly business review processes under 
which business performance is reviewed on business centre, 
area, country, regional and functional levels. Actual results  
are reviewed against targets, explanations are received for  
all material movements, and recovery plans are agreed  
where appropriate. 
• The documentation of key policies and control procedures 
(including finance, operations, and health and safety) having 
Group-wide application. These are available to all staff via the 
Group’s intranet system. 
• Formal procedures for the review and approval of all investment 
and acquisition projects. The Group Investment Committee 
(comprising the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer) reviews and approves all investments. Additionally the 
form and content of investment proposals are standardised to 
facilitate the review process. 
• The delegation of authority limits with regard to the approval  
of transactions. 
• The generation of targeted, action-oriented reports from the 
Group’s sales and operating systems on a daily, weekly and 
monthly basis which provide management at all levels with 
performance data for their area of responsibility, and which 
helps them to focus on key issues and manage them  
more effectively. 
• The delivery of a centrally co-ordinated assurance programme 
by the Internal Audit department that includes key business risk 
areas. The findings and recommendations of each review are 
reported to both management and the Committee. 
• Annual internal control self-assessment and management 
certification exercise covering the effectiveness of financial  
and operational controls. This is based on a comprehensive 
internal control questionnaire collated and reviewed by Internal 
Audit. Results and any necessary mitigating action plans are 
presented to senior management and the Board. 
• The maintenance of high standards of behaviour which is 
demanded from staff at all levels in the Group. The following 
procedures are in place to support this:  
– a clearly defined organisation structure with established 
responsibilities;  
– an induction process to educate new team members on the 
standards required from them in their role, including business 
ethics and compliance, regulation and internal policies;  
– the provision of a copy of the ‘Team Member Handbook’ to  
all team members which contains the Company’s Code of 
Business Conduct, detailed guidance on employee policies  
and the standards of behaviour required of staff;  
– policies, procedure manuals and guidelines are readily 
accessible through the Group’s intranet site;  
– operational audit and self-certification tools which require 
individual managers to confirm their adherence to Group 
policies and procedures; and  
– a Group-wide policy to recruit and develop appropriately 
skilled management and staff of high calibre and integrity  
and with appropriate disciplines.  
The Committee and the Board regard responsible corporate 
behaviour as an integral part of the overall governance framework 
and believes that it should be fully integrated into management 
structures and systems. Therefore the risk management policies, 
procedures and monitoring methods described above apply 
equally to the identification, evaluation and control of the 
Company’s safety, ethical and environmental risks and 
opportunities. This approach ensures that the Company has  
the necessary and adequate information to identify and assess 
risks and opportunities affecting the Company’s long-term value 
arising from its handling of corporate responsibility and corporate 
governance matters. 
The Committee has completed its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year to  
31 December 2013 and is satisfied that it is in accordance with 
the FRC Revised Guidance and the Code. The assessment 
included consideration of the effectiveness of the Board’s  
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the  
risks facing the Group. 
   40 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Whistle-blowing policy 
The Company has an externally hosted whistle-blowing channel 
(‘EthicsPoint’), which is available to all employees via email, and 
on the Company’s Intranet. The aim of the policy is to encourage 
all employees, regardless of seniority, to bring matters that cause 
them concern to the attention of the Audit Committee. 
The Business Assurance Director, where appropriate and in 
consultation with the executive management team, decides on  
the appropriate method and level of investigation. The Audit 
Committee is notified of all material discourses made and receives 
reports on the results of investigations and actions taken on a 
regular basis. The Audit Committee has the power to request 
further information, conduct its own inquiries or order additional 
action as it sees fit.  
External auditors 
KPMG Luxembourg S.à r.l. were the Company’s auditors for  
the year ended 31 December 2013. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for oversight of the external auditors, including  
an annual assessment of their independence and objectivity. 
During the year, the external auditors provided the following  
audit and non-audit related services: 
Audit related: KPMG Luxembourg S.à r.l. audited the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company, performed control 
observations throughout the Group and provided an overview  
of the half year results of the Company. 
Non-audit related: KPMG Luxembourg S.à r.l. performed buy-side 
due diligence work on certain acquisitions by the Group.  
It is the Company’s policy to use the external auditors for non-
audit related services only where the use of the external auditors 
will deliver a demonstrable benefit to the Company as compared 
to the use of other potential providers of the services and where  
it will not impair their independence or objectivity. All proposals  
for permitted defined non-audit services to use the external 
auditors must be submitted to, and authorised by, the Chief 
Financial Officer.  
Permitted non-audit services include advice on financial 
accounting and regulatory reporting matters, reviews of internal 
accounting and risk management controls, non-statutory audits 
(e.g. regarding acquisitions and disposal of assets and interests  
in companies) and tax compliance and advisory services.  
Prohibited non-audit services include book-keeping and other 
accounting services, actuarial valuation services, recruitment 
services in relation to key management positions and transaction 
(acquisitions, mergers and dispositions) work that includes 
investment banking services, preparation of forecasts or 
investment proposals and deal execution services.  
The scope and extent of non-audit related services undertaken  
by the external auditors is monitored by and, above a threshold  
of £50,000, requires prior approval from the Committee to  
ensure that the provision of such services does not impair  
their independence or objectivity. 
The breakdown of the fees paid to the external auditors during the 
year to 31 December 2013 can be found in Note 5 of the Notes to 
the Accounts.  
For the year ending 31 December 2014, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that a resolution to reappoint KPMG 
Luxembourg S.à r.l. as the Company’s auditors be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting. 
The Audit Committee notes the recent dialogue regarding the 
advantages and disadvantages related to the periodic rotation  
of external auditors. The Audit Committee has considered the 
various viewpoints expressed in this debate in the context of 
Regus. Given the significant level of other changes over the last 
several years, which includes the mix of countries in which much 
of the audit work is conducted, the rapid growth and evolving 
structure of the Group, a change in Chief Financial Officer, 
ongoing efforts to continue to improve audit effectiveness with the 
existing external auditors, and other factors, the Audit Committee 
does not believe at this time that it is appropriate or in the interest 
of shareholders to rotate external auditors primarily for the sake of 
change. The Audit Committee is also monitoring developments in 
the proposed EU legislation regarding auditor independence and 
rotation. The Audit Committee will continue to keep under review 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the 
effectiveness of the audit process, legislative developments,  
the rotation of the lead audit partner and other matters as  
they monitor the appropriateness of the retention of KPMG 
Luxembourg S.à r.l. as the Company’s auditors. 
Audit Committee report
continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 41
Dear shareholder,  
As the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
present to you this year’s report on Directors’ remuneration.  
Changes to remuneration reporting in the UK 
Since last year’s report, new remuneration reporting regulations 
have come into effect for UK-incorporated listed companies.  
As a company incorporated under Luxembourg law, we are  
not legally required to adopt the new regulations. However, in 
keeping with our long-standing commitment to good corporate 
governance, we will continue to voluntarily prepare a Directors’ 
remuneration report, and we will do so on the basis of the 
requirements of the new regulations.  
The report is therefore split into two sections: 
• Remuneration Policy (pages 42-46). This sets out our executive 
remuneration framework and policies.  
• Annual Report on Remuneration (pages 47-53). This details  
the implementation of our policies in the current year and our 
approach for 2014. 
Both will be submitted for shareholder approval at the forthcoming 
AGM. Given the different legal jurisdiction in which we are 
incorporated, the approval of our Remuneration Policy will be  
on an advisory rather than a binding basis.  
Remuneration objectives and principles 
As context for considering the report, set out below are the 
remuneration objectives and principles which have consistently 
underpinned our remuneration framework for a number of years: 
• Our remuneration packages must attract, retain and motivate 
people of the highest calibre and experience needed to shape 
and execute the Company’s strategy and to deliver exceptional 
shareholder value. Total compensation opportunities should be 
commensurate with comparable packages available with similar 
companies operating in similar markets. 
• A significant proportion of reward should be based on short and 
long-term performance measured by satisfaction of targeted 
objectives which are the main drivers of shareholder value. 
Executives should be focused on delivering exceptional returns 
to shareholders and be given the opportunity to receive 
exceptional levels of reward if such performance is delivered. 
Conversely, if returns are conservative, compensation levels 
should be conservative. 
• The interests of executives should be closely aligned with those 
of shareholders over the long term through substantial share 
ownership and share-based incentives. This is achieved via  
our Co-Investment Plan (CIP) which measures performance 
over periods of up to five years and through our share 
ownership guidelines. 
Decisions in respect of 2013 
• Based on achievement against adjusted operating profit targets 
in the context of the significant increase to mature operating 
profit and substantial increase in new centres during the year 
(discussed in more detail on pages 19 to 23 of the Annual 
Report), we awarded bonuses of 79% of salary (79% of the 
maximum 100%) to the Executive Directors. Half of the 
awarded bonuses will be deferred as Regus Investment  
Shares for three years under the CIP (see below). 
• The Committee reviewed performance over the four-year 
performance period to 31 December 2013 under the second 
tranche of Matching Shares awarded to Mark Dixon under  
the 2008/09 CIP award. Based on achieving adjusted EPS  
of 17.2p and TSR of 126% (vs FTSE All Share 51%), the 
Committee determined that 35% of the second tranche  
should vest. 
2014 decisions 
• There will be no salary increases for the Executive Directors  
in 2014. 
• The structure and quantum of our incentive opportunities will 
remain unchanged, as set out in the Policy Table on page 42.  
• Based on the deferral of half of the 2013 bonus (i.e. 38.5% of 
salary), an opportunity to earn up to four Matching Shares  
for each Investment Share will be awarded under the CIP.  
This will be equivalent to a maximum award of 158% of salary.  
• These CIP Matching Shares will vest based on performance 
against stretching targets over performance periods of three, 
four and five years. 75% of the award will be based on EPS, 
with targets which require annual growth of 25-35% p.a. for 
maximum vesting. The remaining 25% will be based on our 
total shareholder return (TSR) ranking against the constituents 
of the FTSE 350 (excluding financial services and mining).  
We look forward to receiving your support for both resolutions at 
the 2014 AGM.

Remuneration report 42 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Listing Rules  
and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.  
The Company has been incorporated subject to Luxembourg law rather than UK law. As a result, the Company does not have the 
benefit of the statutory protections afforded by the UK Companies Act in the event that there were to be any inconsistency between  
the Company’s approved policy report and any contractual entitlement or other rights of a Director. Therefore, in the event that there 
were to be such an inconsistency, the Company may be obliged to honour the contractual entitlement or right notwithstanding that it  
is inconsistent with the contents of the approved policy report. 
Remuneration Policy 
This Remuneration Policy, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, will be effective following shareholder approval at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting.

Base salary To provide a 
competitive 
component  
of fixed 
remuneration to 
attract and retain 
people of the 
highest calibre 
and experience 
needed to shape 
and execute the 
Company’s 
strategy 
Salaries are set by the Committee, taking 
into all relevant factors which may include: 
the scope and responsibilities of the role,  
the skills, experience and circumstances  
of the individual, sustained performance  
in the role, the level of increase for other 
roles within the business, and appropriate 
market data.  
Reviewed annually and any changes 
normally made effective from 1 January.  
The base salaries effective 1 January  
2014 are set out on page 47 of the  
Annual Remuneration Report. 
There is no prescribed 
maximum salary. Salary 
increases will normally  
be broadly in line with 
increases awarded to 
other employees in the 
business, although the 
Committee retains 
discretion to award larger 
increases if it considers  
it appropriate (e.g. to 
reflect a change in role, 
development and 
performance in role, or  
to align to market data).  
N/A 
Benefits To provide a 
competitive 
benefits package. 
Incorporates various cash/non-cash  
benefits which may include: a company car 
(or allowance) and fuel allowance, private 
health insurance, life assurance and,  
where necessary, other benefits to reflect 
specific individual circumstances, such  
as housing or relocation allowances, 
representation allowances, re-imbursement 
of school fees, travel allowances, or other 
expatriate benefits.  
Benefit provision is set at 
an appropriately market 
competitive rate for the 
nature and location of  
the role. There is no 
prescribed maximum  
as some costs may 
change in accordance 
with market conditions.  
N/A 
Pension To provide 
retirement 
benefits in line

Component 
Purpose/link to 
strategy Operation Maximum Performance framework 
Co-
Investment 
Plan (CIP) 
Exists to reward 
deferral under the 
annual bonus, 
encourage the 
build-up of 
significant 
personal 
shareholdings 
over time, and 
provide a variable 
pay opportunity, 
which motivates 
and rewards 
long-term 
Company 
performance.  
Awards are made under the terms of the 
Regus plc Co-Investment Plan, approved  
by shareholders in General Meeting in 2008. 
The CIP has two elements: 
Matching Shares element 
This operates in conjunction with the annual 
bonus arrangements whereby a gross bonus 
of up to 50% of base salary is awarded as  
a deferred amount of shares (Investment 
Shares) which will be released at the end  
of a holding period of not less than three 
years, subject to continued employment. 
The participant may then earn additional 
shares (Matching Shares) based on the 
number of Investment Shares awarded and 
the Company’s long-term performance.  
The maximum ratio of Matching Shares  
to Investment Shares is 4:1. 
LTIP element 
An award of shares to be released at the 
end of a period of not less than three years, 
based on the Company’s long-term 
performance. 
Awards of Investment Shares, Matching 
Shares and LTIP awards can be made in  
the form of either a nil cost option or a 
conditional right to shares. 
Awards may vest early on leaving 
employment or on a change of control  
(see later sections). 
Matching Shares 
element: Award size  
of 200% of salary  
per annum 
LTIP element: Award  
size of 100% of salary 
per annum 
Matching Shares and 
LTIP will not normally  
be awarded in the  
same year. 
Vesting is determined by 
reference to performance 
assessed over a period 
of at least three years, 
with awards normally 
split equally over periods 
of three, four and five 
years. There is no 
opportunity for re-testing. 
Performance (for 2014 
awards) will be assessed 
against key measures of 
long-term performance: 
• Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) 
• Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) 
For future awards, the 
Committee may include 
other quantitative, 
financial performance 
measures which are 
aligned to strategic 
objectives and 
shareholder value. 
The performance 
measures framework  
will normally be  
weighted towards EPS. 
The threshold level  
of vesting is 25% of  
the maximum. 
 
Executive Directors may hold awards under the Regus plc Share 
Option Plan, granted in respect of their recruitment or prior to  
(and not in contemplation of) their appointment to the Board, 
however this does not form part of their annual remuneration 
framework. Such awards are made under the terms of the Regus 
plc Share Option Plan, approved by shareholders in General 
Meeting in 2008. Options are granted over Regus shares with  
an exercise price not less than the market value of shares on the 
date of grant. Awards may not be exercised before three years 
from grant and up to a maximum of ten years following grant. 
Awards may vest early on leaving employment or on a change  
of control. The Committee may make an award subject to a 
performance condition or other condition. 
 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising  
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before  
the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion  
of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for  
the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these 
purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards  
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, 
the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award  
is granted. The Committee may make minor amendments to  
the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax  
or administrative purposes or to take account of a change  
in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for  
that amendment.  
   44 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Policy Table for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
Component Approach of the Company 
Chairman fees Determined by the Remuneration Committee.  
A single fee which reflects all Board and Committee duties. 
Set at a level sufficient to attract and retain individuals with the required skills, experience and  
knowledge to allow the Board to effectively carry out its duties. 
Non-Executive Director fees Determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
The fee encompasses a basic fee and may also include supplementary fees for committee or  
other duties. 
Set at a level sufficient to attract and retain individuals with the required skills, experience and  
knowledge to allow the Board to effectively carry out its duties. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits, nor do they participate in any bonus or share incentive scheme, 
nor do they participate in any pension arrangements.  
Performance measures and target setting 
The annual bonus is based on stretching financial performance 
targets determined by the Committee at the start of the year. 
Operating profit is the performance measure for 2014 as this  
is a key performance indicator for the business. 
The CIP is based on long-term performance, using performance 
measures which the Committee feels are most appropriate for  
the Company. For 2014, awards are based on EPS (which the 
Committee believes is the most appropriate measure of financial 
and operational performance delivered for shareholders) and TSR 
(to ensure that an element of reward is based on value delivered 
for shareholders). The performance targets for CIP awards are 
determined by the Committee at the time of grant.  
Under the rules of the CIP, if events occur which cause the 
Committee to consider that the performance targets have become 
unfair or impractical, the Committee has discretion to amend the 
target so that in the opinion of the Committee it is no more or less 
difficult to satisfy than when it was awarded. 
Differences in the Company’s policy on the remuneration  
of employees generally  
Regus operates in a number of different geographies and 
therefore employee remuneration practices vary widely across  
the employee population within the Group. However, employee 
remuneration policies are normally based on the same  
broad principles: 
• they are sufficient to attract and retain the calibre of talent 
necessary to deliver the strategy for shareholders; 
• the Committee believes firmly in the effectiveness of short-term 
incentives as a mechanism for incentivising and rewarding 
annual financial performance for shareholders. Accordingly, 
incentive schemes are widely used across the business; 
• the Group operates various employee share incentive schemes 
to encourage employee share ownership; 
• executive directors participate in the pension plan on the same 
basis as other employees. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group 
When setting the policy for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment 
conditions of employees within the Group. The Committee  
does not consult directly with employees when formulating  
the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.  
Consideration of shareholder views 
Views expressed by the Company’s shareholders were taken into 
account by the Committee in the development of the Company’s 
remuneration framework.  
The members of the Committee, including the Chairman, attend 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting and are available to  
listen to views and to answer shareholders’ questions about 
Directors’ remuneration. 
The Committee also reviews the executive remuneration 
framework in the context of published shareholder guidelines.  
Approach to recruitment remuneration 
When determining the remuneration package for a newly 
appointed Executive Director, the Committee would seek to  
apply the following principles:  
• The package must be sufficiently competitive to facilitate the 
recruitment of individuals of the highest calibre and experience 
needed to shape and execute the Company’s strategy.  
At the same time, the Committee would seek to pay no  
more than necessary.  
• The structure of the annual remuneration package would follow 
that described in the Policy Table for Executive Directors on 
page 42. Salaries would reflect the skills and experience of  
the individual, and may be set at a level to allow future salary 
progression to reflect performance in role. 
• The Committee considers that having flexibility to respond  
to the specific commercial circumstances of a recruitment 
situation is in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders, particularly in exceptional or unexpected 
circumstances which can arise when seeking to facilitate  
senior executive recruitment. Therefore, the maximum level of 
variable remuneration which may be awarded is 450% of salary, 
which would be subject to stretching performance conditions. 
  
Remuneration report
continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 45
 
• Where an individual forfeits remuneration at a previous employer 
as a result of appointment to the Company, the Committee  
may offer compensatory payments or awards to facilitate 
recruitment. Such payments or awards could include cash  
as well as performance and non-performance related share 
awards, and would be in such form as the Committee 
considers appropriate taking into account all relevant factors 
such as the form, expected value, anticipated vesting and 
timing of the forfeited remuneration. There is no limit on the 
value of such compensatory awards, but the Committee’s 
intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than 
value forfeited. While cash may be included to reflect the 
forfeiture of cash-based remuneration, the Committee does  
not envisage that substantial “golden hello” cash payments 
would generally be offered. 
• Any share-based awards referred to in this section will be 
granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing share 
plans. If necessary, awards may be granted outside these  
plans as permitted under the Listing Rules, and in line with  
the approach and the limits set out above.  
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive 
Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the 
Policy Table for Non-Executive Directors on page 44. 
Service contracts  
Executive Directors have service contracts with the Group which 
can be terminated by the Company or the Director by giving  
12 months’ notice. This applies to current Executive Directors and 
would normally be applied as the policy for future appointments.  
The Company may terminate employment of the Chief Executive 
by making a payment in lieu of notice which would not exceed  
12 months’ salary. Unless it is renewed, the contract of the  
Chief Financial Officer will terminate automatically after five  
years (from 1 September 2011) without requiring notice. 
Under the current service agreements of the Executive Directors, 
on a change of control the Director may terminate the contract  
by giving one month’s notice and will, in addition to contractual 
payments for the one-month notice period, receive a payment 
equal to 12 months’ salary, and remain eligible for a  
discretionary bonus.  
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a 
three-year term, which is renewable, with six months’ notice on 
either side, no contractual termination payments being due and 
subject to retirement pursuant to the Articles of Association at  
the Annual General Meeting. 
Policy on payment for loss of office 
Where an Executive Director leaves employment, the Committee’s 
approach to determining any payment for loss of office will 
normally be based on the following principles:  
• The Committee’s objective is to find an outcome which is in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders, taking into 
account the specific circumstances, contractual obligations, 
and seeking to pay no more than is warranted. Payments in lieu 
of notice will not exceed 12 months’ salary and benefits. 
• The Committee has discretion to make a payment under the 
annual bonus. This will reflect the period of service during  
the year and performance (measured at the same time as 
performance for other plan participants, if feasible). 
• The treatment of outstanding share awards would be 
determined by the relevant plan rules, as summarised in  
the table.  
• The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit 
payments where such payments are made in good faith  
in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of  
damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of 
settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection 
with the termination of a Director’s office or employment.  
CIP Investment 
Shares 
Shares will be released to the participant  
(the number of which, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, would reflect the 
proportion of the holding period that  
had elapsed). 
CIP Matching 
Shares or LTIP  
Awards will lapse unless the Committee in its 
absolute discretion determines otherwise for 
reasons including, amongst others, injury, 
disability, retirement, redundancy and death. 
The release of such awards will be dependent 
on the proportionate satisfaction of the 
performance target on the date of cessation 
and will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
proportion of the holding period that  
had elapsed. 
Share Options Unvested options will lapse unless specified 
otherwise in the terms of grant or if the 
Committee so determines. Vested options  
can be exercised within six-months of  
cessation (or such longer period as the 
Committee may decide, not exceeding  
42 months after cessation).  
 
   46 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Change of control and capital events 
The treatment of outstanding share awards would be dealt with in accordance with the relevant plan rules, as summarised in the table.  
Change of control CIP Investment Shares will be released.  
CIP Matching Shares or LTIP awards will be released, the proportion of any such awards 
released being dependent on the degree of satisfaction of the performance requirements on 
such date and (in the Committee’s discretion) the length of any holding period completed. 
Unvested share options may only be exercised to the extent that the Committee decides 
based on the proportionate satisfaction of the performance targets (taking into account the 
length of the period which has expired). 
Mergers  If the Company merges with another company or any of the businesses of the Group are 
demerged the Committee shall have discretion as to whether to release or adjust any  
CIP award. 
Variation of share capital If a variation of capital takes place then the number of shares subject to any award and the 
terms and conditions applying to such awards may be adjusted in such a manner as the 
Committee may determine to be appropriate and as the auditors of Regus shall have 
confirmed in writing to be in their opinion fair and reasonable. 
Illustration of remuneration policy 
The charts below illustrate the application of the Remuneration Policy set out in the Policy Table for Executive Directors. This assumes 
the level of fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and pension) as at 1 January 2014 and the following in respect of each scenario: 
• “Minimum” represents fixed remuneration only. 
• “Target” represents annual bonus of 50% of salary, half of which is deferred into the CIP and eligible for a maximum of four Matching 
Shares. It is assumed the Matching Shares vest at the threshold level of 25% of maximum.  
• “Maximum” represents the maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary, half of which is deferred into the CIP and eligible for a 
maximum of four Matching Shares. It is assumed the Matching Shares vest in full.

The salary, benefits, pension and cash element of the bonus for Dominique Yates are paid in Swiss francs and have been converted to 
pounds sterling for the table above using the average exchange rate for the relevant year. 
Benefits – includes private health insurance and, for Dominique Yates, it also includes a representation allowance, expatriate 
allowances, and a car allowance (2012 only). 
Annual bonus – includes the full value of the annual bonus awarded in respect of the relevant financial year. In both 2013 and 2012, 
50% of the value shown in the table was deferred into Investment Shares for three years subject to continued employment under the 
terms of the CIP, with the remainder received in cash.  
CIP awards – includes the value of Matching Share awards made to Mark Dixon under the CIP in previous years which vested in 
respect of a performance period ending in the relevant financial year. The vesting of the second tranche of the 2008/2009 Matching 
Shares is included in the 2013 column (334,047 shares vested out of the maximum of 954,420). The vesting of the 2010 LTIP Shares 
and the first tranche of the 2008/2009 Matching Shares is included in the 2012 column.  
Other – Dominique Yates was granted market value share options over one million shares in 2011 to aid his recruitment (exercise price 
74.35p). Based on the achievement against 2012 operating profit targets, the Remuneration Committee determined that 91% of the 
options vested. The vested options will become exercisable in equal tranches in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  
The remuneration in respect of the year ending 31 December 2013 of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors who served during the 
year is shown in the table below (with the prior year comparative).

Key components of remuneration 
The following sections describe how the Committee implemented key elements of the policy in the year ending 31 December 2013 and 
how it is intended to operate in the year ending 31 December 2014.  
Base salary and benefits 
The base salaries of the Executive Directors effective 1 January 2014 are set out in the table below together with the prior year 
comparative. 
 2013 2014
Mark Dixon (CEO) £587,000 £587,000
Dominique Yates* (CFO) CHF495,000 CHF495,000
*  The salary for Dominique Yates is denominated and paid in Swiss francs.  
   48 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Benefits 
Both Executive Directors receive private health insurance and life assurance. The CEO also receives a car/fuel allowance. The CFO  
also receives a representation allowance and housing/expatriate allowances. The benefits policy will remain the same for 2014.  
The Committee believes it is appropriate to continue payment of expatriate and housing allowances to the CFO as part of a market 
competitive package for the location of the role, although the Committee will keep this policy under review for future years. 
Annual bonus 
In 2013, the Executive Directors had a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary based on performance against stretching Group 
operating profit targets for the financial year. For the purposes of the annual bonus, the Committee makes adjustments to Group 
operating profit to reflect certain growth costs in order to ensure that the bonus does not act as a disincentive to the investment in  
new centres which underpins the long-term growth strategy.  
Based on the adjusted operating profit achieved in the year, the Committee determined that performance was between the target and 
maximum levels and therefore the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer should each receive a bonus of 79% of salary  
(79% of maximum) in respect of the year.  
In considering the bonus for the year, the Committee took into the following performance context (explained in more detail on pages  
19 to 23 of the annual report): 
• Growth in mature operating profit from £154.6m to £205.3m, with an increase in margin from 13.1% to 16.7%. 
• The addition of 448 new centres, in excess of the 300 expected at the start of the year. 
• The substantial returns to shareholders delivered via a doubling in the share price over the year. 
The Committee believes that the adjusted operating profit targets used to assess the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that 
it is not appropriate to disclose them currently or retrospectively.  
Half of the awarded bonus (39.5% of salary) is paid in cash and half (the remaining 39.5% of salary) will be awarded in the form of 
Investment Shares, the vesting of which will be deferred for three years, under the rules of the CIP (discussed in more detail below).  
There are no changes in bonus quantum or structure for the 2014 financial year. The maximum opportunity will remain at 100% of 
salary and 50% of the bonus earned being deferred into Investment Shares for three years. The bonus will continue to be assessed 
against stretching adjusted operating profit targets.  
CIP awards vesting in respect of 2013 
The 2008 and 2009 Matching Share awards were divided into three separate equal tranches subject to performance periods over three, 
four and five years respectively from 1 January 2010. The vesting conditions are outlined below.

The second tranche of the 2008 and 2009 Matching Share was based on a four-year performance period to 31 December 2013.  
The Committee has assessed performance against the TSR and EPS targets set in 2010 and concluded that 35% of the second 
tranche should vest (and the remainder of that tranche shall lapse): 
• TSR (25%). From a base point of 100%, Regus achieved a TSR value of 225.9% compared to 151.0% for the FTSE All Share Index 
over the performance period, equating to a vesting of 61.75% of this part of the award.  
• EPS (75%). Based on an adjusted 2013 EPS of 17.2p, which reflects underlying performance, adjusted to exclude the positive  
impact of changes in accounting policy and estimates implemented during 2013, and to exclude certain growth costs and one-off 
exceptional items, in accordance with the terms of the original award, the Committee concluded that 30% of this part of the award 
should vest.  
The final tranche of the 2008 and 2009 Matching Share awards will vest in March 2015 subject to performance over the five-year period 
to 31 December 2014.  
CIP awards made in 2013 
The Executive Directors deferred 50% of their 2012 annual bonus into Investment Shares under the CIP. The Investment Shares  
will vest and be released at the end of a three-year holding period, subject to continued employment with the Regus Group during  
that period.  
For each Investment Share held the Executive Directors may earn up to a maximum of four Matching Shares which will vest subject to 
EPS and TSR performance conditions in three equal tranches over performance periods of three, four and five years. 
Details of the Investment Share and Matching Share awards made during 2013 to the Executive Directors are shown in the table below.

CIP awards to be made in 2014 
The Executive Directors will defer 50% of their 2013 annual bonus into Investment Shares under the CIP. These Investment Shares  
will vest after three years in line with the terms described above. For each Investment Share the Executive Directors will be awarded  
the opportunity to earn up to four Matching Shares. As described above, the Investment Shares will have a value of 39.5% of salary, 
implying a maximum number of Matching Shares to be awarded in 2014 of 158% of salary. The number of Investment Shares and 
Matching Shares awarded will be disclosed when granted and in next year’s report. 
The Matching Shares will vest subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions in three equal tranches over performance periods of 
three, four and five years in accordance with the targets as set out below.

Straight-line vesting between these points. No vesting below the threshold target. 
In previous years, the TSR targets were based on out-performance of the FTSE All Share index (as illustrated in the tables in the 
sections above). For 2014 awards, the Committee has re-calibrated the TSR targets which are now based on the ranked TSR 
performance of Regus against the constituents of the FTSE 350 (excluding financial services and mining companies). The Committee 
believes that, given the absence of any listed peer companies, the use of a broad equity index remains appropriate, and that the  
FTSE 350 is preferable to the All Share index on the basis of the position of Regus in the FTSE 350 index. Companies from the financial 
services and mining sectors are excluded in order to ensure the TSR result is not unduly skewed by the performance of these sectors 
which are often subject to their own business cycles.  
For the purposes of the CIP, EPS will be defined as basic EPS of the Group. The Committee has discretion to adjust EPS (both 
positively and negatively) to take into account one-off exceptional items which do not appropriately reflect underlying performance of  
the Group, and to make adjustments where the number of new centres is significantly above or below that envisaged when the targets 
were set. The purpose of such adjustments is to ensure a fair measurement of performance and to avoid the EPS targets acting as a 
disincentive to the investment in new centres which underpins the long-term growth strategy. The equivalent basic EPS figure for 2013 
would be 7.1p, and therefore the targets represent at the maximum approximately 26-34% growth per annum, which the Committee 
believes is very stretching in the current environment particularly over performance periods which extend over three, four and five years. 
Pension  
The Executive Directors participate in the Company’s money purchase pension scheme. The Company matches contributions up to a 
maximum of 7% of basic salary. The Committee considers that the pension benefits of the Executive Directors are low compared with 
comparative companies but prefers to offer enhanced variable compensation (rather than a fixed additional pension contribution).  
The Group does not operate a Group-wide defined benefit pension scheme (with the exception of Switzerland, where pension schemes 
are treated as such for accounting purposes) and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.

c) The CIP Matching Shares are in the form of unvested conditional shares which will vest subject to the achievement of EPS and TSR performance targets.  
The number of share interests includes the following awards which were unvested as at 31 December 2013. For Mark Dixon, the number includes1,908,840 
Matching Shares under tranches two and three of the 2008/2009 CIP awards (granted on 18 March 2008 and 23 March 2009, respectively) and 754,340 
Matching Shares granted on 6 March 2013. For Dominique Yates, the number shows the Matching Shares granted on 6 March 2013.  
d) The Share Option Plan (SOP) grants are vested market value share options (exercise price 74.35p) which were granted to Dominique Yates on 2 September 2011 
to aid his recruitment. The options will become exercisable in three equal tranches in September 2014, 2015 and 2016. 
At the end of the previous financial year (31 December 2012), Mark Dixon retained an unvested interest over a maximum of  
1.8 million shares under the Value Creation Plan (VCP) granted in 2008. Based on the share price performance to 31 March 2013  
(the final Measurement Date under this award), the award lapsed in full (as disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report). 
With the exception of the Directors' interests disclosed in the table above, no Director had any additional interest in the share capital  
of the Company during the year.  
There were no changes in the interests of Directors in the period 31 December 2013 to 31 March 2014.

Performance graph and table 
The chart below shows the TSR of Regus in the five-year period to 31 December 2013 against the TSR of the FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment trusts) and All Share Indices. TSR refers to share price growth and assumes dividends are reinvested over the relevant 
period. The Committee considers the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts) relevant since it is an index of companies of similar size  
to Regus. The All Share Index is also shown as it was used historically to measure the Company’s TSR performance under the CIP. 
 
The table below provides remuneration data for the Chief Executive for each of the five financial years over the equivalent period.

External non-executive directorships held by Executive Directors 
As at 31 December 2013 the Executive Directors did not hold any external positions for which they received fees. Executive Directors 
are permitted to accept appointments on external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business 
of the Group. Any fees received in respect of these appointments would be retained directly by the Executive Director. 
Consideration of Directors’ remuneration – Remuneration Committee and advisors 
The Committee, which met four times during the year, is made up of four Independent Non-Executive Directors and chaired by Alex 
Sulkowski. During the year the members of the Committee were: 
• Alex Sulkowski (Chair) 
• Lance Browne 
• Elmar Heggen 
• Florence Pierre 
The Committee has responsibility for determining, in consultation with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive as appropriate, the total 
remuneration package of the Executive Directors and senior managers, including bonuses, incentive payments and share options or 
other share awards. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website: www.regus.com.  
In addition to the designated members of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary 
also attended Committee meetings during the year although none was present during discussions concerning their own remuneration. 
Deloitte LLP continued to provide independent advice to the Committee during the year. Deloitte was appointed by the Committee  
in 2010 following a competitive selection process undertaken by the Committee. The fees charged by Deloitte for the provision of 
independent advice to the Committee during 2013 were £42,000.  
Deloitte also provided unrelated tax advice to Regus during 2013. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner 
and team, that provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Regus that may impair their independence  
and objectivity. 
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultant’s Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. 
Statement of voting at general meeting 
The Committee is directly accountable to shareholders and, in this context, is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with 
shareholders on the issue of executive remuneration. The members of the Committee attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
and are available to answer shareholders’ questions about Directors’ remuneration. 
Votes cast by proxy and at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 May 2013 in respect of the advisory vote to approve the Directors’

year were: 
Executive Directors 
Mark Dixon 
Dominique Yates 
Non-Executive Directors 
Douglas Sutherland 
Lance Browne 
Elmar Heggen 
Florence Pierre 
Alex Sulkowski 
Biographical details for the Directors are shown on page 32. 
Details of the Directors’ interests and shareholdings are given in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 53. 
The Corporate Responsibility Statement, Corporate Governance 
Statement, Audit Committee Report, Remuneration Report and 
Director Statements on pages 28 to 56 all form part of this report. 
Principal activity 
The Company is the world’s leading provider of global office 
outsourcing services. 
Business review 
The Directors have presented a Strategic Report as follows: 
The Chief Executive Officer’s Review and Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on pages 15 to 23 respectively address: 
• review of the Company’s business (pages 15 to 18); 
• trends and factors likely to affect the future development, 
performance and position of the business (pages 15 to 18); 
• development and performance during the financial year  
(pages 19 to 23); 
• employee development, performance and diversity (page 17); 
and 
• position of the business at the end of the year (pages 22  
and 23). 
The Corporate Responsibility Report, on page 28, includes the 
sections of the Strategic Report in respect of: 
• environmental matters; and 
• social and community issues. 
The Audit Committee report, on pages 38 to 40, includes a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing  
the Company. 
The Directors’ Statements on page 56 includes the statutory 
statement in respect of disclosure to auditors. 
The Directors do not consider any contractual or other 
relationships with external parties to be essential to the business 
of the Group. 
Results and dividends 
Profit before taxation for the year was £81.5m (2012: £85.1m). 
The Directors are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 
£23.6m (2012: £20.7m), being 2.5 pence per share (2012:  
2.2 pence per share). The total dividend for the year will therefore 
be 3.6 pence per share, made up of the interim dividend of  
1.1 pence per share paid in October 2013 (2012: 1.0 pence  
per share) and, assuming the final dividend is approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, an additional 2.5 pence  
per share (2012: 2.2 pence per share) which is expected to be 
paid on 30 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 2 May 2014. 
Policy and practice on payment of creditors 
The Group does not follow a universal code dealing specifically 
with payments to suppliers but, where appropriate, our practice  
is to:  
• agree the terms of payment upfront with the supplier; 
• ensure that suppliers are made aware of these terms of 
payment; and 
• pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations. 
At 31 December 2013, the number of creditor days outstanding 
for the Group was 31 days (2012: 22 days) and for the Company 
was 28 days (2012: 41 days). 
Going concern 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Accounts on pages 58  
to 62. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors have considered the further information 
included in the business activities commentary as set out on page 
18, as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set 
out on pages 24 to 27. Based on the performance of the Group, 
its financial position and cash flows, the Board is satisfied that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. 
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be 
found in note 22 of the notes to the accounts on page 83. 
Employees 
The Group treats applicants for employment with disabilities with 
full and fair consideration according to their skills and capabilities. 
Should an employee become disabled during their employment, 
efforts are made to retain them in their current employment or  
to explore opportunities for their retraining or redeployment 
elsewhere within the Group. 
Political and charitable donations 
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations either in  
the UK or overseas. The Group made charitable donations of 
£80,500 during the year (2012: £30,000).

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company annual accounts in 
accordance with Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice and applicable law. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
their profit or loss for the period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• for the parent company annual accounts, state whether 
applicable Luxembourg accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the parent company annual accounts; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at  
any time the financial position of the parent company and to 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
applicable law and regulations. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration 
Report and a Corporate Governance Statement that complies 
with that law and those regulations.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s websites. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and  
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.  
Statutory statement as to disclosure to auditor 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ statements confirm that: 
• so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and  
• each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. 
These financial statements have been approved by the Directors 
of the Company. The Directors confirm that the financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations and that they include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position  
of the parent company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of  
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
We, the Directors of the Company, confirm that to the best of  
our knowledge: 
• the financial statements prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation as 
a whole; and 
• the Directors’ Report, including content contained by reference, 
includes a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

To the Shareholders of  
Regus plc (société anonyme) 
26, Boulevard Royal 
L-2449 Luxembourg 
REPORT OF THE RÉVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGRÉÉ 
Report on the consolidated financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Regus plc (société anonyme), which comprise the 
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013 and the 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information, as set out on pages 58 to 103. 
Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated 
financial statements  
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and  
fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as 
the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free  
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our  
audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as 
adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du 
Secteur Financier. Those standards require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement 
of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation  
of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not  
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating 
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of 
Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, as set out  
on pages 58 to 103, give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position of Regus plc (société anonyme) as of

(a) Total reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent. 
Share capital represents the net proceeds (the nominal value) on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital. 
At 31 December 2013 Treasury shares represent 5,257,380 (2012: 8,982,139) ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the 
purposes of the Group’s employee share option plans and the share buy-back programme. During the period, nil shares were 
purchased in the open market and 3,724,759 treasury shares held by the Group were utilised to satisfy the exercise of share awards by 
employees. As at 4 March 2014, 5,257,380 treasury shares were held. 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.  
The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic to fair value at the time of 
the acquisition of the outstanding 58% interest on 19 April 2006. 
Other reserves include £37.9m arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken on 14 October 2008, £6.5m relating to merger 
reserves and £0.1m to the redemption of preference shares partly offset by £29.2m arising from the Scheme of Arrangement 
undertaken in 2003.

1. Authorisation of financial statements 
The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 4 March 2014 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominique Yates. Regus plc 
S.A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary shares 
are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
Regus plc S.A. owns a network of business centres which are leased to a variety of business customers. Information on the Group’s 
structure is provided in Note 30, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in Note 29. 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company prepares its parent Company annual accounts in 
accordance with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts from these are presented on pages 104 and 105. 
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and 
equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities. The extract from the parent Company annual 
accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. 
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with an effective date from 1 January 2013 did not have a material effect on the Group financial 
statements, unless otherwise indicated. 
IAS 1   Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 
IAS 12  Amendment to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax accounting for investment property at fair value 
IAS 19  IAS 19 Revised – Employee Benefits 
IFRS 1  Amendments to IFRS 1 – Government Loans 
IFRS 1  Amendment to IFRS 1 – Exemption for severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates 
IFRS 7  Amendments to IFRS 7 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
IFRS 13  Fair Value Measurement 
IFRIC 20  Stripping Costs in the Production of a Surface Mine 
Various  Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2009 – 2011 Cycle) 
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities 
that are measured at fair value.  
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 58 to 103. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further 
information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 15 to 18 as well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 24 to 27. 
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 22 to the notes to the accounts on page 84. 
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£), which is Regus plc’s functional currency, and all 
values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise. 
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.  
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity 
accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or the associate 
qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.  
  
Notes to the accounts 64 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by 
contractual agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of 
jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control 
ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less 
costs to sell and carrying value.  
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition 
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of a joint venture. 
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group. 
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase 
method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect of these 
adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve. 
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus 
plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction, Regus plc 
had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group 
plc. Consequently no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to 
Regus plc. 
IFRSs not yet effective 
The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements as they are 
effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2014 or have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. Their adoption is not 
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise indicated: 
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (Revised) (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2014
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Revised) 1 January 2014
IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014
IAS 36 Amendments to IAS 36 – Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets 1 January 2014
IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 – Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 1 January 2014
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2017
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2014
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2014
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (and subsequent amendments) 1 January 2014
IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014
The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early adoption 
and relevant to the Group. The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become effective and/or 
endorsed by the European Union, whichever is later. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights  
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences. The results are consolidated until the date control ceases  
or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs  
to sell and carrying value. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable 
amount was estimated at 31 October 2013 and updated at 31 December 2013. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash-
generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. 
  
Notes to the accounts
continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
  www.regus.com/investors 65
 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in  
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over 
the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the re-assessment still 
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in 
profit or loss.  
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, 
whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for 
the purpose of impairment testing. 
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the 
requirements of IFRS. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a 
business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Brand – Regus brand  Indefinite life 
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years 
Computer software   5 years 
Customer lists   2 years 
Management agreements  Minimum duration of the contract 
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no 
goodwill is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of 
control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. 
Leases 
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s property leases, are categorised as operating leases. 
Finance leases 
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors,  
net of any future finance charges. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Operating leases 
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments. The commencement of the lease 
term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, 
together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the 
lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option. 
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover 
or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised in the income 
statement as they are incurred. 
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at 
an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
   66 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Buildings    50 years 
Fixtures and fittings   10 years 
Furniture    10 years 
Office equipment and telephones 5 years 
Motor vehicles   4 years 
Computer hardware  3 – 5 years 
The useful life of certain plant, property and equipment were revised in 2012. 
Revenue 
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding 
sales taxes). Where rent free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the 
customer contract. 
Workstations 
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred and 
recognised as revenue upon provision of the service. 
Customer service income 
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as 
an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue. 
Management and franchise fees 
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged 
for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are 
recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used. 
Membership card income 
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card are 
expected to be provided. 
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned from the provision of global workplace solutions. 
Employee benefits 
The Group’s major pension plans are of the defined contribution type. For these plans the Group’s contribution and other paid and 
unpaid benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method. 
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan 
assets, excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to 
retained earnings through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Service costs are recognised in profit or loss, and include current and past service costs as well as gains and losses on curtailments. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation under ‘cost of sales’, ‘selling, general and administration expenses’ and ‘Research and 
development expenses’ in consolidated income statement: service costs comprising current service costs; past-service costs; and 
gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements. 
Settlements of defined benefit schemes are recognised in the period in which the settlement occurs.

Share-based payments 
The share option programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards 
are granted by the ultimate parent. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair 
value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into accounts the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due 
only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the 
employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share appreciation 
rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted.  
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan which awards entitlements to certain employees and Directors of the Group. These 
entitlements are convertible into options over ordinary shares subject to the Group’s share price reaching certain targets.  
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is initially recognised at the date of the award of the entitlements and spread over the period during which the entitlements are 
convertible into ordinary shares. 
The fair value of the entitlements is based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the instruments were granted. 
Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; 
the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well 
advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. 
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Net finance expenses 
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that relate to 
financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of 
the related financial liability on the balance sheet. Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a prepayment and 
recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant unamortised 
portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying value of the financial liability and charged to the interest expense using the effective 
interest rate method. 
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the 
discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate. 
Costs arising on bank guarantees and letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses have been classified separately as other 
finance costs in the income statement. 
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate method. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is 
designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated 
at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets or 
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial 
recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in profit or loss. 
Held-to-maturity financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.  
Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on debt 
instruments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve. When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans 
and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition would be 
immaterial. 
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The results and cash flows of overseas 
operations are translated using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of 
foreign operations are translated using the closing rate with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised in other 
comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Exchange differences are released to the 
income statement on disposal. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 22. Derivative financial instruments are measured 
initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has been 
designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including those that relate to transactions with other operating segments. An operating segment’s results are reviewed 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Directors of the Group) to make decisions about resources to be allocated 
to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East 
and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s non-trading 
holding and corporate management companies that are based in the UK and the EMEA segment does not include the Group’s non-
trading head office and holding companies that are based in Luxembourg and Switzerland. The results of business centres in each of 
these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker. All reportable segments are 
involved in the provision of global workplace solutions. 
The Group’s reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic 
characteristics that exist in each of those markets. Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible 
for the performance of the segment. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2012. The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit 
which excludes internal revenue, corporate overheads and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other 
operating segments.

4. Segmental analysis – entity-wide disclosures 
The Group’s primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions and therefore all revenue is 
attributed to a single group of similar products and services. It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of 
products. Revenue is recognised where the service is provided. 
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
The Group’s revenue from external customers and non-current assets analysed by foreign country is as follows:

Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and 
share-based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are 
forecast taxable profits in the entities concerned. 
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £150.8m  
(2012: £172.3m). The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

Cash generating units (CGUs), comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying 
out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through 
business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these CGUs. 
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 
 
2013  
£m 
2012

Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 203.0 185.3

Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 23.0 25.1
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 169.0 96.3
 438.7 317.0
The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and the UK, is material relative to the total 
carrying value comprising 80.1% of the total. The remaining 19.9% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 35 countries (35 cash 
generating units). The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units are set out below:

The indefinite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the 
year ended 31 December 2006 (see note 12). 
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value

The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the  
value in use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects 
external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates,  
which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group. Management believe that the projected cash  
flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term. In the event that trading conditions deteriorate 
beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods. 
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of CGUs: 
• Future cash flows are based on the budget for 2014 approved by the Board. The model excludes cost savings and restructurings 
that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter forecasts have 
been prepared by management for a further four years from 2014 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3% (2012: 3%).  
• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. Management 
consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position. Cash flows beyond 2018 
have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the 
markets in which the relevant CGUs operate. A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Group’s expectation that  
it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses. 
• The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each CGU. The country specific discount rate 
is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group. The Group WACC is then adjusted for each CGU 
to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country. The Group WACC decreased marginally to 13.6% in 2013 (2012: 14.0%). 
The market risk adjustment has been set between 12.3% and 18.6% (2012: 16.0% to 20.0%). 
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the CGU’s are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to 
conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the CGUs. 
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the cash-generating 
units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount. The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are 
based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year. These models therefore do not reflect the expected improvement 
in margin as new centres mature. 
The key assumptions used in the US model forecasts a centre contribution of 25%, with an average centre contribution of 23% over  
the next five years. Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2013 maintaining a terminal 2018 centre gross margin of 23%. 
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using  
a pre-tax discount rate of 17% (2012:19%). 
The UK model forecasts a 2014 centre contribution of 23%, with an average centre contribution of 22% over the next five years. 
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using  
a pre-tax discount rate of 14% (2012:15%). 
Management has considered the following sensitivities: 
Market growth and WIPOW – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW. The value in use 
calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK CGUs would still be 
greater than their carrying value. 
Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use 
calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to 
be increased to 22% (2012: 28%) for the US CGU and 22% (2012: 28%) for the UK CGU. 
There is no goodwill relating to the Group’s joint ventures.

Included with the brand value is £11.2m relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended  
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the 
value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group. 
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying 
value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount 
of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 11). 
The remaining amortisation life for non-indefinite life brands is 11 years.

22. Financial instruments and financial risk management 
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are 
determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief 
Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day-to-day basis. The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Group’s risk 
management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility  
for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Audit Committee  
is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role. 
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business. 
Going concern 
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are  
likely to affect the future performance and position of the business. The financial review on pages 19 to 23 within the Strategic Report 
reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2013 the  
Group made a significant investment in growth and the Group’s net cash position declined by £177.2m to a net debt position of 
£57.2m as at 31 December 2013. The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Group’s 
mature business centres and bank debt. In 2013 the Group extended the revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship 
banks from £200m to £320m, with a final maturity in 2017. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report  
and Accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises 
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits. 
A diversified customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts, which 
contribute the majority of the Group’s revenue, minimise the Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes 
a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are 
judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more than 
three months overdue which reflects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. 
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.

At the year end 31 December 2013, the Group maintained a provision of £7.0m against potential bad debts (2012: £5.8m) arising from 
trade receivables. The Group had provided £1.1m (2012: £2.2m) in the year and utilised £0.5m (2012: £8.2m). Customer deposits of 
£239.5m (2012: £198.6m) are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default. 
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its 
revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.  
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management 
does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and forecast 
capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group has free cash and 
liquid investments (excluding blocked cash) of £63.3m (2012: £67.6m). In addition to cash and liquid investments, the Group had 
£167.9m available and undrawn under its committed bank facilities. The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity to meet 
day-to-day requirements. 
In September 2013 the Group extended its revolving credit facility from £200m to £320m and extended the final maturity date to 
September 2017. 
Although the Group has net current liabilities of £289.1m (2012: £183.7m), the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity 
risk. A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in 
future periods through the income statement. Although the Group holds customer deposits of £239.5m (2012: £198.6m) these are 
spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material. Therefore the Group does not 
believe the balance represents a liquidity risk. The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were £109.3m at 31 December 
2013 (2012 net current assets: £32.6m).  
Market risk 
The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the market value of our 
investments in financial assets. These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with a written 
policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt, as well as 
investment in financial assets. The surplus cash balances are invested short term, and at the end of 2013 no cash was invested for a 
period exceeding three months.

Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements. The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries 
are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small. Transactional exposures do arise in some 
countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of 
the affiliate. Intercompany charging, funding and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures. It is the policy 
of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, 
thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement. Net investments in Regus affiliates with a functional currency other 
than pound sterling are of a long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures. 
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposures 
where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks. No transactions of a speculative nature  
are undertaken. 
The foreign currency exposure arising from open third party transactions held in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
related entity is summarised as follows: 
2013
£m GBP JPY EUR USD
Trade and other receivables – – 4.9 13.0
Loans – – – –
Trade and other payables (0.3) (3.5) (6.7) (12.0)
Net statement of financial position exposure (0.3) (3.5) (1.8) 1.0
Other market risks 
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the 
income statement. 
Sensitivity analysis 
For the year ending 31 December 2013 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have 
theoretically decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.2m (2012: increase of £1.3m) with a corresponding increase 
in total equity. 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pound sterling would have theoretically 
decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £3.3m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £2.8m). It is estimated 
that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pound sterling would have decreased the Group’s profit before 
tax by approximately £0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: increase of £0.7m). 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pound sterling would have theoretically 
decreased the Group’s total equity by approximately £12.6m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £9.4m). It is estimated that 
a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pound sterling would have decreased the Group’s total equity by 
approximately £0.4m for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £0.1m). 
Capital management 
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The Chief 
Financial Officer monitors the diversity of the Group’s major shareholders and further details of the Group’s communication with key 
investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 33 to 37. In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of  
a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders. 
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board  
hold shares in the Company. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on 
pages 41 to 53. In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees. 
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share 
capital in the market. In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buy-back programme to meet both the need to issue shares under 
the Group’s share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders. 
In the year ended 31 December 2013 Regus plc purchased 1,464,685 (2012: 1,765,783) of its own shares in the open market and 
utilised these to satisfy employee share awards. Regus plc did not re-purchase any of its own shares in the open market to hold  
as treasury shares, however 3,724,759 treasury shares held by the Group were utilised to satisfy the exercise of share awards by 
employees. As at 4 March 2014, 5,257,380 shares were held as treasury shares. 
The Company declared an interim dividend of 1.1p per share (2012: 1.0p) during the year ended 31 December 2013 and proposed a 
final dividend of 2.5p per share (2012: 2.2p per share), a 10% increase on the 2012 dividend.  
The Group’s objective when managing capital (equity and borrowings) is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group has a modest net debt position at the end of 2013 
and  £167.9m of committed undrawn bank facilities.   86 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

During the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 fair value 
measurements, and no financial instruments requiring Level 3 fair value measurements were held. 
Valuation techniques 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are 
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: 
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
   88 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
22. Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued) 
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 and level 3 fair values, as well as the significant 
unobservable inputs used: 
Type Valuation technique 
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables/payables and customer deposits 
For cash and cash equivalents, receivables/payables with a remaining life of 
less than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the 
fair value because of their short-term nature. 
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future 
cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market 
assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities. 
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the 
carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments  
are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year. 
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on broker quotes. 
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

In September 2013 the Group amended and extended its revolving credit facility from £200m to £320m and final maturity to September 
2017. In addition, the Group amended and extended its bank guarantee and letter of credit facility to a revised total of £95m and 
aligned the conditions and the maturity with the £320m facility. Both facilities are subject to financial covenants relating to operating 
cash flow, net debt to EBITDA, and EBITDA plus rent to interest plus rent. The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
23. Share-based payment 
There are three share-based payment plans, details of which are outlined below: 
Plan 1: Regus Group Share Option Plan 
During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan that entitles Executive Directors and certain employees to 
purchase shares in Regus plc (previously Regus Group plc). In accordance with this programme, holders of vested options are entitled 
to purchase shares at the market price of the shares at the day before the date of grant. 
The Regus Group also operates the Regus Group Share Option Plan (France) which is included within the numbers for the Regus Share 
Option Plan disclosed above. The terms of the Regus Share Option Plan (France) are materially the same as the Regus Group Share 
Option Plan with the exception that they are only exercisable from the fourth anniversary of the date of grant assuming the performance 
conditions have been met.

Performance conditions for share options 
July 2004 share option plan 
The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest.  
The share options vested based on the basic earnings per share (adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible 
amortisation) that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index. The basic earnings per share for performance purposes  
was 1p. 100% of the options awarded in July 2004 vested during 2007. 
May, June and August 2010 share option plan 
The options awarded in May, June and September 2010 contain the following performance conditions. 50% of the options will be 
eligible to vest if the Regus Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) % achieved relative to the FTSE All Share Total Return index is at least  
at the median over the performance period. The remaining 50% of the options will be eligible to vest subject to the EPS conditions  
in the table below:

Plan 2: Regus plc Co-Investment Plan (CIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The CIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus whereby a gross bonus of up to 50% of basic annual salary will be taken as a 
deferred amount of shares (“Investment Shares”) to be released at the end of a defined period of not less than three years, with the 
balance paid in cash. Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the number of Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on 
the Company’s future performance. The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded to a participant in any calendar 
year under the CIP is 200% of salary. As such the maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded, based on Investment 
Shares awarded, is in the ratio of 4:1. 
The LTIP provides for the Remuneration Committee to make stand-alone long-term incentive awards without reference to the annual 
bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary per calendar year.

(a) The LTIP awards have a release date of 23 March 2013. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life is on the basis that the awards release 
immediately. The LTIP nil cost options have a vesting date of 23 March 2013 and an expiry of 23 March 2020. The performance conditions are set out below. 
(b) The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the date of the award. A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years. The Remuneration 
Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards was updated 
in the year ended 31 December 2010. 
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently  
in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets 
must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the 
underlying performance of the business. 
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following 
adjustments are currently anticipated for the 2008 and 2009 grants: 
• In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years. Thus it is important to 
ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly those 
costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth, will be excluded from the EPS calculation. 
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current  
year losses from investing in new locations. 
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded. 
• It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby 
increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise 
deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.  
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum  
of 30%. 
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the 
Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value. In addition, the TSR 
condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to shareholders is competitive 
compared to comparable companies.

The performance conditions are as follows: 
2008 and 2009 CIP Investment and matching grants 
The Remuneration Committee agreed to the following modifications to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following 
performance conditions would apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010. 
The total number of awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and was 
subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, 
the first amount vests in March 2013, the second vests in March 2014 and the third vests in March 2015. These vesting dates relate to 
the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively. The vesting of these awards  
is subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts is subject to defined 
earnings per share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) targets over the respective periods. The targets are as follows: 
EPS targets for the financial years ending

The total number of awards made in 2013 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and was subject to future 
performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount 
will vest in March 2016, the second will vest in March 2017 and the third will vest in March 2018. These vesting dates relate to the 
financial years ending 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 respectively. The vesting of these awards is 
subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts is subject to defined 
earnings per share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total

Plan 3: Regus plc Value Creation Plan 
The VCP was introduced in 2008 as a one-off award with the objective of delivering exceptional rewards to participants provided 
absolute returns to shareholders are exceptional. The VCP operates over a five-year period from May 2008 to March 2013. Participants 
in the VCP are granted entitlements (“VCP Entitlements”) to receive a maximum number of shares which shall be earned by the 
conversion of the VCP Entitlements into an option or series of options (the “VCP Options”) which may be granted on certain dates (the 
“Measurement Dates”) based on the Company’s share price performance. The exercise price for VCP Options is the closing share price 
on the date of the Company’s 2008 AGM.

24. Retirement Benefit Obligations 
The Group accounts for the Swiss pension plans as a defined benefit plans under IAS 19 Revised – Employee Benefits. The Group 
adopted the updated requirements of IAS 19 Revised – Employee Benefits on 1 January 2013. This change in accounting policy has  
no significant effect on the Group financial statements due to the immaterial nature of the plans.

consideration of £16.3m. 
In addition to the above, a further £56.8m of purchase consideration was paid to complete a further 12 business and net asset 
acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The completion of business or net asset acquisitions is a key component of our strategic aim to expand our network. 
MWB Business Exchange Plc acquisition 
On 20 February 2013, the Group acquired 75.22% of MWB Business Exchange Plc. The remaining non-controlling interest (“NCI”) of 
24.78% was subsequently acquired on 22 March 2013. The subsequent acquisition of this NCI was accounted for under the present-
access method, resulting in an equity transaction of £16.3m. The total purchase consideration for MWB Business Exchange Plc  
was £65.7m.

resulting in an equity transaction of £16.3m. 
The goodwill arising on the above acquisition reflects the anticipated future benefits the Group can obtain from operating the business 
more efficiently, primarily through savings on overheads. None of the above goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
There was no contingent consideration arising on this acquisition. 
The external acquisition costs associated with this transaction were £3.9m, recorded within selling, general and administration 
expenses within the consolidated income statement. 
MWB Business Exchange was fully integrated into the overall operations of the Group during 2013. The Group is therefore unable to 
determine the contribution of MWB Business Exchange on the consolidated revenue and operating profit of the Group.

more efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services. £9.1m of the above goodwill is 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
There was no material contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions. 
The external acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £1.4m, recorded within selling, general and administration 
expenses within the interim consolidated income statement.  
The Group continued to complete acquisition transactions subsequent to 31 December 2013, which will be accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 3. Due to the timing of these transactions, it is not practical to disclose the information associated with the initial 
accounting for these acquisitions.  
During the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group made a number of individually insignificant acquisitions for a total consideration  
of £49.6m.

25. Acquisitions (continued) 
The net assets recognised in the 31 December 2012 consolidated financial statements were based on a provisional assessment of their 
fair value. The valuation had not been completed by the date the 2012 financial statements were approved for issue by management. 
In 2013, the valuation was completed and the fair value of the other assets was £6.4m, an increase of £2.6m over the provisional value 
and the current liabilities was £10.3m, an increase of £6.2m over the provisional value. As a result, there was also a corresponding 
increase in goodwill of £3.6m, resulting in £42.9m of total goodwill arising on the acquisition. 
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from operating the businesses 
more efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding products and services. £23.6m of the above 
goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
There was no material contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions. 
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £0.9m, recorded within administration expenses within the consolidated 
income statement.

31. Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and 
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. 
Fair value accounting for business combinations 
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market in the 
category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company 
do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available 
information and experience.  
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where management’s judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include 
tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For significant business 
combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be 
included in the financial statements.  
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill 
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event 
or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying value  
of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, which 
assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of 
the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount. Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the 
impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2013, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in 
note 11. 
Tax assets and liabilities 
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and  
other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business 
results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax 
consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. 
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the assets can be used. The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast  
to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future. Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities 
arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can 
be estimated reliably. Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant 
additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for. 
Onerous lease provisions 
We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to recover 
the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point. The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable 
under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate. 
Dilapidations 
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date  
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the 
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made  
to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary. 
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur  
and can be reliably estimated.  104 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements under the historical cost 
convention which differs in material respects from IFRS in both the measurement and presentation of certain transactions. 
The Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of Regus plc. 
The balance sheet has been extracted from the full accounts of Regus plc for the period ended 31 December 2013 which are available 
from the Company’s registered office, 26 Boulevard Royal, Luxembourg and which will be filed with both the Luxembourg Chamber of 
Commerce and the Jersey Register of Companies. 
Financial assets 
Shares in affiliated undertakings are valued at purchase price including acquisition costs. Where any permanent diminution in value is 
identified, value adjustments are recorded in the profit and loss account. These value adjustments are not continued if the reasons 
which caused their initial recording cease to apply.  106 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

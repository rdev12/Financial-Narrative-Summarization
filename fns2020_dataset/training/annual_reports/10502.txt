How do we operate?
Our comparison services offer a compelling proposition both to 
our customers and to product providers.
Our customers are able to search and compare products by price, 
product features and service in one place so that they can choose 
the product most suited to their needs. This saves our customers 
valuable time and helps our customers to make the most of their 
money – always important but never more so than during uncertain 
economic times.
To providers, we strive to offer the most cost effective solution to 
customer acquisition in our chosen business areas. By matching the 
right customer to the right provider we offer our providers an 
efficient and completely measurable media tool. We have 
considerable volumes of informed customers actively looking for the 
product most suited to their needs and ready to purchase. This 
enables product providers and advertisers to target their marketing 
spend most effectively.
Our online services are free to our customers. Our revenue comes 
predominantly from fees paid to us by product providers and 
advertisers either when our customer clicks through to their website 
or when our customer actually applies for or purchases a product. 
How do we measure our 
performance? 
We use a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure 
our performance against our strategy. These are reviewed on a 
regular basis. The principal KPIs for each of our verticals are:

How do we operate?
Our comparison services offer a compelling proposition both to 
our customers and to product providers.
Our customers are able to search and compare products by price, 
product features and service in one place so that they can choose 
the product most suited to their needs. This saves our customers 
valuable time and helps our customers to make the most of their 
money – always important but never more so than during uncertain 
economic times.
To providers, we strive to offer the most cost effective solution to 
customer acquisition in our chosen business areas. By matching the 
right customer to the right provider we offer our providers an 
efficient and completely measurable media tool. We have 
considerable volumes of informed customers actively looking for the 
product most suited to their needs and ready to purchase. This 
enables product providers and advertisers to target their marketing 
spend most effectively.
Our online services are free to our customers. Our revenue comes 
predominantly from fees paid to us by product providers and 
advertisers either when our customer clicks through to their website 
or when our customer actually applies for or purchases a product. 
How do we measure our 
performance? 
We use a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure 
our performance against our strategy. These are reviewed on a 
regular basis. The principal KPIs for each of our verticals are:

The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release 1. 
made in respect of the anti-virus software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or URL displayed 
on an email or webpage to the destination website. This meant that many web based businesses including the Group recorded 
visitors from users of the AVG software who themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor count has been 
adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further update to its anti-virus software early in July 2008 which resolved 
the issue.

Brand 8 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Chairman’s Statement 
Our third year as a public company 
was one of great change. The 
impact of the credit crunch on our 
business, especially our Money 
vertical, was significant. Across the 
whole of the United Kingdom, there 
was a collapse in mortgage and 
secured lending as the banks 
contracted their loan books. 
Against this economic backdrop, the 
Group’s revenue declined by 23% 
from £178.8m to £136.9m for the 
year ending 31 December 2009 and 
adjusted EBITDA declined by 26% to 
£36.0m for the year. 
However, some positives for the 
Group emerged from the crisis. It 
accelerated our transition to a 
professional management team; it 
prompted a significant reduction in 
the cost base; it precipitated a 
review and rethink of everything 
that we do; and it demonstrated the 
resilience of our diversified business 
model with yet another year of solid 
cash flow. 
Peter Plumb was appointed Chief 
Executive Officer in February 2009. 
Graham Donoghue and David 
Osborne were appointed as 
Directors at the same time. All are 
experienced professional managers.
The new management team have 
settled in well. The drop in profitability 
was minimised, the business was 
stabilised, improvements were made 
and by the final quarter our year on 
year profitability was ahead of the 
previous year. We came through the 
worst recession since the 1930’s solidly 
profitable, leaner and better managed.
Each of our verticals were 
significantly enhanced during the 
year and our advertising programme 
changed, initially with Peter Jones 
and then the new programme which 
commenced in January this year 
with Omid Djalili. We retained our 
leading market position in the 
Money vertical, maintaining market 
share, in spite of revenues, 
particularly from mortgage and 
secured lending, falling by 44%. 
We lost some market share in the 
first quarter in our Insurance 
vertical, when some of our site 
enhancements failed to generate 
the improvements expected, but 
held share in the rest of the year. 
Our travel website suffered in line 
with the rest of the market and 
consequently was managed for 
margin. Our Home Services vertical 
performed satisfactorily given the 
greater stability in gas and 
electricity prices in 2009. We 
believe there is good potential to 
switch customers from these to our 
other verticals.
Following a review of the Group’s 
cash requirements in July 2009, the 
Company paid an interim dividend 
of 1.3p per ordinary share on 16 
October 2009, consistent with the 
interim dividend in 2008. In addition, 
the Company paid a special 
dividend on the same date of 4.93p 
per ordinary share reflecting the 
Board’s confidence in the ability of 
the business to generate cash on an 
ongoing basis.
During the year, the business 
continued to generate cash, and we 
ended the year with cash balances of 
£53.8m. With the business stabilised, 
and with the tax changes announced 
in the April 2009 Budget, we have 
decided to recommend another 
special dividend of £25m or 4.91p 
per ordinary share. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 13.34p 
per ordinary share including the total 
of the special dividends of 9.84p per 
ordinary share. If approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, this will be 
paid on 1 April 2010 to all 
shareholders on the register as at  
5 March 2010. 
We are a very cash generative 
business, but will run with a 
conservative debt free balance 
sheet to enable us to take advantage 
of the opportunities as our business 
and the economy recovers.
The new year has begun 
satisfactorily and we are quietly 
confident that the worst is behind 
us. It has been a difficult time for the 
Company. Our employees have 
responded magnificently to the 
challenges they have faced and, on 
behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank them for their commitment 
during the year. 
The Annual General Meeting will be 
held at 10.30am on Wednesday 31 
March 2010 at De Vere Carden Park 
Hotel, near Chester, Cheshire, CH3 
9DQ and I look forward to seeing 
you there.

Chairman

Chief Executive’s Report
Peter Plumb
Chief Executive Officer
This is a great business, with hugely 
dedicated and skilled employees who 
have a passionate focus on helping our 
customers make the most of their money
Q: What have been 
your main priorities and 
achievements in your first 
year as Chief Executive 
Officer? 
A: I was appointed Chief Executive 
Officer during what can only be 
described as an unprecedented 
global financial crisis and a UK 
recession. This, of course, helped 
to shape the main priorities for 
my first year. Those priorities were 
reshaping the business for lower 
volumes, ensuring critical investment 
remained prioritised to capitalise on 
a returning market, as and when it 
happens, and most of all, focusing 
our organisation even further on 
helping our customers make the 
most of their money.
The first six months of the year were 
spent stabilising and reshaping the 
business. We reduced our team by 
approximately 80 people, a burden 
shared across the business and at all 
levels, delivering an annualised 
saving in excess of £2m. 
Our marketing team was challenged 
to deliver ‘more for less’. Our online 
marketing spend including both 
search engine marketing and 
partners was significantly reduced. 
This was delivered through the use 
of sophisticated bid management 
tools and additional investment in 
our marketing team, to harness 
further the benefits our brand, 
expert content and breadth of 
services give us in natural online 
search. We also reduced our offline 
marketing spend. Television 
advertising spend achieved much 
greater ‘cut through’ with our 
‘Savings on household bills’ 
campaign fronted by Peter Jones. 
This campaign played a strong role, 
when combined with our extensive 
PR coverage, in building our brand 
trust with customers. 
In the second half of the year we 
increased our investment in our core 
systems as we continued our focus 
on product development and 
innovation. This resulted in a 
significantly improved motor 
insurance channel being launched in 
beta during the year which went 
fully live in February 2010. In 
January 2010 we also launched an 
improved credit card channel and 
have a programme of delivery in 
place for other major channels in 
2010. Together, this will significantly 
improve our customer proposition 
and customer experience in these 
important channels.
My final and most important priority 
has been to place our customers 
even further into the heart of our 
business. We now run regular focus 
groups, testing out new ideas with 
real customers. We have continued 
to invest in better analytics tools this 
year, giving our design teams 
granular data on how customers use 
and interact with our services.

The UK’s

Q: How have you worked 
with Simon Nixon? 
A: First and foremost, as a major 
shareholder in the Company and as 
an Executive Director, Simon has 
been very supportive of our new 
strategy and vision. On a personal 
level, Simon and I compliment 
each other and work well together. 
Simon’s industry expertise has 
helped me settle into my role 
quickly. 
In his new role, Simon has focused 
on product development and 
innovation across the Group, areas 
he is passionate about and in which 
he clearly has a great deal of 
knowledge and experience. 
Q: Clearly the global 
financial crisis has 
negatively affected 
most businesses. What 
has been the impact on 
Moneysupermarket.com? 
A: As a business working in the 
financial services sector, we have 
clearly and directly been affected by 
the tightening of credit markets and 
downturn in the economy during 2009 
which has made trading challenging.
In 2009, Group revenue declined by 
23% to £136.9m and adjusted 
EBITDA declined by 26% to £36.0m 
from £48.4m in 2008. The Group 
maintained its overall market share 
although it surrendered some share 
in Travel which was managed for 
margin in a declining market.
The Group was able to successfully 
flex its cost base to protect its 
operating margins. The Group has 
remained strongly cash generative and 
ended 2009 with no debt and a cash 
balance of £53.8m after the payment 
of the special dividend and the interim 
dividend on 16 October 2009.
In the first quarter of the year we 
closed the non-core intermediary 
business primarily due to the 
difficulties faced in the mortgage 
market last year.
The Insurance vertical remains the 
Group’s largest vertical, accounting 
for 55% of Group revenue up from 
44% in 2008. Home and travel 
insurance performed particularly 
well, however, the motor insurance 
market remained very competitive in 
2009 with increased advertising 
spend by some competitors. We 
maintained a clear strategy of only 
acquiring visitors at a level which 
made financial sense. This resulted in 
a decline in revenue for the year. 
However in the second half of the 
year following the launch of the 
Peter Jones campaign and 
improvements to the website, the 
Insurance vertical grew over the 
same period last year.
In a year of financial uncertainty for 
our customers, visitors to our Money 
vertical remained consistent. However, 
with a shortage of credit products, 
particularly in the first half of the year, 
revenue decreased in the year by 44% 
to £38.1m. The secured lending market 
in particular suffered from a radical 
reduction in the supply of credit and a 
tightening of underwriting criteria. 
The Travel vertical also suffered in 
2009 with revenue declining by 15% 
to £16.3m following market trends 
and the business was actively 
managed for margin.  12 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s Report continued
Business Review
Travelsupermarket.com was 
redesigned during 2009, improving 
the customer proposition and 
customer usability of the site. During 
the year, we launched a cruise 
channel, increasing the breadth of 
offering in the Travel vertical. 
Revenue in the Home Services 
vertical declined substantially in 
2009 compared to 2008 chiefly due 
to a year of more stable gas and 
electricity prices compared to 2008. 
During the fourth quarter, the Group 
re-launched its vouchers channel 
enabling customers to obtain 
discounts on a much wider range of 
different products and services.
As a business that concentrates on 
helping every household to make 
the most of their money, our 
customer proposition is more 
important now than ever.
Q: What are your plans for 
2010 and beyond? 
A: The actions we took in 2009 will 
provide a strong platform for 2010 
and I am confident that we will see 
the results of that work during the 
year and into 2011. 
We have set out on pages 4 to 7 the 
key elements of our strategy for 
2010 as we continue to focus on 
how we can help households make 
the most of their money. 
We will continue our development 
momentum across the business, 
ensuring that in 2010 our 
customers continue to receive 
market leading services whilst 
building a better service 
infrastructure for our providers.
We will continue to work closely 
with our providers to ensure that we 
offer our customers the best 
possible range of products and 
deals. Our dedicated rates team 
constantly scour the market for 
changing rates and deals, striving to 
offer customers the capability to 
compare the whole of market and 
best buy products.
Our redeveloped channels provide a 
richer data set on our customers. 
This will ensure we are better placed 
to talk to our customers about 
relevant services and deals. Our 
customer communication 
programme will become an ever 
more important part of our business 
as we build long term relationships 
with our customers.
Most importantly, we will complete 
the rollout of our new advertising 
campaign ‘a great deal easier’ 
fronted by Omid Djalili. Our brand 
adverts were aired in early January, 
shortly followed by our new motor 
insurance adverts in mid January. 
The adverts have been well received 
by our customers.
Q: This seems to be 
different to your strategy 
for 2009. What has 
changed? 
A: Although the recession meant 
that my priority was to stabilise 
the business in a market with 
significantly lower credit availability 
and travel product demand, we 
continued investment in teams and 
technology for the long term good 
of our business. Investments were 
made against the clear strategic 
template I referred to above.
The major changes in strategy  
have been ones of marketing 
priorities and our approach to 
international operations. 
With our new offline marketing 
campaign, we will be looking for 
greater ‘cut through’ than we have 
achieved with previous campaigns. It 
is a very competitive market  
and what you say is potentially  
more important than how much  
you spend.
On international, we have stronger 
ambitions than ever to take our 
model to new markets. However, our 
green field market entry test in 
Germany has taught us a great deal 
this year. Germany, a country whose 
personal finance market did not 
escape the global crisis, has proven to 
be very different to operate in. Our 
innovative personalised loans website 
went live during 2009 and is the most 
sophisticated service in Germany. 
However, we have learnt a great deal 
about the need in Germany to 
support online service offline. In the 
UK, customers are happy to self serve 
but in Germany a degree of offline 
support is required through a 
dedicated telephone support team. 
The economics of such a service is 
much less attractive and indeed 
expensive as an organic entry 
strategy. We are therefore winding 
down this test whilst we explore other 
options for international growth.
Q: What do you see as 
Moneysupermarket.com’s 
key strengths? 
A: We are a business with many 
important strengths. Principally, I see 
them as team, scale and brand.
This year has seen a major 
transformation within our business 
in how we build and enhance our 
website based on customer 
behaviour. We start 2010 with a 
much more agile business, both 
curious and innovative. Although 
2010 will see a continued website 
development plan, our core motor, 
home and credit card channels will 
be able to respond to market  Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
13 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
changes in almost real time, 
something we certainly were  
unable to do last year. Our new 
executive team brings a strong mix 
of skills to the business ranging from 
blue chip marketing to hands on 
provider experience.
We are the UK’s number one price 
comparison website and our scale 
brings distinct benefits to our 
business in two main ways. Firstly, 
our breadth of services means that 
customers have many reasons to 
visit us throughout the year to make 
the most of their money. This not 
only gives us the financial benefits of 
a diversified product range, but also 
gives us a real opportunity to cross 
sell products from our different 
verticals. Secondly, we gain benefits 
from our marketing efficiency, both 
online and offline, an area that we 
made good progress on in 2009.
Our business is now 10 years old. 
Moneysupermarket.com is a very 
valuable brand which is highly 
recognised and trusted by our 
customers. 
Q: What do you think will 
be the challenges for the 
year ahead?
A: 2010 will be another challenging 
year for the business as we seek 
to execute our strategy outlined 
above and focus on delivering 
our ambitious plans for 2010 and 
beyond. 
There will remain challenges in  
the wider economy this year, 
particularly in the credit markets, 
and it will be critical that we remain 
flexible and responsive to changing 
market conditions and evolving 
customer needs. 
Our breadth of services will however 
continue to be a source of great 
strength. We will continue to focus 
on our customers and on making 
sure that we offer them the best 
range of products, ensuring that 
whatever their financial needs, we as 
a business can help them make the 
most of their money in 2010.
Q: When do you expect 
things to improve? 
A: Clearly 2009 has been a difficult 
year for the Group. However, we 
have maintained market share in key 
verticals and I believe the business 
has now stabilised with the worst 
behind us.
I remain confident that the work we 
are doing across the business and 
the enhancements we have made 
and will continue to make in 2010 
will ensure the Group is well 
positioned to capitalise on its 
strengths when growth returns to 
our markets.
I am very much looking forward to 
2010 and beyond. This is a great 
business, with hugely dedicated and 
skilled employees who have a 
passionate focus on helping our 
customers make the most of their 
money. That’s a good place to start 
2010 from.

Financial and Business Review
The Group has presented below an extract of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years 
ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 along with a reconciliation to adjusted EBITDA. Revenue in 2009 
was £136.9m (2008: £178.8m) which generated a net profit after tax of £1.9m (2008: loss of £59.1m). The Directors 
believe that the presentation of an adjusted EBITDA measure will allow users of the financial information to gain a 
better understanding of the underlying performance of the business.

Basis of preparation
The results show the trading results for the years  
ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.  
The following adjustments have been made to arrive  
at adjusted EBITDA:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial • 
Group Limited by the Company gave rise to £207.2m 
of intangible assets. These are to be written off over  
a period of 3-10 years with a charge of £25.2m per 
annum to be recorded in each of the first three years 
post acquisition. Charges relating to the impairment 
of goodwill in 2008 have also been added back in 
calculating adjusted EBITDA.
Certain share option charges relating to Directors, • 
senior management and other employees of the 
Group arising from the time the Group listed or when 
it was privately owned have been added back to 
calculate adjusted EBITDA. A charge for awards 
made under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan is 
included within the adjusted results for 2008 
and 2009.
Reference is made in the Overview section below to 
adjusted distribution and administration expenses, and 
adjusted staff costs. These measures represent the 
costs charged to the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, less the intangible amortisation, goodwill 
impairment, and pre-listing share option charges.
Overview
We are pleased to present a solid set of financial results 
for the year ended 31 December 2009. Revenue for the 
year was £136.9m (2008: £178.8m) generating adjusted 
EBITDA of £36.0m (2008: £48.4m). 
During the year the Group focused on reconfiguring its 
business for the lower levels of supply for certain 
products in the Money vertical and making its online 
and offline marketing investment work harder, whilst 
maintaining its market leading position. Good progress 
has been made in both these areas, having reduced the 
cost base substantially, expanded gross margin and 
adjusted EBITDA margin against the second half of 2008.
The management team was considerably strengthened 
during the year with a number of key appointments 
which have provided the Group with a solid skills and 
talent base to provide a foundation for future growth. 
The new team has focused its efforts on technology and 
marketing, to enhance our products and services and 
improve the user experience, whilst maintaining and 
strengthening our brand. In the second half of the year, 
the Group invested £1.3m in technology using flexible 
third party resource to improve its core architecture and 
usability in a number of key channels. The Group 
launched a new vouchers channel in November 2009 
and released new credit card and motor insurance 
channels in January and February 2010 respectively. 
Other major refreshes of some of the Group’s key 
channels will be released throughout the remainder of 
the year. New advertising creative featuring Peter Jones 
was released in June emphasising our key message that 
we help households looking to save time and money on 
their household bills. The campaign was used 
successfully in the second half of the year whilst we 
developed entirely new creative for 2010 which built 
upon this theme and which aired for the first time in 
January 2010 featuring comedian Omid Djalili. Feedback 
from customers to date has been positive.
Financial performance
Revenue declined by 23% to £136.9m (2008: £178.8m) 
and adjusted EBITDA fell by 26% to £36.0m  
(2008: £48.4m). Revenue and profitability in 2009  
were impacted by the credit crunch which reduced  
both the supply of credit and consumer discretionary 
spend in the wider UK economy relative to the same 
period last year. Revenue in 2008 included £13.2m 
generated from secured lender First Plus which closed 
to new business in August 2008. The Group maintained 
its market share measured by Experian Hitwise against 
its key competitor set.
Group gross margins at 68.9% improved by more than 
three percentage points over last year. The Group 
improved its proportion of direct to site revenue in the 
year. An accrual release of £0.8m within cost of sales 
was also made in the first half of the year following the 
resolution of a dispute with a portal partner during the 
period. The Group closed its lower margin intermediary 
operation to new business early in the first quarter of 
2009. Revenue recorded in 2009 represents trail 
commission for mortgage applications in process prior 
to closure and revenue from revenue sharing 
agreements with third parties who have managed the 
winding down of the business. 
The adjusted administrative and distribution cost base 
decreased by 13% from £71.8m to £62.6m in the year. 
Distribution expenses decreased by £3.2m over the 
prior year driven by reduced television advertising costs. 
The Group maintained a level of presence on broadcast 
media broadly similar to the prior year through a 
deflation in media costs and changes made in the length 
of slots acquired. 
Adjusted administrative costs decreased by £6.0m 
(12%) over the prior year from £50.2m in 2008 to 
£44.2m in 2009. Adjusted staff costs (including 
contract resource) decreased by £3.5m to £26.9m.  16 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Financial and Business Review continued
Business Review
Headcount decreased from 555 to 442 from December 2008 to December 2009 as the Group sought to align its 
cost base to the prevailing market conditions in the Money vertical. 
In April 2009 the Group made headcount reductions of approximately 80 people across all areas of the business 
although the largest impacted area was the Group’s mortgage brokerage business. The Group incurred costs of 
£0.5m in relation to these and other reorganisation activities in the first half of 2009 yielding savings of 
approximately £2.3m per annum in permanent staff costs. 
The Group invested approximately £1.3m in the second half of 2009 in flexible resource to improve its core 
technology and product in 2009 and into 2010. The Group made a number of significant releases to its product set 
in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 as referred to above. The Group expects a slightly higher 
run rate level of investment over the course of 2010 to be made in technology. 
Other costs including irrecoverable VAT decreased by £3.3m over last year as expenditure on, inter alia, television 
advertising and search engine marketing was reduced, together with the reduction in the VAT rate to 15% which 
was effective from 1 December 2008. The Group incurred a loss of £2.1m in Germany in 2009 (2008: loss of £1.2m). 
Following a review of its German business, the Group has now taken the decision to wind down this test operation.
Adjusted EBITDA margins declined from 27.1% to 26.3% against the same period last year but improved significantly 
from 22.9% in the second half of 2008.

Internet business 
The Directors use key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to assess the performance of the internet business against the 
Group’s strategy. These are reviewed on a regular basis. The principal KPIs for the internet business are as follows: 
Visitors 
The Group measures the number of visitors to its websites as the number of unique visitors per day per channel, 
measured on a cumulative basis using cookie-based tracking methodologies. 
Transactions 
The Group measures transactions at the point in time that the customer leaves the Group’s websites having clicked 
through to a third party website, or in some cases having completed an application form hosted on the Group’s 
websites. 
Revenue per visitor (‘RPV’) 
The Group measures the total revenue (including click and other internet revenue) divided by the number of visitors 
defined above. 
Revenue per transaction (‘RPT’) 
The Group measures the click based revenue divided by the total number of transactions defined above. 
The relative performance of each of the internet verticals is discussed below:  Money

The Money vertical offers customers the ability to search 
for, and compare, products for, amongst other things, 
credit cards, current accounts, mortgages, loans, debt 
solutions, savings accounts and business finance. It also 
includes elements of the Group’s lead business (PAA) 
and advisory business (MCAT) together with advertising 
revenue that derives from financial products. 
The KPIs for the Money vertical are shown below:

Total revenue in the Money vertical decreased by 44% 
from £68.3m to £38.1m and click based revenue by 43% 
from £57.4m to £32.8m. Visitors were broadly flat. 
Conditions in the credit market in 2009 were 
significantly worse than those in the majority of 2008. 
Credit markets materially worsened over the course of 
2008 and particularly the second half of the year as the 
credit crunch deepened impacting a number of key 
channels in the Money vertical. The secured lending 
market in particular suffered from a reduction in the 
supply of credit and a tightening of underwriting criteria. 
This was one of the Group’s largest revenue generating 
channels. First Plus, a subsidiary of Barclays, which was 
the Group’s largest single provider by revenue closed to 
new business in August 2008. First Plus generated 
revenue of £13.2m in 2008 which the Group was unable 
to replace in 2009. 
The Group noted that towards the end of the first half of 
2009 external measures of credit availability began to 
show signs of having stabilised. Trading in credit 
products defined as total revenue from secured and 
unsecured loans, credit cards, debt solutions and 
mortgages excluding impression based advertising 
revenue was slightly in excess of 50% down against last 
year. However revenue from credit products improved in 
the second half of the year to £13.9m from £13.3m in the 
first half of the year despite the fact the second half of 
the year is traditionally weaker than the first half given 
the softness of fourth quarter revenue. Throughout the 
year trading in the Money vertical improved on a 
quarterly basis relative to the same quarter last year and 
in the fourth quarter was approximately 10% down over 
the same period last year.
Revenue from other banking products, particularly 
savings and current accounts, has held up relatively well 
although savings revenue softened into the fourth quarter 
against a tough 2008 comparator. Savings revenue 
increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 
following the financial uncertainty created after the 
collapse of a number of financial institutions. The change 
in sales mix away from credit based products, which 
generate higher transaction revenue, towards general 
banking products markedly reduced RPT and RPV in 
2009 against last year. RPV has however been slowly 
improving for the Money vertical throughout 2009 as the 
wider markets have shown signs of stabilising.
 
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of 
leads through PAA, commission based sales through 
MCAT for mortgages and loans, and advertising 
revenue, declined approximately £5.6m or 51% over the 
year. Commissions that are earned from loan and 
mortgage brokerage in particular have reduced 
significantly relative to last year as a result of the difficult 
market conditions and accordingly the Group materially 
reduced headcount in this area in the first half of 2009.  0 5177

Business Review
The Insurance vertical offers customers the ability to 
search for, and compare, insurance products for, 
amongst other things, breakdown, dental, home, life, 
medical, mortgage payment protection, motor, payment 
protection, pet and travel insurance. It also includes 
elements of the Group’s lead business (PAA) and 
advisory business (MCAT) together with advertising 
revenue that derives from insurance products. 
The KPIs for the Insurance vertical are shown below:

Revenue in the Insurance vertical declined by 3% from 
£77.7m to £75.7m. Transaction revenue increased by 3% 
from £66.6m to £68.6m.
Revenue in the second half of the year increased by 2% 
over the same period last year having been 6% lower in 
the first half of 2009 relative to 2008. The improvement 
in trading in the second half was driven by increased 
visitor volumes helped in part by the television 
advertising campaign featuring Peter Jones launched in 
June 2009.
The motor insurance comparison market remains the 
most competitive market in which the Group currently 
operates. Revenue was approximately 5% lower in the 
motor insurance channel for the year as a whole 
although revenue in the second half grew marginally 
over the same period last year reflecting the increased 
visitor volumes referred to above. The Group 
concentrated on the profitable online and offline 
acquisition and retention of customers during the year 
rather than focusing exclusively on market share. 
Revenues in the other insurance channels, including 
home insurance, travel insurance and life insurance, 
were all ahead of last year.
Other revenue declined by approximately £4.0m. Other 
revenue fell in the year driven by lower advertising 
revenue from a deliberate reduction in the advertising 
real estate made available to advertisers coupled with 
the cessation of revenue generated from telephone 
based leads which generated £2.5m in 2008. Both 
measures were taken to improve the long term 
customer experience of using the website in line with 
our brand building strategy.

Revenue in the Travel vertical fell by 15% from £19.1m to 
£16.3m. Transaction revenue declined by 12% from 
£16.8m to £14.8m. Visitor levels declined by 12% 
compared to the same period last year whilst RPV 
remained broadly flat.
Revenue in the Travel vertical was impacted as 
customers reduced discretionary expenditure in 
response to the increasing economic uncertainty. 
Package holiday revenue did, however, grow fractionally 
over the same period last year. The Group’s travel 
website, travelsupermarket.com, was redesigned during 
the second quarter of 2009 which improved the 
usability of the website. A cruises channel was added in 
June 2009. 
Non click revenue representing impression based 
advertising fell by 32% due to a reduced number of 
visitors compared to the same period last year together 
with weaker demand from providers for advertising  
real estate.
The Home Services vertical offers customers the ability 
to search for, and compare, products for broadband, 
mobile telephones, vouchers, shopping and utilities.

RPT  £1.03 £2.52 
Revenue in the Home Services vertical decreased by 
25% from £7.4m to £5.5m in the year. Revenue from 
utilities, which represents the largest channel in which 
the Group operates in the Home Services vertical, 
declined by approximately one third against a strong 
comparator period, with the first half of 2008 benefiting 
significantly from the rising price of gas and electricity. 
Utilities prices have been more stable in 2009 and there 
has therefore been less demand for switching services, 
although trading improved markedly in the second half 
of 2009 relative to the first half of the year. 
During the fourth quarter of 2008 the Group launched 
its own shopping comparison service. A new vouchers 
channel was launched in November 2009 enabling 
customers to obtain discounts across a wide range of 
products and services. This has enabled the Group to 
grow visitors to this vertical by 62% over last year. 
Transaction values are typically very low relative to the 
other channels in the vertical and the increase in visitors 
and transaction volumes has reduced the RPV for the 
Home Services vertical measured against the same 
period last year. 20 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Financial and Business Review continued
Business Review
Germany 
Following a review of its business in Germany, the  
Group has decided to wind down its test operation. The 
volume of business has been lower than originally 
anticipated by the Group. Customers require more offline 
support than those in the UK which would require the 
Group to have significant call centre support. The Group 
generated losses of £2.1m in Germany in 2009 (2008: 
losses of £1.2m). The cost of winding down the operation in 
Germany is expected to be approximately £0.8m in 2010.
Cash balance and dividend
As at 31 December 2009 the Group had a cash balance 
of £53.8m. The Group continued to strengthen its cash 
position throughout the year after payment of 
dividends. Having reviewed the cash required by the 
business, the Board is recommending a final dividend, 
subject to shareholder approval, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2009 of 7.11p per ordinary share, 
comprising a dividend of 2.2p per ordinary share 
equivalent to the final dividend paid in respect of the 
2008 financial year and a special dividend of 
approximately £25.0m equivalent to 4.91p per ordinary 
share, reflecting the Board’s confidence in the ability of 
the business to generate cash on an ongoing basis. 
Together with the interim dividend of 1.3p per ordinary 
share and special dividend of 4.93p per ordinary share 
paid on 16 October 2009, this gives a total dividend for 
the year of 13.34p per ordinary share. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the total cost of the dividends for 
the financial year will be £67.8m.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 3 March 
2010, with a record date of 5 March 2010 and a payment 
date of 1 April 2010. Shareholders have the opportunity 
to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase 
existing shares in the Company through a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan.
Tax 
The Group tax charge of £1.3m in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income represents an 
effective tax rate of 40% (2008: -16%). This is higher 
than the prevailing rate of 28%. The current year has 
been impacted by losses from its German operation of 
£2.1m for which a deferred tax asset cannot be 
recognised. During 2008, the Group had disallowable 
expenses in the year of £76.0m (including £70.0m of 
goodwill impairment) and a further £1.2m of losses from 
its German operation for which a deferred tax asset was 
not recognised. In addition in 2008 the Group also 
recognised a deferred tax charge of £2.7m representing 
a revaluation of a deferred tax asset held in relation to 
share options. In future, the Group expects the 
underlying effective rate of tax to be close to the 
standard UK corporation tax rate of 28%.
Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the  
year to 31 December 2009 was 0.4p (2008: loss per 
share of 11.8p). Adjusted basic earnings per ordinary 
share decreased from 6.9p to 4.6p per share. The 
adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on profit 
before tax after adding back intangible amortisation and 
share-based payment charges arising from pre-listing 
share options. A tax rate of 28% (2008: 28.5%) has been 
applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax. 
Key contractual arrangements
Moneysupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the 
Company, is party to contracts and other arrangements 
which the Directors judge are essential to the Group’s 
business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent 
upon its ability to attract customers to its website either 
directly or through paid search or portal partners, and 
revenue generated from commercial arrangements with 
its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract 
customers to its website directly. The Group incurred 
costs of £15.6m (2008: £19.0m) relating to television 
advertising in 2009. The Group has contracts with a 
number of media agencies to acquire advertising 
inventory from commercial television companies. The 
Group typically has a commitment of between 6 and 10 
weeks expenditure at any one time. Television costs 
represent 85% (2008: 88%) of distribution costs. 
The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via 
paid search. The Group spent £30.8m (2008: £38.3m) 
on paid search in 2009. Although there are a number of 
search engines that operate in the UK, Google is the 
dominant search engine and accounts for the majority 
of the Group’s spend in this area. The Group has had 
contracts with a number of media agencies in the year 
to manage search engine marketing. The Group has no 
forward commitment to search engines and manages its 
spend on a real time basis.
The Group does not consider any of the contracts it has 
with portal partners to be material.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers 
which are based either on a cost per click basis or a cost 
per action basis or a hybrid of the two. It also has a 
number of commercial arrangements based on the 
number of page impressions served in the case of  Business Overview Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General

Business Review
banner advertising. The Group does not consider it has 
any material contracts with providers in any one channel.
The Group does however frequently deal with providers 
across a range of different channels managed under 
different contracts, often to different parts of the same 
organisation, and occasionally through third party 
media agencies. At this consolidated channel level, the 
largest individual provider represented approximately 
4% (2008: 4%) of Group internet revenue.
During 2009 there was consolidation in the financial 
marketplace and the number of independent 
organisations reduced. The brands under these group 
umbrellas are usually run independently and the 
marketing budget managed separately. The largest 
group represented approximately 4% (2008: 9%) of 
Group internet revenue. 
Notes:
The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors 1. 
from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release 
made in respect of the anti-virus software AVG. In assessing whether 
a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or URL displayed on an 
email or webpage to the destination website. This meant that many 
web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from 
users of the AVG software who themselves did not technically visit 
the website. The 2008 visitor count has been adjusted for the 
estimated impact of this. AVG released a further update to its 
anti-virus software early in July 2008 which resolved the issue. 22 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Financial risks
  
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Si gn ifi c a n t	
worsening in credit 
markets
Financial institutions may reduce the 
quantum of lending and tighten their 
acceptance criteria for customers seeking 
to obtain credit. This may reduce Group 
revenue. Providers may increase their 
focus on customer retention rather than 
acquisition. This may reduce commissions 
available to price comparison websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers 
and to maximise the opportunities for providers to 
acquire customers in a cost effective manner. 
Si gn ifi c a n t	
consolidation of 
providers
Consolidation of providers may continue 
in response to the poor credit markets. 
This may reduce competition for business 
with customers having less choice and 
may reduce commissions available to price 
comparison websites. 
The Group will continue to improve its search 
functionality and deliver new relevant customers to 
providers at demonstrably lower acquisition costs 
compared with other media. The diversification of 
the Group both in the number of verticals that it 
operates in and the range of products and services 
it provides in each vertical should lessen the impact 
of any consolidation of providers.
Reduction of 
providers
Providers may decide to withdraw their 
products from price comparison websites or 
reduce their customer acquisition activity via 
price comparison websites. This may reduce 
Group revenue and the customer proposition 
of price comparison websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers 
and to maximise the opportunities for providers to 
acquire customers in a cost effective manner. 
Security of cash 
balances
The Group holds significant cash balances. 
A failure of a major financial institution with 
whom the Group places significant deposits 
may result in a material loss to the Group.
The Group has continued to diversify its cash 
holdings across a number of financial institutions in 
accordance with it’s approved treasury policy. At 
the end of 2009, the Group held cash balances with 
five financial institutions with a maximum balance 
of £18.0m with any one institution.
Revenue assurance Significant reduction of or a failure to 
recognise revenue from contracted providers 
where the Group is remunerated on a cost 
per action basis.
The Group will continue to perform independent 
reviews using third parties to gain assurance that 
the Group is being correctly remunerated for the 
sales it introduces to contracted providers.
Investment in new 
areas
Significant capital invested in new products 
and services or new geographies fails to 
make a return.
Investments in new areas typically leverage existing 
expertise and experience built up over many 
years. Capital requirements are relatively low and 
investment is managed in stages such that it is not 
finally committed until there is good visibility of a 
return.
Financial services 
and other markets 
regulation and 
ta x a t i o n
The business model in financial services or 
other lines of business may be compromised 
by changes to existing regulation or the 
introduction of new regulation, or changes  
to the tax legislation, particularly value added 
tax.
The Group has a team of regulatory specialists who 
work with the business to ensure that it remains 
compliant with existing regulation and informed of 
impending regulation. The Group has embraced 
regulation to date and shares the vision of the 
regulators generally to make the market more 
transparent to the end customer.
The Group continues to monitor ongoing European 
Union developments in respect of the review of the 
provision of financial intermediary services with 
regard to value added tax and any relevant case 
law in this area as it emerges.
The tables below summarise the material financial and operational risks to the Group 
and how the Group seeks to mitigate them in the day-to-day running of the business.

Business Review
Operational risks
  
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Competitive 
environment
Loss of market share and erosion of margins 
from increased competition.
The Group continues to focus on building market 
leading products to improve its proposition to 
customers. This includes investment in customer 
retention tools and technology including CRM 
initiatives which deliver additional features and 
functionality to customers.
Brand perception Reduction in customer loyalty with existing 
customers and an inability to attract new 
customers if the business fails to maintain its 
position as a leading price comparison 
website or if its reputation is negatively 
impacted by any event.
Continued investment in television advertising 
reinforced through press activity will maintain the 
Group in customers’ minds. Rigorous checking of 
the website through audit and review will maintain 
the accuracy of the information displayed. Rigorous 
use of internal controls and testing of the Group’s 
systems will ensure the integrity and robustness of 
the Group’s systems. Additional investment in 
initiatives increases transparency to the customer 
helping to protect brand values. 
Capacity and 
functionality of IT 
and systems 
infrastructure
Failure to provide adequate service levels to 
customers or maintain revenue generating 
services.
The Group maintains two separate data centres 
with n + 1 redundancy in relation to its core 
infrastructure to ensure that service is maintained 
in the event of a disaster at the primary data centre. 
Developed software is rigorously tested and the 
Group operates a robust release process which 
mitigates the likelihood of software being released 
into a live environment without being fully tested.
Loss of key 
management
Loss of key management resulting in a lack of 
necessary expertise or continuity to execute 
strategy.
Existing key management and new hires are tied in 
through attractive equity incentive packages and 
rewarding career structures. In addition, succession 
plans have been developed for key members of the 
management team which are regularly reviewed.
Reliance on search 
engine paid search 
and natural listings
Reduction in gross margin through reduction 
in revenue derived from search engine 
optimisation or failure to manage search 
engine marketing campaigns appropriately.
The Group will continue to invest in sustainable 
search engine optimisation activities which adhere 
to search engine guidelines. The Group will 
continue to use a software solution to assist in 
managing the profitability of search engine 
marketing campaigns.
Economic 
environment
Reduction in visitors and revenue from a 
recession as customers seek to reduce levels 
of discretionary expenditure.
The Group continues to focus on building a wide 
range of market leading products to meet 
customers needs. Customers seeking to reduce 
levels of discretionary expenditure will also be 
looking to obtain ‘best’ value from compulsory 
products and services. The diversification of the 
Group both in the number of verticals that it 
operates in and the range of products and services 
it provides in each vertical should lessen the impact 
of a recession upon the Group although it cannot 
entirely mitigate against it. 24 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Corporate Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility Report 
The Group operates with an underlying awareness of its 
wider responsibilities to society.
Communities and charities
The Group’s .Community initiative was launched in 2008 
and has continued to develop throughout 2009. The 
initiative is focused on providing support to charities 
located within a few miles of the Group’s offices in 
Ewloe and so support is targeted primarily in Flintshire 
and Cheshire.
A volunteer group of employees meet each month to 
review requests for donations from charities and to 
allocate funds according to agreed donation guidelines. 
Employees are also active in researching and seeking 
out local good causes that the Group can help support. 
The initiative has been effective at harnessing the 
energy and enthusiasm of the Group’s employees to 
benefit the communities in which it operates.
In 2009 the Group made £2,000 per month available 
for the .Community initiative. This funding has been 
channelled via the Charities Aid Foundation, enabling 
the Group to make gross donations to registered 
charities.
Over the course of the year the Group has supported 
the following 17 charities:
Hawarden Air Cadets
The Money Advice Trust
Blacon Children’s Centre
Jolly Tots
Daffodils
Highway Playdays
Save The Family
Blacon Community Trust
Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology
Age Concern (Cheshire)
North West Air Ambulance
Bryn Gwallia
Macmillan Cancer Support (Cheshire)
Chester Youth Club
Domestic Abuse Safety Unit Deeside
C-Saw
Deafness Support Network
The Group also works with local organisations to 
promote financial inclusion and awareness. The Group is 
involved in the North Wales Financial Capability Forum 
and over the course of the year has worked with 
Flintshire Trading Standards to hold surgeries for 
consumers on loans and debt, and with Deeside Citizens 
Advice to help people in fuel poverty.
In addition to the .Community initiative, the Group and 
its employees continues to select and support a charity 
on an annual basis. The 2008/9 Charity of the Year was 
the Hospice of the Good Shepherd. The Hospice, which 
is on the outskirts of Chester, exists to provide highly 
specialised palliative care for people living with 
advanced diseases from the communities of Chester, 
Deeside, Ellesmere Port and rural Cheshire. Over the 
course of the year the Group’s employees raised  
£6,003 for the Hospice through a wide variety of 
fundraising events. The Group made a donation of 
£6,020 bringing the total donated to the Hospice  
during the year to £12,023.
Employees have selected Hope House Childrens’ 
Hospice as its 2009/10 Charity of the Year. The charity 
runs two centres, in Shropshire and Conwy, serving the 
North West of England and North Wales. The Hospice 
provides free care to terminally ill children and their 
families. Over the course of the year the Group’s 
employees raised £522 for Hope House with the Group 
donating £3,624, bringing the total donated to Hope 
House during the year to £4,146.
Environment
The Group strives to reduce energy and raw material 
usage to support environmental and financial 
performance.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key 
performance indicators due to its relative size and the 
limited impact it has on the environment. The Group 
does however participate in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement 
and consultation and places considerable emphasis on 
keeping its employees informed of the Group’s activities 
via formal half yearly business performance updates, 
regular update briefings, regular team meetings, the 
Group’s intranet site which enables easy access to the 
latest Group information as well as Group policies, and 
the circulation to employees of relevant information 
including corporate announcements. This also helps to 
achieve a common awareness amongst employees of 
the financial and economic factors affecting the 
performance of the Group. 
The Group has established an employee forum through 
which nominated representatives ensure that 
employees’ views are taken into account regarding 
issues that are likely to affect them. A robust employee 
engagement survey process is also in place to ensure 
that employees are given a voice in the organisation  
and that the Group can take action based on  
employee feedback.
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities 
policy. The Group aims to ensure that no employee is 
discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on the  Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
27 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
grounds of colour, race, ethnic and national origins, 
sexual orientation or gender, marital status, disability, 
religion or belief, being part time or on the grounds of age.
The Group recognises the importance of health and 
safety and the positive benefits to the Group. Therefore 
the Group’s commitment to health and safety makes 
good business sense. The Group has a health and safety 
policy which is communicated to all employees through 
a health and safety handbook, which is regularly 
reviewed and updated.
Supporting students
In order to build links between the Group and local 
schools and colleges, work experience and placements 
are offered to a number of students. In doing so, the 
Group strives to make work placements positive, 
challenging and relevant to participants’ current studies 
and their future job prospects.
Customers
The Group is committed to providing a high quality 
price comparison service to its customers, enabling 
them to compare a wide range of products in the 
money, insurance, travel and home services markets, 
and to find the product most suited to their needs.
To maintain high levels of customer satisfaction, the 
Group is constantly assessing the views of its customers 
and undertaking customer testing of its websites and 
any new developments it makes. The Group provides 
customers with information from a wide variety of 
sources such as editorial content, customer and expert 
reviews, forums and community features to enrich their 
experience and to help them find the product most 
suited to their needs. 28 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

financial resources of the Company, the Company’s 
share price and future funding opportunities. The 
Directors will only purchase such shares after taking into 
account the effects on earnings per share and the 
interests of shareholders generally.
Research and development
Innovation is important to the future success of the 
Group and to the delivery of long term value to 
shareholders. The Group’s research and development 
expenditure is predominantly associated with computer 
and internet software systems. Successfully developed 
software is used to develop new products and to 
improve and extend the functionality and scope of the 
Group’s internet operations.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company, and the 
Group as a whole, have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Financial Statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.

The Company has granted indemnities to each of its 
Directors and the Company Secretary to the extent 
permitted by law and its Articles of Association. 
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions and

force as at the date of this report in relation to certain 
losses and liabilities which the Directors or Company 
Secretary may incur in the course of acting as Directors, 
Company Secretary or employees of the Company or of 
any associated company.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group and Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Company Financial Statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted  
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and Company 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply • 
them consistently.
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable • 
and prudent.
For the Group Financial Statements, state whether • 
they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU.
For the Company Financial Statements, state whether • 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Company Financial Statements.
Prepare the Financial Statements on the going • 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that its 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Report that complies with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in  
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities pursuant to 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules 4.1.12
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are 
set out on pages 24 and 25 confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance • 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole.
The Business Review includes a fair review of the • 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Internal control
The Corporate Governance Report and Audit 
Committee Report on pages 33 to 39 includes the 
Board’s assessment of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and consideration of the guidance issued by 
the Turnbull Committee of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of England and Wales.
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and uses a number of ways to engage 
with employees on matters that impact them and the 
performance of the Group. These include formal half 
yearly business performance updates by members of 
the executive management team for all employees, 
regular update briefings for all employees, regular team 
meetings, the Group’s intranet site which enables easy 
access to the latest Group information as well as Group 
policies, and the circulation to employees of results 
announcements and other corporate announcements. 
This also helps to achieve a common awareness 
amongst employees of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group.  32 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance
Directors’ Report continued
The Group has established an employee forum through 
which nominated representatives ensure that 
employees’ views are taken into account regarding 
issues that are likely to affect them. A robust employee 
engagement survey process is also in place to ensure 
that employees are given a voice in the organisation  
and that the Group can take action based on  
employee feedback.
All employees are able to participate in the 
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Share Incentive Plan 
which gives employees the opportunity to purchase 
ordinary shares in the Company using money deducted 
from their pre-tax salary on a monthly basis. This helps 
to encourage employee interest in the performance of 
the Group.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equality of 
opportunity to all employees without discrimination  
and applies fair and equitable employment policies 
which seek to promote entry into and progression within 
the Group. Appointments are determined solely by 
application of job criteria, personal ability, behaviour  
and competency.
Disabled persons
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when 
applying for vacancies, with due regard to their skills 
and abilities. Procedures ensure that disabled employees 
are fairly treated in respect of training and career 
development. For those employees becoming disabled 
during the course of their employment, the Group is 
supportive so as to provide an opportunity for them to 
remain with the Group, wherever reasonably practicable. 
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are 
deemed to be effective and in accordance with their 
intended aims.
Borrowings
The Group did not have any borrowings during the 
financial year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £nil).
Financial risk management
It is the Group’s objective to manage its financial risk so 
as to minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial 
markets on the Group’s profitability and cash flow. The 
specific policies for managing each of the Group’s main 
financial risk areas are set out in note 16 to the Group 
Financial Statements on page 68.
Political and charitable donations
During the financial year ended 31 December  
2009, the Group did not make any political donations 
(2008: £nil) and made charitable donations of £33,379 
(2008: £24,482).
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to agree terms and conditions for its 
business transactions with suppliers. Payment is made in 
accordance with these terms provided the supplier 
meets its obligations. The average number of trade 
creditor days outstanding for the Group at 31 December 
2009 was 58.4 (2008: 49.5) days. The Company is a 
holding company and therefore had no trade creditors 
at 31 December 2009 (2008: nil).
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of this report 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and each such Director has taken 
all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to 
make himself aware of any relevant audit information, 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc have indicated their willingness to 
accept reappointment as auditors of the Company. A 
resolution proposing their reappointment is contained in 
the notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
and will be proposed to shareholders at that meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will be held at De Vere Carden Park Hotel, 
near Chester, Cheshire, CH3 9DQ on Wednesday  
31 March 2010 at 10.30am.

23 February 2010 Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
33 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance Report 
The Board of Directors (‘Board’) of  
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’) is 
committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and supports the principles laid down in the revised 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 
June 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(‘Combined Code’). This Corporate Governance Report 
describes how the principles of the Combined Code are 
applied by the Company and reports on the Company’s 
compliance with the Combined Code’s provisions. 
Compliance
The Board considers that the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2009 and to the date of 
this report except as set out below. 
Board of Directors
The Board currently has eight members, comprising the 
Non-Executive Chairman, Gerald Corbett, two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, Michael Wemms 
and Rob Rowley, and five Executive Directors, Simon 
Nixon, Paul Doughty, Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue 
and David Osborne. Michael Wemms has been 
designated as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director. 
The Board normally meets on at least eight occasions in 
each financial year including a two day strategy 
conference. To enable the Non-Executive Directors to 
more freely discuss the performance of the Group’s 
management, the Chairman meets with the Non-
Executive Directors at least once each year without the 
Executive Directors present.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to 
devote sufficient time to their duties as Directors. 
Biographies of the Board are set out on pages 24 and 
25 including details of the significant commitments of 
the Chairman. The Board is satisfied that these 
appointments do not conflict with the Chairman’s ability 
to carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for 
the Group. 
Independence/Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors bring 
wide and varied commercial experience to Board and 
Committee deliberations. The practice of the Company 
is to appoint Non-Executive Directors for specified 
terms of three years, subject to a maximum of up to 12 
months’ notice within that period and also subject to 
re-election and to Companies Act provisions relating to 
the removal of a Director. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, currently holds a 
letter of appointment reflecting this.
The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was 
independent on appointment as Chairman and 
considers Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley to be 
independent, being independent in character and 
judgement and free from relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect,  
their judgement. 
When determining the Chairman’s independence on 
appointment, the Board had regard to his share award 
(‘Share Award’). Under the Share Award, Gerald Corbett 
purchased ordinary shares in the Company on the listing 
of the Company on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing’) at £1.70 per 
ordinary share to the value of £200,000 and provided 
he completes three years service as Chairman of the 
Company from Listing and retains the ordinary shares 
he purchased on Listing during that three year period, 
he will be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for two 
times the number of ordinary shares he purchased on 
Listing. The Board believes that the number of ordinary 
shares subject to the Share Award is not sufficient to 
have an impact on his independence and thus 
concludes that the Chairman was independent on 
appointment. Shareholder approval was obtained prior 
to the entry by the Company into the Share Award.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended 
at the 2008 Annual General Meeting, in line with the 
Companies Act 2006, to allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to 
impose limits or conditions, as appropriate, when giving 
any authorisation. Any decision of the Board to 
authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is 
agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or 
without their votes being counted and in making such a 
decision, the Directors must act in a way they consider 
in good faith will be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company. The Company has established a 
procedure for the appropriate authorisation to be 
sought prior to appointment of any new Director or 
prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular review 
of actual or potential conflicts of interest. During  
the year, this procedure was adhered to and  
operated effectively.
Relationship Agreement
The majority shareholder of the Company is Simon 
Nixon. The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a 
relationship agreement on 11 July 2007 to regulate the 
ongoing relationship between them (‘Relationship 
Agreement’). The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Company is capable  
of carrying on its business independently of Simon 
Nixon, and that transactions and relationships with 
Simon Nixon are at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms. 34 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
The Company and Simon Nixon have agreed in the 
Relationship Agreement that Simon Nixon is entitled to 
appoint (such number including himself as a Director) 
one Non-Executive Director for as long as he holds the 
beneficial interest in at least 15% of the ordinary shares 
of the Company, two Non-Executive Directors for as 
long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 30% of 
the ordinary shares of the Company and three Non-
Executive Directors for as long as he holds the beneficial 
interest in at least 50% of the ordinary shares of the 
Company. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if 
Simon Nixon holds less than 15% of the ordinary shares 
of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement also includes a protocol to 
be observed in relation to any Non-Executive Director 
appointed by Simon Nixon to deal with potential 
conflicts of interest and the provision of confidential 
information.
As at the date of this report, Simon Nixon had not 
appointed any Non-Executive Directors pursuant to his 
rights in the Relationship Agreement.
Division of responsibilities
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are not combined, ensuring a clear division of 
responsibility at the head of the Company. The division 
of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer is clearly established, set out in 
writing and has been approved by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He 
ensures effective communication with shareholders and 
that the Board is aware of the views of major 
shareholders. He facilitates both the contribution of the 
Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations 
between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day to 
day running of the Group, carrying out agreed strategy 
and implementing specific Board decisions.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the Group’s 
performance and meets regularly to review the 
operation and performance of the Group. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision 
making and matters delegated to Committees of the 
Board which are available on the Group’s website at 
www.moneysupermarket.com. These include the 
Group’s strategy; business plan and annual budget; 
acquisitions and disposals and other major investments 
and capital projects.
There is an established procedure for the preparation 
and approval each year by the Board of business plans 
and the annual budget. The Board receives reports on 
performance against the business plan and budget and 
reviews any significant variances each time it meets. 
This information enables business performance to be 
monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where 
necessary and enables informed, sound decisions to be 
made.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal Committees (Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration) to which various 
matters are delegated. The Committees all have formal 
written terms of reference that have been approved by 
the Board and are published on the Group’s website at 
www.moneysupermarket.com. They are also available in 
hard copy form on application to the Company 
Secretary.
Details of the work of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees are given in the reports of 
those Committees on pages 38 to 48.
The Directors who served on each of the Committees 
during the year are set out below:

Nomination Gerald Corbett Michael Wemms Rob Rowley
Remuneration Michael Wemms Gerald Corbett Rob Rowley Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
35 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
The Executive Directors of the Company may attend 
meetings of the Committees at the invitation of the 
Chairman of the respective Committee.
Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new 
Directors appointed by the Board must retire and 
submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at the 
next Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment. The Company’s Articles of Association 
further require that all Directors must retire and submit 
themselves for re-election at least every three years. 
The Company provides Directors’ and officers’ insurance 
cover for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims 
arising in the performance of their duties. With effect 
from 14 December 2009, the Company has also granted 
indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company 
Secretary to the extent permitted by law and its Articles 
of Association. 
Board evaluation
The Board has established a formal process for the 
annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors. Questionnaires 
were prepared which provided the framework for the 
evaluation process. Each Director completed the 
questionnaires commenting on the performance of the 
other Directors, the Board and each Committee and 
submitted the completed questionnaires for collation. 
Utilising the responses to the questionnaires, the 
Chairman has conducted interviews with each Director 
and assessed their individual performance. The 
Chairman has carried out an evaluation of the 
performance of the Board as a whole and of each 
Committee and, led by the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director, the Non-Executive Directors have 
met and assessed the performance of the Chairman 
taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. 
The conclusions of those evaluations have been 
presented to the Board by the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. The evaluation 
process is designed to cover Board processes, the 
structure and capability of the Board, strategic 
alignment, Board dynamics and the skills brought to the 
Board by each Director. The Board evaluation process 
confirmed that the Board and its Committees were 
operating effectively.
Development
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for 
preparing and implementing an induction programme for 
Directors, including guidance as to their duties, 
responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company 
and business familiarisation. Business familiarisation 
involves Directors visiting the Company’s offices and 
giving the Directors the opportunity to meet the 
executive management team and other senior managers 
in the business. They also have the opportunity to discuss 
organisational, operational and administrative matters. 
Every Director has access to appropriate training as 
required following their appointment.
Information
Board members are given appropriate documentation in 
a timely manner in advance of each Board or 
Committee meeting. This normally includes a detailed 
report on current trading and full papers on matters 
where the Board or Committee will be required to make 
a decision or give its approval. Specific business related 
presentations are given when appropriate.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and providing advice to the Board on corporate 
governance. Both the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole.
Board and Committee attendance
The attendance record of the Directors at scheduled Board and Committee meetings during the year is set out in 
the following table. The Board scheduled 10 meetings during the year and ad hoc conference calls were also 
convened to deal with specific matters which required attention between scheduled meetings.

Corporate Governance
Directors can, where they judge it necessary to 
discharge their responsibilities as Directors, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. Directors have the right to require that any 
concerns they may have are recorded in the appropriate 
Board or Committee minutes.
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining 
good communications with shareholders. Senior 
executives, including the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer regularly meet with 
analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of significant developments and to develop an 
understanding of their views which are reported back to 
the Board. Formal presentations are given to analysts 
and shareholders covering the full year and half year 
results. The Company Secretary deals with questions 
from individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all 
information reported to the market via the regulatory 
information service, press releases and other 
shareholder information, are published on the Group’s 
website at www.moneysupermarket.com to be viewed 
and accessed by all shareholders.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
Michael Wemms, is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial 
Officer has failed to resolve, or for which such contact  
is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask 
questions at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees will be available to answer 
questions at that meeting. Shareholders may also 
contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or,  
if more appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director to raise any issue with one or all of 
the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The result of the vote on each 
resolution will be published on the Group’s website after 
the Annual General Meeting and will be announced via 
the regulatory information service.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The key features of the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management are:
A comprehensive annual business planning and • 
budgeting process, requiring Board approval, against 
which the Group’s actual performance and any 
significant variances are regularly reviewed by the 
Board.
A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s • 
approval to ensure it maintains control over 
appropriate strategic, financial, organisational, 
compliance and capital investment issues.
An organisation structure with clearly defined lines of • 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
Regular reviews by management and the Audit • 
Committee of the key risks facing the Group and the 
actions being taken to mitigate and manage them.
An annual two day strategy conference to discuss • 
and approve the Group’s strategic direction, plans 
and objectives and the risks to achieving them.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the • 
Financial Statements and the material financial 
reporting judgements contained in them.
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the • 
system of internal control and the reviews by the 
external auditors of that system.
The Audit Committee has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management during the financial year ended 31 
December 2009. The Board considers that in the 
context of the control environment described above, the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management 
is effective and satisfactory.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Directors consider that during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2009 and to the date of this report, 
the Company complied with the Combined Code except 
as follows:
A.3.2 – During the year at least half the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, did not comprise Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Company is continuing the 
process, with the assistance of an external search 
company, to appoint additional Independent Non-
Executive Directors.
B.2.1 – The Remuneration Committee does not currently 
comprise at least three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Company is continuing the process, with 
the assistance of an external search company,  Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
37 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
to appoint additional Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It is currently anticipated that at least one of 
the appointees will become a member of the 
Remuneration Committee.
C.3.1 – The Audit Committee does not currently 
comprise at least three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Company is continuing the process, with 
the assistance of an external search company, to 
appoint additional Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It is currently anticipated that at least one of 
the appointees will become a member of the Audit 
Committee.
D.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the 
Board by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer following their dialogue with 
major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director believes he is aware of the views of 
major shareholders. Unless requested by major 
shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director does not attend meetings with them.

Audit Committee Report
Corporate Governance
The Audit Committee presents a separate report in 
relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2009.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-
Executive Directors, Rob Rowley (Chairman of the Audit 
Committee), Gerald Corbett and Michael Wemms. Rob 
Rowley and Michael Wemms are considered by the 
Board to be independent. Gerald Corbett was 
considered by the Board to be independent on 
appointment. Biographies of the members of the Audit 
Committee are set out on pages 24 and 25. Rob Rowley 
is a qualified accountant and was formerly finance 
director of Reuters plc and chairman of the audit 
committee at Prudential plc. He is currently chairman of 
the audit committee at Liberty International plc. The 
Board is satisfied that Rob Rowley has recent and 
relevant financial experience.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on four occasions during the 
year. Details of the attendance at Audit Committee 
meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 35.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
together with the external auditors, will normally attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The external auditors are regularly invited 
by the Audit Committee to advise them of any matters 
which they consider should be brought to the Audit 
Committee’s attention without the Executive Directors 
present. The external auditors may also request a 
meeting with the Audit Committee if they consider  
it necessary.
 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit 
Committee. The members of the Audit Committee can, 
where they judge it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities, obtain independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee’s duties include:
Monitoring the financial reporting process. • 
Monitoring the statutory audit of the Group’s • 
Financial Statements.
Reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the • 
material financial reporting judgements contained in 
them.
Monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal • 
control and risk management systems.
Reviewing and monitoring the independence of the • 
external auditors and the provision of additional 
services to the Group.
Advising the Board on the appointment and removal • 
of the external auditors and the remuneration and 
terms of engagement of the external auditors.
Reviewing the Group’s whistle blowing procedures. • 
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line 
with an annual work plan. The Audit Committee agrees 
the scope of the audit work and discusses the results of 
the full year audit and half year review each year. 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
are published on the Group’s website at  
www.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard 
copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
Group’s whistle blowing procedures to ensure 
arrangements are in place to enable employees to raise 
concerns about possible malpractice or wrongdoing by 
the Group or any of its employees on a confidential 
basis. This includes arrangements to proportionately 
and independently investigate such matters and for 
appropriate follow-up action.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The Audit Committee monitors and 
undertakes an annual review of the effectiveness of, and 
the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management. This includes annual 
consideration as to whether there is a need to establish 
an internal audit function.
The Audit Committee undertook a review of the 
effectiveness of, and the framework for, the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls 
during the year. In addition to this review, the external 
auditors provided the Audit Committee with 
comprehensive reports of the results of their controls 
testing as part of the external audit. On a half yearly 
basis, the Audit Committee also reviewed the key risks 
facing the Group and the actions being taken by 
management to mitigate and manage them.
During the year the Audit Committee considered the 
need to establish an internal audit function and 
concluded that the control systems are sufficient for the 
size and complexity of the Group such that an internal 
audit function is not required at this time. This will be 
reviewed in 2010.
Review of the work of the external auditors
Subject to the annual appointment of the external 
auditors by shareholders, the Audit Committee regularly 
reviews the relationship between the Group and the 
external auditors. This review includes an assessment  
of their performance, cost-effectiveness, objectivity  
and independence. Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
39 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship is maintained between the 
Group and the external auditors. The Group has 
implemented a policy of controlling the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors in order to 
ensure that their objectivity and independence is 
safeguarded. This control is exercised by ensuring that 
all non-audit services are subject to the prior approval of 
the Audit Committee. During the year, the Audit 
Committee continued with the appointment of other 
accountancy firms to provide non-audit services to the 
Group and anticipates that this will continue in 2010.
The Audit Committee, having considered the external 
auditors’ performance during their period in office, 
recommends their reappointment. A full breakdown of 
the audit and non-audit related fees is set out in note 4 
to the Group Financial Statements on page 60. The 
Audit Committee discussed the level of fees and 
considered them appropriate given the current size of 
the Group. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the 
level and scope of non-audit services undertaken by the 
external auditors does not impair their independence 
and objectivity.

Advisors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received 
advice from MM&K Limited, who are independent 
remuneration consultants, in connection with 
remuneration matters including market comparison 
salary benchmarking data and best practice, and the 
development of the Group’s performance related 
remuneration policy. MM&K Limited has no other 
connection or relationship with the Group. MM&K 
Limited provided no other services to the Group during 
the financial year ended 31 December 2009.
Remuneration policy and objectives
The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive 
Directors has been designed to provide market 
competitive remuneration relative to a peer group of UK 
listed companies of similar size and scope to the Group.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to 
provide market competitive levels of remuneration in a 
form and amount necessary to attract, retain and 
motivate Executive Directors of appropriate calibre and 
experience which is essential to the future success of 
the Group. The importance of aligning the interests of 
the Executive Directors with the creation of shareholder 
value together with the incentivisation of performance 
at the highest level is key to this objective. The 
Remuneration Committee believes that this requires:
The provision of mid-market base salaries with • 
appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional 
performance provided stretching and demanding 
performance conditions are met.
A reward structure that balances short term and long • 
term performance.
Competitive incentive arrangements that are • 
underpinned by a balance of financial and operational 
performance metrics to provide both a focus on 
business performance and alignment with the 
interests of shareholders.
In determining the remuneration arrangements of the 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes 
into consideration the performance of the Executive 
Directors and the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 42 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance
The Remuneration Committee believes that the 
remuneration of Executive Directors should provide  
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
(performance related) pay elements with a significant 
proportion of potential total remuneration being 
performance related elements. For target performance, 
it is anticipated that approximately 60% of total 
remuneration for Executive Directors will be 
performance related in 2010.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review 
the remuneration policy to ensure it remains consistent 
with best remuneration practice and is aligned to 
shareholders’ interests. The Remuneration Committee 
believes the policy described above, which applied  
in 2009, remains appropriate and that it will continue  
in 2010.
Components of remuneration
The main components of the remuneration packages of 
the Executive Directors consist of the following 
elements. 
Base salary
Base salary for each Executive Director is determined by 
the Remuneration Committee, taking account of the 
Director’s performance, experience and responsibilities. 
The Remuneration Committee considers salary levels 
from a peer group of UK listed companies. This 
approach ensures that the best available benchmark for 
the Director’s specific position is obtained. When 
determining Executive Director’s base salaries, the 
Remuneration Committee also has regard to economic 
factors, remuneration trends and the general level of 
salary increases awarded throughout the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has decided that due to 
the current economic climate there will be no base 
salary increases for Executive Directors in January 2010 
with the exception of David Osborne whose salary has 
increased by £5,000 to £190,000 per annum reflecting 
his contributions during the year.
Performance related bonus
Targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee 
at the beginning of 2009 and were aligned to internal 
targets and business objectives for 2009. Up to 125% of 
base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of 
base salary for each of the other Executive Directors 
(excluding Simon Nixon) were payable for the 
achievement of target adjusted EBITDA set at 
appropriately stretching levels and certain business 
objectives relating to, inter alia, employees, customers 
and visitors on a 75% (target adjusted EBITDA)/25% 
(business objectives) basis. For the achievement of 
adjusted EBITDA performance greater than target, the 
bonus amounts increased by 35% for each 10% increase 
in adjusted EBITDA performance. No bonus was 
payable unless an adjusted EBITDA threshold measure 
was achieved.
In the financial year ended 31 December 2009, the Chief 
Executive Officer earned a bonus of 90% of base salary 
and each of the other Executive Directors (excluding 
Simon Nixon) earned a bonus of 78% of base salary. 
Simon Nixon did not participate in the Group’s 
performance related bonus scheme in 2009. Details of 
adjusted EBITDA achieved in 2009 are shown on page 14.
Following a review of incentive arrangements, the 
Remuneration Committee has decided that the key 
short term operational drivers of the business remain 
appropriate and therefore the same overall structure as 
applied in 2009 should continue in 2010. Up to 125% of 
base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of 
base salary for each of the other Executive Directors 
(excluding Simon Nixon) will be payable for the 
achievement of target adjusted EBITDA set at 
appropriately stretching levels and certain business 
objectives on a 70% (target adjusted EBITDA)/30% 
(business objectives) basis in the case of Peter Plumb 
and Paul Doughty and a 60% (target adjusted 
EBITDA)/40% (business objectives) basis in the case of 
Graham Donoghue and David Osborne. For the 
achievement of adjusted EBITDA performance greater 
than target, the bonus amounts will increase according 
to a set formula up to a maximum of 175% of base salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of base salary 
for each of the other Executive Directors (excluding 
Simon Nixon) if exceptional performance targets are 
met. No bonus is payable unless an adjusted EBITDA 
threshold measure is achieved. Simon Nixon will not 
participate in the Group’s performance related bonus 
scheme in 2010.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
Conditional nil cost share awards are made by Appleby 
Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trust, following recommendations 
made by the Board. The levels of award and the 
performance conditions are recommended and 
reviewed by the Remuneration Committee annually. 
The awards normally vest at the end of the three year 
performance period, subject to the achievement of the 
performance conditions and continued employment. 
Awards lapse to the extent that the performance 
conditions are not achieved. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
43 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
The maximum award that can be made to an employee 
in any financial year is the equivalent of 200% of an 
employee’s annual base salary, calculated on the basis 
of the market price of the Company’s shares at the date 
of grant.
In 2009, awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
were made to 46 employees of the Group and were 
made over shares worth between 7% and 200% of those 
employees’ annual base salaries. For the awards made in 
2009, as detailed below, vesting of 70% of the award Is 
subject to an adjusted EBITDA performance condition 
and vesting of the remaining 30% of the award is 
subject to a total shareholder return (TSR) performance 
condition. Both of these performance conditions are 
assessed over a three year performance period as 
detailed below.
The adjusted EBITDA target for each of the financial 
years 2009 to 2011 (inclusive) represents one third of the 
adjusted EBITDA element of the award. For the adjusted 
EBITDA element of the award to vest in full, the adjusted 
EBITDA performance conditions for each of the financial 
years 2009 to 2011 (inclusive) must be achieved. The 
adjusted EBITDA upper limit target together with the 
adjusted EBITDA threshold for vesting and the formula 
for determining vesting between the threshold and the 
upper limit target for each of the financial years 2009 to 
2011 (inclusive) is set annually by the Remuneration 
Committee at the beginning of that financial year. No 
award will vest in relation to the adjusted EBITDA 
element for a financial year for performance below the 
threshold level of vesting in respect of that financial 
year. 30% of a financial year’s element of the adjusted 
EBITDA award will vest at the threshold level of vesting 
in respect of that financial year. 
For the TSR element of the award to vest in full, the 
Company’s relative TSR must rank in the upper quartile 
of a selected peer group of companies over the period 
2009 to 2011 (inclusive).
No award will vest in relation to the TSR element for 
performance below median, with 30% of the TSR 
element of the award vesting at median, rising to 100% 
at upper quartile on a straight-line basis. In order for the 
TSR element to vest, the Remuneration Committee 
must be satisfied that such vesting is justified when 
taking into account the underlying financial 
performance of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee chose the combination  
of annually set adjusted EBITDA and TSR as the 
performance targets for the 2009 award under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan to provide closer alignment 
with underlying Group performance and shareholder 
interests and to act as a strong retention tool for senior 
management. The Remuneration Committee further 
chose annually set adjusted EBITDA targets to ensure 
that the adjusted EBITDA target would remain relevant 
and stretching over the entire three years of the plan 
during a period when the Remuneration Committee had 
extremely limited visibility of potential future adjusted 
EBITDA of the Group as a result of the unprecedented 
global financial crisis prevailing at that time.
The Remuneration Committee will meet once the results 
for the three year plan period are available to determine 
whether, and the extent to which, the performance 
conditions have been met.
Dividends will accrue on any shares that vest in the form 
either of additional shares or a cash payment and will be 
made at the time of vesting.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that the 
performance targets for the 2010 award under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan will be based on a combination of 
comparative TSR and absolute TSR set at appropriately 
stretching levels. The Remuneration Committee has 
chosen this combination to ensure even closer 
alignment of management with shareholders interests 
and to incentivise management to generate long term 
sustainable returns for shareholders.
Share Option Scheme
Prior to the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007 
(‘Listing’), the Group operated the  
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited Share 
Option Scheme. All options under this scheme were 
granted prior to Listing and the Group does not intend 
to grant any further options under this scheme. The 
options vest over a three year period from the date of 
grant subject to continued employment and will lapse 
on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the date of 
grant and the date the option holder ceases to be 
employed by the Group. There are no performance 
conditions applicable to this scheme as it is a historic 
scheme used prior to Listing principally as a means of 
retaining key employees. 
In order to enable option holders to participate in the 
forthcoming special dividend proposed to be paid on  
1 April 2010 and thereby prevent any reduction in the 
value of options held by the option holders arising from 
such special dividend, in February 2010, the 
Remuneration Committee approved the early vesting of 
all remaining options under this scheme. The 
Remuneration Committee has determined that prior to 
exercising any such options, the option holders are 
required to enter into a restricted share agreement with  44 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance
the Company. As a result, until the third anniversary of 
the date of grant, any shares obtained following such 
exercise will be subject to clawback and any shares that 
would not have vested under the rules of the scheme 
will be forfeited for no consideration.
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting to authorise the payment of a sum to 
option holders representing the reduction in the value of 
options held by them following the payment of the 
special dividend of 4.93p per ordinary share on 16 
October 2009. Further detail on this resolution is 
provided in the notice of Annual General Meeting sent 
to shareholders at the same time as this report.
Pension 
The Company operates a contributory money purchase 
pension scheme for the benefit of the Executive 
Directors. In all cases, base salary only is pensionable. 
During the year, the Company matched pension 
contributions up to 8% of base salary for the benefit of 
the Executive Directors. From February 2010 the 
Company will match pension contributions up to 10% of 
base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee increased the matched 
pension contributions limit to bring the scheme more 
into line with market standards.
Car allowance
The Company provides a car allowance of £14,000 per 
annum for each of the Executive Directors. The amount 
of the car allowance is reviewed annually.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company’s HMRC approved all employee Share 
Incentive Plan provides all employees with the 
opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company on a monthly basis using money deducted 
from their pre-tax salary.
Simon Nixon Scheme
As disclosed in the prospectus issued in connection with 
the Listing of the Company, Simon Nixon established in 
2009 an additional incentive scheme under which he 
personally granted options over 1,413,199 ordinary 
shares held by him in favour of Paul Doughty. The 
options vested in 2009 subject to Paul Doughty’s 
continued employment with the Group and the 
satisfaction of Group related performance targets and 
individual related performance targets for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2008 and for the first six 
months of 2009. On 4 August 2009, Paul Doughty 
exercised options over 1,120,813 ordinary shares held by 
Simon Nixon and the remaining 292,386 options lapsed 
as a result of a failure of the Group to meet the 
performance targets for 2008. 
The purpose of this scheme was to further incentivise 
the achievement by Paul Doughty of exceptional 
performance and to align his interests with the interests 
of shareholders. Simon Nixon does not intend to grant 
any further options under this scheme.
Chairman’s Share Award
Under a share award agreement between the Company 
and Gerald Corbett dated 31 July 2007 (‘Share Award’), 
Gerald Corbett is entitled to subscribe at nominal value 
for 235,294 ordinary shares in the Company 
(representing twice the number of shares he purchased 
on Listing with an investment of £200,000), conditional 
upon completion of three years’ service as Chairman of 
the Company from Listing and the continued retention 
for that three year period of the 117,647 ordinary shares 
he purchased on Listing. Shareholder approval was 
obtained prior to the entry by the Company into the 
Share Award.
Following the payment of the special dividend of 4.93p 
per ordinary share on 16 October 2009, the Remuneration 
Committee approved an adjustment to the Share Award 
in accordance with the rules of the Share Award. As a 
result of that adjustment, Gerald Corbett has become 
entitled to subscribe at nominal value for an additional 
13,318 ordinary shares in the Company representing the 
reduction in the value of the Share Award arising from the 
payment of that special dividend.
In order to enable the Chairman to participate in the 
forthcoming special dividend proposed to be paid on  
1 April 2010 and thereby prevent any reduction in the 
value of the Share Award arising from such special 
dividend, in February 2010, the Remuneration 
Committee approved, in accordance with the rules of 
the Share Award, the early subscription by the Chairman 
of the shares comprising the Share Award. The 
Remuneration Committee has determined that prior to 
such subscription, the Chairman is required to enter into 
a restricted share agreement with the Company. As a 
result, until the third anniversary of the Share Award, any 
shares obtained by the Chairman following such 
subscription will be subject to clawback and any shares 
that would not have been eligible for subscription under 
the rules of the Share Award will be forfeited for  
no consideration.

1. Executive Directors are appointed on 12 month rolling contracts.
Peter Plumb’s service agreement contains a temporary provision which states that, if his employment is terminated 
by the Company as a result of a change in control, wrongful dismissal or redundancy before 1 November 2011, he 
will be entitled to the sum of £225,000 less the market value of any shares received or receivable by him pursuant 
to his participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan and less any tax payable on such sum, in addition to his 
12 month notice period. Thereafter, Peter Plumb’s notice period will revert to the normal 12 months which reflects 
the Company’s general policy on such matters.
Subject to the above, there are no special provisions for Executive Directors or Non-Executive Directors with regard 
to compensation in the event of loss of office. In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being 
terminated, the Remuneration Committee would, having regard to the individual’s circumstances, pay due regard to 
best practice and take account of the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office address.
Other appointments
Executive Directors may only accept outside appointments on external boards or committees with the prior 
approval of the Board. In addition to his directorship of companies in the Group, Simon Nixon is a director of 
Simonseeks.com Limited in which Simon Nixon is, directly or indirectly, the majority shareholder. In addition to his 
directorship of companies in the Group, Peter Plumb is a director of The Naked Fruit Company Limited.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but instead have letters of appointment for a three 
year term. The current policy is for Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment notice periods to be normally 
no longer than 12 months. Each of the Non-Executive Directors currently has a letter of appointment reflecting this.
Save in respect of the Chairman’s Share Award (details of which are set out on page 44), remuneration of  
Non-Executive Directors consists solely of fees. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, pension, share 
option or other performance related incentive schemes. In line with the approach for Executive Directors, there will 
be no increases in the Non-Executive Directors’ fees in January 2010. 20

of the Executive Directors by the trustee of the Company’s Share Incentive Plan which is detailed on page 44. No 
Director held a non-beneficial interest in any shares.
In the period 31 December 2009 to the date of this report, there has been no change in the Directors’ interests in 
shares in the Company other than through the monthly purchases in January and February 2010 of ordinary shares 
under the Company’s Share Incentive Plan by Paul Doughty. This has resulted in an increase in the interests held by 
Paul Doughty of 329 ordinary shares during this period.
The Remuneration Committee’s intention is to introduce a policy under which the Executive Directors will be 
required to build up a meaningful shareholding in the Company.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Corporate information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’), a company 
incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 23 February 2010. The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 73 to 77.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative figures presented in the Financial 
Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2008. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying 
accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties 
encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and 
accompanying notes:
Note 11 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment • 
Note 12  revenue recognition • 
Note 12 provision for doubtful debts • 
Note 13 accruals • 
Note 17 share-based payments • 
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial 
Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. 
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007. These 
comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the 
Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixon’s 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited from third parties.  The acquisition of Simon Nixon’s shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon 
and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction. The acquisition was of an 
interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this 
arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.  As a 
result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited at original 
carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition of the remaining shares in 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. This resulted in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised. Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency. The functional currency of the foreign operation icero GmbH is the euro. The income and 
expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which 
the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange 
rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a 
separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are 
recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue
Internet business
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales 
and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and 
associated costs in the period that the lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of 
completion of the transaction with the customer. Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an 
advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business
Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated until brought into use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment)  3 years
Fixtures and fittings  5 years
Office equipment  5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. The excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities, is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying 
value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value 
may be impaired. Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. All the Group’s intangible assets (other than goodwill) have been identified as 
having finite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least 
at each financial year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships  7 years
Customer lists  3 years
Technology  3 years
Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of 
products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-
contractual customer relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been 
identified separately. Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the 
marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand. Customer lists 
allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, 
patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of 
their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and 
understanding, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. Development expenditure is 
capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32. Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed 
directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Statement of  
Cash Flows.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income as incurred. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair 
value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the share awards made is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by 
the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs
The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.  Costs associated with the production of 
adverts are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is delivered 
to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.  The cost of airing or 
displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Net finance income
Net finance income comprises interest payable and interest receivable, which are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ 
equity in the period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the prior year as 28% of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives 
which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing the 
tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods. At the prior year end, this liability was remeasured at 
the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which the liability will unwind. This liability will 
decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12. Financial Statements

Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for • 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level • 
of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. 
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital, retained earnings 
and reserves (where applicable).
The Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit 
risk. The Group had no debt as at 31 December 2009 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements; 
management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives 
for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make 
returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 
31 December 2009 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group:
IAS 27 (Amended 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements – is effective for reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and applies prospectively. The standard deals with changes to the accounting for 
non-controlling (minority) interest and deals primarily with the accounting for changes in ownership interests in 
subsidiaries after control is obtained, the accounting for the loss of control of subsidiaries, and the allocation of 
profit or loss to controlling and non-controlling interests in a subsidiary.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised 2008) – is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 
and applies prospectively. Key changes are that transaction costs are expensed other than debt/equity income 
costs (previously all costs were capitalised), goodwill is fixed at the date of acquisition, subsequent adjustments go 
through the income statement, contingent payments which require future services (such as an earn out) that are 
forfeited if employment ceases are treated, in full, as post acquisition remuneration. 
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be 
endorsed by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

3 Segmental information
Business segments
In adopting IFRS 8 – Operating Segments for the first time, the Group has disclosed four reportable segments, 
being Money, Insurance, Travel and Home. This disclosure correlates with the information which is presented to  
the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment. The Group’s 
costs, finance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a 
consolidated level, and therefore have not been allocated between segments in the analysis below. Previously, 
under IAS 14, the Group reported Internet and Intermediary segments. Of the Group revenue of £136.9m  
(2008: £178.8m) reported in 2009, £134.9m (2008: £176.3m) was generated in the UK.

Reconciliation of the effective tax rate
The tax charge for the year is higher (2008: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK in 2009 of 
28% (2008: 28%). The differences are explained below.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. The 
effective tax rate for 2008 was therefore estimated at 28.5%.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of £1,830,000 (2008: £1,185,000). A 
deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable 
profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in a foreign subsidiary that may not make a profit in the 
immediate future. 
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary 
equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary 
equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets 
for impairment.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third 
party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation 
was used as the initial carrying value for these assets. Following the impairment provision in 2008, the market 
capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-
current assets of the Group. At 31 December 2009 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the 
goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets by 78%.
As disclosed in note 3, IFRS 8 has been adopted in the year with comparative disclosures made, and as a result 
revised operating segments are disclosed. On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill 
between its cash generating units (CGU) that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8. 
These CGUs are the four operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services, and the Group has 
therefore performed impairment testing at this level. The goodwill has been allocated on 1 January 2009 based on 
estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with £30.7m allocated to Insurance, £15.5m 
to Money, £6.6m to Travel and £2.2m to Home Services.
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by 
reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions:
Cash flows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2009, and • 
are based upon the Group’s approved budget for 2010. The main assumptions underlying the 2010 budget relate 
to visitor numbers and revenue per transaction/visitor. The forecast assumes some improvement during the 
course of 2010 driven by the new branding campaign and investments made in the core technology for the 
Group’s key channels, as well as the more settled outlook in the wider economy. The Insurance and Money 
segments have been assumed to have similar rates of growth, and the Travel and Home Services segments have 
been assumed to return to close to the revenue levels achieved in 2008.
Cash flows for subsequent years for all segments are consistent with those in year 1 and assume no growth. No • 
reliable third party estimates of long term growth rates exist for the price comparison industry given it is a 
relatively new business model.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations. •  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
65 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
A pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used in the forecast for all segments. A lower discount rate has been • 
used compared with the rate used to test the Internet segment last year (16%) to reflect the reduction in the 
uncertainty in the economic climate since the start of the year.
When there are clear indications that the economy has begun to recover a different set of assumptions may be 
more appropriate.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money and 
Travel segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% and the recoverable amount of the assets 
allocated to the Home Services segment exceeds their carrying value by 20%, and as such, are not impaired. No 
reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 3, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenues between the four operating segments, its cost 
base is reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a 
number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and 
consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment. Therefore the cash flows estimated above include all 
of the Group’s forecast revenues, but only approximately 55% of the Group’s cost base.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent 
with that in 2008. In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the 
carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows which has been 
calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating 
segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets exceeds their carrying value 
by £44m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, an increase of 3% in the discount rate, with all other assumptions 
held constant, would give a value in use for the Group’s assets equal to their carrying value. Similarly, a decrease in 
the annual cash flows of £6.0m, with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use for the 
Group’s assets equal to their carrying value.
At an individual level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, 
and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives. Financial Statements

The Group has a number of share schemes under which options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional 
awards of ordinary shares in the Company have been made to certain Directors and employees (see note 17).
16 Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
There is no significant exposure to interest risk as the Group has no borrowings.
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks. Interest earned therefore closely 
follows movements in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in 
annual pre-tax profit of £538,000 based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 
2009. At the balance sheet date, £18,010,000 was invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most 
invested with any one bank.
Effective interest rates
In respect of interest-earning financial assets, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the year 
end date.
 31 December 2009 
I
 31 December 2008
     Effective  Effective 
     interest rate £000 interest rate £000
Cash and cash equivalents     0.69% 53,805 2.84% 73,465
Credit risk
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit control team and 
finance management. By value, over 90% (2008: 90%) of the Group’s revenue comes from blue chip companies. 
Most of the remaining provider base is subject to payment terms of one week collected by direct debits. At the 
balance sheet date, the five largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted for 12% (2008: 19%) of the total  
trade receivables balance of £14,375,000 (2008: £16,074,000) and the largest individual balance was £585,211 
(2008: £986,817).
Fair values
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not 
materially different from their carrying value.
17 Share-based payments
Unapproved share option scheme
Grant 1
On 22 May 2007 the holders of unapproved share options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited 
agreed to have their unapproved share options replaced with share options in the Company on similar terms to 
those that operated under the original scheme. Options over 1,460 shares were originally exchanged. Following the 
share sub-division on 9 July 2007 where each ordinary share was converted to 5,000 ordinary shares, the shares 
under option were subject to a similar sub-division. Following this, there were therefore 7,300,000 share options in 
issue that related to the share options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, exchanged for share 
options in the Company.
These share options were originally granted by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited on 9 May 2005 
and vested on the earlier of a trade sale or a flotation provided that in the event of a flotation the options had been 
held for three years from the date of grant. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Grant 2
On 18 and 22 June 2007 the Company granted further unapproved share options that entitled key management 
personnel and senior employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options were originally granted over 
1,243 shares, which following the sub-division referred to above, became 6,215,000 shares. Options vest on the 
earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a flotation, equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries from 
the date of grant. The exercise price is 6p per share. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

17 Share-based payments continued
Grant 3
Post the sub-division of shares referred to above, on 10 and 21 July 2007 the Company granted further unapproved 
share options that entitled key management personnel and senior employees to acquire shares in the Company. 
Options were originally granted over 105,000 shares. Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a 
flotation, equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries from the date of grant. The exercise price is 
6p per share.
Subsequent to the year end, the Remuneration Committee has approved the early vesting of all remaining 
unapproved share options under the unapproved share option scheme.
Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 per ordinary share to each eligible 
employee free of charge. If an employee leaves within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares are forfeit; 
between one and two years of listing, 50% are forfeit; between two and three years of listing, 20% are forfeit; and after 
three years of listing, none are forfeit. 948,184 shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan scheme in 2007.
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
On 28 December 2007 and 4 March 2008, the Company made conditional awards over 1,242,201 ordinary shares 
under the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2008 
LTIPs’). Under this scheme, shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of a 
cumulative adjusted EBITDA figure for the three financial years from 2008 to 2010. Based on the adjusted EBITDA 
figures achieved in 2008 and 2009, management do not expect any of these awards to vest.
During the year, conditional awards were made over 8,256,530 ordinary shares under the Moneysupermarket.com 
Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2009 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, up to 70% of 
the shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted EBITDA figure for 
each of the three financial years from 2009 to 2011, and up to 30% of the shares vest at the end of a three year 
period dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company relative to a comparator group of 
defined companies.
Chairman’s share award
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman of the Company, purchased 117,647 ordinary shares on the listing of the Company at 
the initial offer price of £1.70. Subject to him retaining these shares for three years and provided that he completes 
three years’ service as Chairman he shall be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for a total of 235,294 ordinary 
shares in the Company. 
Following the payment of the special dividend of 4.93p per ordinary share on 16 October 2009, the Remuneration 
Committee approved, subsequent to the year end, an adjustment to the Chairman’s share award in accordance with 
the rules of the scheme. As a result of that adjustment, Gerald Corbett has become entitled to subscribe at nominal 
value for a total of 248,612 ordinary shares in the Company reflecting the reduction in the value of the Chairman’s 
share award arising from the payment of that special dividend.
Subsequent to the year end, the Remuneration Committee has approved, in accordance with the rules of the 
Chairman’s share award, the early subscription by Gerald Corbett of the shares comprising the Chairman’s share award.
Simon Nixon Scheme
During 2008, Simon Nixon established an additional incentive scheme under which he personally granted options 
over 633,504 ordinary shares in the Company held by him in favour of one former employee of the Group. Options 
over 487,311 ordinary shares vested on 8 October 2008 and were exercised by the former employee on that date. 
Options over the remaining 146,193 ordinary shares were dependent on the satisfaction of Group related 
performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2008 and lapsed.
During 2009, similar arrangements were entered into by Simon Nixon in favour of Paul Doughty and certain other 
former employees, with options over a total of 3,378,683 ordinary shares held by Simon Nixon being granted 
personally by him to those persons. Options over 2,793,911 ordinary shares vested on 31 July 2009 and 4 August 
2009 and were exercised by the participants on 4 August 2009. Options over the remaining 584,772 ordinary 
shares were dependent on the satisfaction of Group related performance targets for the year ended 31 December 
2008 and lapsed. Financial Statements

The Group provided office space and services to Abacus Permanent Limited and Virtual Processing Limited during 
the year, companies in which Simon Nixon controls over 90% of the voting shares. The Group recharged these two 
companies rent and associated services at the same levels as it recharged wholly owned subsidiary companies. 
These rates were based on notional open market rents for similar offices in the locality. In addition the Group 
provided payroll services for these related companies, fully recovering salaries paid. In the normal course of trade 
with these related companies the Group both charged and was charged for mortgage procuration fees. The level of 
these fees were at arm’s length and mirrored the going rates in the open market.
On 2 July 2009, Rob Budden, a director of Foom.com Limited, acquired 160 ordinary shares of £1 each in the

No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The profit after tax for the Company was £61,445,000.

Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair 
value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest. Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount 
recognised as share based payments relating to awards to their employees. The fair value of the recharge is 
recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends 
payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss 
account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised  
in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of 
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, 
except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

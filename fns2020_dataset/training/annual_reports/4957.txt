Drax Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Drax Group plc is the ultimate holding company of 
Drax Power Limited, the owner of Drax Power Station, 
situated at Selby, North Yorkshire. Drax Power Station is 
the largest, cleanest and most efficient coal-fired power 
station in the UK. The total output capacity of the 
Station’s six generators is 3,960MW. All units are fitted 
with flue gas desulphurisation equipment, which 
removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide from 
emissions. Drax sells the electricity it generates into  
the physical wholesale power market for Great Britain, 
and at current output levels supplies some 7% of the 
country’s electricity needs.
As well as being an important strategic asset nationally, 
Drax Power Station is also vital to the local economy. 
Drax Power employs some 620 people directly and, 
through its use of local sub-contractors and outsourcing, 
supports many other jobs indirectly in the Selby area.  
It is also the major customer for a number of the UK’s 
remaining coal mines.

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
Through	 the	 ownership	 of	 the	 largest,	 cleanest	 and	 most	 efficient	 coal-fired	 power	 station	 in	 the	 country,	 with	 a	 nominal	 output	 capacity	 of	 3,960MW,	 the	 Group	 provides	 power	 sufficient	 to	 meet	 around		 7%	 of	 the	 electricity	 needs	 of	 the	 UK.
The	 year	 2005	 was	 transformational:	 it	 saw	 the	 Group	 refinanced	 and	 its	 shares	 listed	 for	 the	 first	 time	 on		 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.	 Accordingly,	 this	 is	 the	 first	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 for	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 which	 became	 the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 Drax	 group	 of	 companies	 on	 15	 December	 2005.	 Refinancing and Listing
In	 March	 2005,	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 set	 out	 its	 proposals	 to	 refinance	 and	 list	 the	 business	 by	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year.	 The	 reasons	 were	 clear	 to	 the	 Board.	 The	 prevailing	 capital	 structure	 was	 restricting	 the	 ability	 of	 management	 to	 develop	 its	 trading	 and	 business	 strategy	 and	 in	 consequence	 management	 efforts	 to	 enhance	 shareholder	 value	 were	 being	 inappropriately	 constrained.	 Throughout	 the	 year	 in	 a	 series	 of	 investor	 roadshows,	 letters,	 meetings	 and	 discussions	 the	 Board	 outlined	 and	 developed	 its	 proposals	 to	 align	 the	 trading,	 operational,	 and	 financial	 strategies	 to	 deliver	 greater	 shareholder	 value.	 Much	 effort	 was	 put	 into	 engaging	 with	 investors,	 seeking	 their	 understanding		 of	 the	 plans,	 and	 receiving	 their	 feedback	 directly	 and	 through	 their	 representatives,	 all	 of	 which	 helped	 shape	 the	 final	 proposals.	 Whilst	 conceptually	 straightforward,	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 were	 technically	 difficult		 to	 implement,	 requiring	 very	 high	 levels	 of	 positive	 shareholder	 and	 lender	 approvals	 within	 what	 was		 then	 a	 complex	 capital	 structure.
During	 the	 Autumn	 of	 2005	 three	 separate	 indicative	 offers	 were	 made	 for	 the	 business.	 The	 Board	 assessed	 each	 of	 them	 against	 the	 same	 criteria:	 value,	 deliverability	 and	 timeliness.	 Having	 regard	 to	 these	 criteria,	 and	 to	 the	 views	 expressed	 by	 investors	 directly,	 indirectly	 through	 their	 representatives,	 and	 significantly	 through	 their	 votes,	 the	 Board	 with	 the	 support	 of	 its	 advisers	 concluded	 that	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 was	 the	 best	 option	 and	 the	 bids	 were	 either	 rejected	 or	 fell	 away.	 The	 Group	 now	 enjoys	 a	 robust	 and	 simple	 capital	 structure	 appropriate	 to	 a	 business	 operating	 within	 commodity	 markets	 and	 its	 shares	 trade	 in	 a	 transparent	 and	 liquid	 market.	 I	 am	 pleased	 to	 note	 that	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 delivered	 the	 expected	 investment	 grade	 ratings	 for	 the	 Group	 debt	 and	 for	 the	 principal	 operating	 subsidiary,	 Drax	 Power	 Limited.	 The	 resulting	 credit	 standing	 with	 trading	 counterparties,	 together	 with	 our	 enhanced	 ability	 to	 provide	 credit	 support	 where	 necessary,	 are	 already	 delivering	 significant	 trading	 and	 operational	 benefits.
On	 15	 December	 2005,	 Charles	 Berry	 and	 Jamie	 Dundas	 joined	 the	 Company	 as	 additional	 non-
executive	 directors.	 Charles	 has	 extensive	 experience	 in	 the	 UK	 power	 sector,	 joining	 Drax	 from	 ScottishPower	 where	 he	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	 board	 in	 1999.	 Jamie	 brings	 excellent	 City	 experience	 and	 experience	 from	 his	 current	 membership	 of	 the	 Boards	 of	 two	 FTSE	 100	 companies.	 Each	 of	 the	 above	 Board	 appointments	 was	 made	 following	 a	 recruitment	 exercise	 carried	 out	 by	 external	 search	 consultants.	 As	 foreshadowed	 in	 our	 Listing	 Particulars,	 my	 own	 role	 as	 executive	 Chairman	 came	 to	 an	 end	 on		 7	 March	 2006	 and	 is	 now	 that	 of	 a	 non-executive	 Chairman.	 The	 Board	 comprises	 eight	 directors:	 three	 executives	 and	 five	 non-executives,	 of	 which	 four	 are	 deemed	 to	 be	 independent	 under	 The	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	 Governance.
Investor Relations
In	 the	 course	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 process	 during	 2005,	 and	 so	 as	 to	 keep	 the	 then	 current	 and	 potential	 investors	 informed	 of	 the	 progress	 of	 the	 business,	 we	 undertook	 four	 investor	 roadshows		 in	 both	 the	 UK	 and	 US,	 supplemented	 by	 formal	 investor	 presentations	 and	 a	 number	 of	 written	 communications.	 The	 benefits	 flowing	 from	 the		 high	 quality	 relationships	 developed	 with	 our	 then	 investor	 base	 have	 not	 been	 lost	 on	 the	 Board.	 Inevitably,	 since	 the	 Listing	 last	 December,	 there	 has	 been	 a	 material	 change	 in	 the	 composition	 of	 our	 shareholder	 register.	 We	 intend	 to	 maintain	 and	 develop	 the	 high	 standards	 for	 investor	 relations	 that	 we	 set	 ourselves	 in	 2005.	 To	 this	 end	 we	 already	 have	 plans	 in	 place	 to	 meet	 our	 current	 major	 investors	 during	 March	 2006.
Our People
The	 sustained	 commitment	 and	 dedication	 of	 all	 our	 employees	 has	 been	 a	 crucial	 part	 of	 our	 success	 over	 the	 last	 three	 years.	 The	 old	 and	 new	 skills	 brought	 to	 Drax	 combined	 as	 one	 team	 and	 their	 efforts	 against	 the	 backdrop	 of	 improving	 markets	 has	 seen	 the	 business	 develop	 strongly.	 Our	 people	 at	 Drax	 rose	 to	 the	 new	 challenges	 and	 opportunities	 posed	 by	 the	 impending	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.	 I	 should	 like	 to	 thank	 all	 of	 them	 for	 their	 contribution,	 flexibility	 and	 enthusiasm	 in	 what	 proved	 to	 be	 an	 eventful	 and	 successful	 year.

Chief Executive’s  
Statement
Dorothy Thompson
Chief	 Executive
Introduction
In	 2005,	 commodity	 market	 developments	 dominated	 the	 UK	 energy	 landscape.	 Energy	 commodity	 prices	 have	 been	 strong,	 led	 by	 the	 price	 of	 crude	 oil.	 Natural	 gas	 prices	 were	 particularly	 high	 towards	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year,	 influenced	 by	 oil	 and	 a	 tighter	 demand/supply	 balance	 as	 the	 UK	 moved	 to	 a	 greater	 reliance	 on	 imported	 gas.	 High	 gas	 prices	 have	 meant	 that	 gas-fired	 generation	 became	 the	 principal	 price-
setting	 plant	 in	 the	 power	 market	 and	 had	 a	 strong	 upward	 influence	 on	 the	 power	 price.	 The	 year		 also	 saw	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 EU	 Emissions	 Trading	 Scheme	 with	 carbon	 becoming	 a	 traded	 commodity	 and	 a	 new	 cost	 to	 fossil	 fuelled	 	 power	 plant,	 so	 also	 influencing	 the	 price	 of	 	 power	 upwards.
Against	 this	 background	 of	 strong	 commodity	 markets,	 Drax	 began	 to	 realise	 some	 early	 returns	 from	 investments	 in	 plant	 management	 and	 maintenance.	 The	 improvement	 of	 plant	 performance	 compared	 to	 2004	 was	 very	 positive	 and	 directly	 translated	 into	 improved	 safety,	 availability	 and	 reliability.
Energy Sales and Other Income
In	 the	 year,	 Drax	 Power	 made	 net	 sales	 of	 23.2TWh	 (2004:	 22.9TWh)	 of	 electricity	 at	 an	 average	 capture	 price	 of	 £33.9/MWh	 (2004:	 £22.5/MWh).	 The	 capture	 price	 achieved	 reflects	 the	 impact	 of	 power	 sold	 forward	 in	 2003	 and	 2004	 for	 delivery	 in	 2005,	 as	 well	 as	 market	 prices	 prevailing	 in	 2005.	 Power	 prices	 rose	 significantly	 during	 2005	 as	 reflected	 in	 the	 Drax	 capture	 price.	 For	 example,	 the	 price	 of	 the	 forward	 contract	 for	 power	 delivered		 in	 the	 six	 months	 starting	 October	 2005	 rose	 49%	 between	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year	 and	 the	 start	 	 of	 delivery	 in	 October.	 Drax	 makes	 sales	 of	 other	 products	 and	 services	 as	 well	 as	 contracted	 power.	 These	 include	 ancillary	 services	 provided	 to	 the	 national	 grid,	 Renewables	 Obligation	 Certificates	 (ROCs),	 Levy	 Exemption	 Certificates	 (LECs),	 Sulphur	 Emissions	 Allowances	 and	 marketable	 by-products	 from	 our	 generating	 activities,	 namely	 ash	 and	 gypsum.	 In	 2005,	 these	 activities	 generated	 net	 sales	 of	 £32m.
Fuel Procurement
Coal Drax	 burnt	 approximately	 9.3	 million	 tonnes	 of	 coal	 in	 2005,	 with	 around	 60%	 being	 sourced	 from	 the	 UK	 and	 40%	 internationally.	 During	 2005,	 we	 paid	 an	 average	 price	 of	 £37 .3/tonne	 (2004:	 £32.7/tonne)	 for	 our	 coal,	 including	 the	 cost	 of	 delivery	 to	 the	 power	 station.	 International	 coal	 prices	 fell	 from	 	 a	 peak	 of	 US$75/tonne	 early	 in	 the	 year	 to	 about	 	 US$54/tonne	 at	 the	 close.	 To	 increase	 our	 flexibility	 to	 import	 coal	 we	 increased	 our	 contracted	 port	 capacity	 in	 2005.	 	 We	 have	 also	 worked	 with	 our	 rail	 freight	 suppliers	 to	 improve	 logistics	 between	 the	 ports	 and	 mines	 from	 which	 our	 coal	 is	 delivered.
Biomass – Naturally Grow N Fuel As	 well	 as	 coal,	 Drax	 burns	 renewable	 biomass	 material	 which	 has	 the	 twin	 benefits		 of	 reducing	 CO
2
	 emissions	 and	 providing	 an	 additional	 revenue	 source	 through	 the	 sales	 of	 ROCs	 and	 LECs.	 During	 2005	 we	 burnt	 over	 230,000	 tonnes	 of	 biomass	 compared	 with	 95,000	 tonnes	 in	 2004.	 We	 	 made	 significant	 progress	 during	 the	 year	 in	 the	 development	 of	 energy	 crops	 to	 be	 grown	 by	 local	 farmers.	 Contracts	 are	 being	 arranged	 to	 grow	 and	 to	 deliver	 energy	 crops	 over	 the	 next	 decade.	 Work	 continues	 to	 source	 additional	 energy	 crops	 and	 other	 cost	 effective	 biomass.
e missio Ns 
On	 1	 January	 2005	 the	 EU	 Emissions	 Trading	 Scheme	 in	 respect	 of	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 was	 implemented.	 Phase	 I	 of	 the	 scheme	 covers	 2005–
2007	 and	 Phase	 II	 will	 cover	 2008–2012.	 Drax	 has	 an	 annual	 allocation	 granted	 by	 the	 UK	 Government	 	 of	 14.55	 million	 tonnes	 of	 allowances	 in	 Phase	 I.	 In	 2005	 we	 purchased	 a	 further	 6.3	 million	 tonnes	 of	 allowances	 as	 power	 was	 generated	 at	 volumes	 beyond	 those	 supported	 by	 the	 allocation.	 Carbon	 prices	 rose	 through	 2005,	 opening	 the	 year	 at	 around	 €8/tonne	 and	 closing	 at	 over	 €20/tonne.	 In	 October	 2005,	 new	 Integrated	 Pollution	 Prevention	 and	 Control	 regulations	 were	 implemented	 which	 allow	 the	 trading	 of	 allowances	 for	 certain	 emissions	 including	 SO

.	 Drax’s	 allocation	 of	 SO

	 and	 NO
X
	 allowances	 for	 2005	 were	 sufficient	 to	 cover	 generation.	 No	 purchases	 were	 required.	 Indeed,	 as	 Drax	 is	 fully	 equipped	 with	 flue	 gas	 desulphurisation,	 optimisation	 of	 emissions	 has	 resulted	 in	 tradeable	 surplus	 SO 2	 allowances.	 In	 2005,	 Drax	 completed	 	 the	 first	 SO 2	 trade	 and	 continues	 to	 transact	 in	 	 the	 market.

The	 trading	 function	 covers	 all	 the	 commodity	 aspects	 of	 our	 operations	 including	 power,	 	 fuel,	 CO

	 emissions	 allowances,	 renewable	 generation	 incentives,	 and	 grid	 services.	 The	 principal	 objectives	 of	 our	 trading	 strategy	 are	 to	 optimise	 the	 physical	 inputs	 and	 outputs	 of	 the	 plant,	 and	 to	 enhance	 the	 value	 of	 the	 business	 while	 delivering	 some	 stability	 in	 value	 through	 commodity	 price	 cycles.	 An	 important	 aspect	 of	 capturing	 value	 is	 exploiting	 the	 optionality	 of	 the	 power	 plant	 through	 its	 flexibility.	 In	 the	 short	 term,	 our	 trading	 strategy	 focuses		 on	 ensuring	 that	 our	 output	 is	 sold,	 in	 a	 way	 that	 	 adds	 value	 to	 market	 prices,	 for	 each	 period	 where	 market	 prices	 exceed	 our	 marginal	 cost	 of	 production.	 In	 the	 liquid	 forward	 power	 market,	 which	 generally	 trades	 over	 two	 Winter	 and	 two	 Summer	 seasons,	 our	 objective	 is	 to	 capture	 better	 than	 market	 power	 prices	 whilst	 making	 steady	 sales	 across	 a	 range	 of	 counterparties	 and	 hedging	 the	 related	 coal	 and	 CO

	 emissions	 allowances	 requirements	 of	 the	 power	 sales.	 In	 the	 medium	 to	 long	 term	 our	 objective	 is	 to	 transact	 deals,	 at	 attractive	 prices,	 that	 provide	 a	 hedge	 to	 the	 business.	 We	 transacted	 several	 structured	 deals	 in	 2005	 which	 combined	 sales	 	 of	 power	 with	 purchases	 of	 coal	 and,	 in	 some	 instances,	 carbon	 on	 a	 forward	 basis	 for	 up	 to	 	 two	 years.	 Drax’s	 access	 to	 commodity	 markets	 was	 greatly	 constrained	 during	 the	 year	 by	 the	 relatively	 poor	 credit	 status	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Limited,	 the	 trading	 counterparty.	 This	 was	 a	 result	 of	 the	 high	 leverage	 of	 the	 Drax	 Group.	 On	 the	 Refinancing	 of	 the	 Group	 on	 15	 December	 2005,	 the	 credit	 status	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 was	 greatly	 improved	 as	 reflected	 in	 the	 investment	 grade	 rating	 granted	 to	 the	 entity	 by	 Standard	 &	 Poor’s.

Healt H a Nd s a Fety Health	 and	 safety	 remains	 our	 highest	 priority.	 	 The	 year	 2005	 was	 the	 first	 full	 year	 operating	 the	 DuPont™	 STOP™	 behaviour	 based	 safety	 system	 which	 we	 have	 implemented	 as	 a	 vehicle	 to	 deliver	 a	 step	 change	 in	 safety	 culture.	 In	 addition	 we	 have	 focused	 on	 developing	 simple	 and	 clear	 systems,	 improved	 communication,	 detailed	 safety	 incident	 reporting	 and	 follow-up,	 and	 we	 have	 introduced	 weekly	 safety	 meetings	 for	 all	 operational	 staff.	 The	 contractor	 interface	 has	 been	 strengthened	 with	 a	 dedicated	 team	 from	 Drax.	 Overall,	 recordable	 personal	 injury	 rates	 have	 reduced	 by	 39%	 	 compared	 to	 2004.	 l oad Fa Ctor a Nd a vaila Bility The	 plant	 load	 factor	 for	 the	 year	 was	 73.9%	 before	 net	 power	 purchases	 (2004:	 69.1%	 after	 net	 power	 purchases)	 with	 an	 availability	 of	 87 .2%	 (2004:	 81.3%).	 We	 only	 seek	 to	 generate	 electricity	 when	 it	 is	 profitable	 to	 do	 so.	 Thus	 we	 target	 profitability	 rather	 than	 production	 volumes.	 A	 key	 performance	 metric	 for	 the	 plant	 is	 availability.	 Last	 year	 saw	 improvements	 in	 both	 the	 planned	 and	 forced	 outage	 rates,	 with	 a	 strong	 downward	 trend	 in	 forced	 outage	 rate	 over	 the	 four	 quarters	 of	 2005,	 resulting	 in	 the	 best	 full	 year	 performance	 since	 1997 .	 The	 forced	 outage	 reduction	 programme	 has	 included	 the	 establishment	 of	 cross	 functional	 reliability	 teams	 focused	 on	 specific	 plant	 areas	 in	 the	 first	 quarter	 of	 2005	 and	 the	 adoption	 of	 data	 driven	 processes	 to	 analyse	 historic	 failures	 to	 deliver	 improvements	 in	 reliability.	 For	 planned	 outages,	 a	 milestone	 planning	 process	 has	 been	 implemented	 and	 has	 already	 resulted	 in	 some	 performance	 improvements.	 An	 integrated	 Drax/

To	 meet	 the	 2008	 Large	 Combustion	 Plant	 Directive	 (“LCPD”)	 requirements	 for	 oxides	 of	 nitrogen	 emissions	 standards	 we	 have	 a	 programme	 to	 install	 Boosted	 Over	 Fire	 Air	 (“BOFA”)	 equipment	 on	 each	 of	 the	 six	 units.	 During	 2005,	 two	 units	 have	 had	 BOFA	 installed;	 one	 of	 the	 units	 has	 been	 commissioned	 and	 has	 successfully	 completed	 all	 of	 its	 performance	 tests,	 meeting	 in	 full	 the	 design	 specification.	 Construction	 will	 start	 in	 2006	 to	 install	 BOFA	 systems	 on	 the	 remaining	 four	 units		 in	 time	 for	 the	 2008	 change.	 New	 process	 	 control	 systems,	 together	 with	 BOFA	 and	 new	 instrumentation,	 designed	 to	 deliver	 continuous	 emissions	 monitoring	 across	 the	 units,	 will	 ensure	 compliance	 with	 LCPD	 limits	 for	 oxides	 of	 sulphur	 and	 nitrogen,	 and	 particulates.

Outlook	 The	 Refinancing	 of	 the	 Group	 together	 with	 the	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 transformed	 the	 capital	 structure	 of	 Drax.	 The	 new	 capital	 structure	 enables	 us	 to	 align	 the	 operational,	 trading	 and	 financial	 strategies	 of	 the	 business	 to	 deliver	 greater	 shareholder	 value.	 The	 focus	 going	 forward	 is	 to	 deliver	 this	 value.	 Key	 to	 the	 success	 of	 the	 delivery	 will	 be	 the	 sustained	 performance	 of	 the	 Drax	 team	 to	 improve	 on	 the	 good	 results	 achieved	 in	 2005.	 We	 will	 continue	 to	 invest	 in	 the	 development	 of	 our	 staff	 with	 a	 keen	 focus	 on	 the	 performance	 culture	 that	 is	 now	 well	 established.	 Within	 the	 business	 work	 will	 continue	 on	 improving	 plant	 performance	 and	 seeking	 areas	 to	 enhance	 the	 business	 by	 further	 developing	 fuel	 and	 product	 optionality.	 There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 EBITDA	 enhancement	 projects	 which	 we	 identified	 in	 2005	 which	 we	 will	 aim	 to	 deliver	 in	 2006	 and	 2007 .	 In	 addition,	 the	 improvement	 in	 credit	 status	 has	 significantly	 enhanced	 our	 ability	 to	 trade	 in	 the	 power,	 coal	 and	 carbon	 markets.	 It	 has	 provided	 access	 to	 greater	 depth	 and	 tenor	 in	 all	 of	 these	 markets.	 Our	 strategy	 is	 to	 extend	 our	 forward	 contracts	 whilst	 retaining	 a	 significant	 exposure	 to	 the	 commodity	 markets	 in	 order	 to	 exploit	 the	 full	 value	 of	 the	 optionality	 of	 the	 power	 plant	 and	 the	 expertise	 of	 the	 Drax	 trading	 team.	 As	 at	 3	 March	 2006,	 Drax	 had	 contracted	 75%		 of	 expected	 2006	 output	 at	 an	 average	 price	 of	 	 £46.9/MWh,	 and	 47%	 of	 expected	 2007	 output	 	 at	 an	 average	 price	 of	 £49.2/MWh.	 Corresponding	 fixed	 price	 coal	 and	 carbon	 have	 been	 secured	 	 to	 underpin	 these	 sales.	 Overall	 our	 volume	 of	 forward	 power	 sales	 has	 grown	 by	 over	 49%	 in	 	 the	 1 1	 weeks	 from	 15	 December	 2005	 to	 3	 March	 2006	 reflecting	 both	 our	 increased	 credit	 capacity	 	 and	 counterparty	 interest.	 Given	 current	 trading	 expectations	 and	 the	 continued	 development	 of	 our	 hedge	 position	 coupled	 with	 effective	 cash	 management,	 	 we	 expect	 during	 2006	 to	 start	 to	 deliver	 on	 our	 commitment	 to	 return	 surplus	 cash	 to	 our	 shareholders.
We	 will	 remain	 active	 in	 the	 regulatory	 debate.	 	 We	 believe	 coal	 is	 critical	 to	 the	 UK	 energy	 mix	 going	 forward	 if	 the	 Government	 is	 to	 achieve	 	 its	 objectives	 of	 delivering	 security	 of	 supply,	 affordability	 and	 tackling	 climate	 change	 where	 burning	 biomass	 with	 coal	 has	 much	 to	 contribute.	 We	 will	 be	 seeking	 clarity,	 coherence	 and	 consistency	 of	 Government	 policy	 and	 an	 equal	 treatment	 of	 biomass	 co-fired	 generation	 with	 other	 renewable	 energy.

Co-firing	 renewable	 biomass	 materials	 with	 coal	 in	 our	 existing	 boilers	 is	 already	 delivering	 significant	 savings	 in	 emissions	 of	 CO
2
,	 and,	 but,	 given	 the	 right	 energy	 policy	 framework,	 it	 could	 deliver	 much	 more.
Fuel	 diversity	 projects	 include	 petroleum	 coke	 (“petcoke”)	 and	 biomass.	 Drax	 has	 invested	 in	 petcoke	 handling	 and	 blending	 facilities	 during	 the	 year	 and	 commenced	 an	 18	 month	 trial	 burn	 on	 one	 unit	 in	 June	 2005.	 Air	 quality	 monitoring,	 both	 before	 and	 during	 the	 trial,	 has	 shown	 that	 there	 has	 been	 no	 material	 increase	 in	 pollutants	 measured.	 We	 expect	 to	 apply	 for	 a	 licence	 for	 commercial	 burn	 commencing	 in	 2007 .	 Although	 the	 early	 results	 from	 the	 trials	 are	 encouraging,	 there	 can	 be	 no	 guarantee	 that	 permission	 to	 burn	 petcoke	 in	 some	 or	 all	 of	 the	 units	 will	 be	 granted.		 A	 biomass	 “direct	 injection”	 system	 was	 installed	 	 on	 one	 unit	 during	 August	 2005	 and	 has	 proved	 	 to	 be	 an	 effective	 way	 of	 delivering	 larger	 volumes	 of	 prepared	 biomass	 to	 the	 boiler	 than	 is	 possible	 through	 the	 coal	 pulverising	 mills.	 Drax	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 install,	 at	 modest	 cost,	 such	 a	 system	 	 on	 each	 unit,	 should	 the	 investment	 criteria	 be	 met.
Forced	 outage	 rate	 support	 has	 involved	 selective	 investment	 in	 boiler	 parts	 and	 tubes,	 milling	 equipment,	 flue	 gas	 desulphurisation	 plant,	 conveyors,	 common	 plant	 equipment	 and	 infrastructure	 and	 strategic	 spares,	 as	 part	 of	 the	 programme	 to	 drive	 down	 forced	 outage	 rates	 	 to	 the	 levels	 achieved	 in	 the	 early	 1990s.
Drax	 recognises	 the	 potential	 to	 improve	 operating	 and	 thermal	 efficiency	 leading	 to	 reduced	 fuel	 costs	 and	 emission	 rates.	 Examples	 of	 work	 undertaken	 in	 2005	 are	 investment	 in	 the	 flue	 gas	 desulphurisation	 facility	 to	 improve	 scrubbing	 efficiency	 and	 a	 project	 to	 improve	 boiler	 heat	 transfer	 when	 burning	 imported	 coal.	 Drax	 is	 also	 exploring	 several	 turbine	 enhancements	 and	 feed	 system	 upgrades	 with	 the	 objective	 of	 further	 improving	 efficiency	 and	 reducing	 consumption.

Drax	 Group	 plc	 	 is	 the	 ultimate	 holding	 company	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Limited,	 the	 owner	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Station.
The	 principal	 activity	 of	 Drax	 is	 the	 operation	 of	 the	 power	 station	 and	 the	 trading	 of	 the	 electricity	 it	 produces.	 Drax	 is	 the	 largest	 coal-fired	 power	 station	 in	 the	 UK,	 with	 a	 nominal	 capacity	 of	 3,960MW	 and		 a	 registered	 generating	 capacity	 of	 3,870MW.	 All	 electricity	 generated	 is	 sold	 in	 the	 wholesale	 market,	 through	 the	 balancing	 mechanism	 or	 used	 by	 the	 power	 station.	 Fuel	 is	 purchased	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 UK	 and	 international	 sources.	 CO

	 emissions	 allowances	 required	 by	 the	 Group	 in	 excess	 of	 its	 allocation		 under	 the	 UK	 National	 Allocation	 Plan	 (the	 “UK	 NAP”)	 are	 also	 purchased	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 UK	 and	 international	 sources.
For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 Drax	 produced	 an	 EBITDA	 of	 £239m	 and	 an	 operating	 profit	 of	 £354m	 (including	 exceptional	 items	 and	 unrealised	 losses	 on	 derivative	 contracts	 which	 together	 improved	 operating	 profit	 by	 £146m).	 	 For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004,	 EBITDA	 	 was	 £90m	 and	 operating	 profit	 was	 £55m.
Results of Operations
Drax	 Group’s	 revenues	 from	 generation	 during	 	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 were	 £849m,	 compared	 to	 £549m	 during	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2004,	 an	 increase	 of	 £300m	 (or	 55%).	 This	 increase	 was	 mainly	 due	 to	 increases	 in	 average	 electricity	 capture	 prices	 over	 the	 period.

Reflecting	 the	 above	 factors,	 Drax’s	 gross	 margin,	 being	 revenues	 less	 fuel	 costs,	 increased	 from	 	 £239m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 to	 £389m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 an	 increase	 of	 £150m	 (or	 63%).
Drax’s	 other	 operating	 expenses	 excluding	 depreciation,	 amortisation	 and	 exceptional	 items,	 were	 broadly	 flat	 at	 £152m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 and	 £150m	 in	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2005.
EBITDA	 (defined	 as	 profit	 before	 interest,	 tax,	 depreciation,	 amortisation,	 exceptional	 items		 and	 unrealised	 losses	 on	 derivative	 contracts)	 was	 £239m	 in	 2005	 which	 was	 £149m	 higher	 than	 for	 2004.	 The	 improvement	 in	 EBITDA	 reflected	 the	 improvement	 in	 gross	 margin.
Depreciation	 and	 amortisation	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005	 was	 £4m	 lower	 at	 £31m	 compared	 with	 the	 same	 period	 in	 2004.	 The	 depreciation	 and	 amortisation	 charge	 for	 2004	 included	 £2m	 in	 respect	 of	 losses	 on	 disposal	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment.

The	 out-of-the-money	 position	 mainly	 reflects	 prices	 in	 Drax’s	 forward	 sales	 contracts	 for	 power	 against	 rising	 market	 prices	 for	 power.	 For	 the	 period	 from	 1	 January	 2005	 to	 30	 June	 2005,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 these	 contracts	 were	 reflected	 directly	 in	 the	 income	 statement,		 as	 appropriate	 hedge	 accounting	 documentation	 had	 not	 been	 put	 in	 place.	 This	 resulted	 in	 an	 expense	 of	 £1 17m	 relating	 to	 unrealised	 losses	 	 on	 derivative	 contracts	 being	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 for	 2005.
For	 the	 purposes	 of	 IAS	 39,	 from	 1	 July	 2005,	 	 the	 Group	 has	 put	 in	 place	 appropriate	 hedge	 accounting	 documentation	 to	 enable	 it	 to	 achieve	 hedge	 accounting	 for	 a	 large	 proportion	 of	 its	 commodity	 contracts.	 As	 a	 result,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 contracts	 which	 are	 now	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges	 are	 recognised	 through	 the	 hedge	 reserve	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 Reflecting	 the	 above	 factors,	 Drax’s	 operating		 profit	 increased	 from	 £55m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2004	 to	 £354m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005,	 an	 increase	 of	 £299m.	 Operating	 profit	 for	 2005	 includes	 exceptional	 operating	 income	 of	 £263m	 and	 unrealised	 	 losses	 on	 derivative	 contracts	 of	 £1 17m	 as	 	 described	 above.	 Interest	 payable	 and	 similar	 charges	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 were	 £1 14m,	 compared	 to	 £101m	 in	 the	 same	 period	 in	 2004,	 an	 increase	 of	 £13m	 (or	 13%).	 The	 increase	 reflects	 a	 reduction	 in	 interest	 payable	 on	 borrowings,	 principally	 as	 a	 result	 of	 repayments	 of	 the	 Group’s	 B	 Debt	 prior	 to	 15	 December	 2005	 following	 receipts	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim,	 offset	 by	 a	 charge	 of	 £23m	 resulting	 from	 the	 termination	 of	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.
Interest	 receivable	 of	 £24m	 in	 the	 year	 ended		 31	 December	 2005	 includes	 a	 credit	 of	 £18m	 in	 respect	 of	 previously	 recognised	 unrealised	 losses	 on	 terminated	 swap	 contracts,	 accounted	 for	 under	 IAS	 39	 from	 1	 January	 2005.
Drax’s	 tax	 credit	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 was	 £19m,	 compared	 to	 a	 tax	 credit	 of	 £35m	 for	 the	 comparable	 period	 in	 2004.	 The	 tax	 credit	 	 in	 2005	 reflects	 the	 utilisation	 of	 tax	 losses	 brought	 forward	 from	 earlier	 years,	 which	 more	 than	 offsets	 the	 profit	 before	 tax	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 tax	 credit	 for	 2004	 reflects	 the	 loss	 for	 the	 year	 and	 the	 tax	 effect	 of	 the	 financing	 structure.
Reflecting	 the	 above	 factors,	 Drax	 had	 a	 profit	 	 for	 the	 year	 from	 continuing	 operations	 of	 	 £282m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 a	 loss	 of	 £7m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2004.
Key Factors Affecting the Business
The	 profitability	 of	 Drax	 is	 determined	 by	 certain	 primary	 drivers:	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 price	 	 of	 electricity	 available	 in	 the	 market	 and	 the	 cost	 	 of	 generation;	 and	 the	 availability	 of	 the	 six	 independent	 generating	 units	 which	 comprise	 the	 power	 station.	 The	 cost	 of	 generation	 includes	 the	 cost	 of	 coal	 (or	 other	 fuel),	 the	 cost	 of	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances,	 and	 operating	 and	 maintenance	 costs.	 During	 the	 period	 under	 review,	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 condition	 and	 results	 of	 operations	 were	 significantly	 impacted	 by	 a	 financial	 restructuring	 effective	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 (the	 “Refinancing	 and	 Listing”)	 and	 receipt	 of	 distributions	 from	 the	 Administrators	 of	 TXU	 Europe	 Energy	 Trading	 Limited	 and	 TXU	 Europe	 Group	 plc.	 p ri Ce o F e le Ctri City The	 price	 that	 Drax	 realises	 when	 it	 sells	 electricity	 is	 critical	 to	 its	 results	 from	 operations.	 Drax	 sells	 all	 of	 the	 electricity	 it	 generates	 into	 the	 physical	 power	 market	 for	 Great	 Britain.	 Drax	 trades	 mainly	 in	 the	 wholesale	 market,	 through	 a	 mixture	 of	 deals	 consistent	 with	 Drax’s	 hedging	 strategy,	 including	 medium-term	 bilateral	 power	 sales	 (6–12	 months),	 structured	 deals	 and	 short-term	 deals.	 The	 hedging	 strategy	 recognises	 market	 limitations,	 alongside	 balance	 of	 certainty	 and	 returns.	 The	 table	 below	 illustrates	 the	 average	 capture	 price	 Drax	 realised	 on	 a	 calendar	 year	 basis	 together	 with	 the	 market	 closing	 price	 for	 each	 season:

Electricity	 prices	 are	 volatile,	 for	 example	 the	 wholesale	 electricity	 price	 for	 power	 to	 be	 delivered	 in	 Winter	 2005/06	 ranged	 from	 	 £18.1/MWh	 in	 April	 2002	 to	 £67 .0/MWh	 in	 July	 2005,	 driven	 principally	 by	 increases	 in	 fuel	 costs	 for	 gas-
fired	 generators,	 a	 narrowing	 of	 the	 UK’s	 generation	 margin	 and	 upward	 pressure	 from	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 EU	 Emissions	 Trading	 Scheme	 (the	 “EU	 ETS”)	 in	 January	 2005,	 which	 requires	 that	 fossil	 fuelled	 generators	 purchase	 sufficient	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 to	 meet	 any	 excess	 over	 their	 allocation	 under	 the	 UK	 NAP .
Drax’s	 average	 capture	 price	 rose	 from	 £22.5/MWh	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 to	 £33.9/MWh	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005.	 The	 forward	 base	 load	 power	 prices	 for	 Summer	 2006,	 Winter	 2006/07	 and	 Summer	 2007	 were	 approximately	 £42.1/MWh,	 £59.7/MWh	 and	 £42.9/MWh	 respectively	 as	 at	 3	 March	 2006.	 Peak	 and	 extended	 peak	 prices	 are	 generally	 significantly	 higher	 than	 baseload	 prices	 in	 the	 UK	 market,	 whilst	 off-peak	 prices	 are	 generally	 significantly	 lower.	 p ri Ce o F Coal Coal	 costs	 make	 up	 the	 majority	 of	 Drax’s	 fuel	 costs	 and	 significantly	 impact	 its	 results	 from	 operations.	 Drax	 burnt	 approximately	 9.3	 million	 tonnes	 of	 coal	 in	 2005	 and	 approximately	 9.2	 million	 tonnes	 in	 2004,	 purchased	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 sources	 on	 either	 fixed	 or	 variable	 priced	 contracts	 with	 different	 maturities.	 Currently	 the	 mix	 is	 broadly	 as	 follows:	 4	 million	 tonnes	 from	 UK	 Coal	 Mining	 Limited	 (“UK	 Coal”),	 1.5	 to	 2	 million	 tonnes	 of	 Scottish	 coal	 and	 3.5	 to	 4	 million	 tonnes	 from	 international	 suppliers.
	 Operating	 and	 Financial	 Review
  Drax Group plc 	 	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2005 Drax	 experiences	 less	 volatility	 in	 the	 UK	 coal	 market	 than	 in	 the	 power	 market	 as	 Drax	 typically	 enters	 into	 long-term	 supply	 contracts	 with	 UK	 suppliers,	 including	 UK	 Coal,	 and	 can	 leverage	 its	 buying	 power.	 Internationally	 sourced	 coal	 comes	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 countries	 including	 Russia,	 South	 Africa	 and	 Colombia	 and	 requires	 shipping,	 port	 and	 rail	 transport.	 Spot	 prices	 for	 internationally	 traded	 coal	 delivered	 into	 North-West	 Europe	 (as	 reflected	 by	 the	 TFS	 API	 2	 index)	 are	 volatile.	 For	 example,	 prices	 per	 tonne	 rose	 from	 US$65	 at	 the	 end	 of	 March	 2004	 to	 US$79	 at	 the	 end	 of	 June	 2004,	 but	 had	 fallen	 back	 to	 US$54	 at	 the	 end	 of	 December	 2005.
	 A	 five-year	 fixed	 price	 supply	 contract	 with	 UK	 	 Coal,	 the	 First	 Coal	 Supply	 Agreement,	 expires	 on	 	 31	 March	 2006.	 Drax	 signed	 heads	 of	 terms	 on	 16	 July	 2004	 for	 a	 Second	 Coal	 Supply	 Agreement,	 	 a	 five-year,	 semi-fixed	 price	 contract	 effective	 from	 January	 2005	 to	 December	 2009	 for	 500,000	 tonnes	 in	 2005	 and	 3	 to	 4	 million	 tonnes	 per	 annum	 thereafter,	 to	 run	 concurrently	 with	 the	 First	 Coal	 Supply	 Agreement	 until	 its	 expiry	 on	 31	 March	 2006.	 A	 dispute	 arose	 between	 Drax	 and	 UK	 Coal	 concerning	 its	 difficulties	 in	 satisfying	 the	 terms	 	 of	 the	 First	 Coal	 Supply	 Agreement,	 which	 was	 subsequently	 settled	 on	 1 1	 August	 2005	 by	 way	 	 of	 an	 amendment	 agreement.	 The	 terms	 of	 the	 amendment	 include	 that	 UK	 Coal	 will	 deliver	 any	 shortfalls	 in	 supply	 of	 coal	 to	 Drax	 under	 either	 the	 First	 or	 Second	 Coal	 Supply	 Agreement	 by	 certain	 agreed	 dates	 at	 agreed	 prices,	 which	 are	 below	 the	 international	 coal	 price.
o uta Ges a Nd p la Nt u tilisatio N l evels The	 maximum	 theoretical	 amount	 of	 electricity	 that	 Drax	 can	 sell	 is	 directly	 related	 to	 the	 output	 	 of	 the	 plant;	 the	 principal	 limitation	 to	 the	 plant’s	 output	 is	 the	 number	 and	 duration	 of	 outages.
Electrical	 output	 is	 measured	 by	 means	 of	 reference	 to	 the	 load	 factor	 of	 the	 power	 station,	 which	 is	 the	 ratio	 of	 the	 actual	 output	 to	 the	 maximum	 possible	 output	 over	 a	 period	 of	 time.	 In	 general,	 the	 plant	 will	 generate	 if	 available	 and	 if	 the	 market	 price	 for	 electricity	 in	 the	 running	 period	 is	 greater	 than	 the	 marginal	 cost	 of	 production.	 Thus,	 the	 load	 factor	 	 of	 the	 plant	 will	 be	 constrained	 by	 plant	 availability	 (for	 example,	 there	 would	 be	 lower	 availability	 if	 there	 were	 higher	 plant	 forced	 outages)	 and	 marginal	 costs	 of	 generation	 compared	 with	 market	 prices	 for	 electricity.	 The	 following	 table	 illustrates	 Drax’s	 load	 factor	 and	 electrical	 output	 for	 2005	 and	 2004:
	 Years	 ended	 	 31	 December
	 	 	 	 2005	 2004
Load	 factor	 (1)
	 	 %	 73.9	 69.1
Electrical	 output	 (net	 sales)	 TWh	 23.2	 22.9
(1)		 The	 load	 factor	 for	 2005	 represents	 gross	 merchant	 sales	 before	 net	 power	 purchases	 in	 the	 balancing	 mechanism	 divided	 by	 the	 maximum	 theoretical	 generation	 of	 the	 plant.	 The	 load	 factor	 for	 2004	 represents	 gross	 merchant	 sales	 after	 net	 power	 purchases	 in	 the	 balancing	 mechanism	 divided	 by	 the	 maximum	 theoretical	 generation	 of	 the	 plant.	 The	 load	 factor	 for	 2005	 after	 net	 power	 purchases	 was	 70.1%.
The	 forced	 outage	 rate	 relates	 to	 the	 time	 taken	 to	 repair	 equipment	 failures	 which	 have	 caused	 loss	 	 of	 availability	 or	 a	 decrease	 in	 output	 of	 a	 process	 plant	 item.	 The	 planned	 outage	 rate	 covers	 planned	 events	 for	 outages	 and	 major	 repairs	 	 and	 renewals.
The	 following	 table	 illustrates	 Drax’s	 outage	 rates	 and	 availability	 for	 2005	 and	 2004:
	 Years	 ended	 	 31	 December
	 	 	 	 2005	 2004
Planned	 outage	 rate	 (1)
		 %	 7.1	 7.8
Forced	 outage	 rate	 (2)
	 	 %	 6.1	 11.8
Total	 outage	 rate	 	 %	 12.8	 18.7
Availability	 	 %	 87.2	 81.3
(1)		 The	 planned	 outage	 rate	 is	 expressed	 as	 a	 percentage	 of	 registered	 capacity.	 Therefore,	 the	 aggregate	 of	 the	 forced	 outage	 rate	 and	 planned	 outage	 rate	 will	 not	 equate	 to	 the	 total	 outage	 rate.	 (2)		 The	 forced	 outage	 rate	 is	 expressed	 as	 a	 percentage	 of	 planned	 capacity	 available	 (that	 is,	 this	 includes	 a	 reduction	 for	 planned	 losses).	 Drax’s	 maintenance	 regime	 includes	 a	 major	 planned	 outage	 for	 each	 unit	 every	 four	 years.	 Consequently,	 there	 is	 an	 irregular	 pattern	 of	 planned	 outages	 and	 associated	 expenditure,	 since	 in	 two	 of	 the	 four	 years,	 two	 units	 will	 undergo	 a	 major	 outage.	 During	 2005,	 although	 interim	 header	 replacement	 outages	 on	 two	 units	 were	 completed	 ten	 days	 ahead	 of	 schedule,	 the	 major	 planned	 outage	 on	 unit	 6	 overran	 by	 17	 days	 due	 to	 bearing	 failures	 on	 start-up.	 2004	 included	 two	 major	 planned	 outages.	 The	 lost	 generation	 opportunity	 in	 2005	 from	 forced	 outages	 was	 1.9TWh,	 compared	 to	 3.6TWh	 in	 2004,	 resulting	 in	 a	 forced	 outage	 rate	 of	 6.1%	 compared	 to	 1 1.8%	 in	 2004.	 Management	 have	 targeted	 further	 improvements	 in	 forced	 outage	 rates	 by	 focusing	 on	 preventing	 minor	 predictable	 failures	 and	 seeking	 to	 avoid	 major	 failures	 using	 historical	 Drax	 operating	 data	 together	 with	 original	 equipment	 manufacturer	 and	 industry	 experience.	 In	 2005,	 progress	 was	 made	 in	 both	 areas	 with	 minor	 predictable	 failures	 falling	 from	 6.7%	 in	 2004	 to	 5.2%	 and	 major	 failures	 from	 5.1%	 to	 0.9%.	 Drax	 management	 believe	 further	 progress	 can	 be	 made	 and	 will	 continue	 the	 programmes	 initiated	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2004.	 These	 programmes	 include:	 improved	 inspection	 and	 equipment	 monitoring;	 better	 quality	 repairs;	 equipment	 upgrades;	 and	 the	 improved	 provision	 of	 critical	 spares.	 In	 addition,	 Drax	 aims	 to	 achieve	 stable	 operations	 through	 improved	 maintenance	 practices	 and	 by	 seeking	 whenever	 possible	 to	 reduce	 the	 amount	 of	 operating	 unit	 thermal	 cycling.	 Tube	 leaks	 have	 historically	 been	 the		 single	 largest	 source	 of	 forced	 outages.	 In	 2005	 there	 were	 20	 tube	 leaks,	 compared	 to	 an	 average	 of	 38	 for	 each	 of	 the	 five	 years	 2000	 to	 2004.	 The	 2005	 tube	 leak	 performance	 was	 the	 best	 the	 station	 has	 ever	 achieved.	 iN trodu Ctio N o F eu e missio Ns

The	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 took	 place	 on	 	 15	 December	 2005,	 resulting	 in	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 new	 holding	 company,	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Pursuant	 	 to	 the	 schemes	 of	 arrangement	 under	 which	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 was	 implemented,	 the	 existing	 debt	 of	 the	 Group	 was	 settled,	 partially	 through	 the	 issue	 of	 new	 debt,	 and	 partially	 through	 the	 issue	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Also	 on	 15	 December	 2005,	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 was	 introduced	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and	 its	 ordinary	 shares	 commenced	 trading	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.
The	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 involved	 a	 cash	 payment	 of	 £1 12m	 to	 A2	 Debt	 holders	 in	 respect	 of	 an	 equal	 amount	 of	 A2	 Debt,	 and	 an	 exchange	 of	 the	 balance	 of	 A2	 and	 A3	 Debt	 of	 £433m	 for	 new	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 In	 addition,	 the	 existing	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 the	 previous	 holding	 company,	 were	 exchanged	 for	 new	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 The	 outstanding	 A1	 Debt	 of	 £388m	 and	 B	 Debt	 of	 £82m	 was	 repaid	 at	 par,	 and	 previously	 deferred	 interest	 on	 B	 Debt	 and	 accrued	 interest	 on	 each	 of	 the	 tranches	 of	 debt	 of	 £63m	 was	 repaid	 in	 full.	 Interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 with	 a	 notional	 value	 of	 £400m,	 principally	 related	 to	 the	 A1	 Debt,	 were	 also	 cancelled,	 resulting	 in	 a	 termination	 payment		 of	 £23m.
The	 new	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 issued	 	 to	 A2/A3	 Debt	 holders	 and	 existing	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 were	 issued	 by	 way	 of	 schemes	 of	 arrangement,	 and	 therefore	 did	 not	 constitute	 an	 offer	 of	 securities	 to	 the	 public.	 Consequently,	 Listing	 took	 place	 by	 way	 of	 an	 introduction.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 Group	 entered	 into	 new	 debt	 facilities,	 which	 included	 a	 Term	 loan	 of	 £500m	 and	 a	 Bridge	 loan	 of	 £77m,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 of	 £200m	 and	 a	 revolving	 credit	 facility		 of	 £100m.	 The	 Term	 loan	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 fixed	 amortisation	 profile	 beginning	 on	 30	 June	 2006	 and	 ending	 on	 31	 December	 2010.	 The	 Bridge	 loan	 has	 first	 priority	 over	 the	 TXU	 claim	 and	 the	 proceeds	 thereof.
The	 total	 costs	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 amounted	 to	 £45m,	 of	 which	 £29m	 has	 been	 included	 within	 exceptional	 other	 operating	 expenses	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 The	 remaining	 amount	 of	 £16m	 has	 been	 deducted	 from	 debt	 	 and	 is	 being	 amortised	 to	 interest	 payable	 over	 	 the	 duration	 of	 the	 Group’s	 new	 debt	 facilities.
t Xu Claim In	 1999,	 whilst	 owned	 by	 AES	 Corporation,	 Drax	 entered	 into	 the	 TXU	 Hedging	 Contract,	 a	 15-year	 power	 purchase	 agreement	 with	 TXU	 Europe	 Energy	 Trading	 Limited	 (“TXU”).	 TXU	 defaulted	 	 on	 the	 contract	 in	 2002,	 and	 together	 with	 	 certain	 other	 members	 of	 the	 TXU	 Group,	 filed	 	 for	 administration	 in	 the	 UK.	 On	 terminating	 the	 contract,	 Drax	 issued	 a	 claim	 (the	 “TXU	 Claim”),	 ultimately	 agreed	 by	 the	 Administrators	 of	 TXU	 at	 approximately	 £348m	 (including	 VAT),	 in	 respect	 	 of	 unpaid	 power	 purchased	 by	 TXU	 and	 liquidated	 damages	 for	 default	 under	 the	 contract.	 On	 30	 March	 2005,	 the	 Group	 received	 a	 first	 distribution	 of	 £205m	 (net	 of	 VAT	 and	 a	 payment	 	 by	 the	 Group	 to	 TXU	 Europe	 Limited)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 This	 amount	 was	 subsequently	 paid	 to	 	 B	 Debt	 holders	 on	 15	 April	 2005.	 On	 2	 August	 2005,	 the	 Group	 received	 a	 second	 distribution	 of	 £51m	 (net	 of	 VAT)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 This	 amount	 	 was	 subsequently	 paid	 to	 B	 Debt	 holders	 on	 	 17	 August	 2005.	 On	 19	 January	 2006,	 the	 Group	 received	 a	 third	 distribution	 of	 £55m	 (net	 of	 VAT)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 The	 third	 distribution	 has	 been	 recognised	 	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005,	 and	 together	 with	 the	 first	 	 and	 second	 distributions,	 resulted	 in	 exceptional	 operating	 income	 of	 £31 1m	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 third	 distribution	 is	 included	 as	 a	 receivable	 balance	 	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 was	 used	 to	 make	 a	 prepayment	 of	 the	 Group’s	 Bridge	 loan	 facility	 	 on	 23	 January	 2006.
At	 the	 time	 of	 approving	 the	 financial	 statements	 the	 Group	 had	 a	 further	 £26m	 (including	 VAT)	 outstanding	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 The	 directors	 have	 reasonable	 expectations	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 receive	 repayment	 of	 this	 amount	 broadly	 in	 full	 	 by	 early	 2007 .

Net	 debt	 reduced	 to	 £462m	 in	 2005	 from	 £1,208m	 in	 2004.	 The	 main	 reasons	 for	 the	 reduction	 were	 the	 improvement	 in	 gross	 margin,	 receipt	 of	 distributions	 from	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 and	 the	 exchange	 of	 debt	 for	 equity	 as	 part	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.

The	 movements	 in	 these	 accounts	 are	 included	 as	 a	 component	 of	 net	 cash	 generated	 from	 operating	 activities.
Net	 cash	 generated	 from	 operating	 activities	 	 was	 £349m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 £17m	 for	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2004,	 an	 increase	 of	 £332m.	 The	 increase	 includes	 the	 first	 and	 second	 distributions	 received	 in	 2005	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 of	 £256m,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 impact	 of	 improved	 business	 performance,	 gross	 margin	 having	 increased	 by	 £150m	 in	 2005.	 These	 items	 were	 partially	 offset	 by	 an	 increase	 in	 interest	 paid	 of	 £66m,	 which	 includes	 payment	 of	 previously	 deferred	 interest	 of	 £25m	 as	 well	 as	 £23m	 related	 to	 the	 termination	 of	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.
Net	 cash	 used	 in	 investing	 activities	 was	 £25m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 £14m	 for	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2004.	 This	 reflected	 higher	 levels	 of	 capital	 expenditure		 in	 2005.
Net	 cash	 used	 in	 financing	 activities	 was	 £273m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 net	 cash	 generated	 from	 financing	 activities	 for	 	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2004	 of	 £0.5m.	 2005	 includes	 repayment	 of	 borrowings	 prior	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 of	 £268m,	 which	 comprises	 repayment	 of	 B	 Debt	 of	 £256m	 funded	 out	 of	 the	 first	 and	 second	 distributions	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 prepayment	 of	 £12m	 of	 A1	 Debt	 on	 	 30	 June	 2005.	 Also	 included	 in	 2005	 is	 repayment	 	 of	 borrowings	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 of	 £583m,	 which	 comprises	 A1	 and	 B	 Debt	 repayment	 at	 par	 of	 £388m	 and	 £82m	 respectively,	 as	 well	 as	 A2	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £1 12m.	 These	 debt	 repayments	 were	 partially	 met	 by	 new	 debt	 issued	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 of	 £577m.
Reflecting	 the	 above	 factors,	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 increased	 by	 £50m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 £4m	 for	 the	 corresponding	 period	 in	 2004.	 Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 were	 £88m	 at	 31	 December	 2005,	 compared	 to	 £38m	 at	 31	 December	 2004.	 Drax’s	 policy	 is	 to	 invest	 available	 cash	 in	 short-term		 bank	 deposits.
Capital r esour Ces On	 15	 December	 2005,	 the	 Group’s	 existing	 debt	 was	 replaced	 by	 new	 debt	 facilities	 comprising	 a	 £500m	 five	 year	 amortising	 Term	 loan	 facility,	 a	 £200m	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility,	 a	 £100m	 revolving	 credit	 facility,	 and	 a	 £77m	 Bridge	 loan	 facility.	 The	 Term	 loan	 facility	 is	 secured	 on	 a	 pari	 passu	 basis	 with	 the	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 and	 the	 revolving	 credit	 facility	 and	 any	 other	 permitted	 secured	 indebtedness.	 The	 Group’s	 debt	 is	 guaranteed	 	 and	 secured	 directly	 by	 each	 of	 the	 principal	 subsidiaries	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 also	 by	 the	 Company.	 Standard	 &	 Poor’s	 Ratings	 Group	 (“S&P”)	 assigned	 a	 BBB	 senior	 secured	 debt	 rating	 with	 a	 recovery	 rating	 of	 “1”	 to	 the	 Term	 loan	 facility,	 the	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 and	 the	 revolving	 credit	 facility.	 Drax	 is	 required	 to	 fund	 a	 debt	 service	 reserve	 account	 if	 it	 does	 not	 meet	 the	 specified	 historic	 annual	 debt	 service	 cover	 ratio	 on	 any	 of	 the	 six-monthly	 calculation	 dates,	 with	 the	 first	 calculation	 date	 being	 on	 31	 December	 2006.
The	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 can	 be	 used	 to	 provide	 letters	 of	 credit	 to	 counterparties	 or	 exchanges		 in	 relation	 to	 Drax’s	 trading	 business.	 The	 final	 maturity	 date	 of	 the	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 is	 	 15	 December	 2012.	 The	 Group	 guarantees	 the	 obligations	 of	 a	 number	 of	 banks	 in	 respect	 of	 	 the	 letters	 of	 credit	 issued	 by	 those	 banks	 to	 counterparties	 of	 the	 Group.	 As	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 the	 Group’s	 contingent	 liability	 in	 respect	 	 of	 these	 guarantees	 amounted	 to	 £77m	 	 (2004:	 £27m).
The	 revolving	 credit	 facility	 can	 be	 used	 to	 finance	 working	 capital	 requirements.	 It	 may	 also	 be	 used	 to	 provide	 letters	 of	 credit	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 £100m	 or	 provide	 cash	 collateral,	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 counterparties	 do	 not	 accept	 letters	 of	 credit,	 	 up	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 £20m.	 The	 final	 maturity	 date	 is	 15	 December	 2010.
The	 Bridge	 loan	 facility	 must	 be	 repaid	 in	 full	 by	 	 31	 December	 2008.	 Proceeds	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 must	 be	 applied	 to	 repay	 the	 Bridge	 loan	 facility.	 Following	 a	 third	 distribution	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 on	 19	 January	 2006,	 £55m	 of	 the	 Bridge	 loan	 was	 repaid	 on	 23	 January	 2006	 leaving	 a	 balance	 of	 £22m	 outstanding.	 The	 third	 distribution	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 has	 been	 included	 as	 a	 receivable	 balance	 at	 31	 December	 2005.		 The	 debt	 which	 was	 repaid	 on	 23	 January	 2006	 	 has	 been	 shown	 as	 repayable	 within	 one	 year	 at	 	 31	 December	 2005.
Under	 the	 new	 debt	 facilities,	 the	 Group	 can	 incur	 further	 financial	 indebtedness	 up	 to	 an	 aggregate	 of	 £100m	 so	 long	 as	 S&P	 provides	 written	 confirmation	 that	 the	 Term	 loan	 facility	 will	 maintain	 an	 investment	 grade	 credit	 rating	 of	 at	 least	 BBB–	 following	 the	 incurrence	 of	 the	 further	 secured	 indebtedness.	 In	 addition,	 Drax	 can	 enter	 into	 additional	 finance	 leases	 up	 to	 an	 aggregate	 value	 of	 £10m.	 The	 Group	 can	 also	 incur	 overdraft	 and	 other	 short-term	 borrowings	 or	 facilities	 not	 to	 exceed	 £15m	 and	 subject	 to	 certain	 other	 restrictions.	 The	 new	 debt	 facilities	 may	 be	 prepaid	 without	 penalty.

Drax	 faces	 seasonality	 in	 its	 business	 with	 higher	 demand	 in	 the	 Winter	 period	 and	 lower	 demand	 in	 the	 Summer	 months.	 Accordingly,	 cash	 flow	 during	 the	 Summer	 period	 is	 materially	 reduced	 due	 to	 	 the	 combined	 effect	 of	 lower	 prices	 and	 output,	 while	 maintenance	 expenditures	 are	 increased	 during	 this	 period	 due	 to	 planned	 outages.	 The	 £100m	 revolving	 credit	 facility	 will	 assist	 the	 Group	 in	 managing	 the	 cash	 low	 points	 in	 the	 cycle,	 	 where	 required.

The	 above	 table	 illustrates	 both	 past	 and	 projected	 capital	 expenditure	 for	 the	 years	 indicated.	 	 The	 projections	 reflect	 various	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 by	 management	 relating	 to	 the	 implementation	 of	 the	 business	 strategy,	 which	 may	 not	 be	 accurate,	 may	 not	 be	 realised,	 and	 are	 inherently	 subject	 to	 uncertainties	 that	 are	 difficult	 to	 predict	 and	 may	 be	 beyond	 Drax’s	 control.

Critical Accounting Policies
Note	 3(D)	 to	 Drax’s	 Consolidated	 Financial	 Statements	 on	 page	 48	 of	 this	 Annual	 Report	 includes	 a	 summary	 of	 the	 significant	 accounting	 principles	 and	 policies	 used	 in	 the	 preparation	 	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc’s	 financial	 statements.	 The	 preparation	 of	 financial	 statements,	 in	 conformity	 with	 generally	 accepted	 IFRS	 accounting	 principles,	 requires	 management	 to	 make	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 amounts	 reported	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 notes	 to	 the	 financial	 statements.	 Actual	 results	 could	 differ	 from	 these	 estimates.	 Certain	 accounting	 policies	 have	 been	 identified	 as	 the	 most	 critical	 accounting	 policies	 by	 considering	 which	 policies	 involve	 particularly	 complex	 or	 subjective	 decisions	 or	 assessments	 and	 these	 are	 discussed	 below:
Fi Xed a ssets a Nd d epre Ciatio N
Estimated	 remaining	 useful	 lives	 and	 residual	 values	 are	 reviewed	 annually,	 taking	 into	 account	 prices	 prevailing	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 carrying	 values	 of	 fixed	 assets	 are	 also	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 where	 there	 has	 been	 a	 trigger	 event	 by	 assessing	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 and	 net	 realisable	 value	 compared	 with	 net	 book	 value.	 The	 calculation	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 and	 residual	 values	 is	 based	 on	 the	 directors’	 reasonable	 estimates	 of	 future	 prices,	 output	 and	 costs	 and	 is,	 therefore,	 subjective.
p e Nsio Ns Within	 the	 UK,	 Drax	 operates	 an	 approved	 defined	 benefit	 scheme.	 Drax	 accounts	 for	 this	 scheme	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 19	 ‘‘Employee	 Benefits’’	 with	 the	 cost	 of	 providing	 benefits	 determined	 using	 the	 projected	 unit	 credit	 method,	 and	 actuarial	 valuations	 being	 carried	 out	 at	 each	 balance	 	 sheet	 date.	 Inherent	 in	 these	 valuations	 are	 key	 assumptions,	 including	 discount	 rates,	 expected	 returns	 on	 plan	 assets,	 and	 salary	 and	 pension	 increases.	 These	 actuarial	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 annually	 and	 modified	 as	 appropriate.	 Drax	 believes	 that	 the	 assumptions	 utilised	 	 in	 recording	 obligations	 under	 the	 scheme	 	 are	 reasonable	 based	 on	 prior	 experience,	 	 market	 conditions	 and	 the	 advice	 of	 scheme	 actuaries.	 However,	 actual	 results	 may	 differ	 	 from	 such	 assumptions.

e missio Ns a llowa NCes Liabilities	 in	 respect	 of	 obligations	 to	 deliver	 emissions	 allowances	 are	 recognised	 as	 incurred	 by	 reference	 to	 generation	 for	 the	 period.	 Any	 liabilities	 recognised	 are	 measured	 based	 on	 the	 current	 estimates	 of	 the	 amounts	 that	 will	 be	 required	 to	 satisfy	 the	 net	 obligation,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 market	 price	 of	 emissions	 allowances	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 actual	 cost	 of	 those	 allowances	 not	 already	 acquired	 may	 be	 different	 and	 the	 number	 of	 allowances	 may	 be	 different	 as	 actual	 generation	 may	 not	 be	 the	 same	 as	 expected	 generation.

Deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 recognised	 where	 it	 is	 more	 likely	 than	 not	 that	 they	 will	 be	 recovered.
d erivatives Drax	 has	 applied	 IAS	 32	 ‘‘Financial	 Instruments:	 Presentation	 and	 Disclosure’’	 and	 IAS	 39	 ‘‘Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement’’	 from	 1	 January	 2005.	 IAS	 39	 requires	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 to	 be	 recorded	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 	 at	 their	 fair	 value.	 Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivatives	 are	 recorded	 each	 period	 in	 earnings	 unless	 specific	 hedge	 accounting	 criteria	 are	 met.	 The	 fair	 values	 of	 derivative	 instruments	 for	 commodities	 are	 determined	 using	 forward	 price	 curves.	 Forward	 price	 curves	 represent	 Drax’s	 estimates	 of	 the	 prices	 at	 which	 a	 buyer	 or	 seller	 could	 contract	 today	 for	 delivery	 or	 settlement		 of	 a	 commodity	 at	 future	 dates.	 Drax	 generally	 bases	 its	 forward	 price	 curves	 upon	 readily	 obtainable	 market	 price	 quotations,	 as	 Drax’s	 commodity	 contracts	 do	 not	 generally	 extend	 beyond	 the	 actively	 traded	 portion	 of	 these	 curves.	 However,	 the	 forward	 price	 curves	 used	 are	 only	 an	 estimate	 of	 how	 future	 prices	 will	 move	 and	 are,	 therefore,	 subjective.
Market Risks and Treasury Policies
Drax	 manages	 the	 commercial	 risks	 faced	 by	 the	 Group	 in	 accordance	 with	 policies	 approved	 	 by	 the	 Board.
iN terest rate risk Drax	 is	 exposed	 to	 interest	 rate	 risk	 principally	 in	 relation	 to	 its	 outstanding	 bank	 debt.	 In	 particular,	 	 it	 is	 exposed	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 LIBOR	 interest	 rate	 	 of	 sterling-denominated	 debt,	 as	 substantially	 all	 	 of	 its	 debt	 is	 both	 denominated	 in	 sterling	 and	 has	 	 a	 variable	 LIBOR	 rate.	 Drax	 partially	 manages	 this	 	 risk	 with	 interest	 rate	 hedges	 on	 a	 proportion	 of	 	 its	 debt	 facilities.	 Forei GN Curre NCy risk Foreign	 currency	 exchange	 contracts	 are	 principally	 entered	 into	 to	 hedge	 Drax’s	 requirement	 to	 purchase	 coal	 from	 international	 sources	 in	 US	 dollars,	 and	 to	 purchase	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 in	 euros.	 Drax	 also	 purchases	 coal	 and	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 from	 a	 range	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 suppliers.	 Profit Forecast for the Year Ended  
31 December 2005
The	 prospectus,	 dated	 28	 October	 2005,	 prepared	 	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 included	 a	 forecast	 of	 profit	 before	 interest,	 tax,	 depreciation	 and	 amortisation	 (‘‘EBITDA’’),	 profit	 before	 interest	 and	 tax	 (“operating	 profit”),	 and	 net	 profit	 before	 interest	 expense	 and	 tax	 (together	 ‘‘the	 Forecast’’)	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005.	 The	 basis	 of	 preparation	 and	 principal	 assumptions	 for	 the	 Forecast	 are	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 154	 and	 155	 of	 the	 prospectus.	 The	 assumptions	 included	 that	 the	 Forecast	 was	 based	 on	 average	 prices	 of	 electricity	 and	 coal	 prevailing	 over	 the	 five	 days	 up	 to	 and	 including	 21	 October	 2005	 and	 it	 was	 assumed	 	 that	 there	 would	 be	 no	 change	 in	 the	 future	 prices	 of	 electricity	 and	 coal.	 In	 addition,	 following	 the	 completion	 of	 a	 structured	 contract	 with	 EDF	 Trading	 Limited	 in	 October	 2005,	 the	 prospectus	 noted	 that	 the	 Group	 had	 substantially	 fixed	 the	 cost	 of	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 for	 2005.
The	 following	 table	 provides	 a	 comparison	 of	 the	 Forecast	 to	 the	 actual	 results	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 also	 compares	 forecast	 	 and	 actual	 EBITDA	 excluding	 exceptional	 items	 	 and	 unrealised	 losses	 on	 derivative	 contracts.	 Commodity risk Drax	 is	 exposed	 to	 the	 effect	 of	 fluctuations	 in	 commodity	 prices,	 particularly	 the	 price	 of	 electricity,	 which	 is	 the	 commodity	 produced	 by	 Drax,	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 price	 of	 coal	 (and	 other	 fuels),	 which	 is	 essential	 to	 the	 production	 of	 electricity,	 and	 since	 1	 January	 2005,	 the	 price	 of	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances.	 Price	 variations	 and	 market	 cycles	 have	 historically	 influenced	 Drax’s	 financial	 results	 and	 are	 expected	 to	 continue	 to	 do	 so.
Drax	 has	 a	 policy	 of	 making	 forward	 sales	 of	 power	 when	 profitable	 compared	 with	 marginal	 costs	 of	 fuel	 and	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances.
Drax	 purchases	 coal	 on	 either	 fixed	 or	 variable	 priced	 contracts	 with	 different	 maturities	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 sources.	 Drax	 purchases	 CO
2
	 emissions	 allowances	 on	 fixed	 price	 contracts	 with	 different	 maturity	 dates	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 sources.
Cou Nterparty risk As	 Drax	 relies	 on	 third-party	 suppliers	 for	 the	 delivery	 of	 coal	 and	 other	 goods	 and	 services,	 it	 is	 exposed	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 non-performance	 by	 these	 third-party	 suppliers.
Drax	 purchases	 a	 significant	 majority	 of	 its	 coal	 under	 contracts	 with	 UK	 Coal.	 There	 is	 a	 risk	 	 that	 if	 UK	 Coal	 falls	 into	 financial	 difficulty	 and/or	 fails	 to	 deliver	 against	 the	 contracts,	 there	 would	 	 be	 additional	 costs	 associated	 with	 securing	 coal	 	 from	 other	 suppliers.	 Should	 UK	 Coal	 fall	 into	 administration,	 Drax	 could	 be	 subject	 to	 	 temporary	 loss	 of	 deliveries,	 higher	 coal	 prices	 	 and	 accelerated	 payments.	 Drax	 enters	 into	 fixed	 price	 contracts	 for	 the	 sale	 of	 electricity	 to	 a	 number	 of	 counterparties.	 The	 failure	 of	 one	 or	 more	 of	 these	 counterparties	 to	 perform	 their	 contractual	 obligations	 may	 cause	 Drax	 financial	 distress	 or	 increase	 the	 risk	 profile	 of	 Drax.
The	 investment	 of	 surplus	 cash	 is	 undertaken	 to	 maximise	 the	 return	 within	 Board	 approved	 policies.	 These	 policies	 set	 out	 minimum	 rating	 requirements,	 maximum	 investment	 with	 any	 one	 counterparty	 and	 the	 maturity	 profile.	 Operating	 and	 Financial	 Review

The	 significant	 increase	 in	 EBITDA	 after	 exceptional	 items	 and	 unrealised	 losses	 on	 derivative	 contracts	 is	 largely	 due	 to	 the	 improvement	 in	 gross	 margin	 noted	 above	 and	 £55m	 of	 exceptional	 operating	 income	 arising	 from	 the	 third	 distribution	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim,	 received	 on	 19	 January	 2006.

Distribution Policy
The	 Board	 has	 established	 a	 distribution	 policy	 which	 recognises	 Drax’s	 exposure	 to	 commodity	 markets	 and	 comprises	 two	 elements.	 The	 Board	 intends	 that	 Drax	 will	 pay	 a	 stable	 amount	 (£50m)	 by	 way	 of	 ordinary	 dividends	 each	 year	 (the	 “base	 dividend”).	 The	 base	 dividend	 will	 comprise	 an	 interim	 dividend	 and	 a	 final	 dividend	 and	 it	 is	 expected	 that	 the	 interim	 dividend	 will	 represent	 approximately	 one	 third	 of	 the	 total	 anticipated	 base	 dividend	 for	 each	 year.	 Drax	 expects	 to	 pay	 a	 first	 interim	 dividend	 of	 4	 pence	 per	 share	 (being	 approximately	 £16.3m)	 for	 the	 half	 year	 ending	 30	 June	 2006	 in	 Autumn	 2006.
In	 addition	 to	 the	 base	 dividend,	 substantially	 all	 of	 any	 remaining	 cash	 flow	 subject	 to	 the	 availability	 of	 reserves	 and	 after	 making	 provision	 for	 debt	 payments,	 debt	 service	 requirements	 (if	 any),	 capital	 expenditure,	 and	 other	 expected	 business	 requirements	 will	 be	 distributed	 to	 shareholders.	 A	 significant	 cash	 surplus	 is	 expected	 to	 arise	 in	 2006.	 The	 amount	 will	 be	 dependent	 on	 a	 number	 of	 factors,	 including	 commodity	 prices	 and	 plant	 performance.	 Work	 has	 commenced	 to	 identify		 the	 most	 appropriate	 method	 for	 returning	 surplus	 cash	 to	 shareholders	 and	 it	 is	 expected	 that	 the	 proposed	 method	 of	 return	 will	 be	 advised	 at	 the	 Company’s	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 in	 May	 2006	 and	 that	 this	 will	 be	 followed	 by	 an	 indication	 of	 the	 likely	 range	 of	 distribution,	 timing	 and	 shareholder	 approval	 process	 in	 a	 Trading	 Update	 given	 at	 the	 end	 of	 June	 2006.	 This	 review	 was	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 on		 7	 March	 2006.

  Drax Group plc 	 	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2005 Overarching Corporate and Social 
Responsibility Policy
The	 Group	 recognises	 that	 its	 operations	 (which	 are	 all	 conducted	 by	 its	 subsidiary,	 Drax	 Power	 Limited)	 have	 to	 be	 conducted	 within	 a	 framework	 that	 reflects	 legislative	 and	 regulatory	 requirements,	 and	 is	 also	 based	 upon	 a	 set	 of	 voluntary	 policies	 which	 reflect	 society’s	 expectations	 of	 a	 large	 and	 highly	 visible	 power	 station.	 We	 believe	 that	 corporate	 responsibility	 makes	 good	 business	 sense	 and	 we	 strive	 to	 balance	 both	 commercial	 rigours	 and	 regulatory	 demands	 of	 the	 competitive	 commodity	 market	 in	 which	 we	 operate	 with	 a	 commitment	 to	 our	 wider	 stakeholder	 group.	 As		 a	 responsible	 and	 responsive	 business	 with	 long-
term	 ambitions,	 we	 continue	 to	 invest	 to	 comply	 with	 increasingly	 stringent	 environmental,	 and	 health	 and	 safety	 requirements,	 and	 communicate	 with	 the	 wider	 stakeholder	 group,	 both	 local	 and	 national,	 through	 being	 open	 and	 transparent	 in	 	 all	 that	 we	 do.	 Corporate Accountability
The	 management	 and	 organisation	 of	 the	 Group	 	 is	 not	 only	 substantially	 compliant	 with	 the	 governance	 requirements	 of	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange	 but	 also	 sensitive	 to	 the	 expectations	 of	 society	 generally.	 The	 Board	 has	 control	 of	 the	 Group’s	 policies,	 both	 in	 respect	 of	 its	 wider	 corporate	 and	 social	 responsibility,	 and	 in	 particular	 in	 relation	 to	 environmental,	 health	 and	 safety,	 and	 social	 issues.	 The	 Group’s	 employees	 include	 specialists	 who	 spend	 all	 or	 most	 of	 their	 time	 ensuring	 that	 the	 Board’s	 policies	 are	 implemented	 and	 that	 the	 established	 procedures	 for	 identifying	 and	 reporting	 on	 risks	 and	 opportunities	 and	 assuring	 compliance	 in	 these	 areas	 continue	 to	 be	 effective.	 Internal	 processes	 have	 been	 established	 which	 enable	 Board	 members	 and	 managers	 to	 review	 performance	 regularly,	 to	 set	 appropriate	 targets,	 and	 to	 monitor	 progress	 against	 them.
Interaction with Stakeholders
The	 Group	 has	 a	 wide-ranging	 external	 audience,	 from	 shareholders	 and	 lenders,	 through	 Government	 and	 the	 media	 to	 suppliers,	 non-
Governmental	 organisations,	 opinion	 formers	 	 and	 the	 local	 community.	 We	 endeavour	 to	 communicate	 fully	 with	 each	 of	 these	 stakeholders	 through	 both	 an	 investor	 relations	 programme	 	 and	 a	 public	 affairs	 and	 community	 relations	 programme	 aimed	 at	 building	 the	 reputation	 	 of	 the	 Group.
	 iN vestor r elatio Ns During	 2005,	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 Drax	 group	 of	 companies	 until	 Listing)	 sharpened	 its	 focus	 on	 Investor	 Relations	 and	 supplemented	 its	 results	 presentations	 with	 four	 investor	 roadshows	 in	 both	 the	 UK	 and	 US.	 	 We	 believe	 the	 success	 of	 the	 programme	 showed	 through	 in	 the	 97%	 vote	 in	 favour	 of	 the	 schemes	 of	 arrangement	 and	 the	 consequent	 Listing	 of	 the	 Company	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.
p u Bli C aFF airs aC tivities Economic	 and	 environmental	 legislation	 and	 regulations,	 both	 national	 and	 European,	 have	 a	 major	 influence	 on	 UK	 electricity	 industry	 market	 participants.	 Indeed,	 the	 changes	 to	 the	 UK	 electricity	 market	 effected	 by	 legislation	 in	 the	 shape	 of	 the	 Utilities	 Act	 2000	 and	 the	 Energy	 Act	 2004,	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 New	 Electricity	 Trading	 Arrangements	 in	 March	 2001	 and	 the	 British	 Electricity	 Trading	 and	 Transmission	 Arrangements	 in	 April	 2005,	 the	 implementation		 of	 the	 Renewables	 Obligation	 in	 April	 2002,	 the	 progressive	 development	 of	 the	 EU	 Large	 Combustion	 Plant	 Directive	 and,	 at	 the	 start	 of	 2005,	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 EU	 Emissions	 Trading	 Scheme	 are	 examples	 of	 legislative	 and	 regulatory	 changes	 which,	 in	 a	 period	 of	 less	 than	 five	 years,	 have	 had	 a	 significant	 impact	 on	 the	 economics	 and	 dynamics	 of	 the	 industry.
Against	 this	 backdrop,	 the	 Group	 attaches	 importance	 to	 monitoring	 policy	 development	 by	 the	 UK	 Government	 and	 the	 European	 Institutions	 and	 to	 analysing	 and	 assessing	 planned	 and	 prospective	 legislative	 and	 regulatory	 change.	 	 To	 help	 it	 with	 this	 task	 the	 Group	 has	 retained	 	 the	 services	 of	 Lord	 Taylor	 of	 Blackburn	 as	 Parliamentary	 Adviser.	 During	 2005,	 good	 working	 relations	 were	 maintained	 within	 Parliamentary	 and	 Governmental	 arenas,	 including	 Government	 officials	 and	 agents	 of	 Government.	 Focused	 briefings	 were	 used	 as	 a	 vehicle	 for	 raising	 issues	 of	 concern	 and	 presenting	 potential	 solutions	 to	 industry-wide	 issues.	 In	 addition,	 Drax	 took	 full	 advantage	 of	 engaging	 in	 public	 consultations	 emanating	 from	 Government	 departments	 and	 inquiries	 launched	 by	 select	 committees	 and	 other	 Government	 agents.	 During	 the	 year,	 two	 Government	 Ministers	 and	 the	 Member	 of	 Parliament	 for	 Selby,	 John	 Grogan	 MP ,	 visited	 Drax	 Power	 Station,	 as	 did	 two	 prospective	 parliamentary	 candidates.	 Briefing	 meetings	 were	 also	 held	 in	 London	 with	 one	 further	 Government	 Minister	 and	 Government	 officials	 of	 both	 the	 Department	 of	 Trade	 and	 Industry,	 and	 the	 Department	 for	 the	 Environment,	 Food	 and	 Rural	 Affairs.
No	 political	 donations	 were	 made	 in	 the	 UK	 or	 elsewhere	 during	 2005	 and	 the	 Group’s	 contact	 with	 those	 active	 in	 the	 political	 arena	 has	 been	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 be	 aimed	 only	 at	 the	 promotion	 of	 the	 Group’s	 business	 interests.	 However,	 given	 the	 widespread	 doubt	 about	 the	 types	 of	 expenditure	 falling	 within	 the	 scope	 of	 the	 legislation	 controlling	 political	 donations,	 the	 Board	 wishes	 there	 to	 be		 no	 question	 of	 modest	 expenditure	 incidental	 to	 advocating	 the	 Group’s	 business	 interests	 to	 those	 in	 government,	 or	 active	 in	 the	 political	 arena,	 being	 alleged	 to	 be	 in	 contravention	 of	 the	 legislation.	 Accordingly,	 shareholders	 will	 be	 asked	 to	 approve	 a	 resolution	 authorising	 annual	 expenditure	 up	 to	 a	 limit	 of	 £100,000	 in	 respect	 of	 each	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 for	 a	 period	 of	 four	 years.	 s uppliers As	 in	 previous	 years,	 we	 encouraged	 local	 and	 national	 companies	 to	 bid	 for	 contracts	 to	 supply	 the	 many	 goods	 and	 services	 required	 by	 the	 Power	 Station.	 Most	 of	 what	 we	 purchase	 on	 the	 contract	 and	 spares	 replenishment	 side	 tends	 to	 be	 mainly	 from	 a	 UK	 source	 or	 within	 the	 European	 Union.	 Very	 occasionally	 we	 go	 further	 afield.	 In	 making	 the	 various	 purchases,	 we	 are	 mindful	 that	 some	 companies	 or	 indeed	 countries	 may	 operate	 poor	 standards	 as	 far	 as	 profiteering	 at	 the	 expense	 of	 others,	 or	 human	 rights	 issues,	 are	 concerned.	 We	 recognise	 that	 in	 covering	 a	 varied	 marketplace,	 with	 a	 number	 of	 indirect	 manufacturers	 supporting	 the	 end	 product,	 it	 is	 difficult	 to	 state	 with	 some	 certainty	 that	 we	 do	 not	 trade	 with	 certain	 companies	 or	 countries	 whose	 standards	 are	 poor.	 However,	 we	 make	 all	 reasonable	 endeavours	 to	 ensure	 that	 we	 do	 not	 knowingly	 support	 or	 trade	 with	 such	 companies	 or	 countries.	 Commu Nity r elatio Ns We	 are	 committed	 to	 being	 a	 good	 neighbour	 to	 our	 local	 community	 and	 our	 “caring	 for	 the	 community”	 philosophy	 involves	 being	 part	 of	 local,	 county	 and	 business	 communities.
Throughout	 2005,	 we	 maintained	 close	 relations	 with	 the	 local	 community	 through	 formal	 and	 informal	 discussions	 with	 representatives	 of	 parish,	 district	 and	 county	 councils.	 As	 a	 major	 employer,	 we	 sought	 to	 take	 an	 active	 role	 in	 business	 community	 organisations,	 such	 as	 the	 Selby	 Industrial	 Association	 and	 the	 Selby	 Communities	 and	 District	 Industrial	 Mission.

Amongst	 the	 good	 causes	 supported	 were:	 The	 Green	 Team,	 a	 project	 which	 aims	 to	 provide	 a	 low	 cost	 practical	 gardening	 service	 for	 elderly	 people	 and	 people	 with	 disabilities;	 and	 Selby	 District	 Nightstop,	 a	 group	 devoted	 to	 tackling	 the	 problems	 of	 youth	 homelessness	 in	 the	 local	 district.
Sponsorship	 of	 youth	 sports	 proved	 popular	 during	 the	 year,	 with	 football,	 rugby	 and	 cricket	 clubs	 all	 benefiting.	 In	 particular,	 the	 Summer	 saw	 the	 launch	 of	 the	 Drax	 Village	 Cricket	 Club’s	 youth	 section	 and	 we	 were	 pleased	 to	 sponsor	 the	 shirts	 and	 encourage	 this	 initiative	 for	 young	 people	 in	 the	 area.
A	 new	 initiative	 was	 launched	 in	 2005	 to	 focus	 on	 good	 safety	 performance	 during	 the	 major	 outage	 on	 unit	 6.	 During	 the	 12	 week	 outage,	 £500	 was	 donated	 for	 every	 seven	 days	 that	 went	 by	 without	 an	 accident	 that	 did	 not	 require	 more	 than	 first	 aid	 treatment.	 Employees	 and	 outage	 contractor,	 Mitsui	 Babcock,	 were	 each	 asked	 to	 nominate	 a	 charity	 and	 Cancer	 Research	 UK	 and	 the	 Yorkshire	 Air	 Ambulance	 charities	 each	 received	 a	 donation	 of	 £2,250.	 Some	 £19,000	 of	 the	 remaining	 donations	 were	 made	 through	 the	 Group’s	 “£	 for	 £”	 matching	 scheme,	 under	 which	 we	 match,	 £	 for	 £,	 any	 monies	 raised	 for	 charity	 or	 good	 causes	 by	 employees	 at	 the	 Power	 Station.	 We	 were	 particularly	 pleased	 to	 be	 able	 to	 match	 £	 for	 £	 monies	 raised	 by	 one	 of	 our	 employees	 who	 took	 part	 in	 a	 Bikeathon	 to	 raise	 money	 for	 Leukaemia	 Research,	 helping	 him	 to	 raise	 the	 most	 money	 in	 the	 ten	 year	 history	 of	 the	 event.
visitors Thousands	 of	 visitors	 are	 welcomed	 to	 the	 Power	 Station	 every	 year.	 The	 appeal	 of	 discovering	 more	 about	 how	 power	 is	 produced	 and	 the	 sheer	 scale	 of	 the	 site	 and	 its	 associated	 activities	 attracts	 schools	 and	 colleges	 as	 well	 as	 business	 organisations.	 During	 2005,	 we	 hosted	 some	 3,500	 visitors	 which	 included	 a	 total	 of	 64	 schools.
Members	 of	 the	 public	 are	 also	 welcome	 to	 visit	 Barlow	 Mound,	 which	 has	 been	 developed	 over	 time	 through	 careful	 and	 imaginative	 management	 of	 the	 Barlow	 Mound	 ash	 disposal	 scheme.	 Formerly	 an	 old	 munitions	 site,	 extensive	 landscaping	 and	 tree	 planting	 that	 is	 now	 well	 established	 has	 transformed	 this	 area	 into	 woodland	 and	 wetland	 features,	 picnic	 spots	 and	 artificial	 hills.	 This	 nature	 centre	 provides	 a	 complete	 contrast	 to	 the	 industrial	 workings	 of	 the	 Power	 Station	 and	 is	 specially	 designed	 to	 help	 visitors	 understand	 more	 about	 the	 natural	 habitat	 and	 ecology	 of	 the	 area.
Protecting the Environment
eN viro Nme Ntal p oli Cy The	 size	 and	 characteristics	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Station	 mean	 that	 it	 has	 a	 significant	 impact	 on	 the	 environment.	 We	 recognise	 this	 and	 have	 put	 the	 management	 of	 the	 environment	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 our	 decision-making	 process.	 Our	 policy	 is	 as	 follows:
“Drax	 Power	 Limited	 recognises	 its	 responsibilities	 to	 society	 and	 the	 environment	 and	 is	 committed	 to	 being	 an	 innovative	 leader	 in	 the	 management	 of	 the	 environment	 across	 all	 its	 activities	 and	 in	 all	 its	 business	 decisions.
We	 regard	 compliance	 with	 legislation	 as	 a	 minimum	 level	 of	 achievement.	 Furthermore,		 we	 are	 committed	 to	 managing,	 monitoring	 and	 reducing,	 where	 practicable,	 the	 environmental	 impacts	 caused	 by	 our	 business	 through	 continual	 improvement	 of	 our	 operations,	 in	 particular	 emissions	 to	 air,	 discharges	 to	 water,	 disposal	 of	 waste	 and	 the	 use	 of	 natural	 resources.	 We	 will	 maintain	 a	 reputation	 for	 effective	 environmental	 management,	 in	 part	 by	 certification	 to	 the	 international	 environmental	 management	 system	 standard,	 ISO	 14001:1996.	 This	 system	 will	 be	 used	 to	 set	 and	 periodically	 review	 environmental	 objectives	 and	 targets.
We	 will	 discuss	 our	 activities	 with	 our	 stakeholders,	 engaging	 with	 them	 to	 help	 refine	 and	 broaden	 our	 understanding,	 taking	 note	 of	 their	 views	 and	 investigating	 any	 concerns	 promptly.
We	 will	 promote	 environmental	 awareness	 amongst	 our	 staff,	 business	 partners	 and	 contractors,	 ensuring	 that	 they	 understand	 the	 environmental	 aspects	 of	 their	 activities,	 that	 they	 act	 responsibly	 and	 are	 competent	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 jobs.”
eN viro Nme Ntal m a Na Geme Nt s ystem Drax	 manages	 its	 environmental	 compliance	 under	 an	 Environmental	 Management	 System	 (“EMS”)	 certified	 to	 the	 international	 standard	 ISO	 14001.	 Its	 purpose	 is	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 Group	 meets	 its	 legal	 and	 policy	 commitments	 to	 protect	 and	 improve	 the	 environment	 in	 the	 course	 of	 carrying	 out	 its	 business.
The	 EMS	 covers	 all	 activities	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations.	 The	 Chief	 Executive	 has	 overall	 responsibility	 for	 the	 implementation	 of	 the	 	 EMS	 and	 for	 environmental	 compliance	 and	 performance	 of	 the	 business,	 with	 other	 staff	 allocated	 specific	 responsibilities	 as	 determined	 	 by	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 environmental	 impacts	 for	 which	 they	 are	 responsible.
The	 EMS	 contains	 documented	 procedures	 for	 each	 significant	 environmental	 issue	 and	 staff	 are	 trained	 to	 recognise	 the	 legal	 and	 operational	 requirements	 contained	 within	 them.
eN viro Nme Ntal Complia NCe Drax	 operates	 within	 the	 conditions	 of	 its	 Integrated	 Pollution	 Control	 (“IPC”)	 authorisation,	 granted	 by	 the	 Environment	 Agency	 and	 we	 aim	 to	 maintain	 compliance	 with	 no	 significant	 breaches	 of	 the	 regulatory	 limits.	 We	 recognise	 that	 emission	 limits	 will	 become	 tighter	 in	 the	 future	 and	 our	 goal	 is	 to	 be	 ahead	 of	 legal	 requirements	 for	 emission	 reductions	 whilst	 recognising	 the	 need	 to	 maintain	 our	 competitive	 market	 position.
We	 maintain	 investment	 in	 our	 emission	 abatement	 equipment	 and	 consider	 this	 to	 be	 a	 high	 priority.	 Our	 FGD	 plant	 already	 complies	 with	 known	 future	 emission	 limits	 to	 2016	 and	 we	 have	 initiated	 a	 programme	 of	 retrofitting	 all	 units	 with	 low	 NO

	 technology	 (Boosted	 Over	 Fire	 Air	 technology)	 in	 order	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Large	 Combustion	 Plant	 Directive	 (LCPD)	 	 from	 2008.
In	 addition	 to	 emissions	 to	 air,	 the	 operation	 of	 the	 Station	 results	 in	 other	 environmental	 effects,	 such	 as	 discharges	 to	 water,	 waste	 material	 production,	 and	 noise.	 We	 maintain	 an	 up-to-date	 understanding	 of	 the	 science	 underlying	 our	 impacts	 in	 order	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 development	 of	 cost-effective	 control	 measures.

d is CHar Ges to w ater Procedures	 are	 in	 place	 to	 ensure	 that	 all	 discharges	 and	 drainage	 to	 water	 are	 monitored	 and	 treated	 where	 necessary	 to	 meet	 our	 discharge	 consent	 limits.	 There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 sources	 of	 discharge	 and	 drainage	 as	 part	 of	 the	 electricity	 generation	 process.	 These	 sources	 include	 the	 cooling	 water	 used	 to	 cool	 the	 condensers,	 which	 as	 part	 of	 the	 steam	 cycle	 condense	 steam	 to	 water	 after	 it	 leaves	 the	 turbines	 and	 before	 returning	 to	 the	 boilers.	 Cooling	 water	 is	 abstracted	 mainly	 from	 the	 River	 Ouse	 and	 boiler	 feedwater	 originates	 from	 two	 boreholes	 on	 site.	 Approximately	 half	 of	 the	 water	 is	 returned	 to	 the	 River	 Ouse	 at	 a	 few	 degrees	 warmer	 than	 the	 river	 water.
Also,	 the	 FGD	 process	 produces	 effluent	 water	 which	 is	 treated	 in	 a	 specially	 designed	 plant		 before	 it	 is	 discharged	 to	 the	 river,	 and	 there	 is	 also	 drainage	 from	 the	 main	 plant,	 coal	 plant	 and	 roads.

The	 finer	 particles	 of	 ash,	 pulverised	 fuel	 ash	 (PFA),	 are	 collected	 from	 the	 flue	 gas	 by	 electrostatic	 precipitators;	 the	 heavier	 ash,	 furnace	 bottom	 ash	 (FBA)	 falls	 to	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 boiler.	 The	 majority	 of	 ash	 is	 sold	 to	 the	 construction	 industry	 with	 the	 remainder	 sent	 for	 landfill	 at	 the	 Station’s	 adjacent	 Barlow	 Mound.	 Drax	 pays	 landfill	 tax	 on	 the	 PFA	 disposed	 of	 to	 the	 Barlow	 Mound.	 Through	 the	 Landfill	 Tax	 Credit	 Scheme,	 Drax	 is	 able	 to	 claim	 a	 tax	 credit	 against	 its	 donations	 to	 recognised	 Environmental	 Bodies.	 Drax	 has	 worked	 with	 Groundwork	 Selby	 since	 2001	 on	 projects	 designed	 to	 help	 mitigate	 the	 effects	 of	 landfill	 upon	 our	 local	 community.	 During	 2005,	 we	 contributed	 approximately	 £126,000	 towards	 seven	 projects,	 including	 the	 Selby	 Town	 Community	 Pond	 and	 the	 Airmyn	 Playing	 Fields.
Alternative Fuels
To	 help	 maintain	 our	 vital	 role	 in	 the	 UK	 economy	 and	 safeguard	 cost	 effective	 power	 production	 our	 fuel	 strategy	 recognises	 the	 need	 to	 sustain	 a	 ready	 supply	 of	 traditional	 quality	 coal	 and	 how	 best	 to	 incorporate	 alternative	 fuels	 including	 different	 fossil	 fuels	 and	 renewable	 materials.	 The	 choice	 of	 fuels	 has	 to	 be	 balanced	 with	 availability	 and	 flexibility	 of	 supply.
The	 six	 months	 of	 independent	 testing	 and	 measurement	 prior	 to	 the	 start	 of	 the	 trial	 has	 shown	 extremely	 low	 ambient	 levels	 of	 both	 nickel	 and	 vanadium	 in	 the	 locality	 surrounding	 the	 Power	 Station.	 These	 data	 reflect	 regional	 effects	 rather	 than	 effects	 from	 the	 power	 stations	 in	 the	 area	 and	 the	 levels	 are	 well	 below	 safety	 limits	 set	 by	 the	 Environment	 Agency.	 This	 monitoring	 will	 run	 continuously	 during	 the	 trial.	 Biomass We	 are	 aware	 of	 the	 requirements	 to	 reduce	 CO
2
	 emissions,	 and	 we	 have	 continued	 to	 identify	 and	 use,	 where	 commercially	 viable,	 CO
2
-neutral	 fuels,	 such	 as	 renewable	 biomass	 materials,	 to	 replace	 fossil	 fuels,	 such	 as	 heavy	 fuel	 oil	 and	 coal.	 In	 2005,	 a	 CO
2
	 saving	 of	 over	 450,000	 tonnes	 was	 achieved	 through	 our	 biomass	 activities.
Tall	 oil,	 an	 oil	 which	 is	 derived	 from	 wood	 pulp,	 is	 	 an	 environmentally-friendly	 substitute	 for	 heavy	 fuel	 oil	 and	 marks	 an	 important	 development	 	 in	 establishing	 the	 effective	 use	 of	 alternative	 renewable	 fuels.	 Tall	 oil	 replaces	 heavy	 grade	 fuel	 	 oil	 and	 is	 burnt	 during	 a	 number	 of	 processes	 	 at	 the	 Power	 Station,	 for	 example,	 during	 the	 	 start-up	 cycle	 for	 each	 of	 the	 boilers.	 We	 were	 the	 first	 power	 station	 in	 the	 UK	 to	 use	 	 tall	 oil,	 which	 made	 an	 important	 contribution	 to	 reducing	 our	 emissions	 during	 2005.	 Around	 half	 	 of	 the	 CO
2
	 savings	 made	 came	 from	 burning	 tall	 oil,	 and	 emissions	 of	 SO
2
	 were	 also	 reduced.	 We	 will	 continue	 to	 burn	 tall	 oil	 when	 commercially	 viable.
Over	 the	 last	 two	 years	 we	 have	 also	 developed	 the	 capability	 to	 co-fire	 solid	 biomass	 materials	 with	 coal.	 Trials	 on	 a	 variety	 of	 biomass	 materials	 were	 conducted	 throughout	 the	 year,	 with	 the	 emphasis	 on	 developing	 the	 capability	 to	 burn	 wood	 and	 other	 energy	 crops.
We	 are	 able	 to	 add	 biomass	 to	 the	 coal	 before		 the	 coal	 is	 pulverised	 into	 a	 fine	 powder	 in	 the	 pulverising	 fuel	 mills,	 a	 process	 known	 as	 “through	 the	 mill”.	 This	 operation	 has	 worked	 well	 during	 2005,	 although	 there	 are	 limits	 to	 the	 amount	 of	 biomass	 that	 can	 be	 successfully	 blended	 with	 the	 coal	 in	 this	 way.
During	 the	 second	 half	 of	 2005	 a	 “direct	 injection”	 system	 was	 commissioned	 on	 one	 unit	 allowing	 greater	 and	 more	 reliable	 throughput	 of	 	 biomass	 materials.
Corporate	 and	 Social	 Responsibility
Through	 the	 provision	 of	 dedicated	 information	 and	 focused	 site	 tours	 we	 continue	 our	 policy	 of	 being	 open,	 transparent	 and	 informative	 about	 our	 operations.	 In	 November	 and	 December	 of	 2005,	 we	 organised	 tours	 of	 the	 Power	 Station	 specifically	 for	 local	 residents	 to	 enable	 them	 to	 see	 for	 themselves	 how	 alternative	 fuels	 such	 as	 biomass	 and	 petroleum	 coke	 (“petcoke”)	 are	 handled	 on	 site.	 p etroleum Coke The	 18	 month	 trial	 burn	 of	 petcoke	 from	 June	 2005	 is	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 our	 strategy	 of	 developing	 alternative	 fuels.	 It	 involves	 burning	 a	 blend	 of	 coal	 and	 up	 to	 15%	 petcoke	 on	 one	 of	 our	 six	 generating	 units.	 Petcoke	 is	 derived	 from	 the	 petrochemical	 industry	 and	 is	 produced	 from	 oil.
Petcoke	 contains	 higher	 levels	 of	 sulphur	 than	 coal	 but	 the	 FGD	 plant	 at	 Drax	 ensures	 that,	 on	 average,	 at	 least	 90%	 of	 the	 SO
2
	 is	 removed	 before	 gases	 created	 during	 combustion	 are	 emitted	 to	 the	 atmosphere.	 Thus,	 Drax	 has	 the	 capability	 to	 burn	 petcoke	 within	 the	 permitted	 levels	 already	 set	 for	 the	 Power	 Station	 by	 the	 Environment	 Agency.
Studies	 indicate	 that	 burning	 petcoke	 produces	 lower	 total	 emissions	 of	 trace	 metals	 (other	 than	 nickel	 and	 vanadium)	 and	 particulates	 than	 coal,	 boiler	 efficiency	 improves	 and	 therefore	 potentially	 less	 oxides	 of	 nitrogen	 (NO
X
)	 gases	 will	 be	 produced	 during	 combustion.
There	 are	 inherent	 properties	 in	 petcoke	 that	 make	 it	 a	 beneficial	 fuel	 source,	 environmentally	 and	 economically.	 It	 contains	 roughly	 30%	 more	 heat	 per	 tonne	 than	 coal,	 meaning	 that	 less	 has	 to	 be	 burnt	 to	 achieve	 the	 same	 electricity	 output.	 The	 amount	 of	 ash	 produced	 is	 considerably	 less,	 	 under	 1%	 of	 the	 original	 weight	 compared	 with	 	 10-18%	 in	 the	 case	 of	 coal,	 so	 ash	 disposal	 is	 significantly	 reduced.
With	 the	 use	 of	 petcoke	 we	 have	 taken	 	 our	 stringent	 monitoring	 procedures	 even	 further.	 A	 programme	 of	 detailed	 testing	 to	 measure	 emissions	 during	 the	 trial	 was	 approved	 by	 the	 Environment	 Agency,	 and	 they	 receive	 monthly	 reports	 on	 the	 results	 of	 the	 trial.	 These	 are	 also	 published	 on	 our	 website	 as	 part	 of	 our	 policy	 	 to	 be	 open	 and	 transparent	 about	 the	 trial	 results.	 	 In	 addition,	 we	 work	 closely	 with	 both	 the	 Environment	 Agency	 and	 Selby	 District	 Council	 	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 impact	 of	 the	 coal/petcoke	 	 trial	 is	 fully	 understood.

22  Drax Group plc 	 	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2005 r e Cruitme Nt Our	 apprenticeship	 programme	 was	 re-introduced	 in	 September	 2003	 amidst	 a	 growing	 realisation	 	 of	 a	 potential	 future	 shortfall	 in	 skilled	 workers,	 particularly	 in	 the	 more	 traditional	 craft	 disciplines.	 With	 the	 long-term	 future	 of	 the	 business	 in	 mind,	 we	 decided	 to	 take	 steps	 to	 secure	 the	 right	 level	 of	 human	 resource	 and	 the	 programme	 now	 forms	 a	 major	 component	 of	 our	 policy	 of	 investing	 in	 our	 staff.	 This	 practice	 was	 continued	 in	 2004	 and	 again	 in	 2005,	 with	 a	 further	 six	 apprentices	 joining	 us.
More	 immediate	 measures	 were	 necessary	 during	 2005	 to	 address	 the	 skills	 and	 knowledge	 gap		 that	 was	 presented	 by	 a	 significant	 reduction	 in	 specialist	 skills	 effected	 by	 the	 previous	 owner	 	 and	 to	 ensure	 the	 business	 was	 equipped	 with	 sufficient	 corporate	 skills	 as	 we	 made	 the	 transition	 to	 a	 listed	 company.	 Areas	 of	 particular	 focus	 for	 	 this	 recruitment	 activity	 were	 finance,	 trading	 	 and	 engineering.	 iN ter Nal Commu Ni Catio Ns We	 use	 a	 wide	 variety	 of	 communication	 methods	 in	 order	 to	 keep	 people	 as	 informed	 as	 possible	 and	 eradicate	 confusion,	 conflict	 and	 misinterpretation	 of	 messages.	 For	 example,	 team	 briefings	 are	 held	 once	 a	 month	 where	 wide-ranging	 information	 is	 communicated	 throughout	 the	 organisation,	 in	 addition,	 plant-wide	 meetings	 are	 held	 on	 a	 regular	 basis.	 We	 have	 also	 introduced	 an	 IT-based	 internal	 feedback	 system,	 Drax	 Talk,	 allowing	 employees	 to	 anonymously	 raise	 concerns	 or	 make	 comments	 on	 any	 work-related	 issue	 and	 receive	 a	 publicly	 accessible	 response	 from	 the	 leadership	 team.

The	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 employment	 for	 the	 majority	 of	 staff	 within	 the	 Group,	 that	 is,	 those	 	 not	 employed	 under	 a	 personal	 contract,	 are	 incorporated	 into	 the	 Collective	 Agreement.	 	 This	 is	 a	 joint	 agreement	 between	 the	 Group	 	 and	 the	 trades	 unions.	 Staff	 are	 represented	 by	 either	 AMICUS,	 TGWU,	 GMB,	 Prospect	 or	 Unison	 trades	 unions.	 A	 positive	 relationship	 between	 management	 and	 trades	 unions	 has	 been	 established	 over	 a	 number	 of	 years	 and	 is	 based	 	 on	 clear	 guidelines,	 a	 consultative	 approach	 and	 good	 communication	 of	 the	 relevant	 business	 objectives	 of	 the	 Group.
By	 the	 end	 of	 2005,	 biomass	 was	 being	 co-fired	 at	 the	 equivalent	 rate	 of	 250,000	 tonnes	 per	 year.
The	 new	 incident	 investigation	 and	 review	 process	 launched	 in	 2004	 continues	 to	 provide	 a	 firm	 platform	 for	 the	 identification	 of	 health	 and	 safety	 learning	 opportunities.	 The	 weekly	 Safety	 Bulletin	 briefing	 process	 provides	 a	 fast	 track	 for	 safety	 communication	 to	 all	 staff.
The	 safety	 representatives	 and	 management	 team	 members	 of	 the	 Health	 and	 Safety	 Advisory	 Committee	 (HESAC)	 continue	 to	 play	 a	 vital	 role	 through	 facilitating	 staff	 consultation	 on	 health	 and	 safety	 issues.
The	 twinning	 arrangement	 between	 Drax	 and	 ScottishPower’s	 Longannet	 Power	 Station	 continues	 to	 produce	 real	 safety	 benefits	 for	 both	 parties.	 In	 an	 effort	 to	 accelerate	 the	 improvement	 of	 our	 safety	 performance,	 exchange	 visits	 have	 recently	 taken	 place	 with	 EON’s	 Ratcliffe-on-Soar	 Power	 Station	 and	 Corus.
“Spotlight	 on	 Safety”	 is	 the	 Group’s	 implementation	 of	 the	 internationally	 proven	 DuPont™	 STOP™	 programme.	 This	 behavioural	 safety	 programme,	 introduced	 in	 November	 2004,	 will	 continue	 as	 the	 main	 vehicle	 for	 safety	 improvement	 over	 the	 next	 two	 to	 three	 years.
Employment
Culture We	 have	 established	 a	 performance	 culture	 work	 ethic,	 where	 staff	 feel	 valued	 and	 want	 to	 come	 to	 work	 and	 perform	 for	 the	 good	 of	 the	 business.	 We	 are	 working	 towards	 an	 industrial	 relations	 climate	 at	 Drax	 Power	 that	 is	 positive,	 with	 employment	 policies	 which	 respect	 human	 rights	 and	 equal	 opportunities	 as	 well	 as	 facilitating	 training	 to	 develop	 staff	 and	 enhance	 competence.	 The	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 the	 principles	 of	 fairness	 and	 dignity	 at	 work.
Applications	 for	 employment	 by	 disabled	 persons	 are	 always	 fully	 considered,	 bearing	 in	 mind	 the	 aptitudes	 of	 the	 applicants	 concerned.	 In	 the	 event	 of	 a	 member	 of	 staff	 becoming	 disabled,	 every	 effort	 is	 made	 to	 ensure	 that	 their	 employment	 continues	 and	 that	 appropriate	 training	 is	 arranged.	 It	 is	 the	 policy	 of	 the	 Group	 that	 the	 training,	 career	 development	 and	 promotion	 of	 disabled	 persons	 should,	 as	 far	 as	 possible,	 be	 identical	 to	 that	 of	 other	 employees.
By	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year,	 biomass	 was	 being	 co-fired	 through	 both	 “direct	 injection”	 and	 “through	 the	 mill”	 systems	 at	 the	 equivalent	 rate	 of	 250,000	 tonnes	 per	 year.
Looking	 ahead,	 we	 are	 developing	 a	 long-term	 strategy	 involving	 energy	 crops	 in	 partnership	 with	 local	 farmers	 which	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 significantly	 reduce	 CO
2
	 emissions	 from	 the	 Station	 and	 make	 a	 valuable	 contribution	 to	 the	 Government’s	 target	 for	 2010	 of	 10%	 of	 electricity	 supplied	 coming	 from	 renewable	 fuels.
Health and Safety
Health	 and	 safety	 is	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 Drax’s	 corporate	 responsibility	 and	 protecting	 our	 employees	 and	 contractors	 from	 ill-health	 or	 injury	 and	 promoting	 employee	 well-being	 is	 fundamental	 to	 our	 business	 philosophy.	 We	 are	 committed	 to	 developing	 and	 maintaining	 a	 positive	 health	 and	 safety	 culture	 in	 which	 statutory	 requirements	 are	 viewed	 as	 a	 minimum	 standard	 and	 “world	 class”	 performance	 our	 goal.

The	 Company’s	 articles	 of	 association	 require	 that,	 following	 appointment	 by	 the	 Board,	 directors	 submit	 themselves	 for	 election	 by	 shareholders	 	 at	 the	 next	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.	 Each	 of	 the	 present	 directors	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	 Board	 of	 the	 Company	 on	 or	 after	 20	 October	 2005	 and	 therefore	 retires	 and	 offers	 himself	 or	 herself	 for	 re-election	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.
The	 articles	 also	 provide	 that	 one-third	 of	 directors	 shall	 retire	 by	 rotation	 each	 year	 but	 are	 eligible	 to	 submit	 themselves	 for	 re-election	 by	 shareholders	 and	 that	 directors	 shall	 not	 serve	 longer	 than	 the	 third	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 following	 their	 election	 without	 being	 re-elected	 by	 shareholders.	 However,	 in	 view	 of	 the	 dates	 upon	 which	 all	 directors	 were	 first	 appointed,	 this	 provision	 of	 the	 articles	 has	 no	 practical	 effect	 in	 	 relation	 to	 the	 forthcoming	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 but	 it	 will	 be	 applied	 in	 future	 years.
Directors’ Interests
Other	 than	 a	 deed	 of	 indemnity	 between	 each	 director	 and	 the	 Company	 	 in	 respect	 of	 claims	 made	 and	 personal	 liability	 incurred	 as	 a	 result	 of	 	 the	 bona	 fide	 discharge	 of	 their	 responsibilities	 and	 service	 contracts	 between	 the	 executive	 directors	 and	 a	 Group	 company,	 or	 as	 noted	 in	 the	 Remuneration	 Report,	 no	 director	 had	 a	 material	 interest	 at	 any	 time	 during	 the	 year	 in	 any	 contract	 of	 significance	 with	 the	 Company	 or	 any	 of	 its	 subsidiary	 undertakings.	 26  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005

As	 at	 7	 March	 2006,	 the	 Company’s	 register	 of	 substantial	 shareholdings	 maintained	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 provisions	 of	 Section	 211	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 showed	 that	 the	 following	 shareholders	 exceeded	 	 the	 3%	 disclosure	 threshold.

Employees
Drax	 uses	 a	 wide	 variety	 of	 communication	 methods	 in	 order	 to	 keep	 employees	 as	 informed	 as	 possible.	 For	 example,	 team	 briefings	 are	 	 held	 once	 a	 month	 where	 wide-ranging	 information	 is	 communicated	 throughout	 the	 organisation.	 In	 addition,	 plant-wide	 meetings	 are	 held	 	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 and	 cover,	 inter	 alia,	 the	 financial	 and	 economic	 	 factors	 affecting	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Company.	 Details	 of	 employee	 involvement	 through	 share	 participation	 are	 contained	 in	 the	 Remuneration	 Report	 on	 pages	 34	 to	 41.
It	 is	 the	 Group’s	 policy	 to	 give	 full	 consideration	 to	 suitable	 applications	 for	 employment	 from	 people	 with	 disabilities.	 In	 the	 event	 of	 a	 member	 of	 staff	 becoming	 disabled	 every	 effort	 is	 made	 to	 ensure	 that	 their	 employment	 with	 the	 Group	 continues	 and	 that	 appropriate	 training	 and	 rehabilitation	 is	 provided.	 It	 is	 the	 policy	 of	 the	 Group	 that	 the	 training,	 career	 development	 and	 promotion	 of	 disabled	 persons	 should,	 as	 far	 as	 possible,	 be	 identical	 with	 that	 of	 other	 employees.
The	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 a	 policy	 of	 equal	 opportunities	 and	 ensures	 	 that	 country	 of	 origin,	 colour,	 gender,	 religious	 belief,	 sexual	 orientation	 	 or	 disability,	 are	 not	 barriers	 to	 working	 at	 Drax.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Details	 of	 the	 Group’s	 Corporate	 Social	 Responsibility	 (”CSR“)	 policy	 and	 operations	 are	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 20	 to	 23.
Charitable Donations
Drax	 Group	 has	 continued	 to	 support	 community	 initiatives	 and	 charitable	 causes	 and	 the	 total	 Group	 commitment	 during	 the	 year	 was	 £37,500	 	 (2004:	 £22,750).	 Details	 of	 the	 charitable	 donations	 made	 are	 contained	 within	 the	 CSR	 report.
Political Donations
No	 political	 donations	 were	 made	 in	 the	 UK	 or	 elsewhere	 during	 the	 	 year	 (2004:	 £nil).	 It	 is	 the	 Board’s	 policy	 not	 to	 make	 donations	 to	 political	 organisations	 or	 for	 political	 causes.	 In	 the	 CSR	 report	 there	 is	 an	 explanation	 of	 the	 nature	 and	 extent	 of	 the	 Group’s	 intended	 activities	 aimed	 only	 at	 the	 promotion	 of	 its	 business	 interests.	 The	 definitions	 attributed	 to	 EU	 political	 expenditure	 are	 broad	 and	 there	 is	 widespread	 doubt	 of	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 normal	 business	 activities,	 which	 might	 not	 be	 thought	 to	 be	 political	 expenditure	 in	 the	 usual	 sense,	 could	 be	 caught.	 In	 view	 of	 this	 the	 Board	 wishes	 to	 avoid	 any	 inadvertent	 infringement	 of	 the	 legislation	 by	 incurring	 unauthorised	 EU	 political	 expenditure	 and	 as	 such,	 is	 seeking	 the	 authority	 to	 incur	 annual	 expenditure,	 for	 each	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiary	 Drax	 Power	 Limited,	 for	 such	 purposes	 of	 £100,000	 for	 a	 period	 of	 four	 years.	 The	 Board	 does	 not	 believe	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 incurred	 any	 such	 political	 expenditure	 in	 the	 past	 year.
Creditor Payment Policy and Practice
Terms	 of	 payment	 are	 agreed	 with	 suppliers	 when	 negotiating	 each	 transaction	 and	 the	 policy	 is	 to	 abide	 by	 those	 terms	 and	 pay	 creditors	 	 when	 sums	 owing	 fall	 due	 for	 payment,	 provided	 that	 the	 suppliers	 also	 comply	 with	 all	 relevant	 terms	 and	 conditions.	 Drax	 Group	 plc,	 the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 Group,	 has	 no	 trade	 creditors.	 In	 respect	 of	 Group	 activities,	 the	 amounts	 due	 to	 trade	 creditors	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 represented	 approximately	 32	 days	 of	 average	 daily	 purchases	 through	 the	 year	 	 (2004:	 32	 days).
Auditors
In	 accordance	 with	 Section	 385	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985,	 a	 resolution	 	 is	 to	 be	 proposed	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 for	 the	 reappointment	 of	 Deloitte	 &	 Touche	 LLP	 as	 auditors	 of	 the	 Company.	 A	 resolution	 will	 also	 be	 proposed	 authorising	 the	 directors	 to	 determine	 the	 auditors’	 remuneration.	 The	 Audit	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 appointment	 of	 the	 auditors,	 the	 auditors’	 effectiveness	 and	 relationship	 with	 the	 Group,	 including	 the	 level	 of	 audit	 and	 non-audit	 fees	 paid	 to	 the	 auditor.	 Further	 details	 on	 the	 work	 of	 the	 auditors	 and	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 Report	 on	 pages	 31	 and	 32.
Annual General Meeting
The	 first	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 of	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 held	 on	 12	 May	 2006	 at	 The	 City	 Presentation	 Centre,	 4	 Chiswell	 Street,	 London	 EC1Y	 4UP	 	 at	 11am.	 A	 separate	 document	 accompanying	 the	 Directors’	 Report	 and	 Annual	 Accounts	 contains	 the	 notice	 convening	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 and	 a	 description	 of	 the	 business	 to	 be	 conducted.

Corporate Governance
Application of the Combined Code
The	 Listing	 Rules	 require	 listed	 companies	 to	 disclose,	 in	 relation	 to	 Section	 1	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code	 on	 Corporate	 Governance	 (the	 “Code”),	 how	 they	 have	 applied	 its	 principles	 and	 whether	 they	 have	 complied	 with	 its	 provisions	 throughout	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 year.	 No	 member	 of	 the	 Group	 was	 obliged	 to	 comply	 with	 the	 Code	 until	 15	 December	 2005	 when	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 (the	 “Company”)	 was	 admitted	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and	 	 its	 shares	 began	 trading	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange	 (“Listing”).	 This	 report	 explains	 the	 arrangements	 made	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 with	 the	 Code	 with	 effect	 from	 Listing	 but	 also	 includes	 references	 to	 circumstances	 prior	 to	 	 15	 December	 2005.	 Those	 are	 references	 to	 arrangements	 made	 by	 the	 Board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 a	 company	 incorporated	 in	 the	 Cayman	 Islands	 and	 the	 holding	 company	 for	 the	 group	 until	 that	 date.
Compliance with the Combined Code
As	 stated	 above,	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code	 first	 applied	 	 to	 the	 Group	 on	 15	 December	 2005.	 Prior	 to	 that	 date	 and	 from	 1	 January	 2005,	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 applied	 such	 of	 the	 principles	 of	 the	 Code	 as	 it	 was	 permitted	 to	 do	 by	 virtue	 of	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 shareholders’	 agreement	 binding	 upon	 it	 and	 as	 the	 board	 considered	 both	 appropriate	 and	 reasonably	 practicable,	 given	 the	 financial	 structure	 and	 other	 circumstances	 of	 the	 group	 during	 that	 period.	 As	 part	 of	 its	 preparations	 	 for	 admission	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority,	 the	 Board	 adopted	 arrangements	 which	 it	 believes	 will	 enable	 it	 to	 comply	 throughout	 2006	 with	 substantially	 all	 of	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Code.
It	 is	 the	 Board’s	 view	 that,	 throughout	 the	 period	 starting	 with	 Listing	 on	 	 15	 December	 and	 ending	 with	 the	 date	 of	 this	 report,	 there	 has	 been	 full	 compliance	 with	 the	 provisions	 of	 Section	 1	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code,	 with	 the	 exception	 that:
(1)	 	In	 the	 16	 day	 period	 from	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 to	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year,	 it	 was	 not	 practicable	 for	 the	 Chairman	 to	 hold	 meetings	 with	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 as	 required	 by	 code	 provision	 A.1.3.	 However,	 prior	 to	 Listing,	 the	 Chairman	 met	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 on	 a	 number	 of	 occasions	 in	 relation	 to	 specific	 items	 of	 Board	 business.	 (2)	 	As	 the	 former	 holder	 of	 executive	 office,	 upon	 appointment	 as	 Chairman,	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 was	 not	 independent	 within	 the	 meaning	 of	 code	 provision	 A.2.2.	 (3)	 	The	 Board	 has	 not	 undertaken	 an	 evaluation	 of	 its	 own	 and	 of	 its	 Committees’	 performance	 as	 required	 by	 code	 provision	 A.6.
(4)	 	Whilst	 the	 Board	 has	 not	 conducted	 a	 review	 of	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 	 the	 Group’s	 systems	 of	 internal	 control	 as	 required	 by	 code	 provision	 C.2.1,	 as	 part	 of	 the	 Listing	 process,	 the	 Board	 and	 its	 advisers	 formally	 considered	 those	 systems	 and	 their	 adequacy	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 fulfilling	 the	 Company’s	 obligations	 under	 the	 reporting	 requirements	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority.
The Board of Directors
As	 at	 7	 March	 2006	 the	 Board	 comprises	 the	 non-executive	 Chairman,	 four	 independent	 non-executive	 directors	 and	 three	 executive	 directors.	 The	 directors	 are	 named	 and	 their	 principal	 commitments	 outside	 the	 Group	 are	 described	 on	 page	 24.
Corporate Governance
Gordon	 Horsfield	 is	 the	 Chairman.	 Between	 19	 April	 2005	 and	 26	 September	 2005,	 he	 also	 undertook	 the	 role	 of	 acting	 Chief	 Executive.		 On	 7	 March	 2006,	 upon	 the	 completion	 of	 a	 hand-over	 period	 following	 the	 arrival	 of	 Dorothy	 Thompson,	 he	 relinquished	 his	 executive	 responsibilities	 and	 now	 serves	 as	 non-executive	 Chairman.	 Gordon	 has	 held	 an	 executive	 position	 within	 the	 Company	 and	 is	 therefore	 not	 deemed	 independent	 within	 the	 meaning	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code.	 However,	 the	 Board	 considers	 it	 appropriate	 that	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 continues	 as	 Chairman	 in	 view	 of	 his	 experience	 and	 knowledge	 of	 the	 Company,	 the	 industry	 and	 commerce	 generally.	 The	 Board	 also	 considers	 that	 the	 short	 period	 during	 which	 he	 acted	 as	 Chief	 Executive	 has	 not	 adversely	 affected	 his	 independence	 of	 judgement.
Dorothy	 Thompson	 is	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 is	 responsible	 for	 all	 aspects	 of	 the	 management	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 its	 business,	 including	 developing	 	 an	 appropriate	 business	 strategy	 for	 Board	 approval	 and	 securing	 its	 timely	 and	 effective	 implementation.	 She	 provides	 leadership	 to	 the	 executive	 team	 and	 takes	 responsibility	 for	 the	 important	 external	 relationships	 	 with	 customers,	 suppliers,	 regulatory	 agencies	 and	 government	 bodies.	 	 She	 and	 the	 Chairman	 maintain	 high	 quality	 relationships	 with	 Drax	 shareholders.	 The	 division	 of	 responsibilities	 between	 the	 Chairman	 and	 	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 is	 set	 out	 in	 writing	 and	 was	 agreed	 by	 the	 Board	 	 on	 14	 December	 2005.
Gordon	 Boyd	 joined	 the	 Group	 as	 the	 Finance	 Director	 on	 10	 January	 2005	 and	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 financial	 management	 of	 the	 Group,	 its	 risk	 management	 systems	 and	 systems	 of	 internal	 control,	 and	 for	 relationships	 with	 the	 Group’s	 bankers.
Peter	 Emery	 is	 the	 Production	 Director	 and	 responsible	 for	 the	 operation,	 repair	 and	 maintenance	 of	 the	 electricity	 generation	 plant	 at	 Selby,	 	 North	 Yorkshire.
Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby	 have	 served	 the	 Group	 as	 independent	 non-
executive	 directors	 throughout	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005.	 The	 Board	 reviewed	 their	 position	 prior	 to	 the	 Listing	 and	 reiterated	 its	 previous	 conclusion	 that	 each	 of	 them	 is	 independent	 within	 the	 meaning	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code.	 On	 30	 November	 2005,	 in	 anticipation	 of	 Listing,	 the	 Board	 appointed	 Tim	 Barker	 as	 senior	 independent	 director.	 Charles	 Berry	 and	 Jamie	 Dundas	 joined	 the	 Board	 as	 independent	 non-executive	 directors	 	 on	 15	 December	 2005.
The	 Company’s	 articles	 of	 association	 require	 that,	 following	 appointment	 by	 the	 Board,	 directors	 submit	 themselves	 for	 election	 by	 shareholders	 	 at	 the	 next	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.	 Each	 of	 the	 present	 directors	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	 Board	 of	 the	 Company	 on	 or	 after	 20	 October	 2005	 and	 therefore	 retires	 and	 offers	 himself	 or	 herself	 for	 re-election	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.
The	 articles	 also	 provide	 that	 one-third	 of	 directors	 shall	 retire	 by	 rotation	 each	 year	 but	 are	 eligible	 to	 submit	 themselves	 for	 re-election	 by	 shareholders	 and	 that	 directors	 shall	 not	 serve	 longer	 than	 the	 third	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 following	 their	 election	 without	 being	 re-elected	 by	 shareholders.	 However,	 in	 view	 of	 the	 date	 upon	 which	 all	 directors	 were	 first	 appointed,	 this	 provision	 of	 the	 articles	 has	 no	 practical	 effect	 in	 	 relation	 to	 the	 forthcoming	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 but	 it	 will	 be	 applied	 	 in	 future	 years.
	 28  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Corporate Governance
Each	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 the	 Chairman,	 currently	 holds	 a	 letter	 of	 appointment	 which	 provides	 for	 the	 appointment	 to	 continue	 indefinitely	 subject	 to	 one	 month’s	 notice	 of	 termination.	 	 The	 Chairman’s	 letter	 of	 appointment	 provides	 for	 a	 fixed	 three	 year	 term.	 	 It	 is	 the	 Board’s	 policy	 that	 each	 non-executive	 director	 will	 serve	 for	 a	 fixed	 term	 not	 exceeding	 three	 years	 which,	 subject	 to	 the	 Board	 being	 satisfied	 as	 to	 the	 director’s	 performance	 and	 commitment	 and	 a	 resolution	 to	 	 re-elect	 at	 the	 appropriate	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 may	 be	 renewed	 by	 mutual	 agreement.	 However,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 independent	 non-executive	 directors,	 it	 is	 the	 Board’s	 policy	 not	 to	 extend	 the	 aggregate	 period	 of	 service	 (including	 service	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited)	 of	 any	 independent	 non-executive	 director	 beyond	 nine	 years	 and,	 as	 required	 by	 the	 Combined	 Code,	 subject	 to	 rigorous	 review	 any	 proposal	 to	 extend	 a	 non-executive	 director’s	 aggregate	 period	 of	 office	 beyond	 six	 years.	 The	 Board	 expects	 to	 develop	 a	 programme	 of	 rotational	 retirement	 of	 non-executive	 directors	 as	 a	 result	 of	 which	 the	 skills	 and	 experience	 available	 to	 the	 Board	 will	 be	 refreshed	 periodically.	 The	 Board	 has	 adopted	 a	 schedule	 of	 matters	 reserved	 for	 its	 decision	 	 and	 formal	 terms	 of	 reference	 for	 its	 committees	 which	 are	 available	 on	 	 the	 Group’s	 website	 (www.draxgroup.plc.uk).	 The	 Board	 determines:	 the	 Group’s	 strategy;	 risk	 management	 policies;	 the	 annual	 plan	 and	 key	 performance	 indicators;	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals	 and	 other	 transactions	 outside	 delegated	 limits;	 material	 changes	 to	 accounting	 policies	 or	 practices;	 significant	 financial	 decisions;	 capital	 structure	 and	 dividend	 policy;	 shareholder	 communications;	 prosecution,	 defence	 or	 settlement	 	 of	 material	 litigation;	 Group	 remuneration	 policy;	 the	 terms	 of	 reference	 	 of	 Board	 committees;	 and	 Board	 structure,	 composition	 and	 succession.	 	 Matters	 which	 are	 not	 specifically	 reserved	 to	 the	 Board	 and	 its	 committees	 under	 their	 terms	 of	 reference,	 or	 to	 shareholders	 in	 General	 Meeting,	 	 are	 delegated	 to	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 or	 otherwise	 delegated	 in	 accordance	 with	 a	 scheme	 of	 delegation	 approved	 by	 the	 Board.
The	 Board	 receives	 regular	 reports	 on	 performance	 against	 the	 Business	 Plan	 and	 periodic	 business	 reports	 from	 senior	 management.	 Via	 	 a	 committee,	 the	 Board	 monitors	 risk	 exposures	 against	 risk	 management	 policies.	 Directors	 are	 briefed	 on	 matters	 to	 be	 discussed	 at	 meetings	 by	 papers	 distributed	 in	 advance	 of	 Board	 and	 committee	 meetings.
The	 Board	 is	 satisfied	 that	 all	 the	 directors	 are	 able	 to	 devote	 sufficient	 time	 to	 their	 duties	 as	 directors.	 The	 Board	 has	 adopted	 a	 policy	 whereby	 directors	 may,	 in	 the	 furtherance	 	 of	 their	 duties,	 seek	 independent	 professional	 advice	 at	 the	 Company’s	 expense.	 No	 director	 obtained	 any	 such	 advice	 during	 2005.	 During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 each	 of	 the	 appointments	 of	 Charles	 Berry,	 Jamie	 Dundas	 ,	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 and	 Gordon	 Boyd	 was	 made	 on	 merit	 and	 after	 a	 selection	 process,	 conducted	 with	 the	 aid	 of	 recruitment	 consultants,	 which	 assessed	 candidates	 against	 objective	 criteria	 determined	 in	 advance.
As	 mentioned	 in	 the	 Directors’	 Report,	 each	 director	 has	 the	 benefit	 of	 a	 deed	 of	 indemnity	 from	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 in	 respect	 of	 claims	 made	 and	 liabilities	 incurred,	 in	 either	 case	 arising	 out	 of	 the	 bona	 fide	 discharge	 by	 the	 director	 of	 his	 or	 her	 duties.	 The	 Company	 has	 also	 arranged	 appropriate	 insurance	 cover	 in	 respect	 of	 legal	 action	 against	 	 its	 directors.
Committees of the Board
The	 Board,	 and	 where	 indicated	 below,	 its	 predecessor,	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 has	 (or	 had)	 established	 the	 following	 standing	 committees:
(1)	 	Audit	 Committee	 which,	 following	 Listing,	 comprises	 Tim	 Barker	 (as	 Chairman),	 Charles	 Berry	 and	 Jamie	 Dundas.	 It	 is	 the	 current	 intention	 that	 Jamie	 Dundas	 will	 take	 over	 as	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 immediately	 after	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 on	 12	 May	 2006.	 Prior	 to	 Listing	 (and	 as	 a	 committee	 of	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited),	 the	 committee	 comprised	 Tim	 Barker	 (as	 Chairman),	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Mike	 Grasby.
(2)	 	Remuneration	 Committee	 which,	 following	 Listing,	 comprises	 Tim	 Barker	 (as	 Chairman),	 Charles	 Berry,	 Jamie	 Dundas	 and	 Mike	 Grasby.	 Prior	 to	 Listing	 (and	 as	 a	 committee	 of	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited),	 the	 committee	 comprised	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 (Chairman),	 Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby.
(3)	 	Nominations	 Committee	 which	 was	 established	 on	 Listing	 comprises	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 (as	 Chairman),	 Tim	 Barker,	 Charles	 Berry,	 Jamie	 Dundas	 and	 Mike	 Grasby.	 (4)	 	Health	 and	 Safety	 Committee	 comprises	 Mike	 Grasby	 (as	 Chairman),	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 and	 Peter	 Emery,	 with	 the	 Safety	 Manager	 in	 attendance.	 Prior	 to	 Listing,	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 had	 established	 a	 Company	 Health	 and	 Safety	 Committee.
The	 Board	 also	 has	 a	 Trading	 and	 Risk	 Management	 Committee	 whose	 core	 function	 is	 to	 monitor	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 risk	 management	 in	 relation	 to	 trading	 and	 treasury	 matters.	 It	 comprises	 Gordon	 Boyd	 (as	 Chairman),	 Gordon	 Horsfield,	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 and	 Peter	 Emery.	 Prior	 to	 Listing,		 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 had	 established	 a	 Risk	 Management	 Committee	 which,	 throughout	 2005	 until	 Listing,	 undertook	 a	 role	 similar	 	 to	 that	 of	 the	 Trading	 and	 Risk	 Management	 Committee	 of	 the	 Board.	 The	 Board	 is	 minded	 to	 review	 the	 role	 and	 membership	 of	 this	 committee.
Details	 of	 the	 work	 of	 the	 Audit,	 Nominations	 and	 Remuneration	 Committees	 are	 given	 in	 the	 reports	 of	 those	 Committees	 on	 pages	 31	 to	 41.
Board and Board Committee Attendance 2005
From	 Listing	 (the	 date	 upon	 which	 the	 Combined	 Code	 first	 applied)	 and	 until	 31	 December	 2005,	 the	 Board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 and	 its	 Remuneration	 Committee	 each	 held	 one	 meeting.	 There	 were	 no	 meetings	 of	 the	 Audit	 	 or	 Nominations	 Committees	 in	 that	 period.
During	 the	 period	 commencing	 1	 January	 2005	 and	 ending	 14	 December	 2005,	 the	 Board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 and	 its	 Audit	 and	 Remuneration	 Committees	 held	 a	 number	 of	 meetings.	 The	 number	 of	 meetings	 of	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 was	 unusually	 high	 owing	 to	 the	 demands,	 	 first	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 completed	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 and	 secondly	 of	 the	 three	 proposals	 to	 acquire	 the	 Group	 received	 after	 1	 September	 2005	 and	 prior	 to	 Listing.
The	 number	 of	 meetings	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 was	 unusually	 high	 because	 of	 the	 business	 (a)	 occasioned	 by	 the	 Prospectus	 and	 the	 Listing,	 (b)	 arising	 out	 of	 the	 vesting	 of	 shares	 from	 the	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 Long-Term	 Incentive	 Plan,	 and	 (c)	 the	 development	 of	 share	 schemes	 for	 implementation	 after	 Listing.

The	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 did	 not	 undertake	 an	 evaluation	 of	 its	 performance	 or	 of	 that	 of	 its	 committees	 during	 2005,	 nor	 has	 the	 Board	 of	 the	 Company	 done	 so	 in	 the	 period	 from	 15	 December	 2005	 to	 the	 end	 of	 the	 financial	 year	 on	 31	 December	 2005.	 However,	 it	 is	 the	 intention	 of	 the	 Board	 	 to	 undertake	 formal	 reviews	 of	 its	 own	 performance,	 of	 its	 Committees	 and	 of	 individual	 directors	 towards	 the	 end	 of	 2006.	 As	 stated	 in	 its	 report	 on	 pages	 34	 to	 41,	 in	 January	 2006,	 after	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 evaluated	 the	 performance	 of	 executive	 directors.	 That	 review	 was	 informed	 by	 the	 opinions	 of	 Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby	 who	 met	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 executive	 directors	 to	 evaluate	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Chairman.	 Both	 evaluations	 were	 informed	 by	 the	 results	 of	 a	 confidential	 survey	 of	 senior	 managers’	 opinions.	 As	 explained	 earlier,	 in	 the	 16	 day	 period	 between	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 and	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year	 it	 was	 not	 practicable	 for	 the	 Chairman	 to	 hold	 meetings	 with	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 as	 required	 by	 code	 provision	 A.1.3	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code.	 However,	 earlier	 in	 the	 year,	 as	 Chairman	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 the	 Chairman	 met	 with	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 the	 executives	 on	 a	 number	 of	 occasions	 in	 relation	 to	 specific	 matters	 of	 concern	 to	 the	 Board.	 The	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 the	 development	 of	 all	 employees	 and	 directors	 and	 intends	 to	 review	 individual	 director’s	 development	 requirements	 and	 make	 appropriate	 arrangements	 to	 address	 them.	 Induction	 programmes	 have	 been	 arranged	 for	 Charles	 Berry	 and	 Jamie	 Dundas.
Relations with Shareholders
The	 Company	 places	 considerable	 importance	 on	 communication	 with	 shareholders	 and	 engages	 with	 them	 on	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 issues.	 During	 2005	 a	 Head	 of	 Corporate	 Affairs	 joined	 the	 Group.	 During	 the	 coming	 year	 he	 will	 assist	 in	 developing	 appropriate	 liaison	 and	 dialogue	 between	 the	 Group	 and	 its	 major	 shareholders.	 In	 the	 months	 prior	 to	 Listing,	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	 other	 executive	 directors	 met	 on	 a	 number	 of	 occasions	 with	 the	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 and	 also	 with	 a	 large	 number	 of	 prospective	 shareholders	 of	 the	 Company.	 30  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Corporate Governance
The	 Company’s	 small	 and	 private	 shareholders	 together	 hold	 approximately	 1.85%	 of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital.	 The	 Board	 is	 as	 interested	 in	 their	 concerns	 as	 in	 the	 concerns	 of	 larger	 shareholders.	 All	 shareholders	 are	 free	 to	 put	 questions	 to	 the	 Board	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.	 Questions	 asked	 	 in	 person	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 will	 receive	 an	 oral	 response	 whenever	 possible.	 Otherwise	 a	 written	 response	 will	 be	 provided	 as	 	 soon	 as	 practicable	 after	 the	 meeting.	 Questions	 asked	 at	 other	 times	 will	 normally	 receive	 a	 written	 response.	 Shareholders	 attending	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 will	 have	 an	 opportunity	 to	 meet	 informally	 with	 the	 directors	 immediately	 after	 the	 meeting.
All	 information	 reported	 to	 the	 market	 via	 a	 regulatory	 information	 service	 appears	 on	 the	 Group’s	 website	 within	 a	 matter	 of	 hours.
This	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 together	 with	 other	 public	 announcements	 is	 designed	 to	 present	 a	 balanced	 and	 understandable	 view	 of	 the	 Group’s	 activities	 and	 prospects.	 The	 Chairman’s	 Statement,	 Chief	 Executive’s	 Statement,	 and	 Operating	 and	 Financial	 Review	 on	 pages	 	 8	 to	 19	 provide	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 Group’s	 affairs.	 This	 Annual	 Report	 is	 being	 despatched	 to	 shareholders	 at	 least	 20	 working	 days	 before	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 and	 the	 accompanying	 Form	 of	 Proxy	 provides	 for	 a	 shareholder	 to	 indicate	 abstention	 as	 an	 alternative	 to	 a	 vote	 in	 favour	 or	 against	 each	 separate	 resolution.	 Particulars	 of	 aggregate	 proxies	 lodged	 will	 be	 placed	 on	 the	 Group’s	 website	 as	 soon	 as	 practicable.	 Directors’ Responsibilities
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 the	 Annual	 Report	 and	 the	 financial	 statements.	 The	 directors	 are	 required	 to	 prepare	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 Group	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRS).	 Company	 law	 requires	 the	 directors	 to	 prepare	 such	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards,	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 and	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 	 IAS	 Regulation.
International	 Accounting	 Standard	 1	 requires	 that	 financial	 statements	 present	 fairly	 for	 each	 financial	 year	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 position,	 financial	 performance	 and	 cash	 flows.	 This	 requires	 the	 faithful	 representation	 of	 	 the	 effects	 of	 transactions,	 other	 events	 and	 conditions	 in	 accordance	 	 with	 the	 definitions	 and	 recognition	 criteria	 for	 assets,	 liabilities,	 income	 	 and	 expenses	 set	 out	 in	 the	 International	 Accounting	 Standards	 Board’s	 “Framework	 for	 Preparation	 and	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements”.	 	 In	 virtually	 all	 circumstances,	 a	 fair	 presentation	 will	 be	 achieved	 by	 compliance	 with	 all	 applicable	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards.	 Directors	 are	 also	 required	 to	 :
properly	 select	 and	 apply	 accounting	 policies;
present	 information,	 including	 accounting	 policies,	 in	 a	 manner	 that	 provides	 relevant,	 reliable,	 comparable	 and	 understandable	 information;	 and
provide	 additional	 disclosures	 when	 compliance	 with	 specific	 requirements	 in	 IFRS	 is	 insufficient	 to	 enable	 users	 to	 understand	 the	 impact	 of	 particular	 transactions,	 other	 events	 and	 conditions	 on	 the	 entity’s	 financial	 position	 and	 financial	 performance.
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 maintaining	 proper	 accounting	 records	 which	 disclose	 with	 reasonable	 accuracy	 at	 any	 time	 the	 financial	 position	 	 of	 the	 Company,	 for	 safeguarding	 the	 assets,	 for	 taking	 reasonable	 steps	 for	 the	 prevention	 and	 detection	 of	 fraud	 and	 other	 irregularities	 and	 for	 the	 preparation	 of	 a	 directors’	 report	 and	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 which	 comply	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.
The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 maintenance	 and	 integrity	 of	 the	 Company	 website.	 Legislation	 in	 the	 United	 Kingdom	 governing	 the	 preparation	 and	 dissemination	 of	 financial	 statements	 differs	 from	 legislation	 in	 other	 jurisdictions.
The	 Independent	 Auditors’	 Report	 on	 page	 42	 summarises	 their	 review	 of	 the	 Company’s	 compliance	 with	 the	 relevant	 provisions	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code	 as	 applicable	 to	 the	 Company	 during	 the	 year	 under	 review.

Audit Committee Report
The	 Audit	 Committee	 of	 the	 Board	 (the	 “Committee”)	 was	 established	 on	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 and	 did	 not	 meet	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	 December	 2005.	 It	 has,	 however,	 met	 since	 31	 December	 2005	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 considering	 the	 outcome	 of	 the	 audit	 of	 the	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 the	 draft	 of	 this	 Annual	 Report	 and	 to	 make	 appropriate	 recommendations	 to	 the	 Board.
This	 report,	 therefore,	 describes	 the	 role	 of	 the	 Committee	 and	 of	 the	 work	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 of	 the	 board	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (the	 “Former	 Committee”)	 which	 was	 the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 Drax	 Group	 until	 Listing.	 The	 purpose	 of	 the	 Committee	 is	 (and	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee	 was)	 to	 assist	 the	 Board	 in	 discharging	 its	 responsibilities	 for	 	 the	 integrity	 of	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 announcements,	 the	 assessment	 	 of	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 systems	 of	 risk	 management,	 internal	 control	 and	 regulatory	 compliance	 and	 to	 oversee	 the	 objectivity	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 internal	 audit	 function	 (which	 is	 undertaken,	 under	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 Finance	 Director,	 by	 an	 independent	 leading	 firm	 of	 accountants)	 and	 of	 the	 external	 auditors.	 A	 copy	 of	 the	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 is	 available	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 (www.draxgroup.plc.uk).
The Audit Committee
The	 Committee	 currently	 comprises	 the	 following	 independent	 non-
executive	 directors,	 appointed	 by	 the	 Board:
Tim	 Barker	 (Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee)
Jamie	 Dundas	 Charles	 Berry
Prior	 to	 Listing,	 the	 Former	 Committee	 comprised:	 Tim	 Barker	 (as	 Chairman);	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 (Chairman	 of	 the	 Board);	 and	 Mike	 Grasby.	 Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby	 were	 independent	 non-executive	 directors.
It	 is	 the	 current	 intention	 that	 Jamie	 Dundas	 will	 take	 over	 as	 Chairman	 	 of	 the	 Committee	 immediately	 following	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 	 on	 12	 May	 2006.	 The	 Former	 Committee	 met	 on	 six	 occasions	 in	 2005	 and	 the	 members’	 attendance	 record	 is	 set	 out	 on	 page	 29.	 The	 Company	 Secretary	 acted	 as	 the	 Secretary	 to	 the	 Former	 Committee	 and	 acts	 as	 Secretary	 to	 the	 Committee.	 The	 biographies	 of	 the	 directors	 who	 are	 members	 of	 the	 Committee	 are	 	 set	 out	 on	 page	 24.	 The	 Board	 is	 satisfied	 that	 all	 these	 directors	 have	 recent	 and	 relevant	 financial	 experience.
The	 Chief	 Executive,	 the	 Finance	 Director	 and	 the	 external	 auditors	 normally	 attended,	 by	 invitation,	 all	 meetings	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee	 and	 it	 is	 intended	 that	 they	 shall	 normally	 attend	 all	 meetings	 of	 the	 Committee.	 Other	 members	 of	 senior	 management	 were	 also	 present	 at	 meetings	 of	 	 the	 Former	 Committee	 (and	 will	 be	 invited	 to	 attend	 meetings	 of	 the	 Audit Committee Report 
Committee)	 as	 appropriate	 in	 order	 to	 present	 reports.	 In	 undertaking	 its	 duties,	 the	 Former	 Committee	 had,	 and	 the	 Committee	 has,	 access	 to	 the	 services	 of	 the	 Finance	 Director	 and	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 and	 their	 resources,	 as	 well	 as	 access	 to	 external	 professional	 advice.
The	 Committee	 intends	 to	 undertake	 its	 duties	 in	 line	 with	 an	 agreed	 annual	 work	 plan.	 It	 will	 review,	 with	 members	 of	 management	 and	 the	 external	 auditors,	 the	 Company’s	 formal	 financial	 announcements.	 It	 reviewed	 this	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 to	 shareholders	 and	 associated	 documentation	 before	 publication,	 with	 a	 particular	 emphasis	 on	 their	 fair	 representation	 and	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 the	 judgemental	 factors	 and	 appropriateness	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies	 used	 in	 their	 preparation.	 On	 a	 regular	 basis,	 it	 will	 receive	 reports	 on	 risk	 management,	 fraud,	 legal	 and	 corporate	 governance	 matters,	 in	 order	 to	 help	 it	 assess	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 risk	 management	 and	 control	 frameworks.	 The	 Committee	 will	 also	 periodically	 review	 the	 Company’s	 arrangements	 in	 respect	 of	 its	 “whistleblowing”	 policy	 in	 order	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 arrangements	 allow	 proportionate	 and	 independent	 investigation	 of	 matters	 raised	 and	 that	 appropriate	 follow	 up	 actions	 are	 in	 place.
With	 the	 implementation	 of	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRS)	 for	 the	 2005	 financial	 year	 and	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Prospectus	 published	 prior	 to	 Listing,	 the	 Former	 Committee	 reviewed	 the	 progress	 of	 the	 Group’s	 preparations	 for	 reporting	 under	 the	 new	 standards	 and	 the	 related	 processes	 that	 have	 been	 embedded	 throughout	 the	 Group.	 The	 Committee	 will	 receive	 reports	 from	 the	 external	 auditors	 and	 will		 hold	 discussions	 with	 representatives	 from	 the	 audit	 firm,	 in	 the	 absence	 	 of	 management.	 In	 order	 that	 the	 Board	 is	 kept	 fully	 appraised	 of	 the	 Committee’s	 work,	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 will	 follow	 the	 practice	 of	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee	 and	 report	 the	 Committee’s	 deliberations	 to	 the	 next	 following	 Board	 meeting.	 The	 Board	 will	 receive	 	 a	 copy	 of	 the	 minutes	 of	 each	 meeting	 of	 the	 Committee.
Internal Controls
The	 Board	 has	 the	 ultimate	 responsibility	 for	 the	 systems	 of	 internal	 control	 maintained	 by	 the	 Group	 and	 for	 reviewing	 their	 effectiveness.	 The	 systems	 are	 intended	 to	 provide	 reasonable	 assurance,	 but	 not	 an	 absolute	 guarantee,	 against	 material	 financial	 misstatement	 or	 loss,	 and	 include	 the	 safeguarding	 of	 assets,	 the	 maintenance	 of	 proper	 accounting	 records,	 the	 reliability	 of	 financial	 information,	 compliance	 with	 appropriate	 legislation,	 regulation	 and	 best	 practice,	 and	 the	 identification	 and	 containment	 of	 business	 risks.
The	 Committee,	 acting	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board,	 will	 undertake	 an	 annual	 review	 of	 the	 effectiveness	 of,	 and	 the	 framework	 for,	 the	 Group’s	 systems	 	 of	 internal	 control.	 In	 the	 Board’s	 view,	 the	 information	 it	 will	 receive	 will	 be	 sufficient	 to	 enable	 it	 to	 review	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Group’s	 systems	 of	 internal	 control	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Guidance	 on	 Internal	 Control	 issued	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 the	 Combined	 Code. 32  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Audit Committee Report
The	 principal	 features	 of	 the	 control	 framework	 are	 as	 follows:	 Control Environment
The	 Group	 has	 an	 established	 governance	 framework.	 The	 key	 features	 	 of	 the	 control	 environment	 within	 the	 framework	 include:	 the	 Statement	 	 of	 Matters	 Reserved	 to	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 terms	 of	 reference	 for	 each	 of	 its	 committees;	 a	 clear	 organisational	 structure,	 with	 documented	 delegation	 of	 authority	 from	 the	 Board	 to	 executive	 management;	 a	 Group	 policy	 framework,	 which	 sets	 out	 risk	 management	 and	 control	 standards	 for	 the	 Group’s	 operations;	 and	 defined	 procedures	 for	 the	 approval	 of	 major	 transactions,	 budgets	 and	 capital	 allocations.	 Further	 details	 on	 financial	 and	 capital	 risk	 management	 are	 given	 in	 the	 Operating	 and	 Financial	 Review	 on	 pages	 12	 to	 19.
Risk Identification, Assessment and Management
The	 Group	 has	 an	 established	 system	 of	 business	 risk	 management,	 which	 is	 integrated	 into	 the	 Group’s	 business	 planning	 and	 performance	 monitoring	 processes.	 The	 Group’s	 risk	 management	 and	 control	 framework	 is	 designed	 to	 support	 the	 identification,	 assessment,	 monitoring	 and	 control	 of	 risks	 that	 are	 significant	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	 the	 Group’s	 business	 objectives.	 Policies	 and	 controls	 pertinent	 to	 the	 Group’s	 trading	 operations	 and	 actual	 performance	 in	 relation	 to	 them	 are	 kept	 under	 review	 by	 the	 Trading	 and	 Risk	 Management	 Committee.	 Control Procedures and Monitoring Systems
The	 Group	 has	 a	 system	 of	 planning	 and	 monitoring,	 which	 incorporates	 Board	 approval	 of	 a	 rolling	 five-year	 Business	 Plan	 and	 approval	 towards	 	 the	 end	 of	 a	 year	 of	 operating	 and	 capital	 expenditure	 budgets	 for	 the	 year	 ahead.	 Performance	 against	 the	 budget	 is	 subsequently	 monitored	 and	 reported	 to	 the	 Board	 each	 time	 it	 meets.	 The	 Board	 also	 receives	 regular	 reports	 from	 the	 Trading	 and	 Risk	 Management	 Committee.	 Performance	 	 is	 also	 reported	 formally	 through	 the	 publication	 of	 Group	 results,	 and	 accounting	 policies	 are	 applied	 consistently	 throughout	 the	 Group.	 Operational	 management	 report	 frequently	 to	 the	 executive	 directors.
Internal Audit
Under	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 Finance	 Director,	 the	 Group	 has	 outsourced	 the	 internal	 audit	 function	 to	 Grant	 Thornton	 UK	 LLP ,	 which	 is	 an	 independent	 leading	 firm	 of	 accountants.	 They	 undertake	 the	 full	 range	 of	 reviews	 	 that	 would	 ordinarily	 be	 undertaken	 by	 an	 internal	 audit	 function.	 Regular	 reports	 are	 provided	 to	 the	 Committee	 regarding	 the	 audit	 programme	 	 and	 audits	 undertaken	 and	 recommendations	 are	 made	 to	 management	 	 for	 process	 improvements	 as	 appropriate.
External Auditors
Deloitte	 &	 Touche	 LLP	 were	 appointed	 as	 auditors	 of	 the	 Company	 in	 2005,	 having	 previously	 acted	 as	 auditors	 to	 the	 group	 companies	 of	 which	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 was	 then	 the	 holding	 company.	 The	 audit	 engagement	 partner	 changed	 as	 part	 of	 a	 rotation	 process	 in	 2003.	 Deloitte	 &	 Touche	 LLP	 audits	 all	 companies	 in	 the	 Group	 which	 are	 not	 dormant.
The	 Company	 has	 a	 formal	 policy	 aimed	 at	 safeguarding	 and	 supporting	 the	 independence	 of	 the	 auditors	 by	 avoiding	 conflict	 of	 interests.	 The	 Former	 Committee	 reviewed	 compliance	 with	 the	 policy	 concerning	 the	 use	 of	 the	 external	 auditor	 in	 non-audit	 work.	 The	 Committee	 intends	 to	 apply	 the	 best	 practice	 recommendations	 in	 the	 Combined	 Code	 and	 intends	 to	 adopt	 and	 pursue	 a	 policy	 which	 regulates	 the	 appointment	 of	 former	 audit	 employees	 into	 senior	 finance	 positions	 within	 the	 Group	 and	 sets	 out	 the	 approach	 to	 be	 taken	 by	 the	 Group	 when	 using	 the	 services	 of	 the	 auditor,	 distinguishing	 between	 those	 matters	 where	 the	 Company	 requires	 an	 independent	 view,	 such	 as	 audit	 and	 assurance	 work,	 from	 other	 advisory	 services.	 In	 addition	 to	 statutory	 audits,	 audit	 and	 assurance	 work	 includes	 reviewing	 statutory	 returns,	 due	 diligence	 associated	 with	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals,	 fraud	 investigations	 and	 control	 and	 audit	 reviews.	 Whilst	 the	 aim	 is	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 auditor	 cannot	 be	 engaged	 for	 any	 other	 purpose,	 it	 is	 recognised	 that	 there	 may	 be	 a	 small	 number	 of	 areas	 where,	 for	 pragmatic	 reasons,	 it	 may	 be	 in	 the	 Group’s	 interests	 to	 use	 the	 external	 auditor	 for	 other	 work.	 Audit Committee Report
The	 Committee	 will	 review	 annually	 a	 formal	 letter	 provided	 by	 the	 external	 auditors	 confirming	 its	 independence	 and	 objectivity	 within	 the	 context	 of	 applicable	 regulatory	 requirements	 and	 professional	 standards	 and	 did	 so	 	 in	 the	 period	 leading	 up	 to	 its	 approval	 of	 this	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts.	 This	 report	 was	 reviewed	 and	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 on	 7	 March	 2006.

The	 Nominations	 Committee	 of	 the	 Board	 (the	 “Committee”)	 was	 first	 established	 on	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 and	 did	 not	 meet	 before	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year.	 This	 report	 provides	 details	 of	 the	 role	 of	 the	 Committee	 	 and	 the	 work	 it	 will	 ordinarily	 undertake	 during	 a	 year.
The	 Committee	 currently	 comprises	 the	 following	 directors,	 appointed	 by	 the	 Board:
Gordon	 Horsfield	 (Chairman)
Tim	 Barker
Charles	 Berry
Jamie	 Dundas
Mike	 Grasby
The	 Company	 Secretary	 acts	 as	 the	 Secretary	 to	 the	 Committee.	 The	 terms	 of	 reference	 of	 the	 Committee	 require	 it	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 constitution	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 to	 consider	 the	 succession	 of	 the	 directors.	 The	 Committee	 will	 review	 the	 skills,	 experiences	 and	 independence	 of	 its	 directors	 and,	 as	 appropriate,	 will	 identify	 and	 assess	 potential	 new	 directors.	 It	 will	 also	 review	 those	 directors	 retiring	 by	 rotation	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Company’s	 articles	 of	 association	 with	 a	 view	 to	 making	 recommendations	 to	 the	 Board	 regarding	 their	 re-election.
A	 copy	 of	 the	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 is	 available	 from	 the	 	 Company	 Secretary	 and	 can	 be	 viewed	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 	 (www.draxgroup.plc.uk).	 In	 undertaking	 its	 duties	 the	 Committee	 will	 monitor	 the	 skill	 requirements	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 knowledge,	 experience,	 length	 of	 service	 and	 performance	 of	 the	 directors.	 It	 will	 also	 review	 their	 external	 interests	 with	 a	 view	 to	 identifying	 any	 actual	 or	 perceived	 potential	 conflict	 of	 interests,	 including	 the	 time	 which	 they	 are	 able	 to	 commit	 to	 their	 duties	 as	 directors	 of	 the	 Company.	 The	 Committee	 will	 also	 monitor	 Nominations Committee Report
matters	 relating	 to	 the	 independence	 of	 each	 non-executive	 director.	 The	 results	 of	 these	 reviews	 will	 be	 taken	 into	 account	 when	 the	 Board	 considers	 succession	 planning	 and	 the	 reappointment	 of	 directors.	 Members	 of	 the	 Committee	 will	 take	 no	 part	 in	 any	 discussions	 concerning	 their	 own	 circumstances.
Directors’	 service	 contracts	 are	 available	 for	 inspection	 by	 prior	 arrangement	 during	 normal	 business	 hours	 at	 the	 Company’s	 registered	 office.	 They	 will	 also	 be	 available	 for	 inspection	 at	 the	 venue,	 prior	 to	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 details	 of	 which	 are	 contained	 in	 the	 Notice	 of	 Meeting.
As	 stated	 in	 this	 report,	 the	 Committee	 has	 not	 met,	 but	 has	 set	 out	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 it	 will	 conduct	 itself.	 Prior	 to	 the	 Listing	 and	 prior	 to	 the	 requirement	 for	 the	 Committee,	 the	 group	 had	 in	 place	 a	 robust	 and	 fair	 process	 by	 which	 it	 selected	 and	 appointed	 Gordon	 Boyd	 and	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 and,	 at	 the	 time	 of	 Listing,	 Charles	 Berry	 and	 Jamie	 Dundas.	 	 The	 process	 included,	 but	 was	 not	 limited	 to,	 the	 use	 of	 external	 recruitment	 advisers	 deemed	 to	 have	 the	 relevant	 experience	 for	 recruitment	 of	 personnel	 at	 this	 level	 and	 also	 the	 Chairman	 and	 each	 serving	 director	 had	 discussions	 with	 the	 proposed	 candidates	 prior	 to	 the	 final	 appointment	 being	 made.

Remuneration Report
Drax	 Group	 plc	 (the	 “Company”)	 became	 the	 holding	 Company	 for	 the	 Drax	 group	 of	 companies	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 upon	 its	 admission	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 (“Listing”).	 The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 of	 the	 Board	 of	 the	 Company	 (the	 “Committee”)	 became	 responsible	 for	 matters	 relating	 to	 remuneration	 on	 that	 date.	 Until	 that	 date	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 was	 the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 Drax	 group	 and	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 of	 its	 Board	 (the	 “Former	 Committee”)	 was	 responsible	 for	 the	 matters	 dealt	 with	 in	 this	 report.	 Whilst	 compliance	 with	 the	 Combined	 Code	 and	 with	 the	 Directors’	 Remuneration	 Report	 Regulations	 has	 been	 required	 only	 since	 Listing,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 believes	 that	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 work	 of	 both	 committees	 is	 necessary	 for	 a	 fair	 report	 to	 be	 given.	 A	 copy	 of	 the	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 is	 available	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 (www.draxgroup.plc.uk).

There	 were	 eight	 meetings	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee	 during	 the	 period	 ended	 on	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 one	 meeting	 of	 the	 Committee.	 Except	 for	 Jamie	 Dundas	 who	 was	 unable	 to	 attend	 the	 meeting	 on	 20	 December	 2005,	 all	 other	 members	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee	 or	 the	 Committee	 respectively	 attended	 all	 the	 meetings.
The	 Committee	 recommends	 to	 the	 Board	 a	 remuneration	 framework	 designed	 to	 allow	 the	 Company	 to	 attract	 and	 retain	 its	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 management	 and	 which	 is	 aligned	 to	 shareholder	 interests.	 Within	 that	 framework,	 it	 determines	 the	 remuneration	 of	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 management,	 including	 pension	 rights	 and	 any	 compensation	 payments.	 In	 addition,	 it	 is	 responsible	 for	 setting	 the	 remuneration	 of	 the	 Chairman	 and	 maintains	 an	 overview	 over	 rewards	 	 for	 all	 other	 employees.
Whilst	 he	 was	 Chairman	 and	 a	 member	 of	 the	 Former	 Committee,	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 took	 no	 part	 in	 discussions	 relating	 to	 his	 own	 remuneration,	 bonus	 awards	 or	 awards	 under	 the	 Drax	 Group	 Long-Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 (“LTIP”)	 which	 vested	 upon	 Listing.
The	 Committee	 has	 noted	 the	 change	 to	 international	 accounting	 standards	 in	 2005	 and	 the	 adoption	 of	 European	 Embedded	 Value	 principles.	 The	 Committee	 will	 continue	 to	 monitor	 the	 impact	 of	 these	 regulations	 on	 remuneration	 policy	 and	 performance	 conditions	 for	 incentive	 plans.
adviseRs The	 Committees	 have	 retained	 Peter	 Newhouse	 &	 Co	 to	 advise	 them	 throughout	 the	 period	 and	 that	 firm	 has	 not	 provided	 any	 other	 services	 	 to	 the	 Group	 during,	 or	 since	 the	 end	 of,	 the	 period.
The	 Committees	 have	 also	 had	 the	 support	 of	 John	 Readshaw,	 	 Head	 of	 Human	 Resources	 at	 Drax	 who	 has	 also	 acted	 as	 Secretary	 	 to	 both	 Committees.
ChaiRman and non-exeCutive diReC toRs’ RemuneR ation The	 Chairman	 served	 in	 an	 executive	 capacity	 throughout	 2005.	 Particulars	 of	 his	 remuneration	 during	 the	 year	 are	 set	 out	 in	 Part	 2	 of	 this	 report.	 	 On	 7	 March	 2006,	 upon	 the	 relinquishment	 by	 him	 of	 his	 executive	 responsibilities	 (as	 foreshadowed	 in	 the	 Listing	 Particulars),	 the	 Chairman’s	 service	 agreement	 was	 terminated	 by	 mutual	 consent	 and	 without	 cost	 	 to	 the	 Group.	 As	 a	 non-executive	 he	 has	 a	 contract	 to	 provide	 services	 in	 substantially	 similar	 terms	 to	 the	 contract	 with	 each	 of	 the	 other	 non-
executive	 directors,	 save	 as	 to	 the	 level	 of	 remuneration	 and	 the	 period	 of	 notice	 to	 terminate	 the	 contract.	 On	 the	 basis	 of	 a	 review	 of	 remuneration	 data	 for	 Chairmen	 of	 other	 listed	 PLCs	 of	 a	 similar	 market	 value	 or	 turnover	 to	 Drax	 and	 having	 regard	 to	 his	 expected	 time	 commitment,	 the	 Committee	 determined	 that	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 should	 be	 paid	 a	 fee	 of	 £185,000	 per	 annum	 for	 his	 services	 as	 non-executive	 Chairman	 and	 that	 his	 notice	 period	 should	 be	 six	 months	 on	 either	 side.	 Like	 the	 other	 non-executive	 directors,	 he	 will	 not	 receive	 a	 pension	 or	 other	 benefits,	 nor	 will	 he	 participate	 in	 the	 annual	 cash	 bonus	 or	 any	 of	 the	 share-based	 reward	 schemes	 being	 introduced	 during	 2006.	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 agreed	 that,	 in	 view	 of	 the	 stage	 reached	 in	 the	 transfer	 of	 his	 executive	 responsibilities	 to	 Dorothy	 Thompson,	 his	 salary	 as	 an	 executive	 director	 should	 be	 reduced	 to	 £185,000	 per	 annum	 and	 he	 should	 forego	 his	 right	 to	 bonus	 and	 other	 benefits	 under	 his	 service	 agreement	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 period	 from		 1	 February	 2006	 to	 7	 March	 2006.
The	 remuneration	 for	 the	 other	 non-executive	 directors	 is	 determined	 	 by	 the	 Chairman	 and	 executive	 directors	 and	 is	 designed	 to:	 i)	 recognise	 prevailing	 market	 rates	 for	 non-executive	 directors’	 fees;	 ii)	 reflect	 the	 responsibilities	 and	 time	 commitment	 of	 non-executive	 directors;	 and	 iii)	 attract	 and	 retain	 individuals	 with	 the	 necessary	 skills	 and	 experience	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 future	 growth	 of	 the	 Company.	 The	 non-executive	 directors	 are	 paid	 a	 basic	 monthly	 fee	 of	 £3,000	 with	 additional	 fees	 of	 £420	 per	 month	 for	 each	 Board	 Committee	 membership.	 These	 fees	 are	 neither	 performance	 related	 nor	 pensionable.	 The	 non-executive	 directors	 do	 not	 participate	 in	 any	 of	 the	 Company’s	 bonus	 or	 share	 schemes.	 The	 fees	 for	 non-executive	 directors	 were	 originally	 set	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2003	 and,	 whilst	 they	 have	 since	 been	 reviewed	 regularly,	 they	 have	 not	 been	 changed.	 The	 non-executive	 directors	 have	 contracts	 to	 provide	 services	 to	 the	 Company	 which	 may	 be	 terminated	 by	 either	 party	 at	 any	 time	 on	 giving	 one	 month’s	 notice.	 Fees	 for	 non-executive	 directors	 will	 again	 be	 reviewed	 during	 2006.
During	 2005,	 substantial	 additional	 time	 beyond	 that	 contemplated	 in	 their	 agreements	 was	 necessarily	 devoted	 to	 the	 affairs	 of	 the	 Group	 by	 Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby,	 two	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors.	 Time	 records	 show	 that	 they	 each	 devoted	 the	 equivalent	 of	 54	 days	 to	 Drax	 against	 the	 equivalent	 of	 18.5	 days	 contemplated	 by	 Tim	 Barker’s	 contract	 and	 21	 days	 by	 Mike	 Grasby’s.	 The	 causes	 of	 this	 additional	 time	 primarily	 fell	 into	 three	 areas:		 first,	 the	 need	 to	 recruit	 three	 additional	 directors	 to	 the	 Board,	 including	 	 a	 new	 Chief	 Executive;	 secondly,	 the	 consideration	 and	 handling	 of	 three	 indicative	 bids	 for	 the	 Group’s	 business	 during	 the	 Autumn	 of	 2005;	 and	 thirdly	 the	 implications	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 itself.	 The	 latter	 included	 the	 review	 and	 consideration	 of	 numerous	 documents,	 including	 published	 documents	 involving	 the	 acceptance	 of	 personal	 responsibility	 for	 their	 content.	 After	 taking	 advice	 from	 the	 Company’s	 solicitors,	 its	 Remuneration Report 35  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005

brokers	 and	 its	 remuneration	 consultant,	 the	 executive	 directors,	 the	 new	 non-executive	 directors	 and	 the	 Chairman	 were	 minded	 to	 pay	 additional	 remuneration	 pro-rata	 to	 the	 additional	 time	 commitment.	 This	 proposal	 was	 discussed	 with	 representatives	 of	 the	 Association	 of	 British	 Insurers	 and	 with	 a	 number	 of	 the	 Company’s	 major	 shareholders	 representing	 in	 aggregate	 more	 than	 27%	 of	 the	 shares	 in	 issue	 at	 31	 January	 2006,	 before	 being	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 (Tim	 Barker	 and	 Mike	 Grasby	 taking	 no	 part	 in	 the	 discussion).	 The	 approved	 additional	 payments	 to	 the	 two	 non-executive	 directors,	 are	 as	 follows:
Tim	 Barker	 £88,424
Mike	 Grasby	 £80,331
exeCutives ’ RemuneR ation PoliC y The	 Committees	 have	 consistently	 pursued	 the	 following	 remuneration	 policy	 in	 respect	 of	 executive	 directors	 and	 other	 management	 staff	 since	 the	 Former	 Committee	 was	 first	 established	 early	 in	 2004.	 The	 Committee	 intends	 to	 continue	 to	 apply	 the	 same	 policy	 in	 2006	 and	 thereafter.	 The	 policy	 is	 to:
base	 an	 increasing	 proportion	 of	 total	 pay	 on	 performance;
manage	 salaries	 and	 benefits	 around	 median	 levels	 using	 both	 industry	 and	 cross-industry	 benchmarks;
award	 annual	 cash	 bonuses	 which	 are	 firmly	 linked	 to	 the	 delivery	 of	 Drax’s	 annual	 Business	 Plan	 targets	 and	 personal	 performance;	 and
provide	 all	 our	 staff	 with	 long-term	 incentives	 linked	 to	 the	 value	 of	 Drax’s	 shares	 and	 its	 performance.
The	 objectives	 of	 the	 policy	 are	 to:
strengthen	 teamwork	 at	 all	 levels;
motivate	 executive	 directors	 and	 staff	 to	 ensure	 that	 Drax	 meets	 challenging	 performance	 goals;	 and
enable	 Drax	 to	 recruit	 and	 retain	 the	 expertise	 needed	 to	 consolidate	 and	 develop	 its	 business.
imPlementation of PoliC y The	 remainder	 of	 this	 section	 of	 the	 report	 explains	 how	 this	 policy	 is	 applied	 to	 executive	 directors	 with	 a	 view	 to	 attracting	 and	 retaining	 quality	 individuals	 and	 motivating	 them	 to	 deliver	 sustained	 performance	 improvements.	 The	 balanced	 reward	 package	 includes	 meaningful	 performance-related	 bonus	 opportunities,	 both	 over	 the	 short	 and	 the	 longer	 term.
Total	 rewards	 for	 executive	 directors	 comprise	 base	 pay,	 benefits	 in	 kind,	 pension	 and	 variable	 pay	 (annual	 cash	 bonus	 and	 long-term	 incentive	 plans).	 	 An	 indication	 of	 the	 relative	 significance	 of	 each	 of	 these	 components	 for	 2006	 and	 thereafter	 is	 given	 later	 in	 this	 report.
a) Base Pa y Base	 pay	 and	 benefits	 are	 reviewed	 annually	 from	 1	 April	 and	 are	 determined	 having	 regard	 to	 the	 levels	 paid	 in	 a	 comparator	 group	 of	 utilities,	 power	 generators	 and	 other	 industrial	 companies	 with	 a	 similar	 turnover	 or	 market	 value.	 The	 policy	 is	 to	 set	 base	 pay	 at	 levels	 at	 or	 about	 the	 median	 point	 evident	 from	 the	 comparator	 group.	 For	 2005,	 the	 Company’s	 executive	 directors	 were	 generally	 paid	 salaries	 below	 the	 market	 median	 for	 industrial	 companies	 with	 a	 similar	 turnover	 as	 reported	 in	 the	 Monks	 Partnership	 Management	 Pay	 Report.	 The	 Former	 Committee	 consulted	 that	 publication	 annually	 when	 reviewing	 the	 salaries	 of	 executive	 directors	 and	 the	 Committee	 intends	 to	 continue	 that	 practice.	 Directors’	 base	 pay	 during	 2005	 is	 shown	 in	 the	 emoluments	 table	 in	 Part	 2	 of	 this	 report.	 The	 following	 table	 sets	 out	 the	 current	 annual	 packages	 for	 the	 directors.	 Except	 for	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 (see	 note	 5	 below),	 the	 figures	 are	 those	 effective	 as	 of	 1	 January	 2006	 and	 assume	 “on-target”	 performance	 for	 bonus	 purposes.	 The	 table	 excludes	 benefits	 under	 the	 Executive	 Share	 Incentive	 Plan	 (“ESIP”)	 (see	 below)	 pursuant	 to	 which	 no	 awards	 have	 yet	 been	 made.	 The	 Committee	 intends	 to	 review	 the	 annual	 salaries	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 with	 effect	 from	 1	 April	 2006.

C) Pensions
Drax	 Power	 Limited	 is	 the	 principal	 employer	 of	 the	 Drax	 Group	 of	 the	 Electricity	 Supply	 Pensions	 Scheme	 which	 is	 an	 occupational	 pension	 scheme	 providing	 defined	 benefits	 on	 the	 member’s	 death,	 ill-health,	 early	 retirement	 or	 retirement	 to	 eligible	 members	 and	 beneficiaries	 based	 on	 members’	 length	 of	 pensionable	 service,	 final	 salary	 and	 the	 applicable	 accrual	 rate.	 The	 defined	 benefit	 Pension	 Scheme	 was	 closed	 to	 new	 entrants	 in	 2002.	 Although	 certain	 senior	 managers	 are	 members,	 none	 	 of	 the	 executive	 directors	 are	 eligible	 for	 membership.
Executive	 directors	 and	 those	 senior	 managers	 who	 joined	 the	 group	 	 after	 1	 January	 2002	 are	 entitled	 to	 membership	 of	 the	 Group’s	 defined	 contribution	 pension	 plan.	 The	 employer’s	 contribution	 for	 senior	 managers	 is	 11.5%	 of	 basic	 pay	 (up	 to	 currently	 permitted	 maximum	 pay	 for	 tax	 deductible	 contributions	 of	 £105,600	 per	 annum	 for	 2005).	 The	 employer’s	 contribution	 in	 respect	 of	 executive	 directors	 who	 join	 the	 plan	 is	 20%	 of	 basic	 pay	 up	 to	 the	 currently	 permitted	 maximum	 pay	 for	 tax	 deductible	 contributions,	 with	 any	 balance	 of	 entitlement	 being	 paid	 as	 cash	 and	 subject	 to	 normal	 statutory	 deductions.	 Alternatively,	 at	 their	 option,	 executive	 directors	 may	 either	 have	 contributions	 of	 the	 same	 amounts	 made	 to	 their	 personal	 pension	 schemes	 or	 they	 may	 choose	 to	 be	 paid	 cash	 in	 lieu	 of	 pension	 at	 the	 stated	 rate	 and	 subject	 to	 normal	 statutory	 deductions.	 Details	 of	 the	 pension	 contributions	 for	 executive	 directors	 	 and	 of	 payments	 in	 lieu	 are	 included	 in	 the	 emoluments	 table	 in	 Part	 2	 	 of	 this	 report.
d) v aRiaBle Pa y Variable	 pay	 has	 formed	 a	 significant	 proportion	 of	 the	 potential	 total	 pay	 of	 executive	 directors	 since	 the	 end	 of	 2003	 and	 it	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 intention	 to	 ensure	 that	 a	 significant	 proportion	 of	 total	 potential	 pay	 continues	 to	 be	 at	 risk	 of	 performance.
During	 2005,	 the	 two	 components	 of	 variable	 pay	 for	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 managers	 were	 an	 annual	 cash	 bonus	 and	 participation	 in	 	 the	 LTIP .	 For	 2006	 there	 will	 also	 be	 a	 cash	 bonus	 (with	 the	 same	 performance-related	 structure	 as,	 but	 different	 performance	 targets	 to,	 	 the	 2005	 bonus	 and	 with	 increased	 emphasis	 upon	 personal	 performance).	 However,	 participation	 in	 the	 LTIP	 (which	 matured	 on	 Listing)	 will	 be	 replaced	 by	 participation	 in	 the	 new	 ESIP ,	 details	 of	 which	 are	 given	 	 on	 page	 37.
annual Cash Bonus
During	 2005,	 executive	 directors	 were	 able	 to	 earn	 a	 bonus	 of	 up	 to	 60%	 	 of	 base	 pay	 (with	 an	 on	 target	 bonus	 of	 40%	 of	 base	 pay).	 Senior	 managers	 were	 able	 to	 earn	 up	 to	 50%	 of	 base	 pay	 (with	 an	 on	 target	 of	 33%)	 by	 	 way	 of	 bonus.	 Performance	 targets	 for	 the	 2005	 annual	 bonus	 were	 set	 by	 the	 Former	 Committee	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2004	 and	 were	 designed	 to	 incentivise	 executive	 directors	 to	 deliver	 and	 exceed	 the	 targets	 set	 by	 Drax	 Power’s	 Business	 Plan	 for	 2005.	 The	 targets	 incorporated	 a	 mixture	 of	 financial,	 trading,	 plant,	 safety,	 environmental	 and	 development	 objectives.	 When	 determining	 the	 annual	 bonus	 for	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 managers,	 the	 Committee	 has	 regard	 not	 only	 to	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Company	 against	 its	 Business	 Plan	 targets	 but	 also	 the	 personal	 performance	 of	 the	 individual.	 For	 2006	 the	 Committee	 will	 continue	 this	 approach,	 so	 as	 to	 incentivise	 executive	 directors	 and	 senior	 managers	 to	 deliver	 and	 exceed	 the	 Company’s	 Business	 Plan.
l ong-teRm inCentives The	 Committee	 believes	 that	 employee	 share	 ownership	 plays	 a	 significant	 role	 in	 the	 recruitment,	 motivation	 and	 retention	 of	 staff	 at	 all	 levels	 	 within	 Drax.
a waRds undeR the dR ax gR ouP limited l ong-teRm inCentive Plan (l tiP)
The	 LTIP	 was	 approved	 by	 resolution	 of	 the	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (“DGL”)	 passed	 at	 an	 Extraordinary	 General	 Meeting	 on	 30	 April	 2004	 (the	 “EGM”).	 It	 is	 summarised	 in	 note	 21	 to	 the	 Consolidated	 Financial	 Statements	 on	 pages	 63	 to	 65	 which	 explains	 that:
(1)	 	All	 employees	 were	 capable	 of	 benefiting	 from	 the	 LTIP	 which	 would	 have	 available	 to	 it	 a	 cash	 pool	 of	 £5.1m	 and	 a	 share	 pool	 of	 4,323,600	 non-voting	 shares	 in	 DGL	 (equivalent	 at	 Listing	 to	 12,970,800	 shares	 in	 the	 Company);
(2)	 	Awards	 were	 to	 take	 the	 form	 of:	 (a)	 Initial	 Awards	 of	 shares	 to	 be	 purchased	 before	 31	 May	 2004	 by	 beneficiaries	 at	 13.65	 pence	 per	 DGL	 share	 (considered	 by	 the	 directors	 to	 be	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 value	 of	 a	 non-
voting	 share,	 having	 regard	 to	 the	 restricted	 rights	 attaching	 to	 that	 class	 of	 shares	 and	 the	 value	 at	 which	 the	 DGL	 debt,	 to	 which	 its	 shares	 were	 stapled,	 was	 then	 trading);	 (b)	 cash	 “points”	 giving	 a	 proportionate	 right	 to	 a	 share	 of	 the	 £5.1m	 pool	 conditionally	 upon	 the	 repayment	 of	 the	 company’s	 debt	 and	 the	 beneficiary	 continuing	 to	 be	 employed	 by	 the	 group;	 and	 (c)	 share	 “points”	 giving	 a	 proportionate	 right	 to	 the	 balance	 of	 the	 share	 pool	 after	 allowing	 for	 the	 Initial	 Awards.	 (3)	 	The	 conditional	 right	 to	 shares	 given	 by	 the	 share	 points	 would	 vest,	 provided	 the	 beneficiary	 was	 still	 employed	 by	 the	 group,	 upon	 an	 “Exit”	 event	 (the	 Listing	 was	 such	 an	 event).
Whilst	 the	 Former	 Committee	 had	 the	 discretion	 to	 award	 benefits	 as	 it	 saw	 fit,	 it	 was	 explained	 in	 the	 circular	 to	 shareholders	 for	 the	 EGM	 that	 the	 policy	 would	 be	 to	 allocate	 approximately	 25%	 of	 each	 of	 the	 cash	 and	 share	 points	 as	 Initial	 Awards	 and	 that	 the	 balance	 would	 be	 allocated	 over	 the	 following	 three	 years,	 broadly	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 one	 third	 to	 directors,	 one	 third	 to	 other	 management	 and	 the	 remaining	 third	 among	 all	 other	 staff	 with	 more	 than	 one	 year’s	 service	 at	 the	 time	 of	 an	 Exit	 event.
During	 2005,	 particularly	 after	 the	 process	 leading	 to	 the	 Listing	 began	 in	 Spring	 2005,	 the	 Former	 Committee	 sought	 to	 apply	 these	 principles	 in	 the	 context	 of	 changed	 circumstances	 which	 included:
(1)	 	the	 departure	 of	 the	 former	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 the	 temporary	 assumption	 of	 his	 responsibilities	 by	 the	 Chairman;	 and
(2)	 	the	 significant	 number	 of	 new	 employees	 who	 joined	 between	 December	 2003	 and	 the	 middle	 of	 2005,	 particularly	 senior	 managers	 needed	 to	 meet	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 newly	 independent	 business.
The	 Former	 Committee	 concluded	 that	 the	 proportion	 of	 the	 cash	 and	 share	 pools	 available	 for	 directors	 should	 be	 reduced	 to	 26%	 and	 that	 the	 value	 released	 should	 be	 distributed	 between	 the	 management	 groups	 (excluding	 directors)	 and	 all	 other	 employees.	 A	 decision	 was	 made	 to	 award	 points	 to	 all	 employees	 in	 service	 at	 Listing	 with	 awards	 being	 adjusted	 in	 most	 cases	 to	 reflect	 length	 of	 service.	 Except	 for	 directors	 and	 members	 of	 the	 management	 group’s	 entitlement	 to	 the	 full	 per	 capita	 award	 depended	 on	 36	 months’	 service,	 with	 awards	 to	 those	 with	 less	 service	 being	 proportionately	 reduced.	 Of	 the	 total	 cash	 and	 share	 pools,	 some	 72%	 of	 the	 cash	 and	 74%	 of	 the	 shares	 were	 awarded	 otherwise	 than	 to	 directors.	 The	 effect,	 as	 at	 Listing,	 of	 awards	 to	 directors	 under	 the	 LTIP	 is	 shown		 in	 a	 table	 in	 Part	 2	 of	 this	 report.
With	 a	 view	 to	 evidencing	 their	 commitment	 to	 the	 group	 at	 the	 time	 	 of	 Listing,	 the	 Chairman	 and	 all	 executive	 directors,	 together	 with	 other	 members	 of	 the	 management	 team,	 voluntarily	 entered	 into	 lock-in	 restrictions	 on	 the	 sale	 of	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 which	 they	 held	 or	 received	 in	 consequence	 of	 awards	 made	 to	 them	 under	 the	 LTIP .	 These	 restrictions	 require	 that,	 after	 share	 sales	 sufficient	 to	 meet	 income	 tax	 and	 employee’s	 national	 insurance	 liabilities	 arising	 on	 the	 Listing,	 the	 personnel	 concerned	 will	 continue	 to	 hold	 (subject	 to	 limited	 rights	 of	 transfer	 to	 connected	 parties)	 at	 least	 one	 half	 of	 the	 remaining	 shares	 for	 at	 least	 one	 year	 following	 the	 Listing.	 Substantially	 similar	 restrictions	 also	 apply	 to	 	 defer	 payment	 of	 half	 of	 the	 cash	 element	 receivable	 under	 the	 LTIP .	 37  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Remuneration Report
futuRe shaRe-B ased a waRds As	 explained	 in	 the	 Listing	 Particulars,	 the	 Company	 has	 adopted	 three	 share-based	 plans	 to	 provide	 long-term	 incentives	 for	 its	 executive	 directors,	 senior	 managers	 and	 all	 other	 employees:
1.	 Executive	 Share	 Incentive	 Plan	 (“ESIP”).	 The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 currently	 envisages	 that	 participation	 will	 be	 limited	 to	 executive	 directors	 and	 the	 Group’s	 senior	 managers.
Contingent	 awards	 over	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 are	 intended	 to	 be	 made	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 annually	 under	 the	 plan.	 Subject	 to	 continued	 employment,	 these	 awards,	 or	 some	 proportion	 of	 them,	 will	 vest	 over	 three	 to	 five	 years.	 Except	 to	 the	 extent	 determined	 by	 the	 Committee	 in	 the	 case	 of	 a	 beneficiary	 leaving	 the	 Group	 in	 defined	 circumstances	 and	 before	 the	 end	 of	 an	 ESIP	 cycle,	 no	 part	 of	 an	 award	 will	 vest	 less	 than	 three	 years	 after	 the	 date	 it	 was	 made.	 The	 value	 at	 maturity	 of	 an	 award	 will	 depend	 on	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Company	 as	 determined	 by	 reference	 	 to:	 i)	 a	 comparison	 of	 Drax	 total	 shareholder	 return	 with	 those	 companies	 comprising	 the	 FTSE	 250;	 and	 ii)	 the	 internal	 performance	 of	 the	 Company	 measured	 by	 an	 annual	 performance	 index,	 the	 value	 of	 which	 will	 depend	 on	 performance	 against	 the	 objectives	 contained	 in	 the	 Business	 Plan.	 Below	 a	 minimum	 performance	 hurdle,	 no	 shares	 will	 vest.
The	 Committee	 has	 under	 consideration	 whether	 to	 incentivise	 beneficiaries	 better	 during	 the	 five	 years	 following	 each	 of	 their	 first	 three	 awards	 by	 providing	 for	 early	 vesting	 of	 parts	 of	 each	 of	 those	 awards:	 that	 is,	 subject	 to	 the	 performance	 conditions,	 25%,	 or	 thereabouts,	 of	 each	 of	 the	 first	 two	 awards	 would	 vest	 after	 three	 and	 four	 years	 and	 25%,	 or	 thereabouts,	 of	 the	 third	 award	 would	 vest	 after	 four	 years.
It	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 current	 intention	 to	 launch	 the	 ESIP	 shortly	 and	 that,	 subject	 to	 the	 Committee	 deciding	 that:	 i)	 the	 details	 of	 the	 calculation	 and	 application	 of	 the	 ESIP	 index	 (mentioned	 below)	 have	 been	 settled	 to	 its	 satisfaction;	 and	 ii)	 it	 is	 satisfied	 with	 the	 mechanism	 by	 which	 partial	 early	 vesting	 of	 the	 first	 three	 awards	 is	 to	 be	 implemented,	 the	 plan	 should	 operate	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 following	 principles:
An	 ESIP	 cycle	 with	 a	 duration	 of	 five	 years	 (subject	 to	 any	 early	 vesting	 provisions	 for	 the	 first	 three	 awards)	 starts	 every	 year.	 Drax	 employees	 participate	 in	 the	 ESIP	 at	 the	 invitation	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee.
At	 the	 start	 of	 each	 ESIP	 cycle,	 each	 participant	 will	 be	 set	 an	 Initial	 Award	 comprising	 a	 number	 of	 Drax	 shares.	 The	 Initial	 Award	 represents	 a	 “target”	 number	 of	 shares	 to	 be	 awarded	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 cycle,	 subject	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	 performance	 conditions.
During	 the	 ESIP	 cycle,	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 assessed	 annually	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 against	 the	 external	 and	 internal	 performance	 criteria	 referred	 to	 above	 and	 the	 Company’s	 performance	 will	 be	 expressed	 as	 an	 annual	 ESIP	 Performance	 Index	 in	 the	 range	 0	 to	 150%	 with	 100%	 representing	 “on	 target”	 performance.
Under	 the	 partial	 vesting	 proposals	 for	 the	 first	 three	 Initial	 Awards,	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 from	 the	 Initial	 Award	 vesting	 less	 than	 five	 years	 from	 the	 date	 of	 the	 award	 will	 be	 the	 Initial	 Award	 multiplied	 by	 the	 percentage	 due	 to	 vest	 in	 the	 year,	 multiplied	 by	 a	 Performance	 Factor	 (“PF”)	 for	 the	 period	 since	 the	 date	 of	 the	 Initial	 Award.	 The	 PF	 will	 be	 the	 result	 of	 multiplying	 together	 the	 annual	 ESIP	 Performance	 Index	 values	 since	 the	 date	 of	 the	 Initial	 Award.
The	 Final	 Award	 of	 shares	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 ESIP	 cycle	 will	 be	 the	 Initial	 Award	 (that	 is,	 the	 target	 number	 of	 shares),	 multiplied,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 awards	 subject	 to	 partial	 early	 vesting,	 by	 the	 percentage	 of	 the	 Initial	 Award	 which	 has	 not	 already	 vested,	 multiplied	 by	 a	 Performance	 Factor	 for	 the	 ESIP	 cycle	 which	 is	 the	 result	 of	 multiplying	 together	 the	 annual	 ESIP	 Performance	 Index	 values	 during	 the	 term	 of	 the	 award.	 •

It	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 intention	 that	 participants	 in	 the	 ESIP	 should	 receive	 	 an	 Initial	 Award	 of	 shares	 equivalent	 in	 value	 (as	 of	 the	 award	 date)	 to	 the	 annualised	 cash	 bonus	 they	 were	 paid	 in	 respect	 of	 2005	 or	 the	 “on	 target”	 annual	 bonus	 for	 new	 joiners.
2.	 A	 Share	 Incentive	 Plan	 (“SIP”)	 approved	 by	 HM	 Revenue	 &	 Customs.	 Participation	 is	 open	 to	 all	 employees,	 including	 executive	 directors.	 	 Subject	 to	 the	 limits	 in,	 and	 other	 provisions	 of,	 the	 applicable	 legislation,	 the	 scheme	 allows	 the	 Committee	 to	 make	 to	 each	 participating	 individual	 free	 share	 awards	 worth	 not	 more	 than	 £3,000	 in	 any	 tax	 year	 and,	 within	 lower	 financial	 limits,	 to	 allow	 the	 tax-free	 purchase	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 and	 the	 re-investment	 in	 shares	 of	 dividends	 on	 shares	 already	 purchased.	 Grants	 of	 free	 shares	 may	 reflect	 the	 degree	 to	 which	 performance	 targets	 have	 been	 attained	 and	 may	 be	 subject	 to	 forfeiture	 if	 the	 participant	 voluntarily	 leaves	 the	 employment	 of	 the	 Group	 within	 three	 years.	 Shares	 purchased	 must	 be	 held	 for	 a	 minimum	 period	 of	 five	 years	 for	 the	 participant	 to	 secure	 the	 full	 tax	 advantage	 allowed	 by	 the	 scheme.	 It	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 intention	 to	 launch	 the	 SIP	 shortly	 and	 annually	 in	 subsequent	 years	 and	 that	 the	 plan	 should	 operate	 as	 follows:
All	 Drax	 employees	 will	 be	 invited	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 SIP	 (subject	 only	 to	 such	 restrictions	 as	 are	 imposed	 on	 participation	 by	 HM	 Revenue	 &	 Customs).
All	 Drax	 employees	 should	 have	 an	 Initial	 Award	 of	 shares	 equivalent	 in	 value	 (as	 of	 the	 award	 date)	 to	 £2,000.
From	 2007,	 the	 actual	 value	 of	 shares	 awarded	 each	 year	 shall	 be	 based	 on	 the	 Committee’s	 assessment	 of	 Drax’s	 performance	 for	 the	 preceding	 year.
The	 Committee’s	 assessment	 of	 Drax’s	 annual	 performance	 will	 	 be	 based	 on:	 i)	 actual	 results	 against	 the	 Company’s	 Business	 Plan;	 	 and	 ii)	 Drax’s	 total	 shareholder	 return	 against	 a	 peer	 group	 initially	 comprising	 the	 FTSE	 250.
3.	 A	 Savings	 Related	 Share	 Option	 Plan	 (“SAYE	 plan”)	 approved	 by	 HM	 Revenue	 &	 Customs	 under	 which	 participation	 must	 be	 offered	 on	 similar	 terms	 to	 all	 UK	 resident	 employees	 (including	 executive	 directors)	 of	 the	 Group	 who	 have	 been	 employed	 for	 such	 period	 (not	 exceeding	 five	 years)	 as	 may	 be	 specified	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 when	 making	 invitations.	 The	 scheme	 allows	 the	 amount	 payable	 on	 maturity	 of	 three	 and/or	 five	 year	 savings	 contracts	 with	 an	 approved	 provider	 (Yorkshire	 Building	 Society)	 to	 be	 invested	 by	 each	 participant	 in	 a	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 determined	 by	 reference	 to:	 i)	 the	 price	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 at	 the	 	 date	 of	 entering	 into	 the	 savings	 contract;	 ii)	 the	 amount	 the	 participant	 contracts	 to	 save	 (which	 must	 not	 exceed	 £250	 per	 month);	 and	 iii)	 a	 discount,	 determined	 by	 the	 Committee	 and	 not	 exceeding	 20%,	 to	 the	 price	 of	 a	 share	 (determined	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 scheme).	 It	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 intention	 to	 launch	 the	 SAYE	 scheme	 shortly	 and	 that	 all	 employees	 should	 be	 offered	 the	 opportunity	 to	 participate	 with	 options	 being	 granted	 at	 a	 20%	 discount.

Assuming	 “on	 target”	 Company	 performance	 and	 ignoring	 benefits	 in	 kind,	 car	 allowances	 and	 benefits	 from	 the	 SIP	 and	 SAYE	 scheme,	 until	 ESIP	 awards	 (not	 yet	 made)	 mature,	 variable	 pay	 for	 executive	 directors	 will	 amount	 to	 approximately	 25%	 of	 the	 total	 of	 base	 and	 variable	 pay	 (including	 pension	 contributions).	 As	 the	 ESIP	 has	 not	 yet	 been	 implemented,	 it	 is	 not	 appropriate	 to	 forecast	 relative	 proportions	 of	 remuneration	 when	 the	 first	 and	 subsequent	 ESIP	 	 cycles	 vest.	 seR viCe a gReements foR diReC toRs The	 Committee’s	 policy	 is	 that	 executive	 directors’	 service	 agreements	 should	 be	 of	 indefinite	 duration	 subject	 to	 a	 normal	 retirement	 age	 of	 63	 and	 terminable	 at	 any	 time	 by	 the	 Company	 giving	 12	 months’	 prior	 notice	 and	 by	 the	 executive	 director	 giving	 six	 months’	 prior	 notice.	 In	 order	 to	 recruit	 and	 retain	 specific	 individuals,	 this	 policy	 has	 been	 varied	 in	 the	 following	 respects:
With	 effect	 from	 admission	 and	 for	 a	 period	 of	 two	 years	 thereafter	 Dorothy	 Thompson’s	 service	 agreement	 is	 terminable	 by	 either	 party	 on	 not	 less	 than	 	 12	 months’	 notice	 in	 writing	 and	 thereafter	 by	 giving	 a	 period	 of	 six	 months’	 notice	 in	 writing.
In	 the	 event	 of	 a	 change	 of	 control	 within	 12	 months	 of	 the	 date	 of	 commencement,	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 would	 be	 entitled	 to	 the	 following	 less	 £923,670	 (being	 the	 value	 of	 her	 LTIP	 awards):
(a)	 	a	 sum	 equivalent	 to	 the	 Basic	 Annual	 Salary	 (as	 at	 the	 Termination	 Date)	 for	 a	 period	 of	 18	 months;
(b)	 	a	 payment	 reflecting	 loss	 of	 expectation	 of	 a	 bonus	 based	 on	 achieving	 the	 performance	 targets	 for	 a	 period	 of	 18	 months	 and	 amounting	 to	 40%	 of	 basic	 annual	 salary;	 and
(c)	 	a	 payment	 of	 £54,000	 by	 way	 of	 compensation	 in	 respect	 of	 loss	 of	 the	 executive’s	 contractual	 benefits	 in	 kind.
Such	 payments	 would	 be	 inclusive	 of	 any	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 due	 to	 Dorothy	 Thompson	 on	 termination.
Pursuant	 to	 each	 of	 the	 executive	 directors’	 service	 agreements,	 Drax	 has	 the	 right	 to	 make	 a	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 of	 termination,	 the	 amount	 of	 that	 payment	 being	 the	 salary	 and	 benefits	 that	 would	 have	 accrued	 to	 the	 executive	 director	 during	 the	 contractual	 notice	 period.	 The	 following	 table	 shows	 for	 each	 person	 who	 has	 served	 as	 a	 director	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 at	 any	 time	 during	 the	 year	 ended		 31	 December	 2005,	 the	 date	 of	 the	 service	 agreement	 or	 contract	 for	 services,	 the	 unexpired	 term	 and	 details	 of	 the	 notice	 periods	 together	 with	 any	 provisions	 for	 compensation	 payable	 upon	 early	 termination.

exteRnal aPPointments The	 Committee	 recognises	 that	 executive	 directors	 may	 be	 invited	 to	 become	 non-executive	 directors	 of	 other	 companies,	 and	 that	 such	 appointments	 can	 broaden	 their	 knowledge	 and	 experience	 to	 the	 benefit	 of	 the	 Company.	 No	 executive	 director	 currently	 holds	 a	 directorship	 of	 any	 other	 company	 in	 respect	 of	 which	 he	 receives	 a	 fee	 for	 his	 services	 but	 it	 is	 the	 Committee’s	 policy	 that	 the	 individual	 director	 would	 be	 entitled	 to	 retain	 the	 fees	 in	 respect	 of	 any	 appointment	 approved	 in	 advance	 by	 the	 Committee.	 shaRe PeRfoRmanCe The	 Company	 was	 introduced	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and	 its	 shares	 admitted	 to	 trading	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 (“Listing”),	 16	 elapsed	 days	 (10	 business	 days)	 before	 the	 end	 of	 the	 financial	 year	 on	 31	 December	 2005.

The	 FTSE	 250	 has	 been	 chosen	 as	 the	 comparator	 because	 the	 Company’s	 market	 capitalisation	 is	 comparable	 with	 the	 market	 capitalisations	 of	 the	 larger	 companies	 within	 that	 index.

diReC toRs’ inteRests in the dR ax gR ouP l ong-teRm inCentive Plan The	 following	 table	 shows	 particulars	 of	 the	 directors’	 interests	 during	 2005	 in	 the	 LTIP	 established	 by	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (“DGL”)	 in	 May	 2004.	 Further	 details	 of	 the	 Plan	 are	 given	 in	 note	 21	 to	 the	 Consolidated	 Financial	 Statements	 on	 pages	 63	 to	 65.	 DGL	 was	 the	 holding	 company	 of	 the	 group	 until	 Listing.	 Under	 the	 LTIP ,	 two	 types	 of	 points	 (one	 type	 giving	 a	 conditional	 right	 to	 cash	 and	 the	 other	 a	 conditional	 right	 to	 non-voting	 shares	 in	 DGL)	 were	 allocated	 on	 the	 various	 dates	 shown	 in	 the	 table.	 In	 the	 events	 which	 transpired,	 the	 only	 condition	 to	 the	 vesting	 of	 the	 conditional	 rights	 conferred	 by	 the	 points	 which	 proved	 to	 be	 of	 relevance	 was	 the	 Listing.
The	 absence	 of	 a	 market	 for	 non-voting	 shares	 in	 DGL	 and	 the	 way	 in	 which	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 operated	 meant	 that	 the	 earliest	 time	 at	 which	 a	 value	 could	 be	 attributed	 to	 the	 points	 awarded	 was	 upon	 Listing	 when	 the	 points	 held	 by	 each	 individual	 converted	 to	 a	 right	 to	 a	 proportionate	 share	 (according	 to	 the	 individual’s	 points	 and	 the	 total	 number	 of	 points	 then	 held	 by	 all	 beneficiaries)	 of	 £5.1m	 in	 cash	 and	 of	 a	 number	 of	 shares	 in	 DGL	 which,	 upon	 Listing,	 were	 exchanged	 (at	 the	 rate	 of	 three	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 for	 one	 share	 in	 DGL)	 for	 a	 total	 of	 11,321,031	 shares	 in	 the	 Company.
The	 table	 below	 shows	 cash	 and	 numbers	 of	 shares	 in	 the	 Company,	 not	 in	 DGL.	 The	 total	 value	 (whether	 in	 cash	 or	 shares)	 received	 upon	 or	 (in	 the	 case	 of	 cash)	 receivable	 in	 consequence	 of	 Listing	 by	 an	 individual	 and	 by	 virtue	 of	 points	 awards	 has	 been	 apportioned	 to	 award	 dates,	 rateably	 according	 to	 the	 proportion	 of	 the	 individual’s	 total	 points	 which	 were	 awarded	 to	 him	 or	 her	 on	 each	 award	 date.
In	 addition	 to	 points	 awards,	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 provided	 for	 “Initial	 Awards”	 which	 entitled	 the	 selected	 beneficiaries	 of	 the	 awards	 to	 buy	 non-voting	 shares	 in	 DGL	 in	 May	 2004	 at	 a	 price	 of	 13.65	 pence	 per	 DGL	 share.	 In	 the	 table,	 those	 Initial	 Awards	 are	 shown	 as	 shares	 held	 at	 1	 January	 2005	 and	 the	 numbers	 given	 are	 the	 numbers	 of	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 equivalent	 to	 the	 DGL	 shares	 purchased.
For	 completeness,	 the	 table	 below	 includes	 particulars	 of	 the	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 acquired	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 upon	 Listing	 by	 exchange	 of	 the	 non-voting	 shares	 in	 DGL	 which	 each	 of	 them	 acquired	 in	 May	 2004	 as	 a	 result	 of	 investing	 the	 restructuring	 bonuses	 awarded	 to	 each	 of	 them	 by	 resolution	 of	 the	 shareholders	 of	 DGL	 passed	 on	 30	 April	 2004.
Upon	 Listing:
(a)	 	By	 virtue	 of:	 i)	 the	 cash	 to	 which	 points	 awards	 gave	 a	 right;	 and	 ii)	 the	 exchange	 of	 the	 DGL	 shares	 to	 which	 points	 awarded	 gave	 a	 right,	 each	 director	 became	 absolutely	 entitled	 to	 the	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 and	 to	 receive	 one	 half	 of	 the	 cash	 shown	 in	 the	 column	 headed	 “Total	 benefits	 derived	 from	 points	 awards	 under	 the	 LTIP”.	 Entitlement	 to	 receive	 the	 other	 half	 of	 the	 cash	 sum	 is	 conditional	 upon	 the	 individual	 being	 in	 the	 service	 of	 the	 Group	 on	 15	 December	 2006	 or	 having	 left	 the	 service	 of	 the	 Group	 in	 circumstances	 where	 the	 “good	 leaver”	 provisions	 of	 the	 LTIP	 apply.
(b)	 	All	 scheme	 interests	 vested	 within	 the	 meaning	 of	 Schedule	 7A	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 when	 the	 price	 of	 an	 ordinary	 share	 in	 the	 Company		 was	 £5.00.
The	 Committee	 has	 established	 the	 ESIP	 as	 a	 long-term	 incentive	 plan	 to	 replace	 the	 LTIP	 but	 no	 awards	 have	 yet	 been	 made	 pursuant	 to	 it	 nor	 have	 all	 the	 conditions	 attaching	 to	 awards	 yet	 been	 finally	 determined.

Accounts
To the Members of Drax Group plc
We	 have	 audited	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 which	 comprise	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statements,	 the	 consolidated	 statements	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense,	 the	 consolidated	 balance	 sheets,	 the	 consolidated	 cash	 flow	 statements	 and	 the	 related	 notes	 1	 to	 34.	 These	 group	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 accounting	 policies	 set	 out	 therein.	 We	 have	 also	 audited	 the	 information	 in	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 that	 is	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited.
We	 have	 reported	 separately	 on	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 for	 the	 period	 ended	 31	 December	 2005.	 This	 report	 is	 made	 solely	 to	 the	 company’s	 members,	 as	 a	 body,	 in	 accordance	 with	 section	 235	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 Our	 audit	 work	 has	 been	 undertaken	 so	 that	 we	 might	 state	 to	 the	 company’s	 members	 those	 matters	 we	 are	 required	 to	 state	 to	 them	 in	 an	 auditors’	 report	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 To	 the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	 by	 law,	 we	 do	 not	 accept	 	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 to	 anyone	 other	 than	 the	 company	 and	 the	 company’s	 members	 as	 a	 body,	 for	 our	 audit	 work,	 for	 this	 report,	 or	 for	 	 the	 opinions	 we	 have	 formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The	 directors’	 responsibilities	 for	 preparing	 the	 annual	 report,	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 and	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRSs)	 as	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 European	 Union	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 directors’	 responsibilities.
Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited	 	 in	 accordance	 with	 relevant	 United	 Kingdom	 legal	 and	 regulatory	 requirements	 and	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	 We	 report	 to	 you	 our	 opinion	 as	 to	 whether	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 relevant	 financial	 reporting	 framework	 and	 whether	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 and	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	 Regulation.	 We	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion,	 the	 directors’	 report	 is	 not	 consistent	 with	 the	 group	 financial	 statements.	 We	 also	 report	 to	 you	 if	 we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit,	 or	 if	 information	 specified	 by	 law	 regarding	 directors’	 transactions	 with	 the	 company	 and	 other	 members	 of	 the	 group	 is	 not	 disclosed.
We	 also	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion,	 the	 company	 has	 not	 complied	 with	 any	 of	 the	 four	 directors’	 remuneration	 disclosure	 requirements	 specified	 for	 our	 review	 by	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 of	 the	 Financial	 Services	 Authority.	 These	 comprise	 the	 amount	 of	 each	 element	 in	 the	 remuneration	 package	 and	 information	 on	 share	 options,	 details	 of	 long	 term	 incentive	 schemes,	 and	 money	 purchase	 and	 defined	 benefit	 schemes.	 We	 give	 a	 statement,	 to	 the	 extent	 possible,	 of	 details	 of	 any	 non-compliance.
We	 review	 whether	 the	 corporate	 governance	 statement	 reflects	 the	 company’s	 compliance	 with	 the	 nine	 provisions	 of	 the	 2003	 FRC	 Combined	 Code	 specified	 for	 our	 review	 by	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 of	 the	 Financial	 Services	 Independent Auditors’ Report
Authority,	 and	 we	 report	 if	 it	 does	 not.	 We	 are	 not	 required	 to	 consider	 whether	 the	 board’s	 statement	 on	 internal	 control	 covers	 all	 risks	 and	 controls,	 or	 form	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 group’s	 corporate	 governance	 procedures	 or	 its	 risk	 and	 control	 procedures.
We	 read	 the	 directors’	 report	 and	 the	 other	 information	 contained	 in	 the	 annual	 report	 for	 the	 above	 year	 as	 described	 in	 the	 contents	 section	 including	 the	 unaudited	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 and	 we	 consider	 the	 implications	 for	 our	 report	 if	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	 misstatements	 or	 material	 inconsistencies	 with	 the	 group	 financial	 statements.	 	 Basis of Audit Opinion
We	 conducted	 our	 audit	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland)	 issued	 by	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board.	 An	 audit	 includes	 examination,	 on	 a	 test	 basis,	 of	 evidence	 relevant	 to	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited.	 It	 also	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 significant	 estimates	 and	 judgements	 	 made	 by	 the	 directors	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 group	 financial	 statements,	 and	 of	 whether	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 group’s	 circumstances,	 consistently	 applied	 and	 adequately	 disclosed.
We	 planned	 and	 performed	 our	 audit	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 which	 we	 considered	 necessary	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 us	 with	 sufficient	 evidence	 to	 give	 reasonable	 assurance	 that	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 other	 irregularity	 or	 error.	 In	 forming	 our	 opinion	 we	 also	 evaluated	 the	 overall	 adequacy	 of	 the	 presentation	 of	 information	 in	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited.
Opinion
In	 our	 opinion:
the	 group	 financial	 statements	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view,	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 European	 Union,	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 group’s	 affairs	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 of	 its	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 then	 ended;	 and
the	 group	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 and	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	 Regulation.

1. General Information
Drax	 Group	 plc	 (the	 “Company”)	 is	 a	 company	 incorporated	 in	 England	 and	 Wales	 under	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 (together	 the	 “Group”)	 operate	 in	 the	 electricity	 generation	 industry	 within	 the	 UK.	 The	 address	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc’s	 registered	 office	 and	 principal	 establishment	 is	 Drax	 Power	 Station,	 Selby,	 North	 Yorkshire,	 YO8	 8PQ,	 United	 Kingdom.	 The	 operating	 companies	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 disclosed	 within	 note	 3	 of	 the	 Company’s	 separate	 financial	 statements,	 which	 follow	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.
2. Basis of Preparation
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 all	 applicable	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (“IFRS”)	 including	 all	 International	 Accounting	 Standards	 (“IAS”),	 and	 all	 applicable	 Standing	 Interpretations	 Committee	 (“SIC”)	 and	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Interpretations	 Committee	 (“IFRIC”)	 interpretations	 issued	 by	 the	 International	 Accounting	 Standards	 Board	 (“IASB”)	 and	 endorsed	 by	 the	 EU.
The	 Group’s	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS	 is	 1	 January	 2002,	 being	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 period	 for	 which	 historical	 consolidated	 IFRS	 financial	 information	 was	 prepared	 for	 the	 Prospectus	 issued	 pursuant	 to	 the	 Group’s	 introduction	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and	 to	 the	 trading	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 ordinary	 shares	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 the	 first	 prepared	 by	 the	 Group	 in	 accordance	 with	 accounting	 standards	 as	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 EU	 and	 as	 such	 take	 account	 of	 the	 requirements	 and	 options	 in	 IFRS	 1	 “First-time	 Adoption	 of	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards”	 as	 they	 relate	 to	 the	 comparative	 financial	 information.	 Note	 3	 below	 sets	 out	 how,	 in	 preparing	 these	 financial	 statements,	 the	 directors	 have	 applied	 accounting	 standards	 as	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 EU	 under	 the	 first-time	 adoption	 provisions	 set	 out	 in	 IFRS	 1.	 Certain	 of	 the	 requirements	 and	 options	 in	 IFRS	 1	 relating	 to	 comparative	 financial	 information	 presented	 on	 first-time	 adoption	 may	 result	 in	 a	 different	 application	 of	 accounting	 policies	 in	 the	 financial	 information	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 to	 that	 which	 would	 apply	 if	 those	 were	 the	 first	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 accounting	 standards	 as	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 EU.	 In	 particular,	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 transitional	 arrangements	 set	 out	 in	 IFRS	 1,	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 has	 elected	 not	 to	 restate	 the	 comparative	 financial	 information	 to	 show	 the	 effect	 of	 IAS	 32	 “Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure	 and	 Presentation”	 and	 IAS	 39	 “Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement”	 and,	 as	 a	 consequence,	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004,	 financial	 instruments	 continue	 to	 be	 accounted	 for	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 previous	 policies	 for	 financial	 instruments	 under	 UK	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Principles	 (“UK	 GAAP”).	 In	 contrast,	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005,	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 have	 been	 applied.	 This	 is	 further	 explained	 in	 notes	 3(a),	 3(r)	 and	 3(s)	 below.
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 convention	 basis	 as	 modified	 by	 the	 revaluation	 of	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 following	 the	 application	 of	 IAS	 39	 from	 1	 January	 2005.	 At	 the	 date	 of	 authorisation	 of	 these	 financial	 statements,	 the	 following	 Standards	 and	 Interpretations	 which	 have	 not	 been	 applied	 in	 these	 financial	 statements	 were	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 effective:
IFRS	 6	 	Exploration	 for	 and	 Evaluation	 of	 Mineral	 Resources
IFRS	 7	 	Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosures;	 and	 the	 Related	 Amendment	 to	 IAS	 1	 on	 Capital	 Disclosures
IFRIC	 4	 	Determining	 Whether	 an	 Arrangement	 Contains	 a	 Lease
IFRIC	 5	 	Rights	 to	 Interest	 Arising	 from	 Decommissioning,	 Restoration	 and	 Environmental	 Rehabilitation	 Funds
The	 directors	 anticipate	 that	 the	 adoption	 of	 the	 Standards	 and	 Interpretations	 in	 future	 periods	 will	 have	 no	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group,	 except	 for	 additional	 disclosures	 on	 capital	 and	 financial	 instruments	 when	 the	 relevant	 standards	 come	 into	 effect	 for	 periods	 commencing	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2007.	 	 Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The	 principal	 accounting	 policies	 adopted	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 these	 financial	 statements	 are	 set	 out	 below.	 These	 policies	 have	 been	 consistently	 applied	 to	 both	 years	 presented,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated.
(a) IFRS 1 exemptIonS
The	 Group’s	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS	 is	 1	 January	 2002.	 On	 transition	 to	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 following	 exemptions	 to	 assist	 groups	 with	 the	 transition	 process	 contained	 within	 IFRS	 1:
Business	 combinations:	 the	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 allow	 business	 combinations	 which	 were	 effected	 before	 the	 IFRS	 transition	 date	 to	 be	 exempted	 from	 restatement	 under	 IFRS	 3	 “Business	 Combinations”.
Employee	 benefits:	 the	 cumulative	 actuarial	 losses	 relating	 to	 pensions	 and	 other	 post	 retirement	 benefits	 at	 the	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS	 have	 been	 recognised	 in	 retained	 earnings.
Cumulative	 translation	 reserve:	 the	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 reset	 the	 translation	 reserve	 to	 zero	 at	 the	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS.
Share-based	 payment:	 the	 Group	 has	 only	 applied	 IFRS	 2	 “Share-based	 Payment”	 to	 equity	 instruments	 granted	 after	 Exposure	 Draft	 2	 “Share-
based	 Payment”	 was	 issued	 on	 7	 November	 2002	 and	 that	 have	 not	 vested	 by	 31	 December	 2004.
Financial	 instruments:	 the	 Group	 has	 elected	 not	 to	 prepare	 comparative	 financial	 information	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39.	 These	 standards	 have	 been	 applied	 with	 effect	 from	 1	 January	 2005.

(b) pRIncIpleS undeRly Ing goIng conceRn aSSumptIon The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 on	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 1	 “Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements”.	 The	 directors	 believe	 this	 to	 be	 appropriate	 and	 consistent	 with	 the	 Group’s	 cash	 flow	 and	 profit	 forecasts,	 which	 evidence	 the	 Group’s	 long-term	 profitability.
If	 for	 any	 reason	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 is	 unable	 to	 meet	 its	 financial	 obligations	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 the	 Company	 may	 have	 to	 take	 appropriate	 insolvency	 proceedings	 and	 cease	 to	 be	 a	 going	 concern,	 in	 which	 case	 adjustment	 may	 have	 to	 be	 made	 to	 reduce	 the	 monetary	 values	 of	 assets	 to	 the	 recoverable	 amounts,	 to	 provide	 for	 further	 liabilities	 that	 might	 arise	 and	 to	 reclassify	 the	 non-current	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 as	 current	 assets	 and	 liabilities.
(c) b aSIS oF conSolIdatIon The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 incorporate	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 entities	 controlled	 by	 the	 Company	 made	 up	 to	 the	 reporting	 date	 each	 year.	 Control	 is	 achieved	 where	 the	 Company	 has	 the	 power	 to	 govern	 the	 financial	 and	 operating	 policies	 of	 an	 investee	 entity	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 benefits	 from	 its	 activities.
On	 acquisition,	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 and	 contingent	 liabilities	 of	 a	 subsidiary	 are	 measured	 at	 their	 fair	 values	 at	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition.	 Any	 excess	 of	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 acquisition	 over	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 the	 identifiable	 	 net	 assets	 acquired	 is	 recognised	 as	 goodwill.	 Any	 deficiency	 in	 the	 cost	 of	 acquisition	 below	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 the	 identifiable	 net	 assets	 acquired	 (discount	 on	 acquisition)	 is	 credited	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 period	 of	 acquisition.	 The	 results	 of	 subsidiaries	 acquired	 or	 disposed	 of	 during	 the	 year	 are	 included	 in	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 from	 the	 effective	 date	 of	 acquisition	 or	 up	 to	 the	 effective	 date	 of	 disposal,	 as	 appropriate.	 Where	 necessary,	 adjustments	 are	 made	 to	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 subsidiaries	 to	 bring	 the	 accounting	 policies	 into	 line	 with	 those	 used	 by	 	 the	 Group.
All	 intra-Group	 transactions,	 balances,	 income	 and	 expenses	 are	 eliminated	 on	 consolidation.
The	 Group	 underwent	 a	 financial	 restructuring	 (the	 “Refinancing	 and	 Listing”)	 effective	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 which	 resulted	 in	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 new	 holding	 company,	 Drax	 Group	 plc.

the	 existing	 debt	 of	 the	 Group	 was	 settled,	 partially	 through	 the	 issue	 of	 new	 debt	 and	 partially	 through	 the	 issue	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Also	 on	 15	 December	 2005,	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 was	 introduced	 to	 the	 Official	 List	 of	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and	 its	 ordinary	 shares	 commenced	 trading	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.
Under	 IFRS	 3,	 the	 insertion	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 as	 the	 new	 holding	 company	 has	 been	 accounted	 for	 as	 a	 reverse	 acquisition,	 whereby	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (being	 the	 previous	 Group	 holding	 company),	 the	 legal	 subsidiary,	 acquired	 Drax	 Group	 plc,	 the	 legal	 parent	 company.	 The	 impact	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 the	 Group’s	 debt	 and	 share	 capital	 is	 illustrated	 in	 notes	 16	 and	 22	 respectively.
(d) uSe oF eStImateS
The	 preparation	 of	 financial	 statements	 in	 conformity	 with	 IFRS	 requires	 the	 use	 of	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 reported	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 reported	 amounts	 of	 revenues	 and	 expenses	 during	 the	 reporting	 period.	 Although	 these	 estimates	 are	 based	 on	 management’s	 reasonable	 knowledge	 of	 the	 amount,	 event	 or	 actions,	 actual	 results	 ultimately	 may	 differ	 from	 those	 estimates.	 The	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 have	 a	 significant	 risk	 of	 causing	 a	 material	 adjustment	 to	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 within	 the	 next	 financial	 year	 are	 discussed	 below.
Fixed assets and depreciation	 –	 Estimated	 remaining	 useful	 lives	 and	 residual	 values	 are	 reviewed	 annually,	 taking	 into	 account	 prices	 prevailing	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 carrying	 values	 of	 fixed	 assets	 are	 also	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 where	 there	 has	 been	 a	 trigger	 event	 by	 assessing	 the	 present	 value	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 and	 net	 realisable	 value	 compared	 with	 net	 book	 value.	 The	 calculation	 of	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 and	 residual	 values	 is	 based	 on	 the	 directors’	 reasonable	 estimates	 of	 future	 prices,	 output	 and	 costs,	 and	 is	 therefore	 subjective.
Pensions	 –	 Within	 the	 UK,	 the	 Group	 principally	 operates	 an	 approved	 defined	 benefit	 scheme.	 The	 Group	 accounts	 for	 this	 scheme	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 19	 with	 the	 cost	 of	 providing	 benefits	 determined	 using	 the	 projected	 unit	 credit	 method,	 and	 actuarial	 valuations	 being	 carried	 out	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Inherent	 in	 these	 valuations	 are	 key	 assumptions,	 including	 discount	 rates,	 expected	 returns	 on	 plan	 assets	 and	 salary	 and	 pension	 increases.	 These	 actuarial	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 annually	 and	 modified	 as	 appropriate.	 The	 Group	 believes	 that	 the	 assumptions	 utilised	 in	 recording	 obligations	 under	 the	 scheme	 are	 reasonable	 based	 on	 prior	 experience,	 market	 conditions	 and	 the	 advice	 of	 scheme	 actuaries.	 However,	 actual	 results	 may	 differ	 from	 such	 assumptions.	 Emissions allowances	 –	 Liabilities	 in	 respect	 of	 obligations	 to	 deliver	 emissions	 allowances	 are	 recognised	 as	 incurred	 by	 reference	 to	 generation	 for	 the	 period.	 Any	 liabilities	 recognised	 are	 measured	 based	 on	 the	 current	 estimates	 of	 the	 amounts	 that	 will	 be	 required	 to	 satisfy	 the	 net	 obligation	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 market	 price	 of	 emissions	 allowances	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 actual	 cost	 of	 those	 allowances	 not	 already	 acquired	 may	 be	 different	 and	 the	 number	 of	 allowances	 may	 be	 different,	 as	 actual	 generation	 may	 not	 be	 the	 same	 as	 expected	 generation.
Deferred taxation	 –	 Full	 provision	 is	 made	 for	 deferred	 taxation,	 as	 required	 under	 IAS	 12	 “Income	 Taxes”,	 at	 the	 rates	 of	 tax	 prevailing	 at	 the	 period	 end	 dates	 unless	 future	 rates	 have	 been	 substantively	 enacted.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 recognised	 where	 it	 is	 more	 likely	 than	 not	 that	 they	 will	 be	 recovered.
Derivatives	 –	 The	 Group	 has	 applied	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 from	 1	 January	 2005.	 IAS	 39	 requires	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 to	 be	 recorded	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 at	 their	 fair	 value.	 Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivatives	 are	 recorded	 each	 period	 in	 earnings	 unless	 specific	 hedge	 accounting	 criteria	 are	 met.	 The	 fair	 values	 of	 derivative	 instruments	 for	 commodities	 are	 determined	 using	 forward	 price	 curves.	 Forward	 price	 curves	 represent	 the	 Group’s	 estimates	 of	 the	 prices	 at	 which	 a	 buyer	 or	 seller	 could	 contract	 today	 for	 delivery	 or	 settlement	 of	 a	 commodity	 at	 future	 dates.	 The	 Group	 generally	 bases	 its	 forward	 price	 curves	 upon	 readily	 obtainable	 market	 price	 quotations,	 as	 the	 Group’s	 commodity	 contracts	 do	 not	 generally	 extend	 beyond	 the	 actively	 traded	 portion	 of	 these	 curves.	 However,	 the	 forward	 price	 curves	 used	 are	 only	 an	 estimate	 of	 how	 future	 prices	 will	 move	 and	 are	 therefore	 subjective.
(e) Revenue RecognItIon Revenue	 represents	 amounts	 receivable	 for	 goods	 and	 services	 provided	 in	 the	 normal	 course	 of	 business,	 net	 of	 trade	 discounts,	 VAT	 and	 other	 sales	 related	 taxes	 and	 excluding	 transactions	 with	 or	 between	 wholly-owned	 subsidiaries.
Revenues	 from	 the	 sale	 of	 electricity	 are	 recorded	 based	 upon	 output	 delivered	 at	 rates	 specified	 under	 contract	 terms	 or	 prevailing	 market	 rates	 as	 applicable.
Revenues	 from	 sales	 of	 Renewables	 Obligation	 Certificates	 are	 recorded	 at	 the	 invoiced	 value,	 net	 of	 VAT.	 Revenue	 is	 recognised	 at	 the	 point	 there	 is	 a	 binding	 agreement	 to	 sell.
Where	 goods	 or	 services	 are	 exchanged	 for	 goods	 or	 services	 of	 a	 similar	 nature	 and	 value,	 the	 exchange	 is	 not	 treated	 as	 giving	 rise	 to	 revenue.	 Where	 goods	 or	 services	 are	 exchanged	 for	 goods	 or	 services	 of	 a	 dissimilar	 nature,	 the	 exchange	 is	 treated	 as	 giving	 rise	 to	 revenue.	 The	 revenue	 is	 measured	 at	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 goods	 or	 services	 received,	 adjusted	 by	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 cash	 or	 cash	 equivalents	 received	 or	 paid.	 If	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 goods	 or	 services	 received	 cannot	 be	 measured	 reliably,	 the	 revenue	 is	 measured	 at	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 goods	 or	 services	 given	 up,	 adjusted	 by	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 cash	 or	 cash	 equivalents	 received	 or	 paid.
(F) Segmental RepoR tIng Turnover	 comprises	 primarily	 sales	 of	 electricity	 generated	 by	 the	 Group	 to	 the	 electricity	 wholesale	 market	 in	 England	 and	 Wales.	 As	 such,	 the	 Group	 has	 only	 one	 business	 segment	 and	 one	 geographical	 segment.
(g) goodwIll Goodwill	 represents	 the	 excess	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 purchase	 consideration	 over	 the	 Group’s	 share	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 an	 acquired	 business	 at	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition.	 Goodwill	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 asset	 and	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 at	 least	 annually	 and	 whenever	 there	 is	 an	 indication	 of	 impairment.	 Goodwill	 is	 carried	 at	 cost	 less	 amortisation	 charged	 prior	 to	 the	 Group’s	 transition	 to	 IFRS	 on	 1	 January	 2002	 less	 accumulated	 impairment	 losses.	 Any	 impairment	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 it	 is	 identified.
(h) pR opeR ty , plant and equIpment Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 is	 initially	 measured	 at	 cost.	 Cost	 comprises	 the	 purchase	 price	 (after	 deducting	 trade	 discounts	 and	 rebates),	 any	 directly	 attributable	 costs	 of	 bringing	 the	 asset	 to	 the	 location	 and	 condition	 necessary	 for	 it	 to	 be	 capable	 of	 operating	 in	 the	 manner	 intended	 by	 management,	 and	 the	 initial	 estimate	 of	 costs	 of	 dismantling	 and	 removing	 the	 item	 and	 restoring	 the	 site.	 Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment	 in	 value.	 Freehold	 land	 and	 assets	 in	 the	 course	 of	 construction	 are	 not	 depreciated.	 Depreciation	 is	 provided	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 to	 write-down	 assets	 to	 their	 residual	 value	 evenly	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	 the	 assets	 from	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition	 by	 the	 Group.	 The	 estimated	 remaining	 useful	 lives	 are:

taking	 into	 account	 commercial	 and	 technological	 obsolescence	 as	 well	 as	 normal	 wear	 and	 tear,	 and	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment	 calculated	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36	 “Impairment	 of	 Assets”.	 Residual	 values	 are	 based	 on	 prices	 prevailing	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Subsequent	 costs	 relating	 to	 major	 inspections	 and	 overhauls	 of	 the	 station	 are	 included	 in	 the	 asset’s	 carrying	 amount	 or	 recognised	 as	 a	 separate	 asset,	 as	 appropriate,	 if	 the	 recognition	 criteria	 of	 IAS	 16	 “Property,	 Plant	 and	 Equipment”	 are	 met,	 namely	 when	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 economic	 benefits	 associated	 with	 the	 item	 will	 flow	 to	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 item	 can	 be	 measured	 reliably.	 All	 other	 repairs	 and	 maintenance	 costs	 are	 expensed	 as	 incurred.	 (I) ImpaIRment oF tangIble aSSet S
At	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Group	 reviews	 its	 tangible	 assets	 to	 determine	 whether	 there	 is	 any	 indication	 that	 these	 assets	 may	 have	 suffered	 an	 impairment	 loss.	 If	 such	 an	 indication	 exists,	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 is	 assessed	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 net	 present	 value	 of	 expected	 future	 cash	 flows	 of	 the	 asset	 (value-in-use)	 or	 fair	 value	 less	 selling	 costs,	 if	 higher.	 If	 an	 asset	 is	 impaired,	 a	 provision	 is	 made	 to	 reduce	 its	 carrying	 amount	 to	 the	 estimated	 recoverable	 amount.	 The	 discount	 rate	 applied	 is	 a	 pre-tax	 rate	 based	 upon	 the	 Group’s	 weighted	 average	 cost	 of	 capital	 and	 reflects	 the	 current	 market	 assessment	 of	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 business.
During	 the	 year	 to	 31	 December	 2002,	 the	 Group	 performed	 an	 impairment	 review	 following	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 long-term	 power	 purchase	 agreement	 with	 TXU	 Europe	 Energy	 Limited	 (the	 “TXU	 Hedging	 Contract”)	 and	 its	 related	 income	 streams.	 This	 resulted	 in	 the	 write	 down	 of	 goodwill	 to	 nil,	 and	 a	 provision	 for	 impairment	 of	 £20.4	 million	 against	 tangible	 fixed	 assets,	 to	 write	 down	 the	 assets	 to	 their	 estimated	 recoverable	 amount.
In	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36,	 the	 Group	 assessed	 at	 each	 subsequent	 reporting	 date	 whether	 there	 was	 any	 indication	 that	 the	 impairment	 loss	 recognised	 at	 31	 December	 2002	 should	 be	 reversed.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 assessment	 performed	 at	 30	 June	 2005	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 the	 financial	 information	 prepared	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing,	 which	 highlighted	 significant	 increases	 in	 wholesale	 electricity	 prices	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 been	 able	 to	 achieve	 in	 its	 forward	 contractual	 position,	 the	 Group	 recorded	 a	 reversal	 of	 the	 tangible	 fixed	 asset	 impairment	 of	 £19.0	 million.	 This	 represents	 a	 reversal	 of	 the	 total	 impairment	 loss	 recognised	 at	 31	 December	 2002	 after	 adjusting	 for	 depreciation.
(j) decommISSIonIng coSt S
Provision	 is	 made	 for	 the	 estimated	 decommissioning	 costs	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 the	 Group’s	 generating	 assets,	 if	 and	 when	 a	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligation	 arises,	 on	 a	 discounted	 basis.	 The	 amount	 provided	 represents	 the	 present	 value	 of	 the	 expected	 costs.	 An	 amount	 equivalent	 to	 the	 initial	 provision	 is	 capitalised	 within	 tangible	 fixed	 assets	 and	 is	 depreciated	 over	 the	 useful	 lives	 of	 the	 related	 assets.	 The	 unwinding	 of	 the	 discount	 is	 included	 in	 interest	 payable	 and	 similar	 charges.
(k) InventoRIeS
Operating	 stocks	 of	 fuel	 and	 consumables	 are	 valued	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 average	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value.
The	 Group	 is	 able	 to	 claim	 Renewables	 Obligation	 Certificates	 (“ROCs”)	 from	 the	 Office	 of	 Gas	 and	 Electricity	 Markets	 (“OFGEM”)	 as	 a	 result	 of	 burning	 renewable	 fuels.	 A	 market	 exists	 for	 sale	 of	 ROCs	 and	 the	 Group	 recognises	 income	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 at	 the	 point	 where	 there	 is	 a	 binding	 agreement	 to	 sell	 ROCs	 to	 a	 third	 party	 which	 transfers	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership.	 The	 attributable	 incremental	 cost	 of	 generating	 ROCs	 above	 that	 of	 burning	 coal	 is	 included	 within	 inventory	 in	 respect	 of	 ROCs	 earned	 but	 not	 yet	 sold	 and	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 only	 as	 sales	 of	 ROCs	 are	 recorded.	 The	 inventory	 value	 is	 stated	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value.	 (l) emISSIonS allowanceS
The	 Group	 recognises	 its	 free	 emissions	 allowances	 received	 under	 the	 National	 Allocation	 Plan	 at	 nil	 cost.	 Any	 additional	 allowances	 purchased	 in	 the	 market	 are	 recorded	 at	 cost.	 The	 Group	 also	 recognises	 a	 liability	 in	 respect	 of	 its	 obligations	 to	 deliver	 emissions	 allowances.	 The	 charge	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 and	 the	 related	 liability	 is	 measured	 based	 on	 the	 current	 estimates	 of	 the	 amounts	 that	 will	 be	 required	 to	 satisfy	 the	 net	 obligation,	 taking	 into	 account	 free	 allowances	 allocated	 under	 the	 National	 Allocation	 Plan,	 market	 purchases	 and	 forward	 contracts	 already	 in	 place.	 This	 accounting	 policy	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policy	 previously	 applied	 under	 UK	 GAAP .	 It	 does	 not	 reflect	 the	 accounting	 rules	 contained	 within	 IFRIC	 3	 “Emission	 Rights”,	 as	 IFRIC	 3	 was	 withdrawn	 by	 the	 International	 Accounting	 Standards	 Board	 in	 June	 2005.
(m) t axatIon 
Current	 tax	 is	 provided	 at	 amounts	 expected	 to	 be	 paid	 (or	 recovered)	 using	 the	 tax	 rates	 and	 laws	 that	 have	 been	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 by	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 the	 tax	 expected	 to	 be	 payable	 or	 recoverable	 on	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 and	 the	 corresponding	 tax	 bases	 used	 in	 the	 computation	 of	 taxable	 profits,	 and	 is	 accounted	 for	 using	 the	 balance	 sheet	 liability	 method.	 Deferred	 tax	 liabilities	 are	 generally	 recognised	 for	 all	 taxable	 temporary	 differences	 and	 deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 recognised	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 taxable	 profit	 will	 be	 available	 against	 which	 deductible	 temporary	 differences	 can	 be	 utilised.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 calculated	 at	 the	 tax	 rates	 that	 are	 expected	 to	 apply	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 liability	 is	 settled	 or	 the	 asset	 is	 realised,	 and	 is	 charged	 in	 the	 income	 statement,	 except	 where	 it	 relates	 to	 items	 charged	 or	 credited	 to	 equity	 via	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense,	 in	 which	 case	 the	 deferred	 tax	 is	 also	 dealt	 with	 in	 equity	 and	 is	 shown	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense.

(o) penSIon and otheR poSt RetIRement beneFIt S
The	 Group	 provides	 pensions	 through	 an	 approved	 industry	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 and	 a	 defined	 contribution	 scheme.	 The	 cost	 of	 providing	 benefits	 under	 the	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 is	 determined	 using	 the	 projected	 unit	 credit	 method,	 with	 actuarial	 valuations	 being	 carried	 out	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 additional	 option	 within	 the	 Amendment	 to	 IAS	 19	 “Employee	 Benefits	 –	 Actuarial	 Gains	 and	 Losses,	 Group	 Plans	 and	 Disclosures”,	 to	 recognise	 all	 actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 occur	 outside	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense.
The	 current	 service	 cost	 element	 of	 the	 pension	 charge	 is	 deducted	 in	 arriving	 at	 operating	 profit.	 The	 retirement	 benefits	 obligation	 recognised	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 represents	 the	 net	 deficit	 in	 the	 Group’s	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 scheme,	 gross	 of	 deferred	 tax.
For	 the	 defined	 contribution	 scheme,	 the	 Group	 pays	 contributions	 to	 publicly	 or	 privately	 administered	 pension	 insurance	 plans	 on	 a	 mandatory,	 contractual	 or	 voluntary	 basis.	 The	 Group	 has	 no	 further	 payment	 obligations	 once	 the	 contributions	 have	 been	 paid.	 The	 contributions	 are	 recognised	 as	 employee	 benefit	 expense	 when	 they	 are	 due	 to	 be	 paid.	 (p) ShaRe-baSed pa yment The	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 IFRS	 1	 exemption	 to	 only	 apply	 IFRS	 2	 to	 awards	 granted	 since	 Exposure	 Draft	 2	 was	 issued	 on	 7	 November	 2002,	 and	 which	 have	 not	 vested	 by	 31	 December	 2004.	 Share-based	 payments	 are	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant.	 The	 fair	 value	 determined	 at	 the	 grant	 date	 of	 share-based	 payments	 is	 expensed	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 vesting	 period,	 based	 on	 an	 estimate	 of	 the	 shares	 that	 will	 50  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005

ultimately	 vest.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 share-based	 payments	 under	 the	 Group’s	 Long-Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 (the	 “LTIP”)	 has	 been	 calculated	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 equity	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant	 (note	 21).

The	 accounting	 policies	 below,	 which	 have	 been	 applied	 in	 preparing	 the	 IFRS	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004,	 are	 those	 policies	 applied	 by	 the	 Group	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 for	 the	 year	 then	 ended.	 The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 revised	 accounting	 policies	 for	 financial	 instruments	 from	 1	 January	 2005,	 the	 date	 of	 implementation	 of	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39.	 These	 revised	 policies	 are	 detailed	 in	 note	 3(S)	 below.
The	 Group	 uses	 a	 range	 of	 derivative	 instruments,	 including	 interest	 rate	 swaps,	 energy-based	 futures	 contracts	 and	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 for	 hedging	 purposes.	 Debt instruments	 –	 All	 borrowings	 are	 stated	 at	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 consideration	 received	 after	 deduction	 of	 issue	 costs.	 The	 issue	 costs	 and	 interest	 payable	 on	 debt	 instruments	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 at	 a	 constant	 rate	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instruments.
Interest rate swaps	 –	 These	 are	 used	 to	 manage	 debt	 interest	 rate	 exposures.	 Amounts	 payable	 or	 receivable	 in	 respect	 of	 these	 agreements	 are	 recognised	 as	 adjustments	 to	 interest	 expense	 over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 contracts.
Forward contracts	 –	 The	 Group	 enters	 into	 forward	 contracts	 for	 the	 purchase	 and	 /	 or	 sale	 of	 foreign	 currencies	 in	 order	 to	 manage	 its	 exposure	 to	 fluctuations	 in	 currency	 rates.	 The	 cash	 flows	 from	 forward	 purchase	 contracts	 are	 classified	 in	 a	 manner	 consistent	 with	 the	 underlying	 nature	 of	 the	 hedged	 transaction.	 Hence	 unrealised	 gains	 and	 losses	 on	 contracts	 hedging	 forecast	 transactions	 are	 not	 accounted	 for	 until	 the	 maturity	 of	 the	 contract.	 Foreign	 currency	 debtors	 and	 creditors	 that	 are	 hedged	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 exchange	 rate	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 All	 energy-based	 futures	 contracts	 are	 accrual	 accounted	 as	 hedges	 of	 future	 generation.	 Interest	 differentials	 on	 derivative	 instruments	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 as	 interest	 costs	 in	 the	 period	 to	 which	 they	 relate.

The	 Group	 has	 applied	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 in	 the	 financial	 year	 beginning	 1	 January	 2005.	 In	 accordance	 with	 the	 transitional	 arrangements	 set	 out	 in	 IFRS	 1,	 the	 Group	 has	 not	 restated	 the	 prior	 year’s	 comparative	 figures	 to	 show	 the	 effect	 of	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39.	 For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004,	 financial	 instruments	 continue	 to	 be	 accounted	 for	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 previous	 policies	 for	 financial	 instruments	 under	 UK	 GAAP ,	 as	 set	 out	 in	 note	 3(R)	 above.
IAS	 39	 requires	 that	 all	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 be	 measured	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 with	 changes	 in	 fair	 value	 reported	 through	 the	 income	 statement,	 or	 the	 hedge	 reserve	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 contracts	 are	 considered	 effective	 hedges.

IAS	 32	 prescribes	 certain	 disclosures	 on	 the	 use	 and	 impact	 of	 financial	 instruments	 designed	 to	 help	 the	 users	 of	 accounts	 understand	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 financial	 instruments	 to	 an	 entity’s	 financial	 position,	 performance	 and	 cash	 flows,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 factors	 that	 affect	 amounts,	 timing	 and	 risks	 associated	 with	 future	 cash	 flows.
Financial	 liability	 and	 equity	 instruments	 are	 classified	 according	 to	 the	 substance	 of	 the	 contractual	 arrangements	 entered	 into.	 An	 equity	 instrument	 is	 any	 contract	 that	 evidences	 residual	 interest	 in	 the	 assets	 of	 the	 Group	 after	 deducting	 all	 of	 its	 liabilities.
Debt instruments	 –	 The	 Group	 measures	 all	 debt	 instruments,	 whether	 financial	 assets	 or	 financial	 liabilities,	 initially	 at	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 consideration	 paid	 or	 received.	 Transaction	 costs	 (any	 such	 costs	 incremental	 and	 directly	 attributable	 to	 the	 issue	 of	 the	 financial	 instrument)	 are	 included	 in	 the	 calculation	 of	 the	 effective	 interest	 rate	 and	 are,	 in	 effect,	 amortised	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instrument.	 Subsequent	 to	 initial	 measurement,	 debt	 instruments	 are	 measured	 at	 amortised	 cost	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 method.
Commodity contracts	 –	 Where	 possible,	 the	 Group	 takes	 the	 own	 use	 exemption	 permitted	 by	 IAS	 39	 for	 commodity	 contracts	 entered	 into	 and	 held	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 the	 Group’s	 own	 purchase,	 sale	 or	 usage	 requirements.	 Commodity	 contracts	 which	 do	 not	 qualify	 for	 the	 own	 use	 exemption	 are	 dealt	 with	 as	 derivatives	 and	 are	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 with	 changes	 in	 fair	 value	 reflected	 through	 the	 income	 statement,	 or	 the	 hedge	 reserve	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 contracts	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges.	 Treasury derivatives	 –	 The	 Group	 uses	 a	 number	 of	 derivatives	 to	 manage	 exposure	 to	 interest	 rate	 and	 currency	 fluctuations.	 Treasury	 related	 derivatives	 are	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 with	 changes	 in	 fair	 value	 reflected	 through	 the	 income	 statement,	 or	 the	 hedge	 reserve	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 derivatives	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges.	 Income	 statement	 movements	 under	 interest	 rate	 hedges	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 adjustments	 to	 finance	 cost	 /	 income	 for	 the	 period.
Share capital	 –	 Ordinary	 shares	 are	 classified	 as	 equity.	 Incremental	 costs	 directly	 attributable	 to	 the	 issue	 of	 new	 shares	 or	 options	 are	 shown	 in	 equity	 as	 a	 deduction,	 net	 of	 tax,	 from	 the	 proceeds.	 The	 share	 premium	 account	 records	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 nominal	 value	 of	 shares	 issued	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 consideration	 received.
Cash at bank and in hand	 –	 Cash	 at	 bank	 and	 in	 hand	 includes	 cash	 in	 hand,	 deposits	 held	 at	 call	 with	 banks,	 other	 short-term	 highly	 liquid	 investments	 with	 original	 maturities	 of	 three	 months	 or	 less,	 and	 bank	 overdrafts.	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 the	 cash	 flow	 statement,	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 excludes	 debt	 service	 reserve	 and	 escrow	 account	 balances	 as	 these	 balances	 are	 restricted	 and	 can	 only	 be	 used	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 debt	 service,	 and	 payment	 of	 certain	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 fees	 and	 expenses	 respectively.
Trade receivables	 –	 Trade	 receivables	 are	 recognised	 initially	 at	 fair	 value	 less	 provision	 for	 impairment.	 A	 provision	 for	 impairment	 of	 trade	 receivables	 is	 established	 where	 there	 is	 objective	 evidence	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 collect	 all	 amounts	 due	 according	 to	 the	 original	 terms	 of	 receivables.

4. Financial Risk Management
The	 Group’s	 activities	 expose	 it	 to	 a	 variety	 of	 financial	 risks	 including	 commodity	 price	 risk,	 counterparty	 risk,	 interest	 rate	 risk	 and	 foreign	 currency	 risk.	 The	 Group’s	 overall	 risk	 management	 programme	 focuses	 on	 the	 unpredictability	 of	 commodity	 and	 financial	 markets	 and	 seeks	 to	 manage	 potential	 adverse	 effects	 on	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 performance.	 The	 Group	 uses	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 to	 hedge	 certain	 risk	 exposures.
Risk	 management	 is	 carried	 out	 by	 a	 Trading	 and	 Risk	 Management	 Committee	 and	 central	 treasury	 function	 which	 identify,	 evaluate	 and	 hedge	 financial	 risks	 in	 close	 co-operation	 with	 the	 Group’s	 trading	 function	 under	 policies	 approved	 by	 the	 Board	 of	 directors.
c ommodIty RISk The	 Group	 is	 exposed	 to	 the	 effect	 of	 fluctuations	 in	 commodity	 prices,	 particularly	 the	 price	 of	 electricity,	 which	 is	 the	 commodity	 produced	 by	 the	 Group,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 price	 of	 coal	 (and	 other	 fuels),	 which	 is	 essential	 to	 the	 production	 of	 electricity,	 and	 since	 1	 January	 2005,	 the	 price	 of	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances.	 Price	 variations	 and	 market	 cycles	 have	 historically	 influenced	 the	 financial	 results	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 are	 expected	 to	 continue	 to	 do	 so.
The	 Group	 has	 a	 policy	 of	 making	 sales	 of	 power	 when	 profitable	 compared	 with	 marginal	 costs	 of	 fuel	 and	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances.
The	 Group	 purchases	 coal	 on	 either	 fixed	 or	 variable	 priced	 contracts	 with	 different	 maturities	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 sources.	 The	 Group	 purchases	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances	 on	 fixed	 price	 contracts	 with	 different	 maturity	 dates	 from	 a	 range	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 sources.
c ounteRpaR ty RISk As	 the	 Group	 relies	 on	 third-party	 suppliers	 for	 the	 delivery	 of	 coal	 and	 other	 goods	 and	 services,	 it	 is	 exposed	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 non-performance	 by	 these	 third-party	 suppliers.	 The	 Group	 purchases	 a	 significant	 majority	 of	 its	 coal	 under	 contracts	 with	 UK	 Coal	 Mining	 Limited	 (“UK	 Coal”).	 There	 is	 a	 risk	 that	 if	 UK	 Coal	 falls	 into	 financial	 difficulty	 and	 /	 or	 fails	 to	 deliver	 against	 the	 contracts,	 there	 would	 be	 additional	 costs	 associated	 with	 securing	 coal	 from	 other	 suppliers.	 Should	 UK	 Coal	 fall	 into	 administration,	 the	 Group	 could	 be	 subject	 to	 temporary	 loss	 of	 deliveries,	 higher	 coal	 prices	 and	 accelerated	 payments.
The	 Group	 enters	 into	 fixed	 price	 contracts	 for	 the	 sale	 of	 electricity	 to	 a	 number	 of	 counterparties.	 The	 failure	 of	 one	 or	 more	 of	 these	 counterparties	 to	 perform	 their	 contractual	 obligations	 may	 cause	 the	 Group	 financial	 distress	 or	 increase	 the	 risk	 profile	 of	 the	 Group.
The	 investment	 of	 surplus	 cash	 is	 undertaken	 to	 maximise	 the	 return	 within	 Board	 approved	 policies.	 These	 policies	 set	 out	 minimum	 rating	 requirements,	 maximum	 investment	 with	 any	 one	 counterparty	 and	 the	 maturity	 profile.
InteReSt Rate RISk The	 Group	 is	 exposed	 to	 interest	 rate	 risk	 principally	 in	 relation	 to	 its	 outstanding	 bank	 debt.	 In	 particular,	 it	 is	 exposed	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 LIBOR	 interest	 rate	 of	 sterling-denominated	 debt,	 as	 substantially	 all	 of	 its	 debt	 is	 both:	 i)	 denominated	 in	 sterling;	 and	 ii)	 and	 has	 a	 variable	 LIBOR	 rate.	 The	 Group	 partially	 manages	 this	 risk	 with	 interest	 rate	 hedges	 on	 a	 proportion	 of	 its	 debt	 facilities.	 Information	 about	 the	 Group’s	 instruments	 that	 are	 exposed	 to	 interest	 rate	 risk	 and	 their	 repayment	 schedules	 is	 included	 in	 note	 16.
FoReIgn cuRRency RISk Foreign	 currency	 exchange	 contracts	 are	 principally	 entered	 into	 to	 hedge	 the	 Group’s	 requirement	 to	 purchase	 coal	 from	 international	 sources	 in	 US	 dollars	 and	 to	 purchase	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances	 in	 Euros.

Income FRom txu admInIStR atIon On	 14	 October	 2002,	 TXU	 Corporation	 withdrew	 financial	 support	 for	 its	 subsidiary	 TXU	 Europe	 Group	 Plc	 (“TXU	 Group”).	 As	 a	 consequence	 of	 this,	 on	 18	 November	 2002,	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 terminated	 the	 TXU	 Hedging	 Contract	 with	 TXU	 Europe	 Energy	 Trading	 Limited	 (“TXU	 Europe”),	 a	 subsidiary	 of	 TXU	 Group,	 to	 minimise	 financial	 exposure	 due	 to	 credit	 risk.	 On	 terminating	 the	 TXU	 Hedging	 Contract,	 Drax	 Power	 Limited	 issued	 a	 claim	 (the	 “TXU	 Claim”),	 ultimately	 agreed	 by	 the	 Administrators	 of	 TXU	 Europe	 and	 TXU	 Group	 at	 approximately	 £348	 million	 (including	 VAT),	 in	 respect	 of	 unpaid	 power	 purchased	 by	 TXU	 Europe	 and	 liquidated	 damages	 for	 default	 under	 the	 TXU	 Hedging	 Contract.	 The	 claim	 was	 not	 recognised	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 in	 2002.
On	 30	 March	 2005,	 the	 Group	 received	 a	 first	 distribution	 of	 £204.7	 million	 (net	 of	 VAT	 and	 a	 payment	 by	 the	 Group	 to	 TXU	 Europe	 Limited)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 This	 amount	 was	 subsequently	 paid	 to	 B	 Debt	 holders	 on	 15	 April	 2005	 (note	 16).	 On	 2	 August	 2005,	 the	 Group	 received	 a	 second	 distribution	 of		 £51.1	 million	 (net	 of	 VAT)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 This	 amount	 was	 subsequently	 paid	 to	 B	 Debt	 holders	 on	 17	 August	 2005	 (note	 16).	 On	 19	 January	 2006,	 	 Accounts
52  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
the	 Group	 received	 a	 third	 distribution	 of	 £55.1	 million	 (net	 of	 VAT)	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 The	 third	 distribution	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 and,	 together	 with	 the	 first	 and	 second	 distributions,	 resulted	 in	 total	 exceptional	 operating	 income	 of	 £310.9	 million	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 third	 distribution	 is	 included	 as	 a	 receivable	 balance	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 (note	 13).	 This	 amount	 was	 used	 to	 make	 a	 prepayment	 of	 the	 Group’s	 Bridge	 loan	 on	 23	 January	 2006	 (note	 16).
At	 the	 time	 of	 approving	 the	 financial	 statements	 the	 Group	 had	 a	 further	 £26	 million	 (including	 VAT)	 outstanding	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.	 The	 directors	 have	 reasonable	 expectations	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 receive	 repayment	 of	 this	 amount	 broadly	 in	 full	 by	 early	 in	 2007.	 However,	 due	 to	 the	 contingent	 nature	 of	 insolvency	 proceedings,	 there	 remains	 uncertainty	 over	 the	 timing	 and	 amount	 of	 further	 distributions	 to	 be	 determined	 by	 the	 TXU	 Administrators,	 and	 consequently	 these	 further	 amounts	 have	 not	 been	 recognised	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 at	 31	 December	 2005.

The	 calculation	 of	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 outstanding	 assumes	 that	 the	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 issued	 to	 the	 existing	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 were	 in	 issue	 either	 at	 1	 January	 2004	 (to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 related	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 shares	 were	 in	 issue	 at	 1	 January	 2004),	 or	 from	 the	 date	 of	 issue	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 	 shares	 (to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 related	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 shares	 were	 issued	 after	 1	 January	 2004).
The	 Group	 has	 no	 contingently	 issuable	 shares.	 Accordingly,	 there	 is	 no	 difference	 between	 basic	 and	 diluted	 earnings	 per	 share.
Reconciliations	 of	 the	 earnings	 and	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	 shares	 used	 in	 the	 calculation	 are	 set	 out	 below.

10. Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Fixed Assets
During	 the	 year	 to	 31	 December	 2002,	 the	 Group	 performed	 an	 impairment	 review	 following	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 TXU	 Hedging	 Contract	 and	 its	 related	 income	 streams.	 This	 resulted	 in	 the	 write	 down	 of	 goodwill	 to	 nil,	 and	 a	 provision	 for	 impairment	 of	 £20.4	 million	 against	 tangible	 fixed	 assets,	 to	 write	 down	 the	 assets	 to	 their	 estimated	 recoverable	 amount.
In	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 36,	 the	 Group	 assessed	 at	 each	 subsequent	 reporting	 date	 whether	 there	 was	 any	 indication	 that	 the	 impairment	 loss	 recognised	 at	 31	 December	 2002	 should	 be	 reversed.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 assessment	 performed	 at	 30	 June	 2005	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 the	 financial	 information	 prepared	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing,	 which	 highlighted	 significant	 increases	 in	 wholesale	 electricity	 prices	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 been	 able	 to	 achieve	 in	 its	 forward	 contractual	 position,	 the	 Group	 recorded	 a	 reversal	 of	 the	 tangible	 fixed	 asset	 impairment	 of	 £19.0	 million	 (£13.3	 million	 net	 of	 tax).	 This	 represents	 a	 reversal	 of	 the	 total	 impairment	 loss	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 tangible	 fixed	 assets	 at	 31	 December	 2002	 after	 adjusting	 for	 depreciation	 (note	 5).
The	 assessments	 are	 performed	 using	 value-in-use	 calculations	 based	 on	 a	 long-term	 discounted	 cash	 flow	 model	 designed	 specifically	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 the	 impairment	 review.	 The	 key	 assumptions	 used	 in	 the	 model	 include:	 power	 generation	 levels,	 power	 prices,	 fuel	 prices,	 operating	 cost	 inflation,	 capital	 expenditure	 and	 the	 discount	 rate.	 An	 indication	 of	 the	 key	 assumptions	 used	 for	 the	 value-in-use	 calculations	 performed	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 and	 30	 June	 2005	 is	 set	 out	 below:
	 	 	 	 	 	 As 	 at	 As at	 	 	 	 	 	 	 31 	 December	 30 June	 	 	 	 	 	 	 2004	 2005
Average annual amounts included in long-term discounted cash flow model for:
Generation	 (million	 MWh)	 	 	 	 	 	 21.6	 21.0
Power	 price	 (£/MWh)	 	 	 	 	 	 44.7	 45.8
Gross	 margin	 (%)	 	 	 	 	 	 57.5	 60.4
Operating	 cost	 inflation	 (%)	 	 	 	 	 	 1.9	 2.3
Capital	 expenditure	 (£’m)	 	 	 	 	 	 15.2	 22.5
Discount	 rate	 (%)	 	 	 	 	 	 12.2	 12.3
Power	 and	 fuel	 prices	 were	 based	 on	 forward	 curves	 for	 the	 periods	 for	 which	 they	 were	 available	 and	 generation	 on	 plant	 availability	 and	 forecast	 generation	 profiles	 at	 the	 time	 of	 performing	 the	 reviews.	 Projected	 power	 and	 fuel	 prices	 were	 calculated	 utilising	 growth	 rates	 between	 2.5%	 and	 2.7%	 beyond	 available	 forward	 curves.	 The	 discount	 rate	 applied	 was	 the	 pre-tax	 rate	 based	 upon	 the	 Group’s	 weighted	 average	 cost	 of	 capital	 at	 the	 time	 of	 performing	 the	 reviews	 (i.e.	 prior	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005).
The	 directors	 consider	 with	 reference	 to	 both	 external	 and	 internal	 sources	 of	 information	 that	 no	 indication	 of	 impairment	 existed	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2005.	 Accordingly	 a	 value-in-use	 calculation	 has	 not	 been	 performed	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 IAS	 36.

The	 Group’s	 debt	 structure	 consisted	 of	 loans	 and	 notes	 held	 by	 InPower	 2	 Limited	 (“InPower	 2”)	 and	 NoteCo	 Limited	 (“NoteCo”).	 InPower	 2	 and	 NoteCo	 	 are	 special	 purpose	 entities	 resident	 in	 Jersey	 and	 were	 utilised	 specifically	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 holding	 the	 debt	 of	 the	 Group.	 Although	 InPower	 2	 and	 NoteCo	 are	 not	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 in	 accordance	 with	 SIC	 12	 “Consolidation	 –	 Special	 Purpose	 Entities”,	 they	 have	 been	 fully	 consolidated	 within	 these	 financial	 statements	 on	 the	 basis	 that	 their	 sole	 purpose	 was	 to	 hold	 the	 debt	 of	 the	 Group	 prior	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005.
The	 Group’s	 borrowings	 consisted	 of	 four	 tranches	 of	 floating	 rate	 debt	 as	 follows:

The	 A1	 Debt	 was	 the	 first	 ranking	 tranche	 of	 the	 secured	 debt.	 The	 A1	 Debt	 was	 subject	 to	 a	 fixed	 amortisation	 profile	 beginning	 on	 30	 June	 2007	 and	 ending	 on	 30	 June	 2015.	 The	 A1	 Notes	 were	 listed	 on	 the	 Luxembourg	 Stock	 Exchange	 on	 29	 June	 2004.	 Following	 a	 prepayment	 of	 £11.7	 million	 on	 30	 June	 2005,	 £388.2	 million	 of	 A1	 Debt	 principal	 and	 £12.8	 million	 of	 interest	 was	 outstanding	 prior	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.
The	 A2	 and	 A3	 Debt	 were	 second	 and	 third	 ranking	 tranches	 of	 the	 secured	 debt	 respectively.	 The	 A2	 and	 A3	 Debt	 had	 no	 fixed	 amortisation	 profile,	 the	 outstanding	 principal	 balances	 falling	 due	 for	 payment	 on	 30	 June	 2015	 and	 30	 June	 2020	 respectively.	 Both	 the	 A2	 and	 A3	 Notes	 were	 listed	 on	 the	 Channel	 Islands	 Stock	 Exchange	 on	 29	 June	 2004.	 Prior	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing,	 £545.1	 million	 of	 A2/A3	 Debt	 principal	 and	 £22.2	 million	 of	 interest	 was	 outstanding.

Outstanding	 principal	 and	 interest	 in	 relation	 to	 A1	 and	 B	 Debt	 was	 repaid	 in	 full.	 In	 addition,	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 with	 a	 notional	 value	 of	 £400	 million,	 principally	 related	 to	 A1	 Debt,	 were	 terminated.
A2/A3	 Debt	 holders	 contributed	 their	 A2/A3	 Debt	 in	 exchange	 for	 cash	 and	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 A2	 Debt	 holders	 received	 21,668	 ordinary	 shares	 and	 £24,421	 for	 each	 £100,000	 of	 A2	 Debt.	 A3	 Debt	 holders	 received	 28,669	 ordinary	 shares	 for	 each	 £100,000	 of	 A3	 Debt.	 In	 total	 A2	 Debt	 holders	 received	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £112.0	 million	 and	 A2/A3	 Debt	 holders	 received	 124,164,221	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Outstanding	 interest	 on	 A2/A3	 Debt	 was	 repaid	 in	 full.
The	 Group	 settled	 the	 remaining	 nominal	 value	 of	 A2/A3	 Debt,	 after	 deduction	 of	 the	 A2	 cash	 consideration,	 of	 £433.1	 million	 in	 exchange	 for	 issuing	 the	 124,164,221	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 The	 directors	 determined	 that	 the	 nominal	 value	 of	 A2/A3	 Debt	 approximated	 its	 fair	 value	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 debt,	 principally	 the	 ability	 to	 prepay	 at	 nominal	 value	 (note	 18).	 The	 nominal	 value	 of	 shares	 issued	 of	 £12.4	 million	 was	 therefore	 lower	 than	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 asset	 acquired	 of	 £433.1	 million.	 Under	 section	 130	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985,	 the	 shares	 are	 treated	 as	 issued	 fully	 paid	 up	 and	 the	 difference	 of	 £420.7	 million	 is	 recorded	 as	 share	 premium	 (note	 27).
The	 total	 cash	 outflows	 related	 to	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 were	 partially	 funded	 by	 a	 new	 Term	 loan	 of	 £500.0	 million	 and	 a	 Bridge	 loan	 of	 £77.0	 million	 as	 described	 below.	 The	 remaining	 cash	 outflows,	 including	 the	 payment	 of	 fees	 and	 expenses	 (note	 5),	 were	 principally	 funded	 by	 cash	 generated	 from	 operations.

The	 Term	 loan	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 fixed	 amortisation	 profile	 beginning	 on	 30	 June	 2006	 and	 ending	 on	 31	 December	 2010.
The	 Bridge	 loan	 has	 a	 first	 priority	 over	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 and	 the	 proceeds	 thereof,	 which	 are	 its	 primary	 source	 of	 repayment.	 Following	 a	 third	 distribution	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim	 on	 19	 January	 2006,	 £55.1	 million	 of	 the	 Bridge	 loan	 was	 repaid	 on	 23	 January	 2006.	 The	 third	 distribution	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 has	 been	 included	 as	 a	 receivable	 balance	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 (note	 13).	 The	 debt	 which	 was	 repaid	 on	 23	 January	 2006	 has	 been	 shown	 as	 repayable	 within	 one	 year	 at	 31	 December	 2005.	 The	 Bridge	 loan	 has	 no	 fixed	 amortisation	 profile.	 Any	 outstanding	 principal	 balance	 falls	 due	 for	 payment	 on	 31	 December	 2008.
Ultimately,	 the	 Group’s	 ability	 to	 make	 repayments	 of	 the	 Term	 loan	 is	 entirely	 dependent	 on	 the	 successful	 operation	 of	 the	 business.	 The	 ability	 of	 the	 Group	 to	 make	 repayment	 of	 the	 Bridge	 loan	 is	 dependent	 on:	 i)	 the	 timing	 and	 quantum	 of	 recoveries	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim;	 and	 ii)	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 such	 recoveries	 are	 insufficient	 to	 pay	 amounts	 under	 the	 Bridge	 loan	 when	 due,	 the	 successful	 operation	 of	 the	 business.	 The	 Group’s	 debt	 is	 guaranteed	 and	 secured	 by	 each	 of	 the	 principal	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 of	 the	 Company,	 as	 stated	 in	 note	 3	 to	 the	 Company’s	 separate	 financial	 statements,	 and	 also	 by	 the	 Company.

Payment	 profiles	 for	 repayment	 of	 debt	 set	 out	 above	 are	 based	 on	 the	 fixed	 minimum	 repayment	 profile.	 Repayments	 above	 the	 fixed	 minimum	 repayment	 profile	 are	 permitted	 subject	 to	 the	 amount	 of	 cash	 available	 for	 debt	 service.	 With	 the	 exception	 of	 Bridge	 loan	 principal	 repayments,	 debt	 service	 payments	 are	 made	 semi-annually	 on	 30	 June	 and	 31	 December.	 The	 timing	 of	 Bridge	 loan	 repayments	 is	 determined	 by	 receipts	 under	 the	 TXU	 Claim.
letteR oF cRedIt FacIlIty and RevolvIng cRedIt FacIlIty In	 addition	 to	 its	 borrowings,	 the	 Group	 has	 access	 to	 a	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility	 which	 provides	 credit	 support	 of	 up	 to	 £200	 million	 to	 the	 Group’s	 trading	 activities.	 The	 letter	 of	 credit	 facility,	 which	 has	 a	 final	 maturity	 date	 of	 15	 December	 2012,	 provides	 a	 mechanism	 whereby	 it	 may	 be	 extended	 at	 any	 time	 after	 15	 December	 2007,	 but	 no	 later	 than	 one	 year	 before	 the	 final	 maturity	 date.	 The	 Group	 guarantees	 the	 obligations	 of	 a	 number	 of	 banks	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 letters	 of	 credit	 issued	 by	 those	 banks	 to	 counterparties	 of	 the	 Group.	 As	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 the	 Group’s	 contingent	 liability	 in	 respect	 of	 these	 guarantees	 amounted	 to	 £77.4	 million	 (2004:	 £26.5	 million).
In	 addition,	 the	 Group	 has	 access	 to	 an	 undrawn	 £100	 million	 revolving	 credit	 facility,	 which	 may	 be	 used	 to	 issue	 letters	 of	 credit	 or	 for	 working	 capital,	 with	 a	 final	 maturity	 date	 of	 15	 December	 2010.

The	 interest	 accrual	 includes	 £nil	 (2004:	 £25.0	 million)	 deferred	 interest	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 Group’s	 B	 Debt.	 This	 interest	 was	 paid	 in	 full	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing,	 and	 was	 treated	 as	 falling	 due	 in	 more	 than	 five	 years	 under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 Group’s	 previous	 debt	 facilities.	 The	 retention	 liabilities	 relate	 to	 amounts	 held	 back	 from	 certain	 suppliers	 pending	 satisfaction	 of	 contractually	 agreed	 performance	 criteria.	 The	 Group	 estimates	 that	 substantially	 all	 retention	 liabilities	 will	 fall	 due	 for	 payment	 in	 more	 than	 one	 year	 but	 in	 not	 more	 than	 two	 years.	 18. Derivatives and Financial Instruments
The	 Group	 issues	 or	 holds	 financial	 instruments	 for	 two	 purposes:
Financial	 instruments	 relating	 to	 the	 operations,	 financing	 and	 risks	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations.
Financial	 instruments	 relating	 to	 the	 financing	 and	 risks	 of	 the	 Group’s	 debt	 portfolio.
The	 Group’s	 financial	 instruments	 comprise	 borrowings,	 cash	 and	 liquid	 resources,	 items	 that	 arise	 directly	 from	 its	 operations	 and	 derivative
transactions.	 The	 Group	 also	 enters	 into	 short	 and	 medium	 term	 forward	 sales	 contracts	 for	 the	 sale	 of	 electricity	 and	 the	 purchase	 of	 coal	 and	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances.
As	 permitted	 under	 IFRS	 1,	 the	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 exemption	 not	 to	 restate	 comparative	 information	 for	 IAS	 39.	 As	 a	 result,	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 are	 applicable	 for	 the	 Group	 from	 1	 January	 2005.	 For	 the	 period	 prior	 to	 the	 adoption	 of	 IAS	 39,	 the	 Group	 has	 applied	 UK	 GAAP	 accounting	 rules	 for	 derivatives	 and	 financial	 instruments.	 The	 numerical	 disclosures	 immediately	 below	 illustrate	 the	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 as	 defined	 in	 IAS	 32	 relating	 to	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005.	 The	 subsequent	 FRS	 13	 “Derivatives	 and	 Other	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosures”	 set	 out	 numerical	 disclosures	 relating	 to	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004.	 Certain	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 such	 as	 investments	 in	 subsidiary	 companies	 are	 excluded	 from	 the	 scope	 of	 these	 disclosures.	 As	 permitted	 by	 FRS	 13,	 short-term	 debtors	 and	 creditors	 have	 also	 been	 excluded	 from	 the	 disclosures.
IaS 32 “FInancIal InStR ument S: dIScloSuRe and pReSentatIon”: y eaR ended 31 decembeR 2005
From	 1	 January	 2005,	 as	 noted	 above,	 the	 Group	 has	 adopted	 both	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39.	 Were	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 to	 have	 been	 applied	 during	 the	 year	 to	 31	 December	 2004	 the	 impact	 would	 have	 been	 to	 reduce	 net	 assets	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 by	 £3.9	 million	 (net	 of	 tax)	 and	 to	 record	 a	 credit	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 of	 £26.7	 million	 (net	 of	 tax)	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004.
The	 Group	 recognised	 a	 reduction	 in	 net	 assets	 and	 retained	 earnings	 of	 £5.6	 million	 (£3.9	 million	 net	 of	 tax)	 at	 1	 January	 2005,	 being	 an	 adjustment	 to	 reflect	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 at	 that	 time.

c ommodIty contR act S
The	 Group	 enters	 into	 short	 and	 medium	 term	 forward	 electricity	 sales	 contracts	 to	 hedge	 generation	 output.	 The	 Group	 also	 purchases	 coal	 and	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances	 under	 contracts	 from	 a	 range	 of	 domestic	 and	 international	 suppliers.	 Due	 to	 the	 nature	 of	 some	 of	 these	 contracts	 and	 the	 way	 they	 are	 managed,	 the	 own	 use	 exemption	 within	 IAS	 39	 has	 only	 been	 applied	 to	 a	 limited	 number	 of	 them.	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 IAS	 39,	 from	 1	 July	 2005,	 the	 Group	 has	 put	 in	 place	 appropriate	 hedge	 accounting	 documentation	 to	 enable	 it	 to	 achieve	 hedge	 accounting	 for	 a	 large	 proportion	 of	 its	 commodity	 contracts.	 As	 a	 result,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 contracts	 which	 are	 now	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges	 are	 recognised	 through	 the	 hedge	 reserve.	 For	 the	 period	 from	 1	 January	 2005	 to	 30	 June	 2005,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 these	 contracts	 were	 reflected	 directly	 in	 the	 income	 statement,	 as	 appropriate	 hedge	 documentation	 had	 not	 been	 put	 in	 place.
The	 fair	 value	 of	 commodity	 contracts	 qualifying	 as	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 is	 calculated	 by	 reference	 to	 forward	 market	 prices	 which	 are	 available	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 As	 contracts	 are	 generally	 short-term,	 forward	 market	 price	 curves	 are	 available	 for	 the	 duration	 of	 the	 contracts.	 The	 quoted	 market	 price	 used	 for	 financial	 assets	 held	 by	 the	 Group	 is	 the	 current	 bid	 price;	 the	 quoted	 price	 for	 financial	 liabilities	 is	 the	 current	 ask	 price.
InteReSt Rate SwapS
The	 Group	 enters	 into	 interest	 rate	 swap	 arrangements	 to	 hedge	 variable	 interest	 costs	 on	 the	 Group’s	 debt.	 At	 31	 December	 2004,	 the	 notional	 principal	 amounts	 of	 outstanding	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 was	 £400	 million.	 As	 described	 in	 note	 16,	 the	 Group	 terminated	 these	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005,	 resulting	 in	 a	 credit	 adjustment	 to	 release	 the	 previously	 recognised	 unrealised	 losses	 of	 £17.7	 million	 and	 a	 termination	 payment	 of	 £23.1	 million,	 both	 of	 which	 have	 been	 included	 in	 finance	 costs	 for	 the	 year	 (note	 7).	 As	 required	 under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 Group’s	 new	 debt	 facility	 agreements	 effective	 15	 December	 2005,	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 with	 notional	 principal	 amounts	 of	 £250	 million	 were	 entered	 into	 on	 5	 January	 2006.	 Accordingly,	 no	 interest	 rate	 swap	 contracts	 were	 outstanding	 at	 the	 year-end.

Foreign	 currency	 exchange	 contracts	 are	 principally	 entered	 into	 to	 hedge	 the	 Group’s	 requirement	 to	 purchase	 coal	 from	 international	 sources	 in	 US	 dollars,	 and	 to	 purchase	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances	 in	 Euros.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 forward	 foreign	 currency	 exchange	 contracts	 is	 determined	 using	 forward	 exchange	 market	 rates	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
embedded deRIvatIveS
The	 Group	 has	 also	 reviewed	 all	 contracts	 for	 the	 presence	 of	 embedded	 derivatives.	 Where	 contracts	 were	 found	 to	 contain	 embedded	 derivatives,	 they	 were	 considered	 to	 be	 closely	 related	 to	 the	 economic	 characteristics	 and	 risks	 of	 the	 host	 contract	 and	 therefore	 do	 not	 require	 to	 be	 separately	 valued	 from	 their	 host	 contracts.
The	 amounts	 recorded	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 respect	 of	 derivatives	 which	 are	 marked	 to	 market	 are	 as	 follows:

Re-InStatement Provision	 for	 re-instatement	 represents	 the	 estimated	 decommissioning,	 demolition	 and	 site	 remediation	 costs	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 useful	 economic	 life	 of	 the	 Group’s	 generating	 assets,	 on	 a	 discounted	 basis.	 The	 amount	 provided	 represents	 the	 present	 value	 of	 the	 expected	 costs.	 An	 amount	 equivalent	 to	 the	 initial	 provision	 is	 capitalised	 within	 tangible	 fixed	 assets	 and	 is	 depreciated	 over	 the	 useful	 lives	 of	 the	 related	 assets.	 The	 unwinding	 of	 the	 discount	 is	 included	 in	 interest	 payable	 and	 similar	 charges.
The	 provision	 is	 estimated	 using	 the	 assumption	 that	 the	 re-instatement	 will	 take	 place	 between	 2039	 and	 2045.	 The	 provision	 has	 been	 estimated	 using	 existing	 technology	 at	 current	 prices.	 The	 discount	 rate	 applied	 is	 the	 pre-tax	 rate	 based	 upon	 the	 Group’s	 weighted	 average	 cost	 of	 capital	 and	 reflects	 the	 current	 market	 assessment	 of	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 business.

The	 maximum	 total	 cash	 payment	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 plan	 was	 £5.1	 million,	 with	 the	 timing	 of	 payments	 being	 linked	 to	 repayment	 of	 the	 Group’s	 eligible	 debt,	 and	 the	 cost	 originally	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 expected	 debt	 repayment	 period	 on	 an	 undiscounted	 basis.
As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 and	 the	 resulting	 repayment	 of	 the	 eligible	 debt,	 the	 full	 £5.1	 million	 cash-based	 award	 payable	 under	 the	 LTIP	 vested.

At	 an	 extraordinary	 general	 meeting	 of	 the	 previous	 holding	 company,	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 held	 on	 30	 April	 2004	 shareholders	 approved:
(1)	 	the	 conversion	 of	 7,782,480	 un-issued	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 into	 non-voting	 shares;
(2)	 	the	 payment	 of	 £0.4	 million	 to	 each	 of	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 (a	 director	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 at	 the	 time)	 in	 recognition	 of	 services	 rendered	 in	 connection	 with	 a	 restructuring	 of	 the	 debt	 of	 the	 Group	 approved	 on	 22	 December	 2003	 on	 the	 understanding	 that	 each	 of	 them	 would	 have	 the	 right	 (which	 each	 subsequently	 exercised)	 to	 purchase	 1,729,440	 of	 the	 non-voting	 shares	 referred	 to	 in	 paragraph	 (1);	 and
(3)	 	the	 establishment	 of	 a	 Long-Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 which	 would	 have	 at	 its	 disposal	 a	 cash	 pool	 of	 £5.1	 million	 (the	 payment	 of	 which	 was	 dependant	 upon	 certain	 parts	 of	 the	 Group’s	 debt	 being	 repaid)	 and	 4,323,600	 non-voting	 shares,	 being	 the	 total	 of	 the	 non-voting	 shares	 referred	 to	 in	 	 paragraph 	 (1)	 less	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 purchased	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 pursuant	 to	 the	 right	 referred	 to	 in	 paragraph	 (2).
The	 objective	 of	 the	 LTIP	 was	 to	 incentivise	 employees	 to	 create	 sustained	 value	 for	 the	 Group’s	 debt	 holders	 and	 shareholders	 by	 repaying	 the	 Group’s	 debt	 (including	 debt	 repayment	 through	 a	 shareholder	 approved	 refinancing	 at	 par)	 and	 increasing	 the	 value	 of	 the	 Group’s	 equity.	 It	 provided	 for	 the	 making	 of:
(a)	 	Initial	 Awards,	 both	 of	 non-voting	 shares	 and	 cash	 units	 (giving	 a	 proportionate	 entitlement	 to	 sums	 from	 time	 to	 time	 payable	 out	 of	 the	 total		 of	 £5.1	 million	 referred	 to	 in	 paragraph	 (3)),	 to	 employees	 selected	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 and	 in	 post	 on	 22	 December	 2003;	 Accounts
64  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
(b)	 	Performance	 Share	 Awards	 of	 units	 which,	 subject	 to	 the	 satisfaction	 of	 any	 associated	 performance	 criteria	 and	 the	 other	 provisions	 of	 the	 LTIP	 rules,	 gave	 a	 proportionate	 entitlement	 to	 the	 non-voting	 shares	 held	 by	 the	 LTIP	 trustee	 (see	 below);	 and
(c)	 	Performance	 Cash	 Awards	 in	 the	 form	 of	 units	 which	 gave	 a	 proportionate	 entitlement	 to	 sums	 from	 time	 to	 time	 payable	 out	 of	 the	 total	 of	 £5.1	 million	 referred	 to	 in	 paragraph	 (3).
Pursuant	 to	 Initial	 Share	 Awards,	 a	 total	 of	 549,923	 non-voting	 shares	 were	 purchased	 at	 a	 price	 of	 13.65	 pence	 per	 share	 by	 executive	 directors,	 business	 and	 team	 leaders.	 The	 remaining	 3,773,677	 non-voting	 shares	 (i.e.	 7,782,480	 non-voting	 shares	 referred	 to	 in	 paragraph	 (1)	 less	 the	 total	 number	 of	 shares	 purchased	 both	 as	 Initial	 Awards	 and	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 pursuant	 to	 paragraph	 (2))	 were	 subsequently	 issued	 to	 the	 LTIP	 trustee.	 On	 17	 January	 2005	 and	 13	 June	 2005,	 performance	 awards	 comprising	 both	 Performance	 Share	 Awards	 and	 Performance	 Cash	 Awards	 were	 made	 to	 executive	 directors,	 business	 and	 team	 leaders	 in	 recognition	 of	 their	 contribution	 to	 the	 Group’s	 business.	 On	 20	 October	 2005	 performance	 awards	 comprising	 Performance	 Share	 Awards	 and	 Performance	 Cash	 Awards	 were	 made	 to	 all	 employees	 of	 the	 Group	 in	 post	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 (including	 executive	 directors,	 business	 and	 team	 leaders)	 in	 recognition	 of	 their	 contributions	 to	 the	 Group’s	 business.	 These	 awards	 were	 conditional	 upon	 an	 Exit	 Event	 (see	 below)	 taking	 place	 prior	 to	 31	 January	 2006.
The	 £5.1	 million	 at	 the	 disposal	 of	 the	 LTIP	 represented	 0.85%	 of	 the	 aggregate	 eligible	 debt	 at	 the	 time	 of	 establishment.	 Upon	 repayment	 of	 any	 part	 of	 the	 eligible	 debt,	 0.85%	 of	 the	 amount	 repaid	 becomes	 payable	 to	 LTIP	 participants	 according	 to	 their	 respective	 entitlements	 determined	 by	 the	 cash	 units	 awarded	 to	 them.
Under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 LTIP ,	 upon	 the	 occurrence	 of	 certain	 types	 of	 transaction	 (an	 “Exit	 Event”),	 such	 as	 a	 sale	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 a	 listing	 of	 its	 equity	 on	 a	 recognised	 exchange,	 the	 holders	 of	 non-voting	 shares	 purchased	 by	 virtue	 of	 Initial	 Share	 Awards	 have	 the	 same	 rights	 (other	 than	 to	 vote)	 as	 the	 holders	 of	 ordinary	 shares,	 and	 all	 Performance	 Share	 Awards	 vest	 in	 the	 beneficiaries	 giving	 them	 a	 proportionate	 right,	 according	 to	 their	 respective	 holdings	 of	 units,	 to	 the	 non-voting	 shares	 held	 by	 the	 LTIP	 trustee	 (in	 relation	 to	 which	 they	 then	 have	 the	 same	 rights	 (other	 than	 to	 vote)	 as	 the	 holders	 of	 ordinary	 shares).
As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005	 (an	 Exit	 Event),	 all	 cash	 and	 share-based	 awards	 under	 the	 LTIP	 fully	 vested	 and	 exit	 rights	 occurred	 in	 both	 cases.	 Pursuant	 to	 the	 schemes	 of	 arrangement	 under	 which	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 was	 implemented,	 existing	 shareholders	 in		 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 including	 LTIP	 shareholders,	 received	 three	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 in	 exchange	 for	 each	 ordinary	 share	 	 in	 Drax	 Group	 Limited.
Directors,	 business	 and	 team	 leaders	 all	 agreed	 to	 be	 subject	 to	 certain	 voluntary	 sale	 restrictions	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 shares	 they	 received	 under	 the	 LTIP .	 These	 voluntary	 restrictions	 provided	 that	 up	 to	 50%	 of	 a	 participant’s	 holding	 (i.e.	 shares	 subject	 to	 an	 Initial	 Share	 Award	 and	 the	 balance	 of	 the	 shares	 subject	 to	 a	 Performance	 Share	 Award	 once	 the	 associated	 tax	 liabilities	 have	 been	 discharged)	 can	 be	 sold	 at	 any	 time	 after	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.	 The	 balance	 of	 the	 participant’s	 holding	 may	 be	 sold	 at	 any	 time	 after	 the	 first	 anniversary	 of	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing.

65  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
The	 expense	 arising	 from	 share-based	 payment	 transactions	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 is	 determined	 from	 the	 Group’s	 estimate	 of	 the	 market	 value	 of	 the	 shares	 included	 in	 the	 first	 Performance	 Share	 Award	 made	 on	 17	 January	 2005.	 The	 valuation	 relates	 to	 all	 of	 the	 3,773,677	 shares	 held	 by	 the	 LTIP	 trustee,	 as	 under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 LTIP ,	 all	 such	 shares	 vest	 on	 the	 occurrence	 of	 an	 Exit	 Event.	 Although	 subsequent	 Performance	 Share	 Awards	 were	 made	 later	 in	 2005,	 such	 awards	 served	 only	 to	 alter	 the	 proportionate	 rights	 of	 holdings	 in	 LTIP	 units	 of	 participants.	 The	 market	 value	 of	 these	 shares	 was	 estimated	 based	 on	 the	 market	 value	 on	 that	 date	 of	 the	 Group’s	 A2	 and	 A3	 Debt,	 which	 was	 contractually	 linked	 to	 the	 ordinary	 voting	 shares.	 This	 amount	 has	 been	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 full	 in	 2005,	 following	 vesting	 of	 the	 awards	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005.	 There	 is	 no	 expense	 arising	 from	 the	 shares	 purchased	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 or	 from	 the	 Initial	 Share	 Awards,	 both	 in	 2004,	 as	 the	 Group	 determined	 that	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 its	 equity	 was	 £nil	 at	 that	 time.	 The	 remaining	 expense	 arising	 from	 cash-based	 payment	 transactions	 of	 £4.7	 million	 (£0.4	 million	 having	 been	 charged	 in	 2004)	 has	 been	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 full	 in	 2005,	 following	 vesting	 of	 the	 awards	 on	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 on	 15	 December	 2005.	 Employer	 National	 Insurance	 contributions	 on	 cash	 and	 share-based	 payment	 transactions	 have	 also	 been	 included	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 2005.	 The	 total	 charge	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 LTIP	 of	 £37.6	 million	 (£26.3	 million	 net	 of	 tax)	 has	 been	 included	 within	 exceptional	 other	 operating	 expenses	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 (note	 5).
The	 Board	 believe	 that	 employee	 share	 ownership	 plays	 a	 significant	 role	 in	 the	 recruitment,	 motivation	 and	 retention	 of	 staff	 at	 all	 levels	 within	 the	 Group.	 The	 Group	 is	 therefore	 intending	 to	 establish	 certain	 new	 employee	 share	 plans	 to	 be	 administered	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee.

Under	 IFRS	 3,	 the	 insertion	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 as	 the	 new	 holding	 company	 has	 been	 accounted	 for	 as	 a	 reverse	 acquisition,	 whereby	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 (being	 the	 previous	 holding	 company),	 the	 legal	 subsidiary,	 acquired	 Drax	 Group	 plc,	 the	 legal	 parent	 company.	 Therefore,	 the	 share	 capital	 in	 the	 consolidated	 balance	 sheet	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 reflected	 that	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 prior	 to	 the	 reverse	 acquisition.
dR ax gR oup lImIted There	 were	 86,472,000	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 0.001	 pence	 each	 of	 the	 previous	 holding	 company,	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 issued	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2003,	 which	 were	 contractually	 linked	 to	 the	 A2	 and	 A3	 Loans	 issued	 by	 InPower	 2	 and	 A2	 and	 A3	 notes	 issued	 by	 NoteCo	 (note	 16).
At	 an	 extraordinary	 general	 meeting	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 on	 30	 April	 2004	 shareholders	 resolved	 to	 amend	 the	 authorised	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 Company	 by	 the	 conversion	 of	 7,782,480	 unissued	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 into	 7,782,480	 non-voting	 ordinary	 shares.	 With	 the	 approval	 of	 shareholders	 given	 at	 the	 same	 Extraordinary	 General	 Meeting,	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 elected	 to	 re-invest	 the	 net	 proceeds	 of	 their	 restructuring	 bonus	 in	 the	 Group	 through	 the	 purchase	 of	 1,729,440	 each	 of	 the	 newly	 converted	 non-voting	 shares,	 at	 a	 price	 of	 	 13.65	 pence	 per	 share.
Also	 at	 the	 Extraordinary	 General	 Meeting	 on	 30	 April	 2004,	 a	 new	 LTIP	 was	 approved	 by	 shareholders	 (note	 21).	 The	 LTIP	 plan	 was,	 in	 part,	 funded	 by	 a	 pool	 of	 4,323,600	 of	 the	 newly	 converted	 non-voting	 ordinary	 shares	 being	 the	 total	 of	 7,782,480	 non-voting	 shares	 referred	 to	 above,	 less	 the	 number	 of	 shares	 purchased	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove.	 In	 May	 2004	 an	 Initial	 Share	 Award	 under	 the	 LTIP	 resulted	 in	 the	 purchase	 of	 549,923	 shares	 by	 certain	 executive	 directors,	 business	 and	 team	 leaders	 at	 a	 price	 of	 13.65	 pence	 per	 share.	 The	 3,773,677	 remaining	 shares	 in	 the	 LTIP	 pool	 were	 subsequently	 issued	 to	 the	 LTIP	 Trustee.	 Accordingly,	 there	 were	 94,254,480	 shares	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited	 in	 issue	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2004,	 with	 a	 nominal	 value	 of	 £943	 and	 a	 related	 share	 premium	 (which	 arose	 on	 the	 purchases	 by	 Gordon	 Horsfield	 and	 Gerald	 Wingrove	 and	 on	 the	 Initial	 Share	 Awards)	 of	 £0.5	 million.
dR ax gR oup plc The	 Company	 has	 only	 one	 class	 of	 ordinary	 shares,	 which	 carry	 no	 right	 to	 fixed	 income.	 No	 shareholders	 have	 waived	 their	 rights	 to	 dividends.	 These	 shares	 were	 issued	 upon	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 as	 described	 below.
Pursuant	 to	 the	 schemes	 of	 arrangement	 under	 which	 the	 Refinancing	 and	 Listing	 was	 implemented,	 the	 existing	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited,	 including	 LTIP	 shareholders,	 received	 three	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 in	 exchange	 for	 each	 share	 in	 Drax	 Group	 Limited.	 This	 resulted	 in	 the	 issue	 of	 282,763,440	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Under	 section	 131	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985,	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 qualifies	 for	 merger	 relief	 to	 avoid	 recording	 a	 share	 premium	 on	 the	 shares	 issued	 to	 the	 existing	 shareholders	 of	 Drax	 Group	 Limited.	 Accordingly,	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 has	 recorded	 these	 shares	 within	 share	 capital	 at	 their	 nominal	 value	 of	 £28.3	 million,	 with	 a	 corresponding	 debit	 to	 share	 premium	 of	 £0.5	 million	 and	 the	 merger	 reserve	 of	 £27.8	 million	 to	 reflect	 the	 reverse	 acquisition	 adjustment	 (note	 27). Accounts
66  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
As	 described	 in	 note	 16,	 A2/A3	 Debt	 holders	 contributed	 their	 A2/A3	 Debt	 in	 exchange	 for	 cash	 and	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 A2	 Debt	 holders	 received	 21,668	 ordinary	 shares	 and	 £24,421	 for	 each	 £100,000	 of	 A2	 Debt.	 A3	 Debt	 holders	 received	 28,669	 ordinary	 shares	 for	 each	 £100,000	 of	 A3	 Debt.	 In	 total	 A2	 Debt	 holders	 received	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £112.0	 million	 and	 A2/A3	 Debt	 holders	 received	 124,164,221	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 Outstanding	 interest	 on	 A2/A3	 Debt	 was	 repaid	 in	 full.
The	 Group	 settled	 the	 remaining	 nominal	 value	 of	 A2/A3	 Debt,	 after	 deduction	 of	 the	 A2	 cash	 consideration,	 of	 £433.1	 million	 in	 exchange	 for	 issuing	 the	 124,164,221	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc.	 The	 directors	 determined	 that	 the	 nominal	 value	 of	 A2/A3	 Debt	 approximated	 its	 fair	 value	 (note	 18)	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 debt,	 principally	 the	 ability	 to	 prepay	 at	 nominal	 value.	 The	 nominal	 value	 of	 shares	 issued	 of	 £12.4	 million	 was	 therefore	 lower	 than	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 asset	 acquired	 of	 £433.1	 million.	 Under	 section	 130	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985,	 the	 shares	 are	 treated	 as	 issued	 fully	 paid	 up	 and	 the	 difference	 of	 £420.7	 million	 recorded	 as	 share	 premium	 (note	 27).
Accordingly,	 in	 total	 there	 were	 406,927,661	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 in	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 issued	 and	 fully	 paid	 up	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2005,	 with	 a	 nominal	 value	 of	 £40.7	 million	 and	 related	 share	 premium	 of	 £420.7	 million.
Redeemable ShaReS
On	 20	 October	 2005,	 the	 Company	 authorised	 and	 issued	 499,980	 redeemable	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 each	 to	 Drax	 Group	 Limited.	 These	 shares	 were	 subsequently	 fully	 paid	 up	 prior	 to	 31	 December	 2005.
The	 redeemable	 shares	 are	 not	 entitled	 to	 any	 dividend	 or	 surplus	 capital	 return	 over	 and	 above	 their	 share	 issue	 price	 of	 10	 pence.	 The	 shares	 are	 redeemable	 at	 the	 option	 of	 both	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 holder	 and	 must	 be	 redeemed	 by	 20	 October	 2030.	 As	 the	 shares	 do	 not	 entitle	 the	 holder	 to	 any	 residual	 interest	 in	 the	 Company	 and	 are	 mandatorily	 redeemable,	 they	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 debt	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 32.

IaS 19 employee beneFIt S
Under	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 applies	 IAS	 19.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP ,	 the	 Group	 applied	 the	 provisions	 of	 SSAP	 24	 “Accounting	 for	 Pension	 Costs”	 and	 also	 provided	 detailed	 disclosures	 under	 FRS	 17	 “Retirement	 Benefits”.	 IAS	 19	 follows	 a	 balance	 sheet	 approach	 which	 is	 similar	 to	 that	 of	 FRS	 17.	 Under	 IAS	 19,	 the	 pension	 scheme	 deficit	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 approved	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 plan	 is	 recognised	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 The	 income	 statement	 expense	 comprises	 the	 current	 service	 cost,	 the	 interest	 cost,	 the	 expected	 return	 on	 any	 plan	 assets	 and	 the	 appropriate	 portion	 of	 any	 past	 service	 costs.	 Actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses	 are	 recognised	 in	 full	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 arise	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expenditure.
The	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 IFRS	 1	 exemption	 allowing	 full	 actuarial	 losses	 to	 be	 recognised	 at	 the	 date	 of	 transition.
The	 balance	 sheet	 impact	 of	 the	 implementation	 of	 this	 policy	 is	 to	 recognise	 an	 increased	 pension	 liability	 of	 £10.5	 million	 in	 the	 Group’s	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 at	 1	 January	 2002	 and	 an	 increased	 pension	 liability	 of	 £36.5	 million	 in	 the	 Group’s	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 (both	 before	 tax).	 During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2004	 an	 additional	 amount	 of	 £0.1	 million	 (before	 tax)	 was	 credited	 to	 the	 income	 statement.
IFRS 2 ShaRe-baSed pa yment S
Under	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 applies	 IFRS	 2.	 Under	 IFRS	 2,	 a	 charge	 is	 required	 for	 all	 share-based	 payments	 including	 share	 options.	 The	 charge	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 shares	 or	 options	 at	 grant	 date.	 The	 charge	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 recognised	 over	 the	 relevant	 vesting	 periods,	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 actual	 and	 expected	 levels	 of	 vesting.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 share-based	 payments	 under	 the	 Group’s	 LTIP	 have	 been	 calculated	 based	 on	 the	 implied	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 equity	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP ,	 the	 income	 statement	 charge,	 if	 any,	 is	 based	 on	 the	 difference	 between	 exercise	 price	 and	 the	 market	 price	 on	 the	 date	 of	 issue.
The	 Group	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 IFRS	 1	 exemption	 to	 only	 apply	 IFRS	 2	 to	 awards	 granted	 since	 Exposure	 Draft	 2	 was	 issued	 on	 7	 November	 2002	 and	 which	 have	 not	 vested	 by	 31	 December	 2004.
IaS 16 pR opeR ty , plant and equIpment Under	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 applies	 IAS	 16.	 Under	 IAS	 16	 each	 significant	 part	 of	 an	 item	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 should	 be	 depreciated	 separately,	 and	 the	 useful	 life,	 residual	 values	 and	 depreciation	 method	 used	 is	 required	 to	 be	 reviewed	 at	 least	 each	 financial	 year	 end,	 with	 any	 revisions	 in	 these	 estimates	 being	 taken	 prospectively.	 Following	 a	 detailed	 exercise	 to	 review	 all	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	 the	 individually	 significant	 items	 of	 plant	 and	 machinery,	 the	 Group	 identified	 a	 number	 of	 items	 with	 estimated	 useful	 lives	 of	 less	 than	 the	 estimated	 life	 of	 the	 station.	 This	 resulted	 in	 an	 adjustment	 of	 £8.2	 million	 (before	 tax)	 to	 reduce	 the	 net	 book	 value	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 in	 the	 Group’s	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 at	 1	 January	 2002,	 and	 additional	 depreciation	 charges	 of	 £0.9	 million	 per	 annum	 thereafter.	 The	 balance	 sheet	 impact	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 of	 the	 implementation	 of	 this	 policy	 is	 to	 reduce	 the	 book	 value	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 by	 £12.4	 million	 before	 tax.	 IaS 12 Income taxeS
Under	 UK	 GAAP ,	 deferred	 tax	 is	 provided	 based	 on	 timing	 differences	 between	 accounting	 and	 taxable	 profits.	 Under	 IFRS	 deferred	 tax	 is	 required	 to	 be	 provided	 on	 all	 temporary	 differences	 between	 the	 book	 carrying	 values	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 and	 their	 related	 tax	 bases.
Following	 the	 acquisition	 of	 the	 power	 station	 from	 National	 Power	 in	 1999,	 for	 UK	 GAAP	 purposes	 the	 Group	 has	 treated	 differences	 between	 the	 book	 value	 of	 non-qualifying	 tangible	 fixed	 assets	 and	 their	 tax	 bases	 as	 permanent	 items	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 deferred	 tax	 and	 accordingly,	 no	 deferred	 tax	 liability	 has	 been	 recorded.	 Under	 IAS	 12,	 such	 differences	 are	 treated	 as	 temporary	 timing	 differences	 and	 hence	 an	 additional	 deferred	 tax	 liability	 of	 £293.0	 million	 has	 been	 recorded	 in	 the	 Group’s	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 as	 at	 1	 January	 2002.	 To	 the	 extent	 that	 depreciation	 has	 been	 charged	 in	 following	 years	 this	 deferred	 tax	 liability	 has	 reduced,	 with	 a	 corresponding	 credit	 recognised	 in	 the	 tax	 charge	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
This	 provision	 does	 not	 affect	 the	 Group’s	 underlying	 tax	 position	 nor	 give	 rise	 to	 any	 expected	 future	 liabilities	 to	 pay	 tax.
Impact oF IaS 32 and IaS 39
The	 Group	 has	 adopted	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 from	 1	 January	 2005.	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 set	 out	 the	 accounting	 rules	 surrounding	 the	 recognition,	 measurement,	 disclosure	 and	 presentation	 of	 financial	 instruments.	 The	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies	 under	 IAS	 32	 and	 IAS	 39	 will	 not	 be	 impacted	 by	 the	 elements	 carved	 out	 of	 the	 EU	 endorsement,	 and	 hence	 will	 comply	 in	 full	 with	 IAS	 39.
The	 most	 significant	 impacts	 of	 adopting	 these	 standards	 are	 set	 out	 below:
Commodity contracts –	 The	 Group	 enters	 into	 short	 and	 medium	 term	 forward	 electricity	 contracts	 for	 the	 sale	 of	 electricity	 and	 the	 purchase	 of	 coal	 and	 carbon	 emissions	 allowances.	 Due	 to	 the	 nature	 of	 some	 of	 these	 contracts	 and	 the	 way	 they	 are	 managed,	 the	 own	 use	 exemption	 within	 	 IAS	 39	 has	 only	 been	 applied	 to	 a	 limited	 number	 of	 them.	 From	 1	 July	 2005,	 74  Drax Group plc 	 Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Accounts
the	 Group	 has	 put	 in	 place	 appropriate	 hedge	 accounting	 documentation	 to	 enable	 it	 to	 achieve	 hedge	 accounting	 for	 a	 large	 proportion	 of	 its	 commodity	 contracts.	 As	 a	 result,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 contracts	 which	 are	 now	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges	 are	 recognised	 through	 the	 hedge	 reserve.	 For	 the	 period	 from	 1	 January	 2005	 to	 30	 June	 2005,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 these	 contracts	 were	 reflected	 directly	 in	 the	 income	 statement,	 as	 appropriate	 hedge	 documentation	 had	 not	 been	 put	 in	 place.
Interest rate swaps –	 The	 Group	 enters	 into	 interest	 rate	 swap	 arrangements	 to	 hedge	 variable	 interest	 costs	 on	 debt.	 From	 1	 July	 2005,	 the	 Group	 has	 put	 in	 place	 appropriate	 hedge	 accounting	 documentation	 to	 enable	 it	 to	 achieve	 hedge	 accounting	 for	 these	 arrangements.	 As	 a	 result,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 arrangements	 which	 are	 now	 considered	 to	 be	 effective	 hedges	 are	 recognised	 through	 the	 hedge	 reserve.	 For	 the	 period	 from	 1	 January	 2005	 to	 30	 June	 2005,	 mark-to-market	 movements	 on	 these	 contracts	 were	 reflected	 directly	 in	 the	 income	 statement,	 as	 appropriate	 hedge	 documentation	 had	 not	 been	 put	 in	 place.
Embedded derivatives –	 IAS	 39	 requires	 that	 all	 embedded	 derivatives	 are	 identified,	 and	 where	 relevant,	 separated	 from	 the	 host	 contract	 and	 separately	 valued.	 The	 Group	 have	 completed	 a	 review	 of	 all	 contracts	 for	 embedded	 derivatives	 and	 consider	 all	 embedded	 derivatives	 to	 be	 closely	 related	 to	 the	 economic	 characteristics	 and	 risks	 of	 the	 host	 contract.	 As	 such,	 no	 embedded	 derivatives	 have	 been	 separately	 valued.
c aSh Flow Statement The	 consolidated	 cash	 flow	 statement	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 UK	 GAAP	 (FRS	 1	 “Cash	 flow	 statements	 (Revised)”)	 presented	 substantially	 the	 same	 information	 that	 is	 required	 under	 IFRS	 (IAS	 7	 “Cash	 flow	 statements”).	 However	 under	 IFRS	 there	 are	 differences	 with	 regard	 to	 the	 definition	 of	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 and	 with	 regards	 to	 the	 classification	 of	 items	 within	 the	 cash	 flow	 statement.
Under	 IFRS,	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 includes	 short-term	 deposits	 which	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 were	 included	 within	 the	 management	 of	 liquid	 resources	 category.
	 Under	 UK	 GAAP ,	 cash	 flows	 were	 reported	 under	 nine	 standard	 headings;	 operating	 activities,	 dividends	 from	 joint	 ventures	 and	 associates,	 returns	 on	 investments	 and	 servicing	 of	 finance,	 taxation,	 capital	 expenditure	 and	 financial	 investments,	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals,	 equity	 dividends	 paid,	 management	 of	 liquid	 resources	 and	 financing.	 Under	 IFRS	 the	 cash	 flows	 are	 classified	 under	 three	 standard	 headings;	 operating	 activities,	 investing	 activities	 and	 financing	 activities.
Income	 taxes	 paid	 or	 received	 in	 the	 period	 are	 classified	 as	 a	 part	 of	 operating	 cash	 flows	 under	 IFRS,	 but	 were	 included	 in	 a	 separate	 category	 of	 tax	 cash	 flow	 under	 UK	 GAAP .
ReclaSSIFIcatIon In	 the	 Group’s	 historical	 financial	 statements	 revenue	 has	 been	 recorded	 net	 of	 bilateral	 power	 ‘buy-backs’	 (i.e.	 the	 cost	 of	 power	 purchased	 to	 meet	 power	 sale	 commitments).	 In	 addition,	 the	 Group’s	 activities	 in	 the	 balancing	 mechanism	 have	 been	 included	 within	 revenue	 irrespective	 of	 whether	 the	 net	 result	 from	 those	 activities	 is	 income	 or	 expense.
In	 these	 consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 and	 in	 accordance	 with	 common	 industry	 practice,	 the	 Group	 has	 recorded	 a	 reclassification	 in	 each	 reporting	 period	 to	 reflect	 revenue	 and	 fuel	 costs	 for	 the	 total	 of	 bilateral	 power	 buy-
backs	 and	 any	 balancing	 mechanism	 net	 expense.	 Where	 the	 result	 from	 the	 balancing	 mechanism	 is	 net	 income	 for	 the	 period,	 no	 reclassification	 is	 required.

These	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 accounting	 policies	 set	 out	 therein.
	 The	 corporate	 governance	 statement	 and	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 are	 included	 in	 the	 group	 annual	 report	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005.	 We	 have	 reported	 separately	 on	 the	 group	 financial	 statements	 of	 Drax	 Group	 plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 and	 on	 the	 information	 in	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 that	 is	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited.
This	 report	 is	 made	 solely	 to	 the	 company’s	 members,	 as	 a	 body,	 in	 accordance	 with	 section	 235	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 Our	 audit	 work	 has	 been	 undertaken	 so	 that	 we	 might	 state	 to	 the	 company’s	 members	 those	 matters	 we	 are	 required	 to	 state	 to	 them	 in	 an	 auditors’	 report	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 To	 the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	 by	 law,	 we	 do	 not	 accept	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 to	 anyone	 other	 than	 the	 company	 and	 the	 company’s	 members	 as	 a	 body,	 for	 our	 audit	 work,	 for	 this	 report,	 or	 for	 the	 opinions	 we	 have	 formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The	 directors’	 responsibilities	 for	 preparing	 the	 annual	 report	 and	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 United	 Kingdom	 Accounting	 Standards	 (United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice)	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 directors’	 responsibilities.
Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 relevant	 United	 Kingdom	 legal	 and	 regulatory	 requirements	 and	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	 We	 report	 to	 you	 our	 opinion	 as	 to	 whether	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 relevant	 financial	 reporting	 framework	 and	 whether	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 We	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion,	 the	 directors’	 report	 is	 not	 consistent	 with	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements.	 We	 also	 report	 to	 you	 if	 the	 company	 has	 not	 kept	 proper	 accounting	 records,	 if	 we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit,	 or	 if	 information	 specified	 by	 law	 regarding	 directors’	 remuneration	 and	 other	 transactions	 is	 not	 disclosed.
We	 read	 the	 directors’	 report	 and	 the	 other	 information	 contained	 in	 the	 annual	 report	 for	 the	 above	 year	 as	 described	 in	 the	 contents	 section	 and	 consider	 the	 implications	 for	 our	 report	 if	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	 misstatements	 or	 material	 inconsistencies	 with	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements.	 Basis of Audit Opinion
We	 conducted	 our	 audit	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland)	 issued	 by	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board.	 An	 audit	 includes	 examination,	 on	 a	 test	 basis,	 of	 evidence	 relevant	 to	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements.	 It	 also	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 significant	 estimates	 and	 judgements	 made	 by	 the	 directors	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements,	 and	 of	 whether	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 company’s	 circumstances,	 consistently	 applied	 and	 adequately	 disclosed.
We	 planned	 and	 performed	 our	 audit	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 which	 we	 considered	 necessary	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 us	 with	 sufficient	 evidence	 to	 give	 reasonable	 assurance	 that	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 other	 irregularity	 or	 error.	 In	 forming	 our	 opinion	 we	 also	 evaluated	 the	 overall	 adequacy	 of	 the	 presentation	 of	 information	 in	 the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements.
Opinion
In	 our	 opinion:
the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view,	 in	 accordance	 with	 United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice,	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 company’s	 affairs	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2005;	 and
the	 individual	 company	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.

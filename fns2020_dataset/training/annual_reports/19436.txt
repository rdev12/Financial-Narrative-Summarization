Chairman’s Message
It is now five years since the Group changed its structure following the acquisition of its property advisers. At that time 
we were in the middle of a global financial crisis and were completing 675,500 square metres (“sqm”) of new, speculative 
development. It needed strong management to deal with the uncertainties we faced. We anchored our balance sheet 
with an issue of preference shares, without significant dilution to our ordinary shareholders and stuck to our belief 
that the market we operated in was chronically under supplied and that we could deliver a superior return for our 
shareholders. The highlights follow the journey that we have been on over the last five years and vindicate our strategy 
through those difficult times.
Today, we have 1.4 million sqm of completed assets and occupancy is running at 97%, with annualised Net Operating 
Income (“NOI”) of $192 million. Underlying earnings, one of our key measures for covered distributions to ordinary 
shareholders, has increased from a loss of $27 million in 2009 to a profit of $60 million at 31 December 2013, a number 
which I hope will increase further with a full year of rental income at today’s occupancy level.
With a mature portfolio, we have taken the opportunity to adjust our balance sheet weighting, converting half of our 
preference shares to ordinary shares with a 1 for 2 offer which was oversubscribed. This reduces our adjusted diluted 
NAV per share but has no significant impact on our earnings per share, the saving on preference share coupon 
compensating for the increase in the number of ordinary shares. As an investment company whose strategy has 
focussed on shareholder distributions, our earnings performance has always been the most important ratio for us. 
NAV growth should follow with a sustained history of high yield returns.
So what about the next five years? The existing portfolio still has to show the results of a full year at current occupancy. 
We have prime development land in Moscow and we intend to build that out over the next four years with a mixture of pre 
let and speculative space, if demand remains at current levels. Acquisition opportunities are increasing in our market and 
we will take those opportunities if they meet our quality criteria and are earnings accretive for ordinary shareholders. Our 
balance sheet is strong, we have cash to deploy, we continue to raise external debt when required and we have a good 
balance of capital instruments with our preference and ordinary shares. We have a proven and committed management 
team to execute our plans, to manage our estate, and to optimise the balance sheet.
We are well placed to continue growing.
Our final distribution of 3 pence per share takes our total for the year to 5 pence, a 33% increase on 2012. Again we 
intend to distribute by way of a tender offer of 1 in 28 ordinary shares at 85 pence.
We must hope that events in the Ukraine settle peaceably in the coming months and we recognise the effect that this will 
have on the capital markets whilst the issues remain unresolved. For us, it is ‘business as usual’ in Russia, with leases 
and banking arrangements continuing to be signed and rents paid. 
As always, I would like to thank our shareholders, employees, advisers and all of our other stakeholders for their support 
during another busy year.

  STRATEGIC REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA

Chief Executive’s Report
2013 has been an important year. Raven Russia has finally become the specialist investment company that was always 
planned. Slightly delayed by the financial crisis, but better late than never.
We own a portfolio of top quality logistic warehouses, mainly in Moscow, which are fully let to strong tenants with average 
unexpired lease terms of 4.6 years and currently producing annualised NOI of $192 million. In addition we have sufficient 
permitted land to support our organic growth plans for a number of years.
In terms of financial performance, these are the highlights:
 •
Full year distribution up 33% from 3.75p to 5p;
 •
NOI up 37% from $135.6 million to $186.4 million;
 •
Underlying profit before tax is up 103% from $34.5 million to $70.0 million;
 •
Basic underlying earnings per share are up 106% from 5.3 cents to 10.9 cents; and
 •
Adjusted Diluted Net Asset value per share up a cent to 126 cents.
 •
Bank debt at the year end of $815 million, the majority of which is secured on individual assets, has an average 
interest rate of 7.2% and an average weighted term to maturity of 4.7 years.
We also have $229 million of free cash at today’s date.
For 2013 we intend to make a final distribution of 3 pence for each ordinary share making it 5 pence for the year. This 
continues our progressive distribution policy that has seen us return $347 million to ordinary and preference shareholders 
since flotation.
There is no benefit to shareholders of self congratulation (no matter how tempting) the real question is: what comes next?
We still believe that our sector of the market is structurally under supplied and that even modest economic growth in 
Russia will result in a significant excess of demand over supply. Competition remains fragmented and none of the major 
global players has entered the market. Russia continues to present many barriers to entry.
We have a stable position in terms of lease contracts and banking in the medium term, however we will be focussing on 
improving all of these arrangements through active management of tenants and lenders.
Raven Russia has always been about yield. In today’s market stabilised assets produce a dollar yield of 11% and 
developments show around 14%. These stable cashflows provide the platform for attractive and growing distributions to 
shareholders.
We remain committed to distributing to ordinary shareholders by way of tender offer buy-backs. This is tax efficient and 
gives shareholders the option of receiving cash or increasing their percentage holding. In the long term the continual 
shrinking of the share base could have a powerful effect on value.
Our overhead base is stable so all increases in income will flow to the bottom line and enable us to increase distributions. 
Indexation will help but we can add 50,000sqm to 100,000sqm per year by building on existing land. Assuming rents of 
$130 per sqm, each 10,000sqm adds $1.3 million to NOI when let.
We are still pursuing acquisitions of completed assets and Moscow land. 
The global economic and political environment remains difficult. Relatively speaking Russia is in a strong position but 
currency volatility makes financial planning difficult and we know that globalisation means banking contagion. For this 
reason we feel justified in keeping a relatively high balance of free cash.

Business Model
Our Strategy
Our strategy is simple: to build an investment portfolio of Grade A logistics warehouses in Russia that delivers 
progressive distributions to our shareholders.
Russia and Moscow in particular, has long had an under supply of logistics infrastructure supporting its growing 
consumer demand. The sector offers high, dollar denominated, ungeared yields. The market was and continues to be 
neglected by both local and international property investment players and from a standing start in 2005 we have become 
the largest investment company in the warehouse sector in Russia, with only 1.4 million sqm of completed assets.
We see a continuing opportunity to grow our portfolio, especially in the Moscow market. 
Business Model
As there was no active investment market in Russia when we floated the business, we entered into a development 
programme to build our own investment portfolio. Between 2005 and 2010, the majority of that development was 
speculative and it has taken until this year to complete the letting of our properties on acceptable lease terms and with 
the covenants we required.
Our model has adapted over that time from one initially focussed on deploying our equity in forward funding construction 
projects with local joint venture developers, to a geared development model with in house construction project 
management. The bulk of our investment portfolio was completed in 2009 and we entered into a sustained period of 
letting activity. Today, we are a maturing investment property group with a focus on growth through proactive asset 
management, organic development projects and acquisition.
Our tenants are a mixture of large, local and international businesses: retailers; distributors; manufacturers; and large, 
third party logistics providers. Where possible, we look to partner tenants to assist in their growth, the development at 
Noginsk over the last three years is a good example, with high specification developments, completed and in progress, 
for the large Russian retailers X5 and Dixy.
Our lease maturity profile shows a spike in 2016 and we will be working to deal with that well in advance as we will with 
debt maturities arising in 2016/17.
Operating in an underdeveloped investment market such as Russia does come with risks and we expand on these later 
in the Report. 
Information relating to environmental matters is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 50 and information 
relating to employee matters is contained in the Diversity section of the Corporate Governance Report on page 43.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The opportunity of high, Dollar denominated yield attracted us to this market and our KPIs are yield and distribution 
focussed. Our results are driven by increasing rental income and NOI performance, underpinned by the portfolio ERV 
and vacancy rates. 
Our central overheads are reasonably stable and can support more growth. We focus on measurements that reflect our 
ability to pay cash covered distributions, principally underlying earnings and operating cash flows after interest. The latter 
forms the key measurement in our incentive plan targets.
With an immature investment market in Russia, asset values will have less of an effect on our share price than distribution 
growth and may result in a period where our shares trade at a premium to our fully diluted NAV per share.
With a final distribution of 3 pence confirmed and a total of 5 pence for the year, our shares yield 6.7% at today’s share price.
We have struggled to find comparable indices for our stock. Russia is dominated by developers in the property market 
and we do not know of any similar investment companies in our part of the property universe. Similarly, comparing 
ourselves to UK Reits does not work given the disparity in metrics.
However, we have shown a comparison of our total shareholder return over the last 5 years to both the FTSE Small Cap 
and FTSE 350 indices later in the Annual Report, which shows a significant outperformance over that period. RUSSIAN FEDERATION

2013 saw the company consolidate its position as the 
market leader in the warehouse and logistics sector in 
Russia. We delivered 83,600sqm of new space in Moscow 
at our Noginsk and Klimovsk projects, started work at 
Padikovo in Moscow and signed a substantial pre-let with 
Dixy Group at Noginsk in Moscow. We also ended the 
year with a vacancy rate in the portfolio of only 3% and 
contracted NOI of $191.8 million including $1.7 million of 
PLAs and LOIs. This increases to over $200 million with 
the Dixy pre let.

During 2014 we only have 57,800sqm of lease breaks and 
expiries reflecting the defensiveness of our portfolio in the 
short term. Looking further ahead, 161,300sqm expiries 
and breaks occur in 2015 and 302,200sqm in 2016. We 
are already in discussions with a number of these tenants 
with the aim of renewing or extending expiries early to lock 
into today’s strong rents.
Portfolio yields
Valuation yields remain steady at circa 11% for our prime Moscow assets, moving out to 12.5% for St Petersburg and the 
regional cities of Rostov and Novosibirsk. We still believe these yields are above where they should be but without greater 
investment interest in Russia they are likely to stay there. From a shareholders perspective, if we can keep growing the 
portfolio at these yields or better through selective investment, land acquisition and development we should continue to 
produce excellent returns. Klimovsk

Our investment properties were valued by Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL ”) at the period end, in accordance with the RICS 
Valuation and Appraisal guidelines, and are carried at a market value of $1.65 billion (see note 11 to the financial 
statements). This resulted in an increase of $144 million in portfolio value since 2012, reflecting our progress in leasing, 
development and asset management. This carrying value reflects an average yield of 12% on a fully let portfolio NOI of 
$196.7 million (not including phases under construction).

In Moscow, excluding the space under construction at 
Noginsk and Nova Riga, we have eight completed projects 
totalling 966,000sqm, producing an annualised income of 
$135 million at the year end. These properties are virtually 
fully let. During the year we had net lettings of 69,684sqm 
in Moscow increasing our income by $12 million per 
annum. Rents have remained around $130-$135 per sqm 
for Grade A warehousing throughout the year. 
Moscow Portfolio
At Noginsk we completed a further 35,600sqm at a 
marginal yield on cost of 17.7%. We have also signed 
a pre-let with Dixy, the leading Russian Supermarket 
operator, for 39,284sqm on a 15 year lease and annual 
rent of $8.5 million. This space is due for delivery in the first 
quarter of 2015. We anticipate this will generate a marginal 
yield on cost of 17.7% and a development profit of circa 
$11 million. 
 
At Klimovsk we delivered 48,000sqm of new space in the 
summer. This is now 60% leased with a further 9% under 
LOI. Based on actual and anticipated rents of $130 per 
sqm, the project has generated a marginal yield on cost 
of 21%.
 
At Pushkino we have completed circa $10 million of 
improvements to the property that were funded by 
the vendor.  Shushary

Tenant Mix 
Our strategy remains to lease to strong Russian and 
International tenants who can fulfil their rental obligations 
over the term of their lease contracts. In selecting tenants 
we are also conscious of exposure to any one tenant or 
any particular sector or use. Our largest tenant, Itella, 
accounts for only 12% of our annual warehouse NOI. 
We have tenants from a very broad business base who 
are involved in many different aspects of the Russian 
economy, from high street retail, to car part assembly, 
internet retail and pharmaceuticals. This diversified profile 
helps protect the Company from a downturn in any 
particular sector.

We have started work building 39,284sqm at Noginsk for Dixy and on the first 67,000sqm at Nova Riga both for delivery 
in the first quarter of 2015. At Noginsk we still hold another 25.9 ha on which we can build 134,000sqm and at Nova Riga 
there is the potential to add a further 130,000sqm on the additional 25.2 ha we own.
Demand in the regional cities across Russia is improving and we are talking to a number of large occupiers about their 
expansion plans although any development in the regions would only commence once we had signed a pre-let for a long 
term lease. The last of those land plots held under leasehold are nearing their maturity and we have reduced the carrying 
value of these on the assumption that we will not renew the land lease.
The Market
Tenant demand is still driving the market and JLL estimate that take up in 2013 was 1.3 million sqm in Moscow alone. 
The vacancy rate for class A warehouse stood at 1.4% at the year end. In St Petersburg the vacancy rate has fallen to 
1.7%. For 2014, JLL forecast new supply of Grade A warehouse space in Moscow of circa 1.6 million sqm with potential 
demand of 1.1 million sqm. The key trend in the market is the increase in build to suit for sale deals which accounted for 
35% of total take up in 2013, up from 26% in 2012.
The investment market has been relatively quiet over the last twelve months with property owners, anticipating future 
yield compression, unwilling to sell at current prices. The owner occupier market has been strong with circa 316,000 
sqm of space sold in Moscow at an estimated average price of between $1,250 and $1,300 per sqm. This compares 
favourably to our own valuations in Moscow of circa $1,235 per sqm. 
Ownership of one of our largest competitors, MLP, changed in the second half of the year in an off market transaction. 
Their portfolio consisted of 4 assets totalling 730,000sqm, with two properties in Moscow, one in St Petersburg and one 
in Kiev, Ukraine. We estimate the deal was completed at around 11% to 11.5% for the Moscow properties.
Looking into 2014, we are aware of a number of investment deals that have been marketed in the last quarter of 2013 
where deals may close in the next few months at or around 11%. Novosibirsk

operating profit increases to $161.4 million from $111.9 million in 2012.
Our bank interest expense for the year increased with a full year of charge on debt drawn in 2012 (note 7 to financial 
statements), increasing to $63.2 million from $51.1 million. Similarly, our preference share charge increased to $38.3 
million (2012: $33.5 million) with a full year of charge on shares issued in 2012. This charge will halve in the current year 
following the preference share conversion.

Our IFRS results are dominated by the accounting treatment for the preference share conversion exercise completed 
at the year end. The swap of 1 preference share for 2 ordinary shares, for half of the preference shares in issue, results 
in an increase in shareholder funds of $170 million following the issue of new shares and reduction in the preference 
share liability but results in a charge to the income statement of $86 million. This charge reflects the difference between 
the market value of the ordinary shares being issued and the carrying value of the preference shares on the balance 
sheet, which are recorded at amortised cost. Other than the costs of the transaction, there is no cash impact on this 
year’s results.

The preference share conversion strengthens our balance sheet, reducing perceived gearing and reducing exposure 
to the fixed sterling preference share coupon. The ability to progress our distribution policy to ordinary shareholders 
is maintained as the future saving on preference share coupon compensates for the increase in the number of 
ordinary shares.
Our completed investment property portfolio had a market value at 31 December 2013 of $1.65 billion, up from $1.5 
billion at the end of 2012. This follows transfers from assets under construction of $85 million and a valuation uplift of 
$57 million. Investment property under construction had a market value of $116 million at the year end, down from 
$147 million at the beginning of the year following the completion of phases at Noginsk and Klimovsk and after a net 
revaluation uplift of $6.7 million.
Following the preference share conversion exercise, adjusted fully diluted NAV per share increased during the year from 
$1.25 to $1.26.

We have total debt outstanding of $815 million at the year end (2012: $776 million), with only $43 million (2012: $128 
million) unhedged. Our average weighted cost of debt remains stable at 7.2% (2012: 7.3%) and weighted average time to 
maturity remains at 4.7 years (2012: 4.7 years).
We have one short term maturity of $37 million which we aim to roll over during the year.
Our focus on debt in the year has been refinancing the equity on the additional phases we completed at Klimovsk 
and Noginsk and refinancing the most expensive debt we have on our regional assets. We have achieved the former, 
drawing an additional $20 million before the year end and $23 million on the latter early in the current year. We have also 
refinanced our Rostov facility, with a new loan of $61 million, repaying the existing facility of $41 million. The refinancing 
of our Novosibirsk asset is also progressing well with a new loan now credit approved at a cost of debt to the Group well 
below the existing facility. We aim to complete this refinancing in the next quarter.
Our attention is now on the maturities which arise in 2016 and 2017 and we will aim to extend these maturities well before 
they reach term.
We are also in discussions to finalise a long term construction loan secured on the Nova Riga project which will allow us 
to accelerate the build programme there.
Foreign Exchange
The Rouble depreciation in the last few months has put focus on foreign exchange risk. As a US Dollar denominated 
business the main foreign exchange risks we face are:
 •
Rental income: leases are pegged to the US Dollar and we receive a variable Rouble amount based on the Central 
Bank exchange rate on the date paid;
 •
Property operating costs: these are recoverable from tenants and are Rouble denominated;
 •
Construction costs: the majority of these are Rouble amounts;
 •
Administrative costs: the majority of these are salary related and the only exposure is central overheads which are 
paid in Sterling; and
 •
Preference share coupon: this is a Sterling cost.
In the majority of cases, we hold sufficient cash in the three main currencies of US Dollar, Rouble and Sterling to cover 
cash requirements. The most significant of these is ongoing property operating costs and sufficient Rouble reserves are 
held to cover these each quarter. The remainder of rental income is then converted to US Dollars to service our US Dollar 
debt requirements and pass surplus cash to the holding company. We are mindful that the majority of our tenants are 
Rouble based companies and the continued weakening of the Rouble means that their US Dollar denominated rents get 
increasingly expensive. Lobnya

As our construction activities are now a smaller part of the business, there is no significant foreign exchange exposure 
and our cost of construction reduces with the weakening Rouble.
We maintain sufficient rolling Sterling cash balances to cover our overhead exposure.
Following the preference share conversion exercise, our exposure to the preference share coupon has been halved. We 
do still maintain a three year cap at $1.60 to £1.00, maturing quarterly to hedge the exposure.
As we hold a mixture of different currency cash balances and also preference shares denominated in Sterling, our 
balance sheet is open to unrealised exchange movements but these should unwind as the cash is used for future 
expenditure. Given the long term nature of the preference shares there is no reason to hedge their principal value and 
as the recent conversion to ordinary shares demonstrated, there are methods for redeeming these without foreign 
exchange risk.
So the main risk is any knock on effect that the weak Rouble has on consumer demand and the level of rents that can be 
achieved in the market place. We are watching the trends closely.
Subsidaries
Our trading subsidiaries have performed well this year. Raven Mount has now disposed of the majority of its legacy 
residential stock in the UK and its joint venture for second homes at The Lakes in the Cotswolds continues to generate 
cash. 
Roslogistics has contributed $14.7 million to profit (2012: $10.2 million), the equivalent of $1.3 million profit (2012: loss of 
$3.2 million) after taking account of the rent and operating expenses payable to the Group for warehouse space.
Provisions
We continue to carry a provision for a legacy litigation claim on the Pushkino project, which we acquired in 2012. The 
liability is covered by retention monies released to us by the vendor during the year. The majority of this is held as 
restricted cash until the litigation is settled. Details are given in note 25 to the Financial Statements.
The year ahead
We have a strong balance sheet today and the year ahead is about minimising risk, especially in the current environment. 
A long period of Rouble weakness could have an impact on demand for our new stock and the sustainability of the 
current rent roll on our existing portfolio. It is too early to say if there will be wider implications, on the banking sector and 
cost of debt for example. But, for now, as the Chairman said, it is business as usual in Russia.  Sholokhovo

The Board places significant importance on identifying and 
managing the risks facing the business. These encompass 
the risks, real and perceived, of operating in a foreign 
market such as Russia, to the more obvious cyclical, 
property specific risks, presented by the development and 
investment in a large property portfolio.
In the last nine years we have addressed the fundamental 
risks of entry into any new market, identifying experienced 
and trustworthy local joint venture partners in the early 
stages and gradually building up our own domestic 
presence. We are now the largest player in our niche and 
have all of the in house skills required to manage both 
local regulatory and generic property risks. Our in house 
expertise includes legal, finance and accounting, leasing, 
asset management and construction departments. We 
believe that we have the structure and culture in place to 
identify and effectively manage the risks that our market 
and sector presents.
The macro and political risks that have arisen since 2008, 
including the current situation in Ukraine, obviously have 
an impact on our business and we strive to dampen 
the effects of those as best we can. We pass foreign 
exchange risk onto our tenants with US Dollar pegged 
rents in exchange for reduced inflationary indexation 
(linked to US CPI rather than Russian inflation); we use ring 
fenced structures to hold assets, minimising recourse to 
the holding company; we have a diverse spread of funding 
banks, both international and domestic; similarly, we have 
a diverse range of tenants, international and domestic; 
and we have a mixture of capital instruments that we can 
offer on the Company balance sheet, ordinary shares, 
preference shares and warrants. All of which, to date, 
has allowed us to minimise the effect of downturns on 
our shareholders. 
Our primary focus remains an offering of attractive returns 
for our shareholders. As such, and in the context of the 
paragraph above, we have a commensurate focus on 
financial risks. Set out below is an overview of how we 
manage our key financial risks.
Financial Risks
Our strategy from the outset has been simple: to build 
an investment portfolio in the Russian warehouse sector 
which allows us to generate a high Dollar denominated, 
ungeared yield on cost. We believed that this would 
translate into very attractive distribution yields for 
our shareholders.
Gearing
Gearing has enabled us to accelerate our growth but we 
have managed the increased risk to the Group by raising 
asset secured facilities, ring-fenced in special purpose 
vehicle structures. We have not taken any significant bank 
debt exposure onto the holding company balance sheet 
to date. This allows us to monitor both our debt service 
obligations at an asset level but maintain low gearing ratios 
at a consolidated level. Our Group gearing levels, not 
including preference shares, have been managed between 
41% and 48%. This held us in good stead during a busy 
speculative construction period in 2008 and 2009 and 
through the recent financial crises.
The changing banking landscape, combined with our 
maturing portfolio, may mean that we do look to alternative 
financing structures in the future. We have demonstrated 
this already with the issue of preference shares and at 
some point we may change our financing risk profile to 
a more central financing structure, using the portfolio as 
a whole, to reduce our effective cost of debt. We would 
be mindful of refinancing and covenant risk if we were to 
move in that direction.
Key Performance Indicators
With the impact of gearing and our preference shares on 
results, we place emphasis on our “Underlying Earnings” 
(as defined in note 9 to the financial statements) and 
operating cash flows after financing costs, the key metric 
in our incentive schemes. These measures give the most 
relevant and comparable information on the operating 
performance of our portfolio and our ability to pay 
distributions from those operations.
We also monitor our loan to value covenants and the 
impact of valuations on our diluted net asset value per 
share. However, given that valuation yields in our market 
remain significantly above other comparable European 
markets (close to replacement cost) and result in high 
cash cover on debt service, we do not currently see this 
as a key metric on our performance. Our focus is on yield 
driving our shareholder return.
Property Acquisition and Development
The market in which we operate has been and continues 
to be undersupplied. This means that we have had to 
construct the majority of our portfolio speculatively, 2008 
and 2009 being the periods of greatest construction activity. 
The global downturn resulted in this new space taking time 
to let with the cost of vacant space being carried by the 
Group. We have now reached letting levels that reduce this 
cost to de minimis levels. 
New development in today’s market has the potential to 
deliver high income yields, especially on additional phases 
of existing assets. We have commenced a speculative 
construction programme limited to a maximum of 100,000 
sqm in any year. This allows us to manage the construction 
and letting risk on new space in the context of our existing 
portfolio of 1.4 million sqm.
There are a number of potential acquisition opportunities in 
the market, of completed, fully let properties. We continue 
to assess acquisitions of fully let income producing assets 
to grow the portfolio. Acquisitions have presented their 
own risks in our market as we have not been involved in the 
historic construction and management of the sites. Whilst 
this adds to the potential for enhanced asset management 
returns it also introduces the risk of legacy issues that may 
need to be managed out. This is all part of the integration 
risk of introducing new assets to the portfolio.
Risk Report   
We have set out in the following table the principal risks and uncertainties that face our business, our view on how those 
risks have changed during the year and a description of how we mitigate or manage those risks. Given the current 
political climate we see the first three of the financial risks below increasing.
Financial Risk

Bank Lending
The number of banks lending 
in our market diminishes 
because of macro economic 
or political events.
Reduced access to funding 
and potential increase in 
funding cost.
Reduces ability to refinance 
maturing facilities.
Debt facility maturities have 
a weighted average of 4.7 
years with only one near term 
maturity at 30 September 
2014. 
Larger Russian domestic 
lenders are now offering 
debt on similar terms to the 
international banks who have 
exited the market although 
we will need to monitor this 
position following recent 
Central Bank rate hikes;
Alternative sources of funding 
such as preference shares are 
available; and
Facilities have a mix of 
amortising profiles and 
approximately $50 million of 
principal is repaid each year. 
This means that our gearing 
levels are low (44.44% at 31 
December 2013) and debt 
service coverage ratios are 
more than adequately met.

Adverse movements in 
Rouble or Sterling against US 
Dollar
A reduction in our US Dollar 
denominated earnings.
Rental income, whilst received 
in Roubles, is pegged to the 
US Dollar exchange rate, 
the exchange risk being 
passed to tenants. In return, 
indexation is held to US CPI 
levels rather than Russian 
inflation. Sustained Rouble 
weakness will ultimately 
affect our tenants as they 
are predominately Rouble 
businesses so there may 
be a point where temporary 
reductions have to be 
considered;
We retain sufficient Rouble 
funds from rent collection 
to meet Rouble expenditure 
requirements;
Construction costs are 
payable in Roubles, if we have 
insufficient Rouble resources 
to cover future construction 
payments we may enter into 
Non Deliverable Forward 
instruments to retain certainty 
on our US Dollar returns;
Our largest Sterling exposure 
is the payment of preference 
share coupon and ordinary 
share dividends; 
We have capped the 
exposure of our preference 
share coupon to December 
2016 and retain sterling 
cash where possible to 
cover known ordinary share 
dividend commitments; and
Our balance sheet is open to 
unrealised losses on foreign 
exchange if the US Dollar 
weakens against Sterling and/
or the Rouble but these have 
minimal cash effect.

GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Corporate Governance
Chairman’s foreword
In this section of our Annual Report we explain how the principles of corporate governance have been adopted across 
the Group. The Board is committed to good corporate governance and see it as vital to support the delivery of our 
strategic objectives, and as such, governance has been embedded within the way the business is run and managed. 
This year will be the first time we have reported under the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) and the 
new narrative and accounting requirements. This report aims to more fully explain the process adopted by the Group in 
delivering compliance with the Code.
Richard Jewson 
9 March 2014
The Financial Conduct Authority’s listing rules require the Company to explain how it has applied the Main Principles 
of Section 1 of the Code. This report, together with the Directors’, Audit and Remuneration Committee Reports, set 
out how the Company has done so. For the financial year ended 31 December 2013, we have treated the Company 
as a ‘smaller company’ for the purposes of the Code. This is not strictly correct as we entered the FTSE 350 for one 
quarter of the year and as such did not meet the criteria of a “smaller company”. This means that, as 50% of our Board, 
excluding the Chairman, did not comprise of Non Executive Directors, we were not in compliance (B1.2 of the Code). 
However, as our stay in the FTSE 350 was not prolonged, we have maintained the current Board composition. Except 
for this, in the opinion of the Board, the Company has complied fully with the Main and Supporting Principles of the Code 
throughout the financial year. Copies of the Code can be obtained free of charge from the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website: www.frc.org.uk. 
Leadership
The Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the governance processes 
of the Group whilst monitoring the performance of 
the Executives to whom it delegates management 
responsibility for the Group. There is a defined division 
of the responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the 
effective working of the Board and the Chief Executive 
for the operational management of the business. 
This includes development of the Group’s strategy 
and business model, the presentation of this to the 
Board and ultimately its implementation across the 
Group. Terms of reference delineating a clear division 
of responsibilities are in place and are reviewed on 
a regular basis. 
The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters 
reserved solely for its consideration as outlined below 
and updates this schedule as necessary. 
The Board has delegated a number of its responsibilities 
through its Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees. Terms of reference for each of these 
committees are reviewed periodically by the Board, 
the most recent update having been performed in 
November 2013, and are available on the Company’s 
website: www.ravenrussia.com

GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
The Board and its Committees
Board composition
During the year, the Board comprised eight Directors: Non Executive Chairman, Richard Jewson; four Executive 
Directors; and three Non Executive Directors. The Board considers all of the Non Executive Directors to be independent 
for the purposes of the Code. The Board considers the Chairman to be independent. The balance of skills and expertise 
of the Board ensures that no individual or group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision making, allowing for 
independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s deliberations. The roles of the individual Directors are explained 
further below.
Christopher Sherwell is the Senior Independent Director of the Company.
Biographies for each Director are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The full Board meets at least six times a year to consider general matters affecting the Company and otherwise as 
required. Committee meetings comprising any two or more Directors meet on an ad hoc basis to consider transactional 
and related matters concerning the Company’s business. During 2013, there were 17 such committee meetings. 
Meetings are generally held in Guernsey at the Group’s head office, however at least once a year, the Board will hold 
a formal meeting in Russia to review the Group’s operations and meet local management. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information, including briefing 
papers distributed in advance of any board meeting and regular management information. All of the Directors are 
entitled to have access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where they deem it necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. On appointment, a Director receives advice from the Company’s 
financial and other professional advisers as to the affairs of the Company and their responsibilities, an estimation of time 
commitments necessary to undertake the role and a commitment to receive other such training as may be appropriate.

Effectiveness
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertakes annual performance evaluations of its own and its Committees’ activities. These are led by the 
Chairman and where dealing with his own performance, by the Senior Independent Director.
The performance evaluations during 2013 were again facilitated by the Institute of Directors and took the form of a 
questionnaire and production of a report. The findings of the report were discussed in detail by the Board and it was 
concluded that the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was effective and the Board had 
the necessary balance of skills, expertise, independence and knowledge required to direct the business. 
The Board and Nominations Committee annually consider the composition of the Board and its Committees with 
reference to the Group’s needs and also the requirements of the Code. In accordance with the Code, all Directors will be 
put forward for re-election each year at the Annual General Meeting. Having considered the balance of skills, expertise 
and performance of the Board, its committees and individual Directors, the Board recommends each of the Directors for 
re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Anton Bilton, Christopher Sherwell and Richard Jewson, who is Chairman. The 
Committee undertakes an annual review of any succession planning and ensures that the membership and composition 
of the Board and its Committees are constituted appropriately in light of the requirements of the Group and those of the 
Code, with the necessary balance of skills, expertise, independence and diversity to undertake their roles effectively. The 
Committee continues to review the Board and its Committees’ composition in light of the Code. The Committee agreed 
that no formal policy or standard will be adopted to meet any diversity targets, including gender, as this could be unfairly 
prejudicial and bias the opinions and judgements of the Board and its Committees’ in any selection process. 
Should the Committee consider it necessary to either refresh or enlarge the Board or its Committees, giving due regard 
to the outcome of the evaluation process for the year and acting in accordance with its terms of reference, a rigorous 
and thorough evaluation will be undertaken by the Committee in assessing the requirements of the Group so that the 
individual or individuals appointed will add value to the activities of the business.

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Stephen Coe, Richard Jewson, David Moore and Christopher Sherwell, 
who is Chairman. The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year to review the performance of Executive 
Directors and to recommend their remuneration and other benefit packages. The fees of the Non Executive Directors 
are determined by the Executive Directors. Full details of the activities undertaken by the Committee during the year are 
included within the Remuneration Report and elsewhere in the Annual Report. The Remuneration Report will be subject 
to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholder Relations
The Chief Executive, Executive Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer are the Company’s points of contact for 
investors, fund managers, analysts, the press and other interested parties. The Company’s investor relations programme 
includes formal presentations of the annual and interim results, as well as regular analyst briefings and meetings. 
The Board receives updates on the Company’s investor relations activities including any reports prepared by the 
Company’s brokers, external analyst papers, and details of any shareholder meetings.
The Board believes that sustainable financial performance and delivering on the objectives of the Company are key 
measures in building trust with the Company’s shareholders. To promote a clear understanding of the Company, its 
objectives and financial results, the Board ensures that information relating to the Company is disclosed in a timely 
manner and in a format suitable to the shareholders of the Company. The Company’s website has been developed 
to facilitate communication with all shareholders. Communication through these means allow our investors to receive 
information in a timely and cost effective manner. 
The notice of AGM accompanies this report and a separate proxy card is provided for shareholders.
Diversity
The Nominations Committee continue to review the Board and its Committees composition in light of the Code and 
business requirements. The Board consider the experience, background, age and tenure of each individual to contribute 
to the diversity of the Board, its Committees and the wider Group. In any recruitment across the Group, appointments 
are made on merit, ensuring the best candidates are appointed to support the operating activities of the Group. 
Information about the diversity of the Group’s workforce is set out here. 42 | 43
GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Audit Committee Report
Audit Committee Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2013. This report sets out the 
work of the Committee throughout the year and includes additional disclosure reflecting the changes to the Code in 
this reporting cycle. We are following the proposed changes to the legislative requirements for listed companies and 
the impact of the recent preliminary agreement on audit reform confirmed by the EU Permanent Representatives 
Committee. Whilst we are not an EU company we will be assessing our approach on issues such as auditor rotation, 
non audit services, the transition provisions that will be proposed by the legislation and general, ongoing best practice for 
Listed Companies.
During the year, the Committee’s role continued to be:
 •
monitoring of the integrity of the Group’s financial statements;
 •
reviewing the significant areas of judgement included in the financial statements;
 •
reviewing the role of the external auditors, including independence and remuneration; and
 •
monitoring the quality of the Group’s internal controls and risk management functions.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, we have also reported to the Board on whether the Committee believes that the 
annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable.
During the year the Committee met with the external auditors, with and without management present, to assess the audit 
approach, audit independence and the working relationship between the Group auditor and management. We have also 
met and had telephone discussions with Jones Lang LaSalle, the Group’s appointed independent valuers, to discuss the 
property portfolio, valuation methodology and more generally, the market conditions in the locations in which the Group 
operates.
In both cases, we believe that the working relationship is good and that the management approach and estimates are 
appropriately challenged. As explained in the report below, we have also assessed the ongoing engagement of our 
auditor and valuers and recommended their continuing appointment in the current financial year.
We also review the business risk and internal control frameworks regularly. There were no significant changes to these 
during the year and they are reported on in the Strategic report and Corporate Governance sections of the Annual 
Report.
Steve Coe
Chairman
Audit Committee
9 March 2014  
The Audit Committee
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored and 
reported. The Committee reviews the annual and interim financial statements, the accounting policies of the Group, key 
areas of accounting judgement, management information statements, financial announcements, internal control systems, 
risk management, and the continuing appointment of the Group auditor. It also monitors the whistle blowing policy and 
procedures for fraud and bribery.
The Committee comprises David Moore, Christopher Sherwell and Stephen Coe, (Chairman). The Chairman is 
considered to have recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code. The Committee meets at least 
twice a year. There are a number of regular attendees at meetings of the Audit Committee, including other members of 
the Board, senior management and the Group’s external auditor. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the 
external Group auditor without management present throughout the year.
The Committee met three times during 2013 and addressed:
 •
The recommendation to the Board to approve the 2012 annual and 2013 interim financial statements following 
consideration of the key areas of judgement;
 •
The appointment, remuneration and continued independence of the external auditor; and
 •
The monitoring of the Group’s internal control procedures and risk management.
The action taken on these areas is expanded on below.
External Audit and Valuations
External Audit
During the year, the Committee has considered the appointment, compensation, performance and independence of the 
Group’s auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. 
Ernst & Young were appointed in 2008 following a tender process and this is their sixth year of tenure as Group auditor. 
The current lead partner has been in place for three years. The Committee met with the key members of the audit team 
throughout the year and Ernst & Young have formally confirmed their continued independence as part of the interim and 
final financial statements process. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the lead audit partner outside of 
the formal meetings to discuss any issues arising in the course of the audit and to confirm no restrictions on scope are 
placed on them by management. The Chairman also has regular meetings with the CFO and COO to discuss the audit 
approach, relationship with auditors and fee structure.
The external auditor prepares a detailed audit plan for the Committee which includes their assessment of the key risks 
impacting the financial statements. The Committee actively monitors these risks and obtains updates from the external 
auditor on the status of their procedures covering these risks throughout the year.
Local statutory audits of individual subsidiary companies are also required in the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates, being Guernsey, Cyprus, Russia and the UK. Ernst & Young carry out these audits in Guernsey and Cyprus 
but trading entities in Russia and the UK are audited locally by Baker Tilly and Crowe Clark Whitehill respectively. The 
Committee believes that this gives a balance to our overall audit provision and added assurance to the audit process.
Non Audit Services
Ernst & Young LLP have also provided non-audit services to the Group where they are determined to be best placed 
to provide the particular service. The Committee has policies in place for non audit service provision and the external 
auditor will not be permitted to carry out services such as property valuation or accounting services. The non-audit 
services provided are typically assignments, such as a review of the interim financial statements, tax advisory or 
transaction advisory services. As shown in note 6(b) to the financial statements, total fees payable to Ernst & Young LLP 
in the year to 31 December 2013 amounted to $1.5 million, of which $512,000 was for non-audit services. This included 
$432,000 for transactional advisory services in connection with the preference share conversion and prospectus prior 
to the year end. The Committee was satisfied of the auditor’s independence on this assignment as they followed their 
own internal procedures, with a team independent of the audit team carrying out the work and reported directly to the 
Company’s brokers.
Committee Conclusions
The Committee has recommended a resolution for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young to be proposed to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. However, we will be meeting with the auditors later in the year to review our approach to 
non audit services, auditor rotation and re-tender in light of the proposed EU legislation on audit appointments. 44 | 45
GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Valuers
As with the external audit process, the Committee monitors the objectivity of the Group’s external valuers, Jones Lang 
LaSalle. We have had open discussion with the valuers during the year on the valuation process and the external auditor 
has direct access to them as part of the audit process. We also have the opportunity to see comparable valuations 
of part of the portfolio each year, where independent valuations are required for banking purposes and these are 
undertaken by other external independent valuers. The Committee and management are of the view that the approach of 
Jones Lang LaSalle is both appropriate and robust and intend to renew their engagement for the current year.
Significant Issues Considered by the Audit Committee
In recommending the approval of the 2013 financial statements, the Committee considered the following:
Matter Arising Action
Property Valuations
Valuations for investment property and investment 
property under construction are conducted by external 
valuers. The land bank is carried at Directors’ valuation.
Valuation movements can have a significant impact on 
the Group’s net asset value.
The Committee discusses the valuation approach with 
both management and the external valuers.
The Committee also assesses the continuing 
independence and objectivity of the valuers. The 
external auditors have direct access to the external 
valuer and comment on the key assumptions and 
movements on property valuations. Management also 
prepared and presented a detailed report on the land 
bank in November 2013, underpinning the basis for the 
valuation. The Committee considered and compared 
the views of all of the above together with independent 
market information available and was satisfied that the 
judgement used was appropriate.
Provisions and Acquisitions
The most significant provision on the balance sheet 
relates to outstanding litigation inherited as part of an 
acquisition in 2012. The vendor dealt with the expected 
cost of this litigation, initially through indemnities backed 
by retentions held in escrow and latterly with a release 
of the escrow amounts as a reduction in the cost of 
the acquisition. 
Due to its contingent nature, the level of provision 
required is dependent on legal and management 
judgement. The Committee has discussed progress at 
length with management, and legal representation has 
been received on the likely outcome of the case. The 
position at the year end was also discussed with the 
auditors. This provision is covered by retention amounts 
released by the vendor and the key risk is that the 
litigation outcome and costs exceed that amount. 
The Committee also discussed any judgement made 
by management on the release and allocation of that 
retention amount as part of the acquisition accounting.
The Committee is satisfied with the approach to both the 
provision and acquisition accounting.
Internal Control and Risk Management 
The Board has overall responsibility for the systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness throughout the 
Group. This is an on going process, in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal controls, that 
identifies, evaluates and manages the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives. Such a system is designed to manage or reduce the effects of the possible risks to which the 
Group’s activities are subject, rather than providing absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Consideration of risks and risk management form an integral part of the Board deliberations and are key to its decision 
making processes. There are risks which the Board have no control over. These are mainly overriding external risks 
such as the wider economic environment, however the impact of such risks and effect that they have on the Group are 
considered and mitigated to the extent possible. The strategic decisions of the Group are adjusted to address these 
issues ensuring that threats are reduced and opportunities are exploited.   
Key features of the risk management process in place during the year and up to the date of the annual report and 
financial statements include:
 •
A comprehensive system of reporting and business planning;
 •
A defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board;
 •
An organisational structure chart with clearly defined levels of authority and division of responsibilities;
 •
Formal documented policies and procedures throughout the Group;
 •
The close involvement of the Executive Directors and senior management in all aspects of the day-to-day operations, 
including regular meetings to review all operational aspects of the business and risk management systems;
 •
The Board’s review of Group strategy and progress against objectives throughout the year;
 •
A formal whistle blowing policy;
 •
A comprehensive and robust system of financial reporting which includes regular management information, such as 
budgets, re-forecasts, cash flows, treasury reporting and management accounts with review of financial KPIs; and
 •
A regular assessment of risks within the business at all operational levels.
The Audit Committee has established a Risk Committee to carry out the review and assessment of risks associated 
with the business. This Committee comprises Executive Directors and senior management involved in each operating 
jurisdiction and department of the Group. This engenders a culture of risk assessment within the Group and reinforces 
the strategic objectives communicated by the Board. During the year ended 2013, the Risk Committee met five times. 
The Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee on its deliberations and findings. The risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group is subject are reviewed and considered by the Audit Committee and the Board 
at regular intervals, particularly with reference to the strategic objectives of the business. The principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group are included elsewhere in the Annual Report.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of these systems of internal control and has reported its findings to 
the Board throughout the year and up to the date of the Annual Report and financial statements.
Due to its size, structure and the nature of its activities, the Group does not have an internal audit function. 
The Committee has revisited its previous decision and concluded that there is no need for a separate internal audit 
function at this time but will continue to keep this matter under review. This view is supported by the Board given the 
stable nature and trading activities as an investment property group and the relatively small number of individual assets 
in the portfolio. 46 | 47
GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate responsibility covers many different aspects of business but our primary focus is on the environmental impact 
of our activities and properties and the social impact in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is the responsibility 
of the Board to manage the environmental, economic and social impact of the Group’s business strategy.
The Board recognises that the way its investment properties are designed, built, managed and occupied can significantly 
influence their impact on the environment and the community in which they are located and it seeks to manage these 
issues. Although the Group is not required by statute to provide detailed reports on its environmental impact, the Board 
considers this an issue that must be monitored and warrants disclosure. The information required by Main Market 
listed businesses to report on levels of greenhouse gas emissions is set out below. The inclusion of further metrics and 
information, such as waste and water usage, will be considered for future years. 
The Board also recognises the social impact of its operations in each of its key jurisdictions, Russia, Guernsey and Cyprus. 
In Russia, this is particularly evident in the employment opportunities that are created in the communities where the 
Group’s properties are located. Staff are encouraged to participate in community activities and the Board has established 
a fund to support local causes or charities, which meet the corporate values of the Group. During 2013 the Group 
committed to support various causes from national and local charities to supporting local community sports groups. No 
political donations were made during the year.
Greenhouse Gases 
We commissioned Trucost to assist in compiling our report to comply with the Mandatory Greenhouse Gases Reporting 
Regulations (GHG). Energy consumption information was collated from all 12 warehouses in the portfolio and the Group’s 
vehicles to report on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The reporting covers 99% of our business by net operating income 
and 100% by warehouse floor area.
The table below sets out the emissions table collated and the intensity ratio agreed at tonnes / square metre of floor area.

Data collection and methodology protocol
The group used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
methodology for compiling its GHG data, and includes the 
following material GHG’s: CO
2
, N

O and CH
4
. The Group 
used the following emission conversion factor sources:
 •
Natural gas: DEFRA 2013 conversion factor for cubic 
meters natural gas
 •
Diesel: DEFRA 2013 conversion factor for litres diesel
 •
Office car: DEFRA 2013 conversion factor for kilometres 
of unknown fuel (average car)
 •
Purchased electricity: IEA Fuel Combustion (Highlights 
2011 Edition) and EIA Foreign Electricity Emission 
Factors
 •
District heating: electricity factors were adjusted using 
the same ratio as between UK electricity, and district 
heating (from DEFRA 2013 conversion factors for UK 
electricity, and district heat and steam)
Although tenants are the end users of the energy consumed, we consider this an important metric to measure. Not only 
does this make our buildings more attractive to tenants and funders but also the more energy efficient our buildings are 
the less greenhouse gas production occurs at our sites. 
As our relations with key tenants become more established we are working with them to anticipate their requirements 
with specifically designed buildings. In the case of energy intensive uses, such as cold storage, this allows a more efficient 
building to be constructed compared to the adaptation of a standard warehouse unit.
Other examples of increased efficiency include adopting low energy lighting in our new warehouses and new 
developments are being assessed by BREEAM, the worlds longest established and most widely used method of 
assessing, rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings. Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact of 
our developments and use the results of BREEAM assessments to provide practical ideas for future and existing 
development projects.
Due to the locations of the investment portfolio and the extremes of weather which they are subject to, there is no industry 
data from which meaningful comparisons could be drawn. The data which has been collated for the year ended 31 
December 2013 will be used to set targets on energy usage going forward.  
Letter from the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present our report on Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 
2013. This encompasses “The UK Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act of 2013” introduced during the year and whilst, as 
a Guernsey registered company, we are not required to follow these regulations, we have adopted them as best practice.
Business Strategy
The business has had a simple strategy since its incorporation: to build an investment portfolio of grade A warehouses 
in Russia, that delivers progressive distributions to our shareholders. Our remuneration policies for Executive Directors 
and Senior Management are driven by that strategy in a way that is also transparent and simple. Targets set underpin our 
ability to pay progressive cash covered distributions and avoid discretionary awards. The cornerstone has been minimising 
cash incentives and maximising share based incentives so that progressive distributions become an important element of 
Executive Directors’ and Senior Management’s annual income.
Performance Outcomes
The business has performed exceptionally well this year and targets for the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive 
Scheme “CBLTIS” and the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) have been met. Expectations have been exceeded with 
extremely high letting levels reached (97%), vacant space in the Regions taken up at a much faster pace and at higher rents 
than foreseen. Raven Mount has also accelerated the sale of its legacy housing stock and generated significantly higher 
cash contributions in the last two years. This has resulted in significant outperformance in the year and allows us to increase 
our distribution to ordinary shareholders by 33%. Details of the incentive schemes are given in the Remuneration Policy 
table and the summary of targets and performance is:
2013 Performance Maximum Target
CBLTIS – Operating cash inflow after interest $88 million $45 million
LTIP – Total shareholder return 220.0% 20.2%
Remuneration Decisions
This means that 100% of the share incentive available for the Executives and senior management will be issued. 
No discretion has been exercised by the Remuneration Committee in recommending these awards. In line with policy, 
increases in base salaries for Executives have been limited to inflation and no cash bonuses are available.
There has been no change in the remuneration policy during the year but following the preference share conversion 
exercise, targets for 2014 will be adjusted to account for the impact of the reduced preference share coupon. Details of the 
preference share conversion are given in the Strategic Report and the conversion means that operating cash flows after 
interest will increase by $19 million per annum as the fixed coupon obligation has been halved. The Policy table discloses 
the revised targets for 2014.
Current Year
The Committee focus is now on the development of an incentive plan for the three years to 31 December 2017 , 
as the current schemes end this year. It is intended that the new scheme will follow the same parameters as the existing 
CBLTIS, with targets set based on potential covered distributions to shareholders and no cash bonuses available. 
We intend to discuss the parameters of the new scheme with key shareholders to incorporate their feedback before formally 
presenting it at the AGM.
Business KPIs
Elsewhere in the Annual Report we have looked at the movement in business KPIs over the last five years, the term of the 
existing LTIP . The business performance can be summarised as follows:
 •
Let space at 1 January 2009 was 389,000sqm increasing to 1,345,000sqm at 31 December 2013;
 •
Reported NOI of $40 million in 2009 increasing to $186 million in 2013;
 •
An underlying loss of $27 million increasing to an underlying profit of $60 million;
 •
An underlying basic loss per share of 5.6 cents, now an underlying basic profit per share of 10.9 cents; 
 •
Operating cash after interest, an outflow of $29 million in 2009, an inflow of $88 million in 2013;
 •
A Total Shareholder Return on Ordinary Shares over the five years of 353%; and
 •
A Total Shareholder Return on Preference Shares of 122% since the first issue. 48 | 49
GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Compare those metrics with the progression of the remuneration of the four Executive Directors in the same period:
 •
An average basic salary of £378,000 per annum over the 5 years;
 •
An average of £84,000 per annum of cash bonuses paid in the period;
 •
Negligible holding of ordinary shares from incentive schemes at 1 January 2009 to a total vesting of 10.3 million ordinary 
shares and 3.3 million preference shares from remuneration schemes at 31 December 2013;
 •
Being 1.4% and 3.4% of total shares respectively with a current value of £8.2 million and £5.2 million.
It is easy to see from the above comparison that the Executive Board have been rewarded for their efforts since 
appointment with a heavy weighting towards shares to be held for the long term and why they will continue to be 
incentivised to deliver the progressive distribution policy.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Introduction
Composition
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Board’s Non Executive Directors, Stephen Coe, Richard Jewson, 
David Moore and Christopher Sherwell, who is Chairman.
Report Format
The following sections look at: 
 •
Our remuneration policy and how it links to our Group strategy;
 •
The current remuneration structure and how that will operate in 2014;
 •
A summary of the total remuneration packages for the Executive Directors in 2013;
 •
Targets achieved for incentive schemes in 2013;
 •
The relative spend on Executive Director pay compared to profit, distributions to shareholders and total Group pay;
 •
A summary of the Chief Executive Officer’s total pay; and
 •
The various disclosure requirements that are subject to audit. 
Remuneration Policy and Strategy 
The Group’s remuneration policy supports the corporate strategy of building an investment portfolio which allows 
progressive distributions to be made to our shareholders. As with any remuneration policy we must be able to attract, 
retain and incentivise high calibre executives and senior staff whilst aligning their interests with those of shareholders and 
other stakeholders in the business. We strive to keep the remuneration structure as simple and transparent as possible in 
meeting these objectives. 
The current structure has developed over the last five years and:
 •
is weighted towards long term share ownership;
 •
does not include any cash bonus element for Executive Directors or Senior Management;
 •
is based on clear targets set at the date of grant which underpin progressive distributions over three years; and
 •
means the distributions become an important element of the Executives’ and Senior Management annual income as 
shareholders in the business.
The following table summarises the elements of the current remuneration package of the Executive Directors:  
 Purpose and link 
to strategy
Operation Opportunity
Base Salary To retain, attract 
and motivate the 
right people for 
our business.
Salaries are reviewed annually and fixed for 
the calendar year reflecting:
the experience and responsibilities of each 
individual;
Market comparators for listed companies; and
percentage increases in base salary for the 
Group as a whole.
Except for an increase 
in base salary for Colin 
Smith in 2012, Executive 
Directors’ base salary 
increases have been held 
to a maximum of UK RPI 
since 2009.
Benefits To promote the 
wellbeing of 
Executives
Benefits are limited to life insurance, 
health insurance, and private healthcare.
None
Pension To reward 
continuing 
service 
A contribution is made to personal pension 
arrangements or direct to personal 
pension plans.
Benefits and pension contributions are held at 
the lower end of listed company comparators.
Contributions of 10% of 
base salary are made 
each year.
Combined 
Bonus and 
Long Term 
Incentive 
Scheme 
(“CBLTIS”)
A simple and 
transparent 
scheme with 
targets linked 
directly to the 
Company’s 
strategy of 
progressive 
distributions.
Encourages 
long term share 
ownership for 
key individuals.
No cash bonuses will be paid with reference 
to performance in the three years to 
31/12/2014.
Awards were granted at the commencement 
of the scheme and vest annually over a three 
year period, in ordinary shares or other capital 
instruments of the Company.
The equivalent of 22.5m ordinary shares is 
held for the maximum awards over the three 
years of the scheme for Executives and 
Senior Management.
Targets are fixed at the commencement of the 
scheme and are based on the operating cash 
flow after interest of the Group
Other than the sale of shares to meet 
personal tax obligations, no discretionary 
disposal of awards under the scheme can be 
made until April 2016.
However the Committee expect that 
Executives will hold the majority of shares 
awarded for the long term.
The maximum award in 
any year is the lower of the 
equivalent of 1.5 million 
ordinary shares or 300% of 
base salary based on the 
share price on the date of 
grant of an award. 
 
The maximum allocation 
for 2014 for Executives in 
the equivalent of ordinary 
shares is: 
 
A Bilton 1,341,000 
G Hirsch 1,341,000 
M Sinclair 1,141,000 
C Smith 756,000  
 
The grant price is 59.5p 
being the market value 
of shares on the date the 
Committee approved 
the Scheme.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan

Option Scheme 
introduced 
in 2009 to

Return
All employees of the Group were eligible 
to participate in the Plan. Options were 
granted by the Company’s Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”), the independent Trustees 
considering recommendations made by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
The EBT held 10 million ordinary shares to 
satisfy the terms of the plan and dividends 
rolled up over the vesting period.
The plan has no hold period.
Options available to the 
Executives under the 
plan were: 
 
A Bilton 810,811

Progressive numerical targets for operating cash flow 
after interest.  
 
This equates to the Group’s ability to pay a progressive, 
cash covered distribution. 
 
Operating cash flow after interest is defined as “Net cash 
generated from operating activities plus interest received less 
borrowing costs paid less dividends on preference shares”, all as 
defined in the audited cashflow statement of the Group.  
 
Borrowing costs are adjusted for any element capitalised as part 
of construction programmes and in 2014, the preference dividend 
deduction will be adjusted so no benefit is derived from the recent 
conversion to ordinary shares.
The operating cash flow after interest targets and percentage 
vesting for 2014 are:
50% $55m
75% $64m
100% $73m
These targets have been increased to compensate for the change 
in preference share coupon payable in 2014.
The Committee has 
discretion to reduce 
awards as a Group 
or for individuals if 
thought appropriate. 
 
This may occur 
if cash targets 
were met but Total 
Shareholder Returns 
dropped below 7.5% 
per annum or if an 
individual did not meet 
personal expectations 
in any year.
Award targets 
for 2014 will be 
increased to ensure 
no benefit is received 
from the reduced 
preference share 
coupon following 
the preference share 
conversion to ordinary 
shares.
Options granted vest in three equal tranches on 24 March 2012, 
24 March 2013 and 24 March 2014. 
 
Performance criteria for each tranche are based on meeting 
a total shareholder return of 7.5% over UK RPI in each of the 
following three year periods, with a starting share price of 25p: 
 
24 March 2009 to 24 March 2012; 
24 March 2010 to 24 March 2013; and 
24 March 2011 to 24 March 2014. 
 
Options vesting have an exercise price of 25p.
None None  
Clawback
Financial misstatement which resulted in overstatement of vesting of plans in previous years would result in clawback.
Performance Measures
The CBLTIS performance measure of operating cash inflow was chosen as the best approximation of cash available 
for distribution to shareholders. The targets over the period were set to match a progressive distribution policy with the 
maximum target a threefold increase in cash generated over the three year period of the scheme.
General Remuneration Policy
The main difference between the remuneration policy for Directors and employees is the payment of cash bonuses. 
Directors do not receive cash bonuses while general employees do. Senior Management is awarded a mixture of 
share based and cash bonus incentives based on the same performance measurements as the Directors. Discussion 
with Senior Management on on-going remuneration policy has focussed on the move from cash based incentives 
to share based. Other employees receive basic salary and cash bonuses. Basic salary increases for all employees 
including Directors, are linked to inflation. The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees when setting 
Directors’ Remuneration.
Potential Remuneration for Directors
The bar charts below show the potential remuneration which each Director could receive if performance was below 
target thresholds, if performance was in line with expectations and the maximum that could be received if expectations 
are exceeded. Share based remuneration is valued at the share price at the date of grant and does not take account of 
share price appreciation or accrued distributions.
The minimum amount of remuneration is the fixed element comprising basic salary, pension and benefits. On target 
remuneration assumes 75% vesting on the variable remuneration. The maximum remuneration assumes full vesting of 
the incentive schemes.

Recruitment and Exit Policies
Summary details of the Executive Directors’ and Non Executive Directors’ service contracts are given later in this report. 
Recruitment of new Directors would be based on the same terms as the existing service contracts. No additional 
remuneration would be offered as an incentive to join and the composition of remuneration would be based on the same 
components as existing Directors. 52 | 53

Exit policies for the elements of remuneration are summarised in the table below:
Component Good Leaver* Bad Leaver* Change of Control
Basic Salary and Benefits 12 months notice period No notice period or 
payment in lieu of notice.
150% of the normal notice 
provisions for basic salary.
Annual Bonus Pro rata payment

year’s award, payable 
at the discretion of the 
Committee
No award Pro rata payment based 
on the previous year’s 
award.
CBLTIS Awards not vested

circumstances**
Awards not vested

All subsisting awards vest
*Bad leaver provisions relate to termination of employment for the reason of gross misconduct including breach of 
obligation, bankruptcy and disqualification as a director. A good leaver covers all other circumstances.
**If a scheme participant ceases employment due to ill health or disability, redundancy as determined by the Committee 
or retirement, awards not vested shall continue in effect and vest on the original vesting dates if performance targets are 
met. The Committee has discretion to reduce awards with reference to the period of time that has elapsed from the date 
of grant to the date the participant ceases employment.
Shareholder Views
The view of shareholders is sought prior to any significant change to the Remuneration Policy. Prior to the introduction 
of the existing CBLTIS scheme, the views of shareholders holding over 60% of ordinary shares were taken into account 
prior to formal presentation at the AGM. It is intended that the same approach will be taken with the new scheme being 
developed.

1. Taxable Benefits include health cover and insurance, medicals and sports memberships. These are not performance 
related. They have been calculated based on premiums and subscriptions payable.
2. Pensions are cash payments made to Executive Directors, either directly or to their pension scheme.
3. LTIP share awards had a grant price of 23.5p with an exercise price of 25p so a value of 0p is used for valuation 
at grant. 
4. CBLTIS share price at grant was 59.5p.
5. Uplifts in valuation calculations have used the price of the shares at the end of the relevant financial period for the 
LTIP less any payment required to exercise the option, and at the end of the relevant financial period for the CBLTIS 
plus accumulated dividends or distributions in the relevant periods. The CBLTIS awards are shown in the year of the

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
All employees of the Group were eligible to receive invitations to participate in this plan and the EBT held 10 million 
ordinary shares reserved for the purpose. The options it granted over these shares vest in three equal tranches, 
subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 24 March 2013 and 24 March 2014. The scheme is closed to new 
participants and no further awards can be made.
Performance criteria for each tranche are based on meeting a target of total shareholder return of 7.5% over UK RPI in 
each of the following three year periods, with a starting share price of 25p:
 •
24 March 2009 to 24 March 2012;
 •
24 March 2010 to 24 March 2013; and
 •
24 March 2011 to 24 March 2014.
Dividends roll up during the vesting period and options granted under this scheme have an exercise price of 25p.
The second tranche of this scheme vested in full in 2013.
For the period 24 March 2010 to 24 March 2013, total shareholder return was 220% and the target total shareholder 
return for the period was 12.7%. Therefore the tranche available for 2013 vested.

Relative Spend on Pay (US$m)
The Chief Executive in consultation with the executive 
board agreed that the Non Executive Directors’ fees 
should be increased for the year ended 31 December 
2014. This is the first increase in remuneration since 
2011. Included in the increase is a fee of £2,000 for those 
Non Executive Directors who chair Board Committees, 
reflecting the additional time required. The fees will be 
fixed until 31 December 2016.
Unaudited Information
Relative Spend on Pay
The chart below shows the comparison between total 
executive remuneration, total Group remuneration, 
distributions to shareholders, both ordinary and 
preference and underlying profitability.
Underlying profitability before preference dividends 
shows the profit from operations after all remuneration 
and demonstrates how this profit has been distributed to 
preference and ordinary shareholders. These distributions 
are then compared to total pay and Directors’ pay.

The increase for all employees in the year, on a like for like basis, was 8%.
The information above illustrates the effectiveness of the focus on share based rewards. A high percentage of the CEO’s 
and other Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are share based and a significant percentage of the increase 
in packages relates to successful business performance and the resulting increase between grant price and vesting 
price of awards. The LTIP share price at grant was 23.5p and the vesting prices in 2012 and 2013 were 63p and 71p 
respectively. The share price at grant for the CBLTIS was 59.5p and at the year end was 80p.
The graph opposite reinforces the performance of the Group over the last five years, ordinary shares outperforming both 
the FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 350 indices. The table compares the trend in CEO’s remuneration package over the same 
period. As explained in the Business Model section of the Strategy Report, we struggle to find comparable property 
company indices given the geographical market we operate in. We have used the indices above as we were in both at 
some point during the last year. The outperformance compared to the indices reflects the total shareholder return over 
the five year period of 353%. 58 | 59

GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
Going Concern
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings are described in the Financial Review 
and the notes to the accompanying financial statements. In addition, in note 36 there is a description of the Group’s 
objectives and policies for managing its capital, financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit and 
liquidity risk.
During the year the Group continued to hold substantial cash and short term deposits. The property portfolio is running 
at high occupancy levels, with stable rental income streams and overhead base. Debt facilities have a weighted average 
time to maturity of 4.7 years at 31 December 2013.
The Board receive monthly updates on future cash flow projections and have regular working capital reports presented, 
in particular, as part of the half year and full year reporting process. A comprehensive independent working capital review 
was also undertaken as part of the preference share conversion transaction just prior to the year end. After making 
appropriate enquiries and examining sensitivities that could give rise to financial exposure, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of these financial statements.
Directors’ Responsibilities 
Guernsey company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 •
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 •
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 •
State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 •
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and IFRS as adopted by the EU. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware 
and each has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities below has been prepared in connection with the Company’s full Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The Board confirms to the best of its knowledge:
The financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
The strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
The Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 March 2014 and is signed on its behalf by:
Mark Sinclair Colin Smith 
Chief Financial Officer Chief Operating Officer  
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members 
of Raven Russia Limited
We have audited the financial statements of Raven Russia Limited for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise 
the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group 
Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 40. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies 
(Guernsey) Law, 2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 65, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
 •
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its loss for the year 
then ended; 
 •
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
 •
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy and scope: 
 •
misstatement of the fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction;
 •
the Group’s property investment and logistics businesses operate in a market with a comparatively high level of legal 
and political risk. The Group is subject to ongoing litigation in its Toros subsidiary; and
 •
revenue recognition.
Our application of materiality 
We determined materiality for the Group to be $3.2 million, which is approximately 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit. 
We adjusted pre-tax profits to exclude the revaluation of investment property and investment property under construction 
and the finance expense in relation to the preference share conversion. This provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and 
determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. 62 | 63
GOVERNANCE REPORT  2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement is that overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75% of planning materiality, 
namely $2.4 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $0.16 million, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group has operations in Russia, Cyprus, the United Kingdom and Guernsey. Our testing is performed on a 
consolidated basis using thresholds which are determined with reference to the Group performance materiality and the 
risks of material misstatement identified. All testing of significant balances is performed by the Group audit team.
Our response to the risks identified above was as follows:
 •
Misstatement of the fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction: We assessed the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of the external valuers. We challenged the assumptions made by the external 
valuers and the directors in performing their valuations. We tested the source data used in the valuations. We conducted 
analytical procedures by reference to external indices to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuations adopted by the 
Group and investigated further the valuations of those properties which were not in line with our expectations. 
 •
Legal and political risk: We identified the specific financial statement balances impacted by these risks on the basis of 
our knowledge of the Group, developments in Russia and discussions with management.
 •
With respect to the ongoing litigation in Toros, we obtained and reviewed the claims and litigation assessment 
prepared by the Group’s external legal advisor. We challenged the assumptions made by management in arriving at the 
provision recorded. 
 •
Revenue Recognition: We confirmed our understanding of the controls in place to prevent and detect fraud and errors 
in revenue recognition. We tested the controls in relation to rental and logistics income. We performed a detailed 
analytical review of rental and logistics income based upon quantitative expectations. We agreed the calculation of the 
IFRS rent adjustment to underlying lease and tenancy data. We performed cut-off procedures on all revenue streams.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Directors’ Report is: 
 •
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 •
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or 
 •
is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 •
proper accounting records have not been kept; or
 •
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
 •
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

Group Cash Flow Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
| 69 68
1. General information
Raven Russia Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) is a property investment group specialising in commercial real
estate in Russia.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey under the provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The Company’s
registered office is at 1 Le Truchot, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 6EH.
The audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised by the Board for issue on 9 March 2014.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, section 244, not to prepare company
financial statements as group financial statements have been prepared for both current and prior periods. The group financial statements are
presented in US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($’000) except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the group financial statements are set out below. The policies have been
consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of judgement or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
The allocation of creditors acquired with the acquisition of Pushkino were incorrectly allocated between operating activities and investing activities
in the 2012 Cash Flow Statement. The 2012 Cash Flow Statement has been restated. There was no impact on the Group’s Statement of
Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet or cash balance at 31 December 2012. The impact on the 2012 Cash Flow Statement was to increase
operating cash inflows by US$11,999k, increase investing cash outflows by US$10,551k and to decrease the effect of foreign exchange rate
changes on cash and cash equivalents by US$1,449k. There was no effect in 2013.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the
European Union (“IFRS”) and the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the Group has adopted the following new
and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2013:
New and amended standards
IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation - Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (adopted early - mandatory 1 January 2014)
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (adopted early - mandatory 1 January 2014)
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (adopted early - mandatory 1 January 2014)
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised)
Other than detailed below the adoption of the new or amended standards had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IAS 1 Presentation of Items in Other Comprehensive Income
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce the grouping of items presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Amounts disclosed as Other
Comprehensive Income that will be recycled to profit or loss in the future are presented separately from items that will not be recycled. In the case
of the Group all amounts disclosed as Other Comprehensive Income will be recycled in the future. The amendment affects the presentation of the
results and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
The application of IFRS 10 has not had an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group and, whilst the standard requires different
factors to be considered in the assessment of control, the resulting conclusions are unchanged from prior periods. The Group assessed its
control of subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles based on factors set out in the standard, including the Group’s power over the investees and
the Group’s exposure to variable returns.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
The application of IFRS 11 has changed the accounting treatment for the Group’s joint ventures. Previously the financial statements included the
Group’s proportionate share of these entities’ assets, liabilities, income and expenditure on a line by line basis. Following the adoption of IFRS 11
the Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method, whereby the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint ventures is
included as a single line item in the balance sheet called “Investment in joint ventures”. Similarly, the Group’s share of profit or loss of its joint
ventures is shown as a single line item on the face of the Income Statement as “Share of profits of joint ventures”. The change in accounting
policy has been applied retrospectively and the comparative financial information has been restated. The impact of the change on the 2012
financial information is set out below.

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The adoption of IFRS 13 in the period has not required the Group to change any of its accounting policies, however additional disclosures are
required and are presented in notes 11, 12, 13 and 37.
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments or revisions to existing standards, which may be relevant to the Group, have been
published that are mandatory for later accounting periods and which have not been adopted early. These are:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (effective 1 January 2015)
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements amended (effective 1 January 2014)
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities amended (effective 1 January 2014)
The Group has determined that the impact of these changes on its financial statements will not be material. The standards, amendments or
revisions are effective for annual periods beginning on or after the dates noted above.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and the special purpose vehicles
(“SPVs”) controlled by the Company, made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with or ownership of the investee entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
investee. 
The Group has acquired investment properties through the purchase of SPVs. In the opinion of the Directors, these transactions did not meet the
definition of a business combination as set out in IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. Accordingly the transactions have not been accounted for as
an acquisition of a business and instead the financial statements reflect the substance of the transactions, which is considered to be the
purchase of investment property and investment property under construction. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
| 71 70
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of entities acquired to bring the accounting policies into line with those used
by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued. For business
combinations after 1 January 2010, transaction costs associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is capitalised with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the Income Statement. Impairment tests on goodwill are
undertaken annually at the financial year end. Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the Income Statement.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Where the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the cost of the combination, the
resulting negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the
joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the activities
require unanimous consent of the contracting parties for strategic financial and operating decisions. 
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in a joint venture
is initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint
venture since the acquisition date. Any premium paid for an interest in a joint venture above the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is determined as goodwill. Goodwill relating to a joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the
investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of joint ventures is shown on the face of the Income Statement within Operating Profit and
represents the profit or loss after tax.
Revenue recognition
(a) Property investment
Rental income from operating leases is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental increases calculated with
reference to an underlying index and the resulting rental income (“contingent rents”) are recognised in income as they are determined.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such
a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to
continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the directors are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
Premiums received to terminate leases are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
(b) Roslogistics
Logistics revenue, excluding value added tax, is recognised as services are provided.
(c) Raven Mount
The sales of completed properties and land are recognised on legal completion.
Taxation
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel Islands, and is exempt from taxation. The Group is liable for Russian, UK and
Cypriot tax arising on the results of its Russian, UK and Cypriot operations.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
(a) Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit (or loss) as reported in the Income
Statement because it excludes items of income and expenditure that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based
on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income
Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
(c) Value added tax
Revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the amount of value added tax except:
Where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the
value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expenditure item as applicable; and
Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value added tax included.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables, as
appropriate, in the Balance Sheet.
Investment property and investment property under construction
Investment property comprises completed property and property under construction held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property comprises both freehold and leasehold land and buildings. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including
related transaction costs. After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value. The Directors assess the fair value of investment
property based on independent valuations carried out by their appointed property valuers or on independent valuations prepared for banking
purposes. The Group has appointed Jones Lang LaSalle as property valuers to prepare valuations on a semi-annual basis. Valuations are
undertaken in accordance with appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements contained in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 7th Edition (the “Red Book”). This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation. Gains or losses arising
from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. For the purposes of
these financial statements, in order to avoid double counting, the assessed fair value is reduced by the present value of any tenant incentives and
contracted rent uplifts that are spread over the lease term and increased by the carrying amount of any liability under a head lease that has been
recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction of investment property are included in the cost of the property from the date of
commencement of construction until construction is completed.
Leasing (as lessors)
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset are classified as operating
leases. All of the Group’s properties are leased under operating leases and are included in investment property in the balance sheet.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventory includes land and completed units that are available for sale.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending upon the purpose for which the asset was
acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see financial liabilities policy for out-of-the-money derivatives), which are carried at
fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Loans and receivables
These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. In the case of the
Group, loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, loans, security deposits, restricted cash and cash and short term
deposits.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue,
and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in
administrative expenses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment is recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any such
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and short term deposits include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
| 73 72
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity comprises
ordinary shares and listed warrants.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories listed below.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the
Income Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include interest bearing loans, trade payables (including rent deposits and retentions under construction contracts),
preference shares and other short-term monetary liabilities.Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recorded at
fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing loans and preference shares are initially recorded at fair value net of direct issue costs and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are charged to the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Income Statement net of any reimbursement.
Own shares held
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income
Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and
the consideration is recognised in retained earnings.
Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group rewards its key management and other senior employees by a variety of means many of which are settled by ordinary or preference
shares of the Company, these include the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012
to 2014.
Awards linked to or settled by ordinary shares
These are accounted for as equity-settled transactions in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The cost of equity-settled transactions
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. Fair value is determined by an external valuer, using an
appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance conditions (vesting
conditions), other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). Any other conditions, which
are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Like market
conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at grant date.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance
and service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense that is recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income
statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a
market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied,
provided that all other performance and service conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the
award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are
not met.
Awards linked to or settled by preference shares
These awards are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits whereby the Group estimates the cost of awards using the
projected unit credit method, which involves estimating the future value of the preference shares at the vesting date and the probability of the
awards vesting. The resulting expense is charged to the Income Statement over the performance period and the liability is remeasured at each
Balance Sheet date.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each Group entity are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). For the Company the directors consider this to be Sterling. The presentation currency
of the Group is United States Dollars, which the directors consider to be the key currency for the Group’s operations as a whole. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction or when their fair values are reassessed.
(c) On consolidation
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet;
(ii) income and expenditure for each Income Statement are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing in the period unless this
does not approximate the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case they are translated at the transaction date rates;
and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.
On consolidation, the exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in Other
Comprehensive Income. When a foreign entity is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the
gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s ordinary shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this is
when declared by the directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders at an AGM.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and judgements regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience as adjusted for current market conditions and other factors. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom
equal the related actual results. The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
Judgements other than estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies the following are considered to have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
(a) Acquisitions
Properties can be acquired through the corporate acquisition of a subsidiary company. At the time of acquisition, the Group considers
whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business. The Group accounts for the acquisition as a business combination where
an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property. More specifically, consideration is made of the extent to which
significant processes are acquired and the extent of ancillary services provided by the subsidiary.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities.
The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values, and no goodwill or deferred
tax is recognised.
(b) Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in
the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the
future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
(c) Acquisitions of investment property
The consideration payable in respect of each acquisition is dependent upon certain future events. In calculating the cost of each acquisition
the Group has assessed the most probable outcome as at the balance sheet date. These amounts are reconsidered annually at each year
end. The assessments include consideration of the future rental levels and costs of construction of a property as well as the terms of the
legal agreements governing each acquisition. Based on these factors management will consider whether a liability or a contingent liability
should be recognised or disclosed at the balance sheet date.
Estimates
(a) Valuation of investment property and investment property under construction
The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar lease and other contracts. In the absence of such
information, the Group determines the amount within a range of reasonable, fair value estimates. In making its judgement the Group
considers information from a variety of sources and engages external, professional advisers to carry out third party valuations of its
properties. The external valuations are completed in accordance with appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements contained
in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 7th Edition (the “Red Book”). This is an internationally
accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 13. In our market, where transactional activity is minimal, the
valuers are required to use a greater degree of estimation or judgement than in a market where comparable transactions are more readily
available.
The significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of investment property and investment property under
construction are set out in note 13. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA
| 75 74
(b) Income tax
As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Group is required to estimate the provision for income tax in each of the
jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves an estimation of the actual current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities, which are included in the Balance Sheet.
Russian tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which may occur frequently. The interpretation of legislation that
the Group applies to its transactions and activities may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. Additionally there
may be inconsistent interpretation of tax regulations by various authorities, creating uncertainties in the taxation environment in Russia.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities for the three calendar years preceding the years of review and in some
circumstances may cover a longer period. Additionally, there have been instances where tax regulations have taken effect retrospectively.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
(c) Provisions
The provision relating to the ongoing litigation in Toros (see note 25) requires the estimation of the likely outcome of the legal proceedings.
In making the estimate, management has taken account of advice received from its legal advisers.
4. Segmental information
The Group has three operating segments, which are managed and report independently to the Board of the Group. These comprise:
Property Investment - acquire, develop and lease commercial property in Russia
Roslogistics - provision of warehousing, transport, customs brokerage and related services in Russia
Raven Mount - sale of residential property in the UK
Financial information relating to Property Investment is provided to the Board on a property by property basis. The information provided is gross
rentals, operating costs, net operating income, revaluation gains and losses and where relevant the profit or loss on disposal of an investment
property. The individual properties have similar economic characteristics and are aggregated into a single reporting segment.
Information about Raven Mount provided to the Board comprises the gross sale proceeds, inventory cost of sales and gross profit, including the
share of profits or losses of its joint venture.
Roslogistics is an independently managed business and the Board is presented with turnover, cost of sales and operating profits or losses after
deduction of administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses and foreign currency gains or losses are reported to the Board by segment. Finance income and finance expense are
not reported to the Board on a segment basis. Sales between segments are eliminated prior to provision of financial information to the Board.
For the Balance Sheet, segmental information is provided in relation to investment property, inventory, cash balances and borrowings. Whilst
segment liabilities includes loans and borrowings, segment loss does not include the related finance costs. If such finance costs were included in
segment profit or loss, the profit from Property Investment would have decreased by US$63,114k (2012: US$58,446k). In 2012 the Raven Mount
segment loss would have increased by $20k. There is no corresponding cost for Raven Mount in 2013.

9. Earnings measures
In addition to reporting IFRS earnings the Group adopts the European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) earnings measure, as set out in
their Best Practice Policy Recommendations document issued in August 2011 and also reports its own underlying earnings measure.
EPRA earnings
The EPRA earnings measure excludes investment property revaluations and gains or losses on disposal of investment property, intangible asset
movements, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings consists of the EPRA earnings measure, with additional group adjustments. The Directors consider underlying earnings to be
a key performance measure, as this is the measure used by Management to assess the return on holding investment assets for the long term.
Adjustments include share-based payments and other long term incentives, the accretion of premiums payable on redemption of preference
shares, material non-recurring items, depreciation and amortisation of loan origination costs.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

the Company implemented a tender offer buy back of ordinary shares on the basis of 1 in every 40 shares at a tender price of 80 pence per
share, the equivalent of a dividend of 2 pence per share.

13. Investment property and investment property under construction - Valuation
It is the Group’s policy to carry investment property and investment property under construction at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair
Value Measurement” and IAS 40 “Investment Property”:
– Investment property consists of the completed, income producing, portfolio; and
– Investment property under construction consists of development projects and land bank.
The latter is subcategorised as:
– Assets under construction - current development projects and the value of land on additional phases of existing investment property; and
– Land bank - land held for potential development.
For the purposes of IFRS 13 disclosure, we have analysed these categories by the geographical market they are located in being Moscow,
St Petersburg and the Regions (the other Russian regional cities). These form distinct markets for valuation purposes as the fundamentals differ
in each.
The fair value of the Group’s investment property and assets under construction at 31 December 2013 has been arrived at on the basis of market
valuations carried out by Jones Lang Lasalle (“JLL”), external valuers to the Group. JLL have consented to the use of their name in these financial
statements.
The Group’s land bank in St Petersburg and the Regions is valued by the Directors.
Valuation process
The executive management team members responsible for property matters determine the valuation policies and procedures for property
valuations in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The Group has three qualified RICS members on the management team, one of whom is the Chairman of RICS in Russia and the CIS. All have
relevant valuation and market experience and are actively involved in the valuation process. They also regularly meet with agents and consultants
in the market to obtain additional information and an alternative perspective.
The effectiveness and independence of the external valuer is reviewed each year. The criteria considered include market knowledge, reputation,
independence and professional standards. The Audit Committee also meets the external valuer at least once a year. Executive management and
the Directors have determined that the external valuer is experienced in the Russian market and acts as an “External Valuer” as defined in the
“RICS Valuation - Professional Standards”.
The external valuers perform their valuations in accordance with the “RICS Valuation - Professional Standards”, the 2012 Edition (the “Red
Book”). This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with the principles of IFRS 13.
For investment properties and assets under construction, the executive team members consult with the external valuers and the valuers then
determine:
– whether a property’s fair value can be reliably determined;
– which valuation method should be applied for each asset; and
– the assumptions made for unobservable inputs that are used in valuation methods.
The land bank is valued by the Directors. The process followed includes regular site inspections, meetings with local real estate experts,
comparison to any local land sale information and comparison to transactions in other regional cities including those where the Group has stable
income producing assets. Updated acquisition appraisals and any indication of value for alternative use are also considered.
Valuations are prepared on a biannual basis. At each valuation date the executive team members review the information prepared by the property
department for valuation purposes being submitted to the external valuers. Each property valuation is then reviewed and discussed with the
external valuer in detail, adjustments made as necessary and results discussed with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The executive management also present the valuation results to the Audit Committee and hold discussions with the Group’s auditors. Both the
Audit Committee and the auditors also have discussions with the external valuers. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA

The fair value of investment property is determined using the income capitalisation method where a property’s fair value is estimated based on
the normalised net operating income of the asset divided by the capitalisation (discount) rate. Each income stream from every tenant is valued
based on capitalising the contracted rent for the term of the lease, including any fixed increases in rent but excluding any future indexation.
Allowance at lease end is made for any potential letting void and an assessment is made of the estimated rental value on re-letting (ERV). These
elements are determined based on current market conditions and values.
Assets under construction (development projects) are valued on a residual value basis using the future anticipated costs to complete
construction, a provision for letting costs, a letting void period and an assessment of ERV. Depending on the status of the development, and how
much of development process has been completed an allowance will also be made for developers profit.
Assets under construction (additional phases of existing sites) are valued on a comparable basis. The value of these plots is estimated based on
comparable transactions in the same market. This approach is based on the principle that a buyer will not pay more for an asset than it will cost
to buy a comparable substitute property. The unit of comparison applied is the price per square metre.
All of the above valuations are completed by JLL.
The land bank is valued by the Directors using the comparable basis.
Sensitivity analysis of significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the entity’s
portfolio of investment property are:
– ERV;
– Void period on re-letting;
– Initial yield; and
– Specific to property under development: construction costs, letting void, construction period and development profit.
Significant increases (or decreases) in the ERV (per sqm p.a.) would result in a significantly higher (or lower) fair value measurement. Significant
increases (or decreases) in the long-term void period on re-letting and initial yield in isolation would result in a significantly lower (or higher) fair
value measurement.

The interest rates shown above are the weighted average cost, including US LIBOR, as at the Balance Sheet dates.
During the year there were the following changes to the Group’s financing arrangements:
The Group repaid its facility with Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG and entered into a new facility of US$100 million from Sberbank secured on the
Krekshino project. The facility, which was fully drawn in the year, is for a seven year term and has a margin of 6.9% over US LIBOR.
The Group also refinanced the IFC facility secured on the Rostov project, drawing down US$61 million from a facility provided by VTB. The facility
was fully drawn, for a five year term and has a fixed interest rate to the Group of 7.7%.
US$20million was drawn from a US$33 million facility from ZAO Raiffieisen Bank (RZB) secured on the third phase of the Klimovsk project. The
facility has a margin of 7.25% over US LIBOR and a ten year term. The undrawn portion of this facility is available until 29 May 2014. The Group
drew down the final $3.5 million of the RZB facility secured on the second phase of Klimovsk.
The Group also agreed an increase of US$9.7 million to the RZB facility secured on the Sholokhovo project, which was fully drawn in the year.
Finally the Group agreed an increase of US$23 million to the facility provided by Unicredit for the Noginsk project. The additional facility was fully
drawn in January 2014.
At 31 December 2013 the Group had undrawn loan facilities available of US$36 million (2012: US$3.5 million).
The Group has entered into hedging arrangements in respect of its exposure to floating interest rates (note 20). US$305 million (2012:
US$422 million) of Group bank borrowings have been fixed with three years remaining (2012: three years) at a weighted average swap rate of
1.43% (2012: 1.86%) and US$381 million (2012: US$225 million) capped at 1.33% (2012: 1.93%) for four years (2012: three years). This gave a
weighted average cost of debt to the Group of 7.2% (2012: 7.3%) at the year end. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | RAVEN RUSSIA

The preference shares entitle the holders to a cumulative annual dividend of 12 pence per share.
Preference shares repurchased are transactions where the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts have subscribed for or purchased preference
shares and preference shares reissued are where those shares are subsequently transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of the
CBLTIS (see note 33b).
On 31 December 2013 the Company converted 97,416,231 preference shares into 194,832,462 ordinary shares in accordance with the terms of
the preference share conversion offer made to preference shareholders on 27 November 2013. The difference between the carrying value of the
preference shares converted and the fair value of the ordinary shares created resulted in a charge of US$86 million to the Income Statement. The
Company’s Employee Benefit Trust participated in the conversion and converted 56,709 preference shares.
On 26 June 2012 the Company issued and admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange 48,414,250 new preference shares under
the terms of a placing and open offer. The new preference shares were issued at a price of 134 pence per share and rank pari passu with the
other preference shares in issue. The trustees of one of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts sold £5 million (US$8 million) of ordinary shares
(see note 30) so that the Employee Benefit Trust could acquire £5 million of new preference shares as part of the placing. The trustees will use
these preference shares to satisfy in part awards made under the CBLTIS, details of which are set out in note 33.
25. Provisions
Provisions reflect the ongoing litigation in CJSC Toros (“Toros”), the subsidiary company that owns the Pushkino project.
In December 2010, prior to the Group’s acquisition of Pushkino, a supplier to Toros filed a claim against Toros in the Moscow Region Arbitration
Court, concerning alleged non payment of rent in respect of the supply of electricity generating equipment. The amount claimed was 827.4 million
Roubles plus interest at the prevailing Russian Central Bank financing rate. The Arbitration Court ruled in favour of the supplier on 31 May 2011 and
ordered Toros to pay the claim. Toros filed an appeal of the judgement in July 2011 and continued to appeal through the various levels of the
Russian court system. On 18 December 2012, the claim was referred back to the Arbitration Court by the Cassation Court, recommencing the
entire appeal process, subject to the direction of the Cassation Court. Various hearings have been held during 2013 and 2014 and the claim
currently being assessed by the Arbitration Court is for 1,141.7 million Roubles (US$34.9 million) plus interest, which Toros is vigorously defending.
At the time of the acquisition the vendor of Toros, PLP Holding GmbH (“PLP”), agreed to indemnify Padastro Holdings Ltd (“Padastro”), the
acquiring entity and the new holding company of Toros, in respect of this litigation. The indemnity was secured by a cash retention and PLP
retained conduct of the claim on behalf of Toros in return. On 12 October 2013, PLP agreed with Padastro and Toros to release the retention in
return for which Padastro released its claim under the indemnity. Toros now has conduct of the litigation and under the terms of the agreement to
release the indemnity, the majority of the retention monies received are restricted until the litigation has been resolved. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
The increase in the provision in the year results from an updated assessment of the amount required to resolve the matter. It is not possible to
determine how quickly the matter will be resolved.

33. Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group utilises a number of different Share Schemes to reward and incentivise the Group’s executives and senior staff. The Share Schemes
operated in the year are as follows:
Executive Share Option Schemes (“ESOS”)
The Group operates two ESOS, the Employee Retention Scheme (“ERS”) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Both schemes involved the
grant of options over the Company’s ordinary shares by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts. The ERS vested in full on the publication of the
audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the ERS options do not have an exercise price. The LTIP
options vest in three equal tranches, subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 2013 and 2014. The LTIP options have an exercise price
of 25p per option and the first and second tranche vested in full. The performance criteria for each tranche are based on meeting a target of total
shareholder return of 7.5% over UK RPI. Both the ERS and LTIP schemes are closed and further awards cannot be made under either scheme.
Awards made under the ERS and LTIP have been accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012 to 2014 (“CBLTIS”)
During 2012 the Group implemented the CBLTIS and contingent awards were made in respect of 14.3 million ordinary shares and 3.7 million
preference shares and which cover the calendar years 2012 to 2014. The awards are subject to performance criteria linked to operating cash
income. Awards in respect of ordinary shares are accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Awards to be settled by preference shares do not meet the criteria under IFRS for a Share-based payment and are instead accounted for in
accordance with IAS 19 - Employee Benefits.
During the year the Company made a discretionary bonus award of 121,429 ordinary shares to certain senior managers below Board level. In
2012 the Company made an award of 4.2 million ordinary shares to satisfy bonuses to the Executive Directors and senior management. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued

36. Financial instruments – risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks in relation to the financial instruments it uses: market risk (including currency risk,
price risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The financial risks relate to the following financial instruments: trade
receivables, cash and short term deposits, trade and other payables, borrowings, preference shares and derivative financial instruments.
Risk management parameters are established by the Board on a project by project basis and overseen by management in conjunction with
professional advisers. Reports are provided to the Board formally on a weekly basis and also when authorised changes are required.
(a) Market risk 
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from a variety of currency exposures, primarily with
respect to US Dollars, Sterling and Russian Rouble. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions (including
construction contracts and lease receivables), recognised monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign entities.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated in US Dollars, which is also the reporting currency for the Group. The functional
currency of the Company is Sterling, however the functional currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries vary. The analysis that follows
considers the impact of Russian Rouble and Sterling on the Group.
Russian Rouble
Whilst the Group has some Rouble denominated overhead and maintains modest levels of Rouble cash balances to fund the working
capital requirements of the investment property portfolio in Russia, it is during a period of substantial construction activity that the Group
can become exposed to significant Rouble currency risk. This is because construction contracts have tended to be denominated in
Roubles. The Group is not currently in a period of substantial construction but when this has been the case the Group has taken out non
deliverable forwards to hedge against the US Dollar/Rouble cash flow exposure. The other principal area where the Rouble can affect the
Group is the accounting adjustments that are required when consolidating the results of some of the property owning subsidiaries that
have a Rouble functional currency. Exchange gains or losses arising as a result of these consolidation accounting adjustments are included
in the translation reserve.
Sterling 
The Group’s exposure to Sterling is primarily driven by the Sterling denominated preference shares and the related quarterly preference
dividends, but also head office costs and ordinary dividends. Whilst there are no Sterling foreign exchange gains and losses arising in the
parent company itself, in preparing the group financial statements these Sterling amounts are translated to the Group’s US Dollar
presentation currency and the resulting exchange gains and losses are included in the translation reserve. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued

The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is
unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in
foreign currency exchange rates. The Group principally manages foreign currency risk on a project by project basis. The sensitivity analysis
prepared by management of foreign currency risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the impact on consolidation if the US Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% against the Russian Rouble or
Sterling, with all other variables in each case remaining constant, then:

Sterling 6,719 3,230

The majority of Sterling sensitivity relates to the retranslation of the value of irredeemable preference shares.
Accounting standards also require disclosure of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different from the
functional currency of the specific subsidiary or entity in the Group. These are set out in the tables below.

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings (note 23), which include preference shares issued (note 24). Borrowings
issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whilst borrowings issued at a fixed rate expose the Group to fair
value risk. The Group’s cash flow and fair value risk is reviewed monthly by the Board. The cash flow and fair value risk is approved
monthly by the Board.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. It takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels
of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows. Interest costs may increase as a result of such changes. They may reduce
or create losses in the event that unexpected movements arise. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing,
renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Based on these scenarios the Group calculates the impact on profit and
loss of a defined interest rate shift. The simulation is run on an on-going basis to verify that the maximum potential impact is within the
parameters expected by management. Formal reporting to the Board on cash flows is made on a monthly basis.
To date the Group has sought to fix its exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings through the use of a variety of interest rate derivatives
and the issue of preference shares at a fixed coupon. This gives certainty over future cash flow but exposure to fair value movements,
which amounted to an accumulated unrealised loss of US$7.3 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: loss of US$13.7 million). Notes to the Financial Statements – continued
Sensitivity analysis on the Group’s interest rate borrowings, net of interest bearing deposits, indicate that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates
would decrease the profit for the year and net assets by US$1.6 million (2012: US$600,000). If LIBOR rates were to drop to zero then
there would be a decrease in the profit for the year and in net assets of US$1.7 million (2012: US$1.9 million) as the loss on income from
cash would be greater than gains on interest expense because of the low LIBOR rates prevailing at this time and the interest rate hedges
in place.
(b) Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk associated with the Group’s trade and other receivables is considered low due to the Group having policies in place to ensure
that rental contracts are made with tenants meeting appropriate Balance Sheet covenants, supplemented by rental deposits or bank
guarantees from international banks. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An
allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the terms of the receivables concerned. Details of the movements in provision for impairment of trade receivables is provided in the table
below.

At 31 December 2013 there were no significant amounts of trade receivables that were past due for collection (2012: US$ nil).
The Group has VAT recoverable of US$17 million (2012: US$14 million). The timing of recovery of these balances is subject to future
revenue receipts and application to the Russian Courts. The Group forecasts the recovery of these balances based upon the timing of
future revenue receipts and its experience of successful application to the Russian Courts. No balances are considered past due or
impaired at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$ nil) based upon this assessment of the timing of future cash receipts. The Group believes its
only exposure is in relation to the timing of recovery. 
The credit risk of the Group’s cash and short term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited to the Group’s policy of
monitoring counterparty exposures.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed
credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Board and its advisers seek to have appropriate credit facilities in place on
a project by project basis, either from available cash resources or from bank facilities.
Management monitor the Group’s liquidity position on a daily basis. Formal liquidity reports are issued from all jurisdictions on a weekly
basis and are reviewed monthly by the Board, along with cash flow forecasts. A summary table with maturity of financial liabilities is
presented below.
All amounts shown are gross undiscounted cash flows.

Details of the interest rates applicable to the Group’s long term borrowings and preference shares are given in notes 23 and 24. The Group
is subject to interest costs in perpetuity in respect of preference shares, which have no contractual maturity date. The table above does
not show cash flows beyond 10 years.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by forecasting cash flow requirements for future years. The Group’s objective is to
maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and other short term borrowing facilities,
bank loans and equity fund raisings.

The fair values of loans receivable and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing
interest rates. The fair value of short term deposits, other assets, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables is assumed to
approximate to their book values. The fair value of preference shares is assumed to be their last quoted price. The fair value of derivatives
is determined by a model with market based inputs.
(d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern to provide returns to
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
For capital risk management, the Directors consider both the ordinary and preference shares to be permanent capital of the Company,
with similar rights as to cancellation.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, undertake tender offers,
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors
capital on the basis of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities
but excluding provisions, head lease obligations and preference shares, which for capital risk management is considered to be capital
rather than debt, less cash and short term deposits. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the balance sheet, plus preference
shares and net debt. Where the Group has a net cash position, the gearing ratio will be zero. Notes to the Financial Statements – continued

* Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: 
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the balance sheet date.
Level 2 – Use of a model with inputs that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 – Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The Group’s foreign currency derivative financial instruments are call options and are measured based on spot exchange rates, the yield curves of
the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The Group’s interest rate derivative financial
instruments comprise swap contracts and interest rate caps. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model and where not
cash collateralised consideration is given to the Group’s own credit risk.
There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year or the prior year.

39. Operating lease arrangements
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases. At the Balance Sheet date
the Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments:
2013 2012
US$’000 US$’000
Within one year 171,396 153,873

779,495 836,077
40. Acquisitions
The Group made three acquisitions in the prior year, Pushkino Logistics Park, Sholokhovo and land at Padikovo. In each case the Group
purchased each of the properties by acquiring all of the issued share capital of the corporate vehicles that owned the properties. In accordance
with its accounting policy the Group considered each acquisition in turn, assessing whether an integrated set of activities had been acquired in
addition to the property. In each case it was concluded a business had not been purchased but rather the acquisition of a group of assets and
related liabilities.
Analyses of the considerations payable for the properties and incidental assets and liabilities are provided below:

The consideration payable for Pushkino is provisional subject to the conclusion of the litigation described in note 25 and was partially funded by
a US$129 million debt facility (see note 23), with the remainder funded out of the net proceeds of the placing and open offer of new preference
shares (see note 24). The considerations payable for Sholokhovo and Padikovo were funded out of the Group’s existing cash resources and are
final.

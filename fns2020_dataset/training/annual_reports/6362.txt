The key performance indicators for G4S operational management are organic growth, PBITA margin
and cash conversion (operating cash flow as a % of PBITA). Other non-financial measures are specific
to particular markets or individuals and cannot therefore be amalgamated into group-wide key
performance indicators.

Financial PerformanceThe group has performed well in 2008,
with revenue increased substantially and margin maintained.
Profit before interest, taxation, amortisation and exceptional
items increased by 23%* to £416.4m, whilst turnover was up
22%* to £5,942.9m. Organic growth has increased to 9.5%
and group profit margin is 7%. Adjusted earnings per share
increased by 26% to 16.7p.
* To show a fair comparison, constant exchange rates are assumed
Developments During the year we have taken a number of
strategically important steps. We have made some significant
acquisitions, including GSL,ArmorGroup,T ouchcom, MJM
Investigations, RONCO Consulting and the Rock Steady
Group. As a result we have been able to develop the breadth
of our offering and move a greater proportion of our business
into longer term and higher value services. We have also
finalised the disposal of our French and German security
services businesses. In May we issued 127m new shares, placing
them with institutional investors and generating net proceeds
of £276m as a means of maintaining sound financial ratios and
helping to fund strategic acquisitions.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 7
G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 3.68p or DKK 0.3052 per share, payable on 5 June 2009,
which, with the interim dividend of 2.75p or DKK 0.2572 per share paid on 31 October 2008, makes a total
dividend of 6.43p or DKK 0.5624 per share for the year ended 31 December 2008. This is an increase of 30%
over the total dividend for 2007 and the culmination of the board’s stated aim to reduce the company’s target
divided cover to two and a half times normalised earnings. For the future, the board expects to increase dividend
broadly in line with normalised earnings.
The Board I am pleased to be able to report that the board continues to perform well. I can say this with some
degree of certainty as we engaged consultants who undertook a very thorough review of the performance of
the board as a whole, its members and of each of its committees. My own experience of working with this
board endorses the conclusions of the reports we have received. The board maintains an excellent blend of
experience and skills. We are not complacent however and realise the huge importance of rigorous standards
where corporate governance is concerned. We will therefore continue to monitor the way the board functions
and to place great emphasis on the controls in operation throughout the group.
Sir Malcolm Williamson retired from our board in May of course and we have announced that, following this year’s
AGM,Thorleif Krarup will stand down as chairman of the Audit Committee, with Mark Seligman taking his place.
Our Staff I mentioned that we are living in uncertain times. This presents our group with many opportunities,
but it also results in many of our employees (now totalling in excess of 585,000 around the world) carrying out
their work in what can sometimes be the most difficult of circumstances. This was brought home to us very hard
by the deaths of two of our colleagues during the terrorist attacks on the hotel in Mumbai where they were
providing services. I would therefore like to pay tribute not only to them, but also to all our employees who face
danger and sometimes risk injury because of the violent world in which we exist.
We have also seen that our employees can have a positive impact on those around them – and not just as a
result of the services the group provides. In our Corporate Responsibility Report you will see just a few
examples of the tremendous efforts being made by some of our staff and the effects they are having on the
environment in which they live.
The importance to our group of its employees cannot be overstated. It is because we recognise our staff as the
group’s greatest asset that we have forged an alliance with UNI, the global trades union organisation, by entering
into an Ethical Employment Partnership – and by reaching a recognition agreement with the SEIU in the United
States. We are determined to do all we can to raise standards for our employees and, we hope, for all who work
in our industry.
The Future The economic future is especially difficult to predict. So many businesses seem to be suffering in the
current economic climate and it would be foolish to assume that we can be completely immune from the effects
of what appears to be a global slow-down. I believe however that the nature of our businesses, our broad
geographic spread and our strategy of developing closer, longer-term, more valued relationships with our customers
will stand us in good stead for the future. I believe the group is well placed to meet the challenges ahead.

An interview with Nick Buckles
CEO REVIEW
Q: How would you summarise the performance of the group in 2008?
A: We had a very strong year in 2008 with organic turnover growth of 9.5%, operating
profits up 23%, profit margins maintained at 7% and earnings per share increasing by
26% to 16.7 pence. Those results were driven by good performances across all of our
geographic regions, service lines and customer segments.
On top of that, we made significant progress on implementing the group strategy and
integrated some fairly substantial acquisitions on schedule and in line with the
expected costs.
I’m really proud of our achievements last year and the fact that the strong
performance was widespread – across the whole company – is a credit to everyone
who is part of G4S.
Q: What were the most important strategic issues that required the focus of the
senior management during that time?
A: In order to make sure that the group is able to deliver the growth strategy and to
facilitate succession planning, we had to implement some structural, organisational
changes. These will enable us to focus on key customer segments and share best
practice across the group.
Whilst in our business model, the structure is based primarily on country-level
accountability, we had to overlay customer segment and service line expertise to
make sure that we are in the right shape to achieve our goals in the future. In order
to do that we needed to make sure that the relevant group values, such as teamwork
and collaboration, were fully embedded in the organisation for this matrix-style
structure to be successful.
Embedding the values, creating the right structure and making sure we had the right
expertise in the right places, was a challenge, but we know it will benefit the
organisation in the long run and it was worth taking the time to get it right.
Q: Which parts of the business were the star-performers in 2008?
A: One of the key aspects of our strategy in 2008 was to acquire capability-building
businesses across the group. Seeking the right businesses, completing the deals and
integrating the different organisations (culturally and operationally) without negatively
impacting the business performance was a key achievement in a number of markets
and, in my opinion, is now a core strength of the group.
The integration of GSL was primarily in the UK, but also in Australia and South Africa.
The acquired ArmorGroup operations spanned around 20 of G4S’s existing markets
and also enabled the group to enter four new countries. There were various
acquisitions across the African continent which required complex integration
management and a number of smaller deals across Europe.
Operationally, I would say that Romania was a star performer last year – the business
took on an enormous contract start-up in the cash management market, growing
from zero to more than 650 operational vehicles in just two years. Mobilising a
contract of that size successfully is a great achievement.
OPERATING & FINANCIAL REVIEW 9
G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The cash solutions businesses as a whole deserve a mention – driving superior margins unrivalled in the
industry whilst delivering strategic and operational benefits for our cash management customers. Cash
management is a core area of expertise within the group and we are proud of our achievements.
At the same time our US business has really embraced the group strategy and is now more closely aligned
to the G4S culture, brand and ideals. After years of success as a quality manned security organisation, G4S
Wackenhut has recently won substantial contracts based on the use of newly developed integrated
manpower and technology solutions – significantly transforming the product offer in the US.
So overall, we have a lot to be proud of.
Q: Which parts of the business didn’t perform to your expectations in 2008?
A: I wouldn’t say that any businesses didn’t perform to our expectations, but there are a still a handful of
countries which are failing to meet our minimum margin targets. They continue to implement business
improvement action plans and we are confident that they will soon be brought in line.
Q: What impact has the economic downturn had on the performance of the group in 2008?
A: G4S is not immune from an economic downturn, but it tends not to have a huge impact on our business.
We are resilient to economic pressure for a number of reasons.
A large proportion of our business is in complex, long term outsourcing contracts (many in the government
sector) which are unlikely to be those that come under pressure during difficult periods of the economic
cycle. Particularly those contracts in areas such as the justice sector, border control or military support
services are not likely to face cuts in times of economic uncertainty. In fact, outsourcing tends to increase in
times of difficulty as customers seek greater efficiencies and look for ways to reduce costs.
Consumers turn to cash in tough times. It allows them to budget more effectively and avoid unnecessary
interest charges which they would pay on a credit card. We do our very best to make sure this demand is
catered for efficiently and that the public can get access to their cash where and when they need it – this
means that cash needs to move around an economy as efficiently as possible and ATM cash needs to be
managed appropriately to cater for the changes in demand.
Generally, our broad geographic exposure provides some protection from economic pressure with no over-
reliance on a single country or economy. In some countries, where we compete with local competitors
which are going out of business as a result of the current state of the economy, we are in a position to pick
up additional contracts as customers require confidence in the long-term sustainability of the service and
that their security partner can deliver.
Of course, we constantly keep our own cost base and the efficiency of the operation under review. As a
service business, a large proportion of our investment is in people – in times of economic difficulty it does
become easier to recruit good quality people and to retain existing employees for longer.
Overall, I would say that whilst there are challenges for us in recessionary times, our business model,
international presence and contract base means that we are more resilient that most.
Q: How are you expecting the current economic situation to affect the business in the next two years?
A: Of course, we can’t predict how the global economy will turn out – the likely length and depth of the
recession is a major point of debate and views differ greatly.
However, for all of the reasons I have already described, I think that we will be able to ride the storm more
positively than most.
We will focus on building customer relationships and increasing customer partnerships and we are
monitoring and managing our debtor base very carefully to make sure that we deal with any issues that arise
before they can impact the business.
Q: What was the best decision you made in 2008?
A: The GSL and ArmorGroup acquisitions are probably the highlights – they have helped to transform the
organisation in so many ways and add capability and expertise in areas which will really help us develop and
drive growth in the future. 10
Operating & Financial Review (continued)
Q: What would you have done differently in 2008 with hindsight?
A: There are always ways to improve the business performance, but I can’t really say that there are any major
things that we should have done differently. We had a good year and moved forward enormously in terms
of building capability and confidence for the future.
Q: What drives growth in your business?
A: The growth drivers differ across our two main service lines.
In cash solutions, the primary driver of growth is the maturity of the cash cycle and the role of the central
bank. In the most mature markets, the central banks have given responsibility for managing the cash cycle to
the commercial banks which, in turn, pass that responsibility onto cash solutions providers such as G4S. In
these markets outsourcing of almost the entire cycle is common and provides a way for the banks to focus
on their core business and for G4S to apply its expertise to the management of the flow of cash around the
economy. We can take responsibility for the entire cycle including cash management, cash forecasting,ATM
network management and so on. Our challenge is to encourage less developed markets to move through
these phases of development to a fully-outsourced model.
The structure of the market is also a key growth driver. In less developed cash markets, the central banks
and commercial banks retain a high number of cash processing locations which means the market can be
very fragmented with hundreds and sometimes thousands of cash-in-transit providers. In cash management,
economies of scale and density of customers are key to providing the most efficient service and to
facilitating the outsourcing of non-essential banking services by the banks.
G4S expertise and competitive differentiation in the cash management sector also helps us to grow. Within
the group, we have some of the world’s most experienced cash management experts with strong track
records. We have developed our expertise in this area over a number of years and can demonstrate true
benefits to customers looking to outsource their cash management processes whilst needing to feel secure
in the knowledge that their business is in safe hands.
Underlying all of those major issues is the consumer demand for cashThe demise of cash has been
predicted for over 25 years and yet it is still very popular with consumers – it is free at the point of use,
it is anonymous and it provides the best means of managing a budget, particularly in tough economic
environments. Consumers also want access to their cash 24 hours a day, which drives the need for ATM
networks to be delivering that convenience to consumers across the world.
In secure solutions the key driver is the propensity for government and commercial customers to
outsource to the private sector. There are many reasons why this might take place – in the government
sector, resources such as the military and police are constantly under pressure to focus on their core role
and to outsource any aspects of their operation which are not delivering front line benefits. The private
sector has shown that it can be successful in delivering a quality service in these areas and provide cost-
savings at the same time.
In the non-government sector, the focus is largely on reducing risk and driving quality whilst managing cost
so the organisation can focus on its core business – for example, retailers need to focus on selling goods,
airlines have to move passengers around the world efficiently and sporting venues need to maximise the
experience for their paying audience. Managing the risk aspects of these sectors is the core business and
expertise of organisations such as G4S.
We focus very hard on increasing customer partnerships across our business and demonstrating the
expertise and value that G4S can bring to a customer. This means that we become an integral part of their
business and a significant contributor to their business success. 11
G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Underlying this, there is always the issue of crime and risk. Whilst it is difficult to quantify how increases in
crime and risk directly impact security spend, what is apparent is that it is usually accompanied by an
increased focus on the associated business issues. Risk management is increasingly a topic for board level
discussion and decisions are taken at a higher level within our customer organisations than they would have
been ten or maybe even just five years ago. It’s important to us to build relationships at this level.
Across all service lines we continue to acquire businesses which contribute to growth. We made a large
number of acquisitions in 2008 – some to add scale to the group, but the majority to provide additional
capability and expertise to drive outsourcing opportunities. In the future, capability-building acquisitions will
continue to be a focus for the group although we will also consider acquisitions which give us access to a
particular geography or a market sector which we don’t already have.
Q: What are the biggest risks to that growth being achieved in 2009?
A: No company can ignore the state of the global economy right now. We believe that we have the ability to
ride the economic storm and should be well-placed to drive superior growth once global economies get
back on track, but with so much uncertainty around, we can’t be complacent about it.
Q: What will be the biggest challenge to the group in 2009?
A: The biggest challenge will be keeping everyone motivated, positive and driving forward in a year of
economic stress.
We have a great business and really good people who have delivered good results time after time. We need
to make sure that we have got the right culture across the organisation and that everyone believes in, and
lives up to the group values. We can’t be everywhere supervising everything and we need to trust our
people to do what they do best – take the group strategy and culture and make it work for them in their
local market.
Q: How is the shape of the business likely to change or develop in the future?
A: We are committed to the multi-service model – it works well for us, particularly in new markets where
customer relationships are developed across multiple service lines.
Our unique geographic footprint isn’t likely to change fundamentally although we would always consider
acquisitions which give us access to markets or sectors where we don’t currently have a presence. We will
certainly seek acquisitions which bring additional expertise or capability to the group.
We will focus on developing customer partnerships across the board and in key sectors. We would expect
our government business to continue to become a larger proportion of group revenues over time.
Q: How would you summarise the mid-term outlook for the business?
A: We achieved very strong results in 2008 and made significant progress in implementing the group strategy,
supplemented by some key capability-building acquisitions.
Against the backdrop of economic uncertainty in 2009, we continue to focus on building customer
relationships, retaining and growing existing business, winning new business, improving productivity,
controlling costs and differentiating G4S with new service lines.
So, whilst there are some challenges for our business in recessionary times, we do expect to perform
strongly in the year ahead.

Bloemfontein, South Africa CASE STUDY – MANGAUNG CORRECTIONAL CENTRE
THE FIRST PRIVATE SOUTH AFRICAN PRISON
“Mangaung is something for G4S
to be very proud of.”
Visitors to community projects in Bloemfontein, South Africa may not know it, but the soup they receive each day starts
its life in the gardens of a G4S-operated facility. It’s one example of how a commitment to care, innovation and integrity is
contributing to the success of the Mangaung Correctional Centre in Bloemfontein, which was one of the contracts G4S
acquired as part of the GSL acquisition.
Empowering prisoners and the provision of care are driven by the quality of relationships between staff and residents.
G4S staff on-site act as role-models which creates a very special atmosphere within the facility.
Donating garden produce to local charities is just one example. The centre is rightly proud of its Liberty programme of
adult learning – a scheme that is now recognised as a benchmark in South African prisons. In a recent study no fewer that
87 best practices at Manguang across recreation, education, rehabilitation and training were identified.
“Treating people with dignity and respect is key,” continues FrikkieVenter, G4S Managing Director of Mangaung Correctional
Centre in Bloemfontein.“I’m proud of what has been achieved here. By supporting prisoners, we improve their future
prospects and lessen the chances of them re-offending. That is good news for them, for G4S and for South Africa.”

 ORGANIC GROWTH IN
NORTH AMERICA WAS 3.6%
with margins of 5.8%.
In Continental Europe, organic growth was 8.6% and margins were slightly below the prior year at 5.4% due mainly
to a challenging environment in aviation security as a result of lower passenger numbers, the start up of the Oslo
airport contract and lower installation growth in the smaller security systems businesses. Cost reduction measures
are being implemented in these markets. Security systems is a relatively small part of the G4S portfolio and contracts
are concentrated in Continental Europe. Overall contract retention in the region was high at over 95% with key
contracts such as those for the European Parliament (Belgium and Luxembourg) and Schiphol airport being renewed
in 2008.
Lithuania and Luxembourg had a strong year in all customer segments and Austria delivered good results assisted by
completion of some systems projects, the Euro 2008 football championships and other major events. In Greece, the
business won four new regional airports contracts and the Athens Metro contract in 2008, which contributed to
excellent growth and helped improve margins.
In Romania, the business achieved excellent growth and margins, largely as a result of the outsourcing of a wide range
of security-related services by the Romanian post office and the critical mass that this has created across the country.
In the Baltics, growth slowed but margins were robust.
Norway achieved excellent organic growth of over 40% assisted by the Oslo airport contract which began early in
the year. Finland had a good year and in Sweden, the business is now trading profitably under the new management
team and following some good contract wins in 2007. There was good growth and solid margins in Denmark, aided
by security systems growth across all segments and strong growth in manned security.

Operating & Financial Review (continued)
Organic growth in North America was 3.6% and, excluding the US commercial nuclear
sector which lost a large contract, organic growth was 7.0%. Margins were slightly lower at
5.8% as expected due to start up costs on some new contracts and contract renewals.
In the United States the commercial business was broadly flat. However excluding the
commercial nuclear business, organic growth was 5%. The government business achieved
organic growth of 11%, with the immigration and border control contract performing
strongly.
New contract awards included those for the Department of Energy at its Hanford Site
and commercial nuclear power sites for companies such as FPL and an international
contract with Agilent. Contract renewals and extensions included Chrysler and Bank
of America.
In Canada there was good organic growth and margins improved as a result of a
programme to exit low yielding contracts and focus on higher margin businesses.
In New Markets, organic growth was excellent at 16.1% and margins were maintained at
around 8%.
Organic growth in Asia was 15.6% and margins were 7.9%. Margins in Asia were slightly
down due to the lower margin Australian prison contracts which were acquired with GSL.
India continued to deliver excellent growth of over 20% and strong margin improvement.
Thailand also performed well with organic growth of over 20% with improved margins
and won a major contract with SCB at the end of 2008. In Malaysia, organic growth was
10% due to improved operational performance and a significant increase in the number
of ATMs and CDMs serviced.
In Hong Kong, the business grew slightly despite a challenging competitive environment
and margins were maintained. In Macau, growth slowed but was still above 15% and
margins remained strong. The Papua New Guinea business performed very well in its first
year of operation.

FOR A MULTI-USE ARENA.
“Malmo is a multi-use, multi-purpose, multi-visitor venue.”
The Malmo Arena launch was the culmination of one-and-a-half years of construction and preparation. It was clear early
on that Malmo’s requirements were not standard.
“Malmo Arena is multi-use because it hosts everything from major sports events to concerts. Multi-purpose because
Malmo sits in the middle of a site combining retail, leisure and residential uses. And multi-visitor because there are leisure,
business, and tourist visitors at the site”, says Peter Narbe who headed up the Malmo project for G4S.
A range of services was required to keep overall costs under control, which G4S achieved through a hybrid service
model: vetted, trained security personnel and hospitality personnel for reception, ticketing, stewarding and front-of-house
services.
G4S ensures resourcing levels are uniquely geared to each event. All of the venue’s cash management needs are met by
G4S while sophisticated systems combat counterfeit tickets.
No two events are the same at Malmo Arena. But for every visitor it offers the experience of a lifetime. G4S is always
there throughout, ensuring the visit is safe, secure, and fun.

In Africa, organic growth was 10.8% and margins improved to 9.0%. Kenya performed very well with growth of 14%
and continued strong profitability. Morocco had strong growth assisted by new contracts in the oil and banking
sectors. In South Africa, growth continued but margins were lower due to a number of underperforming contracts
and new management has been installed.
Elsewhere in Africa, DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Namibia and Zambia all performed well with healthy
organic growth and a significant increase in scale from the ArmorGroup acquisition in many of these markets.
In the Latin America & Caribbean region, organic growth was 16.5% and margins were 6.6%. The region has
experienced a slight slow-down in economic growth and some smaller competitors in countries such as Peru and
Ecuador have exited the market, which is currently providing an opportunity for the group as the labour market
tightness has reduced.
Argentina continued to perform well with organic growth over 30% and improved margins helped by an improved
business mix.
In Chile, improving margins were assisted by the acquisition of the largest marine security solution company and
some higher margin mining contracts. Peru grew more than 20% helped by new regulation which favours
professional security companies and margins improved due to new technology related contracts.
The various businesses within Colombia performed well in comparison to 2007 but overall results were impacted
by the renegotiated tolls contract, as expected.

In the UK & Ireland, the cash solutions business performed well with good organic growth
and firm margins. The fifth “super branch” cash management centre in the UK was officially
opened in London in January 2009.
There was slower growth but strong margins in the Netherlands as a result of excellent
operational controls. The implementation of the Swedbank ATM management contract
contributed to substantial revenue growth and improved margins in Sweden.
In Belgium there was good growth in ATMs and cash management, largely from expanding
existing customer contracts. In Hungary and the Baltics there was high revenue growth
and excellent margins.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Basis of accountingThe financial statements are presented in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union
(“adopted IFRSs”). The group’s significant accounting policies are detailed in note 3 on
pages 51 to 58 and those that are most critical and/or require the greatest level of
judgement are discussed in note 4 on pages 58 and 59.
Operating results The overall results are commented upon by the Chairman in his
statement and operational trading is discussed in the operating review on pages 8 to 17.
Profit from operations before amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets (PBITA)
amounted to £416.4m, an increase of 34% on the £311.4m in 2007 and an increase of
23% at constant exchange rates.
Associates Included within PBITA is £3.4m (2007: £3.0m) in respect of the group’s share
of profit from associates, principally from the business of Space Gateway in the US which
provides safety services to NASA. Cash flow from associates was £12.2m, compared to
£1.0m in 2007. 19

(excluding acquired net

£369.8m.
 NET INTEREST PAYABLE ON
NET DEBT WAS £81.2M. This
is an increase of 41% over
the 2007 cost of £57.4m.
Acquisitions and acquisition-related intangible assets Investment in acquisitions in the year (excluding acquired net debt
of £210.3m) amounted to £369.8m, of which £358.2m was a cash outflow and £11.6m deferred consideration. This
investment generated goodwill of £408.5m and other acquisition-related intangible assets of £202.0m.
The largest acquisition in the year was the purchase of the Global Solutions group (“GSL”), an international leader
in the provision of support services for governments, public authorities and the private sector, based in the UK, on
12 May for total consideration of £176.1m.
Other significant acquisitions included ArmorGroup, an international provider of defensive, protective security
services, head-quartered in the UK;T ouchcom, a security consultancy and design business in the US; RONCO, an
international provider of humanitarian mine action and ordnance services, specialised security and training, head-
quartered in the US; MJM Investigations, a provider of insurance fraud mitigation and claims services in the US; Rock
Steady, providing event security in the UK;Travel Logistics, a provider of passport and visa services in the UK; and
Progard, the market leader in professional security services in the Republic of Serbia. In addition, the group acquired
the 49% of its business in Macau that it did not already own, completed in March the purchase of a further 25% of its
multi-service businesses in the Baltic States and, in December, acquired the final 10% of these businesses.
Larger acquisitions in 2007 included the purchase of controlling interests in Fidelity Cash Management in South Africa
and the business of al Majal Facilities Management in Saudi Arabia; the purchase of RIG, a police recruitment business
in the UK; and the recognition of put options that increased to 90% the group’s interest in the multi-service
businesses in the Baltic states.
The contribution made by acquisitions to the results of the group during the year is shown in note 17 on pages 69
to 71.
The charge for the year for the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets other than goodwill amounted
to £67.8m. Goodwill is not amortised. Acquisition-related intangible assets included in the balance sheet at
31 December 2008 amounted to £2,060.4m goodwill and £392.2m other.
Financing items Finance income was £104.9m and finance costs £189.3m, giving a net finance cost of £84.4m. Net
interest payable on net debt was £81.2m. This is an increase of 41% over the 2007 cost of £57.4m due principally
to the increase in the group’s average gross debt. The group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2008 was 5.5%
compared to 5.7% in 2007. The cost based on prevailing interest rates at 31 December 2008 was 4.6% compared
to 5.7% at 31 December 2007.
Also included within financing are other net interest costs of £6.9m (2007: £1.3m), including the unwinding of the
discount on put options over minority interests, and a net income of £3.7m (2007: £5.0m) in respect of movements
in the group’s net retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation The taxation charge of £89.3m provided upon profit from operations before amortisation of acquisition-
related intangible assets less net interest, represents a tax rate of 26.9%, compared to 27.5% in 2007. The group
believes that an effective tax rate of around this level is sustainable going forward as a result of the ongoing
rationalisation of the post-merger group legal structure and the elimination of fiscal inefficiencies. The amortisation of
acquisition-related intangible assets gives rise to the release of the related proportion of the deferred tax liability
established when the assets were acquired, amounting to £19.1m. Potential tax assets in respect of losses amounting
to £503.9m have not been recognised as their utilisation is uncertain.
Disposals and discontinued operations The group disposed of its secure solutions businesses in Germany on
15 May 2008 and of its security systems business in France on 31 July 2008. The group’s disposal of its manned
security business in France was in progress at 31 December 2008 and completed on 28 February 2009. In addition,
during the year the group disposed of a number of small businesses, including the cash services business in Guatemala.
On 2 July 2007, the group disposed of its cash services business in France and during that year disposed of a number
of small businesses, mainly in Latin America. 20
Operating & Financial Review (continued)
The loss attributable to discontinued operations comprises a loss of
£13.3m in respect of post-tax trading of discontinued businesses, a profit
of £12.0m in respect of the disposals made in the current year, an
impairment of £29.4m in respect of the carrying value of the group’s
manned security business in France and a profit of £1.6m in respect of
adjustments to prior year disposals.The result from discontinued operations
in 2007 comprises a loss of £11.5m in respect of trading of both the
2007 and the 2008 disposals, a £9.1m profit in respect of disposals and
a £2.9m profit in respect of adjustments to prior year disposals.
The net cash proceeds from business disposals received in 2008 were
£31.1m, including £27.0m in respect of the secure solutions businesses
in Germany.
The contribution to the turnover and operating profit of the group
from discontinued operations is shown in note 6 on pages 60 to 63 and
their contribution to net profit and cash flows is detailed in note 7 on
pages 63 and 64.
Profit for the year Profit for the year was £164.9m, compared to
£160.6m in 2007. The increase represents the £105.0m increase in
PBITA less the £30.7m increase in net interest cost, the £26.2m increase
in amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, the £14.2m
increase in the tax charge and the £29.6m increase in loss from
discontinued operations.
Minority interests Profit attributable to minority interests was £13.7m
in 2008, slightly higher than the £13.4m for 2007, reflecting minority
partner shares in the group’s organic and acquisitive growth, less a
reduction in minority shares in net profits consequent upon the group
increasing its interests in certain subsidiaries.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share from continuing and
discontinued operations was 11.1p compared to 11.5p for 2007. These
earnings are unchanged when calculated on a fully diluted basis, which
allows for the potential impact of outstanding share options.
Adjusted earnings, as analysed in note 16 on page 68, excludes the
result from discontinued operations, amortisation of acquisition-related
intangible assets and retirement benefit obligations financing items, all
net of tax, and better allows the assessment of operational
performance, the analysis of trends over time, the comparison of
different businesses and the projection of future performance. Adjusted
earnings per share was 16.7p, an increase of 26% on 13.3p for 2007.
Dividends The directors recommend a final dividend of 3.68p (DKK
0.3052) per share. This represents an increase of 29% upon the final
dividend for the year to 31 December 2007 of 2.85p (DKK 0.2786)
per share. The interim dividend was 2.75p (DKK 0.2572) per share and
the total dividend, if approved, will be 6.43p (DKK 0.5624) per share,
representing an increase of 30% over the 4.96p (DKK 0.5105) per share
total dividend for 2007.
The proposed dividend cover is 2.5 times (2007: 2.7 times) on adjusted
earnings. The group has, in accordance with stated intentions, been
reducing its dividend cover to the 2.5 times level over a period of
several years. The group’s intention is that dividends in future increase
broadly in line with normalised adjusted earnings.
Cash flow The primary cash generation focus of group management is
on the percentage of operating profit converted into cash. From 2007,
the group’s target conversion rate was raised from 80% to 85%.
Operating cash flow, as defined for management purposes, was as

Working capital was largely unchanged in both 2008 and 2007 due to a
programme of billing and collection process improvements that is being
rolled out across the group offsetting the impact of the group’s organic
growth. Capital expenditure relative to the depreciation charge can vary
from year to year due to the timing of asset replacements. It was 138%
of depreciation in 2008, compared to 109% in 2007. Overall operating
cash generation for the year was good, as a result of the maintenance
of financial discipline across the organisation.
The management operating cash flow calculation is reconciled to the

Net debt represents the group’s total borrowings less cash, cash
equivalents and liquid investments. The components of net debt are
detailed in note 39 on page 96.
Share capital On 13 May 2008, the group completed a placing of 127m
ordinary shares of 25p at a price of 222p per share. Gross proceeds
were £281.9m and issue costs £5.9m.
Financing and treasury activities The group’s treasury function is
responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for
managing the group’s financial risk arising from currency and interest
rate volatility and counterparty credit. Treasury is not a profit centre and
is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments. The treasury
department’s policies are set by the board. Treasury is subject to the
controls appropriate to the risks it manages. These risks are discussed in
note 33 on pages 84 to 86.
Financing The group’s funding position is strong, with sufficient headroom
against available committed facilities and very little debt maturing before
2012.
The group’s primary source of finance is a £1.1bn multicurrency revolving
credit facility provided by a consortium of lending banks at a margin of
0.225% over Libor and maturing on 28 June 2012.
The group also has US $550m in financing from the private placement
of unsecured senior loan notes on 1 March 2007, maturing at various
dates between 2014 and 2022 and bearing interest at rates between
5.77% and 6.06%. The fixed interest rates payable have been swapped
into floating rates for the term of the notes, at an average margin of
0.60% over Libor.
Between 7 March and 15 July 2008 the group had available committed
facilities amounting to £350m at an initial margin of 0.35% over Libor.
The purpose of these facilities was to provide the group with
headroom whilst the group assessed options in the capital markets.
On 15 July 2008, the group completed a further $514m and £69m
private placement of unsecured senior loan notes, maturing at various
dates between 2013 and 2020 and bearing interest at rates between
6.09% and 7.56%. The proceeds of the issue were used to reduce
drawings against the revolving credit facility. $265m of the US dollar
receipts have been swapped into sterling for the term of the notes.
The group has other short-term committed facilities of £45m and
uncommitted facilities of £578m.
The group’s net debt at 31 December 2008 of £1,347.7m represented a
gearing of 92%. The group headroom at 31 December 2008 was £350m.
The group has sufficient capacity to finance current investment plans.
On 9 March 2009, the group obtained a BBB credit rating from Standard
& Poor’s, which provides the group with further flexibility as regards
future funding.
Interest rates The group’s investments and borrowings at
31 December 2008 were, with the exception of the issue of private
placement notes in July 2008, at variable rates of interest linked to Libor
and Euribor, with the group’s exposure being predominantly to interest
rate risk in US dollar and euro. The group’s interest risk policy requires
treasury to fix a proportion of this exposure on a sliding scale utilising
interest rate swaps. The maturity of these interest rate swaps at
31 December 2008 was limited to five years. The market value of the
Loan Note-related pay-variable receive-fixed swaps outstanding at
31 December 2008, accounted for as fair value hedges, was a gain of
£92.3m. The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps
and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross-currency swaps outstanding at
31 December 2008, accounted for as cash flow hedges, was a gain
of £32.3m.

Operating & Financial Review (continued)
Foreign currency The group has many overseas subsidiaries and
associates denominated in various different currencies. Treasury policy is
to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets
and income denominated in foreign currencies. The methods adopted
are to use borrowings denominated in foreign currency supplemented
by forward foreign exchange contracts.
During 2008 both the US dollar and euro appreciated significantly
against sterling. The average rate for the dollar during 2008 was
$1.86=£1 compared to $2.00=£1 for 2007. The rate at 31 December
2008 was $1.44=£1 compared to $1.99=£1 at 31 December 2007.
This variance has impacted the group’s dollar-denominated assets and
assets denominated in New Market currencies that follow the dollar.
The average rate for the euro during 2008 was €1.26=£1 compared to
€1.46=£1 for 2007. The rate at 31 December 2008 was €1.03=£1
compared to €1.36=£1 at 31 December 2007. This variance has
impacted the group’s euro-denominated assets and assets denominated
in European currencies that follow the euro.
Exchange differences on the translation of foreign operations included
in the statement of recognised income and expense amount to a gain
of £100.9m (2007: gain of £18.4m). These differences are net of a
£186.2m loss (2007: £12.2m loss) on the retranslation of net debt and
a £65.9m cash outflow (2007: £4.3m outflow) from forward exchange
contracts.
The market value of forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2008
was a loss of £28.6m.
Cash management T o assist the efficient management of the group’s
interest costs and its short-term deposits, overdrafts and revolving credit
facility drawings, the group operates a global cash management system.
At 31 December 2008, 90 group companies participated in the pool.
Debit balances of £128.4m and credit balances of £131.0m were held
within the cash pool. IFRS does not permit the netting off of these
balances, which are therefore disclosed gross within current assets and
current liabilities.
Retirement benefit obligations The group’s primary defined benefit
retirement benefit schemes are those operated in the UK, but it also
operates such schemes in a number of countries, particularly in Europe
and North America. The latest full actuarial assessments of the UK
schemes were carried out at 31 March 2007 in respect of the Group 4
scheme (approximately 8,000 members), at 5 April 2006 in respect
of the Securicor scheme (approximately 20,000 members) and at
31 March 2005 in respect of the GSL scheme (approximately 2,000
members) acquired during the year. These assessments and those of the
group’s other schemes have been updated to 31 December 2008,
including the review of longevity assumptions.The group’s funding shortfall
on the valuation basis specified in IAS19 Employee Benefits was £286m
before tax or £206m after tax (2007: £136m and £98m respectively).
The valuation of gross liabilities decreased during 2008 largely due to an
increase in the appropriate AA corporate bond rate in the UK from
5.8% to 6.3%, partially offset by an increase in expected longevity.
However, the value of the assets held in the funds decreased by £245m
during 2008.
The group believes that the short-term volatility in reported retirement
benefit obligations, in response to movements in asset prices and
financial circumstances, is of limited relevance in the context of liabilities
which are exceptionally long-term in nature and furthermore that, over
the long term, investment returns on the retirement benefit scheme
assets will be sufficient to fund retirement benefit obligations. However,
in recognition of the regulatory obligation upon pension fund trustees
to address reported deficits if they arise, the group anticipates that
additional cash contributions will continue to be made at least at a level
similar to that in 2008. The three schemes in the UK have combined
under one trustee body with effect from 1 January 2009 and will all be
formally actuarially assessed at 5 April 2009.
Corporate governance The group’s policies regarding risk management
and corporate governance are set out in the Corporate Governance
Statement on pages 33 to 35.
Going concern The directors are confident that, after making enquiries
and on the basis of current financial projections and available facilities,
they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Risks All businesses are subject to risk and many individual risks are
macro-economic or social and common across many businesses. Many
risks are to a greater or lesser extent controllable, but some are not
controllable. Through its internal risk management process, the group
identifies business-specific risks. It classifies the key risks as those which
could materially damage the group’s strategy, reputation, business,
profitability or assets and these risks are listed below. This list is in no
particular order and is not an exhaustive list of all potential risks. Some
risks may be unknown and it may transpire that others currently
considered immaterial become material.
1. Price competition
The security industry comprises a number of very competitive markets.
In particular, manned security markets can be fragmented with relatively
low economic barriers to entry and the group competes with a wide
variety of operators of varying sizes. Actions taken by the group’s
competitors may place pressure upon its pricing, margins and profitability.
2. Major changes in market dynamics
Such changes in dynamics could include new technologies, government
legislation or customer consolidation and could, particularly if rapid or
unpredictable, impact the group’s revenues and profitability or the
carrying value of goodwill and other assets.
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) 23
G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
3. Cash losses
The group is responsible for the cash held on behalf of its customers.
Increases in the value of cash lost through criminal attack may increase
the costs of the group’s insurance. Were there to be failures in the
control and reconciliation processes in respect to customer cash these
could also adversely affect the group’s profitability.
4. Onerous contractual obligations
Should the group commit to sales contracts specifying disadvantageous
pricing mechanisms, unachievable service levels or excessive liability it
could impact its margins and profitability.
5. Inappropriate sourcing of staff
The group’s greatest asset is its large and committed work force.
However, were the group to source inappropriate staff, whether it be as
permanent employees, temporary workers or sub-contractors, the
result could be detrimental to the group’s reputation and could
adversely affect the group’s growth and profitability.
6. Poor operational service delivery
Should the group fail to meet the operational requirements of its
customers it could impact its reputation, contract retention and growth.
7. Financing
If due to adverse financial market conditions insufficient or only very
costly financial funding were available, the group might not be in a
position to implement its strategy as it plans to do or invest in
acquisitions or capital expenditure, adversely impacting its growth and
profitability.
8. Defined benefit pension schemes
A prolonged period of poor asset returns and/or unexpected increases
in longevity could require increases in the current levels of additional
cash contributions to defined benefit pension schemes, which may
constrain the group’s ability to invest in acquisitions or capital
expenditure, adversely impacting its growth and profitability.
9. Regulatory requirements
Security can be a high-profile industry. There is a wide and ever-changing
variety of regulations applicable to the group’s businesses across the
world. Failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect the
group’s revenues and profitability.
The group has a robust risk assessment and control process in place to
identify and mitigate the controllable risks faced by the organisation.
Mitigation measures include:
1.The group’s diversity
The group operates around 150 businesses across over 110 countries
and across a range of product areas. Most of the risks detailed above
are market-specific and, therefore, any particular issue should only
impact part of the group’s operations.
2. Management structure
The group operates a management structure that is appropriate to the
scale and breadth of its activities. Business performance and strategies
are reviewed continuously by regional, divisional and group
management. Potential issues requiring management attention are
therefore identified and there is a wide range of expertise available
throughout the organisation, which is utilised as necessary to address
these issues.
3. Authorisation procedures
The group has clear authorisation limits and procedures which are
cascaded throughout the organisation. For example, a contract approval
process is in place, under which certain contracts are reviewed by the
group’s legal department.
4. Group standards
Each of the group’s businesses applies the systems and procedures
appropriate to its size and complexity. However, the group requires that
these conform to group standards in respect of matters such as
operational and financial controls, recruitment and vetting, financial
reporting, contract risk management, business continuity planning and
project management techniques. Further standards, including those in
respect of IT systems, are applied on a divisional or regional basis.
5. Internal audit
The Internal Audit department operates under a wide remit, which
includes ensuring adherence to group authorisation procedures and
control standards. A separate dedicated cash audit function monitors
compliance with the group’s standards on cash management and
reconciliation.
6. Diversified sources of finance
The group’s treasury department monitors the group’s financing
requirements and extends its sources of finance as necessary. For
example, during the last two years the group has raised around $1.1bn
of funding in the form of long-term loan notes from the US private
placement market.
7. Market engagement
Most of the risks to which the group is exposed are market risks. So as
to better understand and influence the market, the group is committed
to a policy of proactive engagement across its geographic range, with
customers, industry associations, government regulators and employee
representatives. 24

OUR PEOPLE
Core aims and standards – G4S has defined a number of core standards and processes to ensure
that employees are treated with respect, fairness and dignity at work in line with the G4S values.
These standards and processes cover issues such as:
Ethical employment goals – Our Business Ethics Policy sets out the group’s core standards in relation
to our employees, for example by supporting the principles of international standards such as the
ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. With significant G4S operations in
many developing markets, real commitment to these international standards is essential.
Investing in the workforce – We place great focus on attracting and retaining the right talent at all

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Background As a major global organisation, we play a significant role in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people
– both directly through employment and indirectly through our involvement in the communities in which our
employees live and work.
We take that role very seriously and encourage all of our businesses to actively raise standards and invest in the
communities in which they operate. At a group level, we also invest in programmes which contribute positively to the
community and environment and we set international standards and policies to which our businesses must operate.
Business Ethics G4S is committed to operating to the highest levels of business ethics throughout its operations.
We have an extensive business ethics policy which describes the company’s minimum expected standards in a wide
range of areas such as:
This policy is communicated to managers throughout the group and, on an annual basis, they are required to declare
individually their personal commitment by endorsing the policy and confirming compliance within their own area
of responsibility.
Strict adherence to the principles of the business ethics policy is required of all group employees. Compliance with the
policy is monitored through our internal and external audit functions and through the group’s whistle-blowing facilities.
The risk-based three year group audit plan ensures that all businesses across 110 countries, including those in small
and remote locations, receive at least one visit during the three year audit cycle. We take our responsibilities in this
area very seriously and take swift and robust action against any non-compliance.
Environment – G4S recognises that its business activities have a direct and indirect impact on the natural
environment and is committed to proactively managing these impacts in a responsible manner.
The G4S Environmental Policy and the G4S Climate Action Programme were launched in 2008. The policy outlines
the key commitments from G4S to protect and preserve the environment for future generations and the
programme will ensure everyone is encouraged to contribute to protecting and preserving the environment. The
Climate Action Board meets monthly to review progress on the programme and reports directly to the group chief
executive and provides a written statement to the group management board on a quarterly basis.

carried out continuously. Research and development written off to profit and loss during the year amounted to £3.5m (2007: £2.1m).
7 Payment of suppliers

8 Employees
In 2008 the company signed an Ethical Employment Partnership with UNI, the global union, which sets out how the organisations will work
together to raise employment standards in the group and the wider industry. This landmark agreement provides further evidence of the group’s
commitment to engaging and involving employees and their representatives in the business, and helps to ensure that the group maintains its
position as a leading global employer. At a local level, group companies continue to use a range of mechanisms to ensure employees are involved in
the business and their views are sought and considered as appropriate in the local culture and context, for example by using joint project teams or
suggestions schemes to address specific business issues, or establishing employee forums and dialogue with local unions to discuss matters directly
affecting employees.
The company remains committed to its Diversity & Inclusion policy and in 2008 the group appointed a Head of Talent & Diversity with
responsibility for developing and implementing a cohesive approach to diversity and inclusion across its businesses around the world. This policy is
designed to ensure that the group continues to develop fair employment practices and creates a diverse workforce which is truly representative of
all sections of society. The group strives to create an environment in which differences can be acknowledged, respected, and valued so that all may
realise their full potential and the talents and resources of the workforce are utilised fully to enable it to provide the best service to its customers
globally. This ensures that the group supports and develops employees regardless of any disability, and the company is proud to maintain an
excellent record as a fair and inclusive employer.
Further details of the group’s approach to employee engagement, social dialogue and diversity are included on pages 24 and 25 of this report and
in the group’s separate Corporate Responsibility Report.

service.

have been granted by the company in favour of certain of the directors of certain of the group’s subsidiaries in Germany. The company has
maintained a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the year under review.
Details of directors’ interests (including their family’s interests) in the share capital of G4S plc and of the directors’ remuneration are set out on
pages 36 to 43.
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Each of the directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report, further confirms that, to the best of his knowledge: the
financial statements in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and the group taken as whole; and this directors’ report, including the Operating

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
32 The board’s statement on the company’s corporate governance performance is based on the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in
June 2006 (“the Combined Code”).
The Combined Code requires companies to disclose how they apply the code’s principles, and to confirm that they comply with the code’s provisions
or, where they do not comply, to provide an explanation.
(a) Application of Combined Code principles
The board comprises the non-executive chairman (Alf Duch-Pedersen), a non-executive deputy chairman (Lord Condon), five other non-executive
directors, the chief executive (Nick Buckles), the chief financial officer (Trevor Dighton) and the chief operating officer (Grahame Gibson). The
board considers all the non-executive directors to be independent. The senior independent director is Lord Condon.
All continuing directors are subject to election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment and will submit
themselves for re-election at least every three years.
Membership of the three board committees is as follows:
Audit Committee
Thorleif Krarup (chairman)
Bo Lerenius
Mark Seligman
Remuneration Committee
Lord Condon (chairman)
Mark Elliott
Bo Lerenius
Mark Seligman
Nomination Committee
Alf Duch-Pedersen (chairman)
Lord Condon
Mark Elliott (joined May 2008)
Sir Malcolm Williamson left the Audit and Nomination Committees when he retired from the board on 30 May 2008. Mr Elliott joined the
Nomination Committee on 30 May 2008. Mr Seligman is the member of the Audit Committee with recent and relevant financial experience.
As previously announced, it is intended that Mr Seligman will become chairman of the Audit Committee following the company’s Annual General
Meeting in 2009. Mr Krarup will remain a member of that committee. The terms of reference of each of the above committees are available on the
company’s website.
It is intended that the chairmen of the three committees will be available to answer questions at the Annual General Meeting which is an important
opportunity for communication between the board and shareholders, particularly private shareholders. Following each resolution at the Annual
General Meeting, the meeting is informed of the numbers of proxy votes cast and the same information is subsequently published on the
company’s website.
There were nine regularly scheduled board meetings during the year ended 31 December 2008. Two additional meetings were called at short
notice to consider specific transactions. One of the meetings was also an extended board and strategy session, at which presentations on
implementation of the company’s strategy were made to the board by senior executives. Another of the board meetings was held in Romania to
enable the board to have greater inter-action with one of the group’s rapidly developing businesses. All members attended each of the board
meetings except that Mark Elliott was absent from two of the regularly scheduled meetings and Grahame Gibson,Thorlief Krarup and Sir Malcolm
Williamson were each unable to attend one of the meetings called at short notice.
At each meeting, the board receives reports from the chief executive, the chief financial officer and the company secretary, an HR report which
includes summaries of developments on HR matters and an investor relations report which includes analysts’ reviews and any comments received
from major shareholders since the previous board meeting. After meetings of the board committees, the respective committee chairmen report to
the board on the matters considered by each committee. In addition, the board receives monthly management accounts.
There are nine board meetings scheduled for the current year, including an extended, two-day, strategy review session.
G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
33 (a) Application of Combined Code principles (continued)
There is a detailed schedule of matters reserved to the board which are set out under five separate categories: (1) Board and management;
(2) Operations; (3) Finance; (4) Business control; and (5) Secretarial. By way of example, board approval is required for (a) acquisitions, disposals,
investments and capital projects exceeding £4m; (b) any changes to the group’s business strategy; and (c) the annual trading, capital expenditure and
cash flow budgets.
Each of the directors has disclosed to the board any situations which apply to them as a result of which they have or may have an interest which
conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the company. In accordance with the company’s articles of association (as amended in accordance
with a resolution passed at the company’s 2008 Annual General Meeting), the board has authorised such matters. The affected directors did not
vote when their own positions were considered.Where the board deemed it appropriate, such authorisation was given subject to certain
conditions. The board will review such matters on a regular basis.
In the year under review, the Audit and Remuneration Committees both met four times and the Nomination Committee met twice. All members
attended each of the meetings except for Bo Lerenius who was absent from one meeting of the Remuneration Committee and Mark Elliott who
was absent from two meetings of the Remuneration Committee.
An external consultancy was appointed by the board to conduct an evaluation of the performance of the board as a whole, each of the directors
individually and the board’s committees. Reports from the consultancy have been considered by the board, the chairman and by each committee
and a number of areas for improvement have been identified and actions agreed. As a result the Remuneration Committee has scheduled an extra
meeting, both the board and the Audit Committee will have greater contact with senior managers from around the group and the board will
increase its focus on a number of matters including, amongst other things, oversight of risk management and executive succession management.
The chairman held meetings with the non-executive directors without the executives present and a review of the performance of the chairman by
the non-executive directors, without the chairman present, was led by the senior independent director.
The chief executive and the chief financial officer hold regular meetings with individual institutional shareholders to discuss the group’s strategy and
financial performance, although price sensitive information is never divulged at these meetings. It is intended that all the directors will attend the
company’s Annual General Meeting and will be available to answer questions from shareholders.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for making recommendations on board appointments and on maintaining a balance of skills and
experience on the board and its committees.
Audit Committee meetings are attended by representatives of the group auditor, the chief financial officer, the head of internal audit and the
company secretary. The committee considers the group’s annual and half-yearly financial statements and any questions raised by the auditor on the
financial statements and financial systems. It also reviews, amongst other matters, the group’s internal auditing process, whistle-blowing arrangements,
risk management procedures and internal controls.
The Audit Committee has established a policy on the provision by the external auditor of non-audit services, so as to ensure that the
independence of the audit is not compromised. Besides the formal audit function, the auditor is permitted to provide consultation and due diligence
services related to mergers and acquisitions, audits of employee benefit plans, reviews of internal accounting and control policies, general advice on
financial reporting standards and corporate tax services. The auditor is prohibited from providing other services without specific permission from
the Audit Committee. The value of non-audit services provided by the auditor must not exceed the fees charged for the statutory audit, save in the
event of a major transformation deal. The auditor has written to the Audit Committee confirming that, in its opinion, it is independent.
The work of the Remuneration Committee is more fully described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report which appears on pages 36 to 43.
(b) Compliance with provisions of Combined Code
The company complied throughout the year under review with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED
34 (c) Risk Management and Internal Control
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The risks associated with the group’s activities are reviewed regularly by the board, which considers major risks and evaluates their impact on the
group. Policies and procedures, which are reviewed and monitored by the head of internal audit, are in place to deal with any matters which may
be considered by the board to present significant exposure.
The key features of the group’s risk management process are:
> A common risk management framework* is used to provide a profile of those risks which may have an impact on the achievement of business
objectives.
> Each significant risk is documented, showing an overview of the risk, how the risk is managed, and any improvement actions. The risk profiles
ensure that internal audit reviews of the adequacy, application and effectiveness of risk management and internal controls are targeted on the
key risks.
> Risk management committees have been established at regional, divisional and group level. The regional committees meet at least annually and
the divisional and group committees meet quarterly. A standard agenda covering risk and control issues is considered at each meeting and risk
profiles are reviewed and updated at each meeting.
> Risk and control self-evaluation exercises are undertaken for each operating company, for most companies at least twice a year, and updated risk
profiles are prepared. Similar exercises are undertaken as part of the integration process for all major acquisitions. The results of the company
risk evaluations are assessed by the regional and divisional risk management committees*.
The process, which is reviewed regularly by the board in accordance with the internal control guidance for directors in the Combined Code, is
carried out under the overall supervision of the group risk management committee. This committee, which reports to the Audit Committee,
includes both the chief executive and the chief financial officer.
The Audit Committee undertakes a high level review of risk management and internal control. Both the divisional risk management committees and
the group risk management committee receive internal audit reports and regular reports on risks. They monitor the actions taken to manage risks.
The internal control system includes clearly defined reporting lines and authorisation procedures, a comprehensive budgeting and monthly
reporting system, and written policies and procedures. In addition to a wide range of internal audit reports, senior management also receive
assurance from other sources including security inspections, third party reviews, company financial control reviews, external audit reports,
summaries of whistle-blowing activity, and risk and control self-evaluations.
The board has reviewed the group’s risk management and internal control system for the year to 31 December 2008 by considering reports from
the Audit Committee and has taken account of events since 31 December 2008.

* Because Wackenhut Services, Inc. (“WSI”) is governed through a proxy agreement under which the group is excluded from access to certain information, it is not subject to the same risk
management process as is applied to other group companies.The board has however satisfied itself as to the adequacy of the internal control processes adopted by WSI. This report, prepared on behalf of and approved by the board, provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors and sets out the company’s
remuneration policies for the current financial year and, subject to ongoing review, for subsequent financial years. The report will be put to the
company’s Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the period under review. The members of the committee, all of whom are considered to be
independent, are Lord Condon (chairman), Mark Elliott, Bo Lerenius and Mark Seligman. The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the
remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors, the three other members of the group executive committee and the company secretary. It is
also responsible for the operation of the company’s share plans. Its terms of reference are available on the company’s website.
T owers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc.* (“T owers Perrin”) has been appointed by the committee to provide executive and senior management
remuneration advice to the company. Their terms of appointment are available on the company’s website. In addition Alithos Limited* (“Alithos”) has
been appointed by the committee to verify the calculation of certain elements of payments due under the company’s performance share plan. In
addition to its work for the committee,T owers Perrin has also provided a small amount of management remuneration information to the company
during the period under review. Alithos has not provided any other services to the company during the period under review.
Nick Buckles, chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group. Further guidance
was received from the group’s HR director, Irene Cowden. Neither Mr Buckles nor Mrs Cowden participated in discussions regarding their own
remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the executive management team aims to achieve:
> the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives;
> a strong link between executive reward and the group’s performance;
> alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders; and
> provision of incentive arrangements which focus on both annual and longer-term performance.
In terms of market positioning, the overall objective is to achieve remuneration levels which provide a market competitive base salary with the
opportunity to earn above market norms on the delivery of superior performance through the company’s incentive schemes. A significant proportion of
total remuneration is related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes. On average, the performance-
related element of remuneration for executive directors amounts to around 45% of the total package for target performance and around 65% of the
total package for stretch performance. The committee believes that the current balance is appropriate, although it is kept under review.
The committee is satisfied that the incentive structure for the board does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating
irresponsible behaviour.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
Elements of remuneration
(a) Base salary and benefits
The salaries of the executive directors are reviewed with effect from 1 January each year. Interim salary reviews may be carried out following
significant changes in responsibility.The salaries take account of a benchmarking exercise based on similarly sized companies with a significant part of
their business overseas and also reflect responsibility, individual performance, internal relativities and salary and other market information supplied
by T owers Perrin. Benefits include pension arrangements and the provision of a company car (or a cash allowance in lieu of a car), health insurance
and life assurance. Notwithstanding the strong performance of the business, for 2009 the executive directors have requested that their base salaries
are frozen at 2008 levels, given the current economic climate. Similarly, the non-executive directors have asked that their fee levels are not changed
in 2009.
At 31 December 2008
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
36
* T owers Perrin and Alithos have each given, and not withdrawn, their written consent to the issue of this document with the inclusion of the reference to their respective names in the form and
content in which they appear. Copies of the consent letters are available for inspection at the company’s registered office. (b) Performance-related bonus scheme
For the year under review, the executive directors participated in an annual performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which were
dependent on the attainment of defined PBTA (profit before tax and amortisation) targets of the group, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional
items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.The committee believes that PBTA best reflects the various key drivers of
business success within the group. For achievement of a threshold level of profits which is slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of
25% of base salary was due. 40% of base salary was payable on achievement of the budgeted target and the amount of bonus increases on a straight
line basis up to 80% of base salary for achievement of a stretch profit target. A further 20% was payable on achievement of pre-defined key business
objectives approved by the Remuneration Committee. These objectives vary for each individual according to their responsibilities and support longer-
term business development. Any such bonus up to the value of 50% of the executive director’s salary was payable in cash with any excess balance
being awarded in the form of deferred shares. Any deferred shares will normally only be transferred to the executive director if he remains in
employment (otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances) for a period of three years from the date of the award of the shares.
The company performed well in 2008, with PBTA increased by £75.6m (£53.3m at 2008 constant exchange rates) materially exceeding target, but
falling below maximum full stretch target performance. As a result the Remuneration Committee agreed that the resulting payment for this
component of the bonus should be at the 62.5% of base salary level. In addition the committee agreed that the element of bonus dependent on
achievement of pre-defined key business objectives, including objectives linked to strategic development and organisational development issues,
should be paid at between 17% and 20% of base salary.
Following a review of the level of bonus opportunities offered by the company in comparison with those of its peers, the committee has agreed
that for 2009, the bonus opportunity for executive directors will be changed so that they may receive an amount equal to 125% of base salary
(150% in the case of the chief executive). No specific element of bonus will be attributable to key business objectives as the committee believes it
is preferable to concentrate on financial performance in the present economic conditions. The executive directors will however still be set key
business objectives which will be used to monitor performance. Furthermore, any bonus due above 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus
entitlement will be awarded as deferred shares which will not vest for three years. The bonus will be entirely based on the achievement of PBTA
targets which would result in the payment of 60% of maximum bonus entitlement. This amount of bonus would increase on a straight line basis up
to 100% of maximum bonus entitlement for achievement of a stretch profit target. 35% of maximum bonus entitlement would be payable for
achievement of a threshold level of profit which is at least 95% of the budgeted profit target. No bonus would be payable for performance below
threshold. The committee believes that payment of at least part of the available bonus entitlement for a performance slightly below the PBTA target
is justified because it would be desirable to incentivise the executives to push for the best result possible, even if it became apparent that the PBTA
budget would not be met.
In addition, a claw-back provision has been included in the 2009 annual bonus rules. Any deferred shares awarded and dividends arising from these
shares could be clawed back if the 2009 profit figures are restated materially in line with a recommendation by the Audit Committee within two
years of the year end.
The PBTA targets used for the above schemes are the same as the company’s budgeted PBTA for the corresponding period (assuming constant
exchange rates). The committee is satisfied that in order to achieve the 2009 PBTA targets, the company would have to achieve a tough budget in
what are likely to be testing times. The PBTA targets allow for adjustments in respect of any material, non-budgeted changes which take place
during the year, such as acquisitions, disposals etc. Thus, for example, should a planned disposal not be completed by the year end, the committee
reserves the right to re-insert the operating profit or loss for the business in question in the actual and budgeted PBTA targets.
(c) Performance Share Plan (long-term incentive plan)
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was introduced in July 2004. Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives
receive conditional allocations of the company’s shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares payable under the plan is two and a half times base salary. The annual award approved by the committee for
the year under review is two times base salary for the chief executive, one and a half times base salary for the other executive directors and one
times salary for senior executives below board level.The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest is determined, as to two thirds of
the award, by the company’s normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and, as to the remaining third
of the award, by the company’s ranking by reference to TSR (total shareholder return; being share price growth plus dividends paid) using a
bespoke global group of 16 support services companies as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period.
In relation to awards made in years prior to 2007, the conditions subject to which allocations of shares vest under this plan differ in a number of
respects: half of any award is determined by the company’s normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three year period
and the other half of the award by the company’s ranking by reference to TSR using the FTSE 100 constituent companies as at the date of the
award as a comparator group, again over a single three year period. There is no provision for retesting.

At 31 December 2008
37 (c) Performance Share Plan (long-term incentive plan) (continued)
The following targets will continue to apply to two-thirds of awards granted since 2007, with the three year EPS (earnings per share) period ending
on 31 December in the third year (so for awards granted in the year under review, the period ends on 31 December 2010):
Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting
Less than RPI + 6% per annum Nil
RPI + 6% per annum (18% over three years) 25%
RPI + 6-11% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100%
RPI + 11% per annum (33% over three years) 100%
The same targets apply to the first half of awards granted in years prior to 2007.
The following targets apply to the remaining one third of each award granted since 2007:
Ranking of the company against the bespoke
comparator group by reference to TSR Proportion of allocation vesting
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
The same targets apply to the second half of each award granted in years prior to 2007, but the ranking applied is that of the company against the
FTSE 100 constituent companies as at the date of the award.
In addition, participants in the PSP will receive a further share award with a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid in
respect of PSP awards vesting at the end of the performance period.
In relation to awards made before 2007, there will only be a transfer of shares under the second half if the growth in EPS of the company has
exceeded the growth in RPI by 10% over a performance period of three financial years.
Furthermore, there will only be a transfer of shares under the final third (or second half in respect of awards made before 2007) if the
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the company’s TSR performance is reflective of the company’s underlying performance. For the 2009
PSP awards, a claw-back provision has been applied so that, in the event of a re-calculation of EPS and/or TSR within the two years of vesting, any
over-payment must be returned.
The Remuneration Committee believes that a combination of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return targets is the most
appropriate performance measure for the performance share plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the company’s performance,
both in terms of underlying financial performance and returns to shareholders.The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have
been achieved by reference to the company’s audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the company’s earnings per
share, whilst TSR ranking will be determined by T owers Perrin whose findings are verified by Alithos.
Awards will not normally vest where an employee ceases to be employed within the group unless cessation of employment is due to death, injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement or following a change of control of, or sale outside the group of, his or her employing company. In these situations,
vesting will occur in the normal course and the performance targets will need to be satisfied pro rata to the time the allocation has been held.
Only a proportion of the award, based on the time which has elapsed from the award date to the end of the last complete month in which the
employee was employed, will vest in these circumstances in most cases. The Remuneration Committee does however retain the ability to allow for
a greater award to vest if it considers it to be appropriate in exceptional circumstances.
The company’s current policy is to use market purchased shares to satisfy performance share plan awards.
The Remuneration Committee believes that continued shareholding by executive directors will strengthen the alignment of their interests with
shareholders’ interests. Accordingly, executive directors of the company will be expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains
made on the vesting of performance share plan awards until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times base salary.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED
38 (c) Performance Share Plan (long-term incentive plan) (continued)
Following a review of the operation of the PSP by the Remuneration Committee including detailed analysis of the current EPS and TSR targets, the
committee was satisfied that both measures and targets remained appropriate for 2009. In addition, the committee also recognised that the current
method of calculating both EPS and TSR introduces inappropriate effects (both positive and negative) of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
outside the control of participants.
In an effort to more closely align the PSP with the underlying performance of the company, the committee plans to remove the impact of currency
movements from the calculation of both EPS and TSR.
In respect of EPS, the committee believes that this is the correct method of calculation because the company’s exposure to currency risk is almost
entirely translational and not transactional. The committee believes that if the impact of currencies is excluded from the EPS calculation, it is
consistent to calculate TSR on a local currency basis so that currency movements do not impact either measure and instead focus on rewarding
superior management performance.
The EPS for 2005, which is the base year for determining the EPS performance for the PSP awards vesting in 2009, is 11.7 pence if calculated on a
constant exchange rate and lower, at 11.1 pence, if calculated on actual exchange rates.
For PSP awards based on EPS performance for the three years to 31 December 2008, vesting in 2009 will be unaffected as a result of the
application of the committee’s adjustment to EPS performance for currency fluctuations over the period. Similarly,TSR-based awards vesting in 2010
and thereafter will be calculated on a local currency basis.
Fees, service contracts and letters of appointment
The chairman’s annual fee is £270,000. The annual fee for the non-executive directors, which is set by the chairman and the executive directors, is
£54,100, with a further £44,550 for the role of deputy chairman, £16,700 for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and
£10,000 for the role of senior independent director. No other fees are paid for membership of the board committees. These fees are subject to
periodic review which takes into account comparative fee levels in other groups of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment for the non-
executive directors.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows:
Nick Buckles 2 June 2004
Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004
Grahame Gibson 6 December 2006
The contracts of Messrs Buckles, Dighton and Gibson are terminable by the company on 12 months’ notice.The contracts are terminable by the executive
directors on 12 months’ notice. There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company
reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice. It is the company’s policy that it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors on
no more than 12 months’ notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements
for the notice period. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements are appropriate and in line with best practice.
The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment. Mr Elliott’s three year term of appointment
began on 1 September 2006. Mr Seligman has been granted a two year extension to his initial three year term of appointment. That extension began
on 1 January 2009. The other non-executive directors were granted three year extensions to their initial letters of appointment, such extensions having
begun on 19 May 2007. All continuing directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
It is the company’s policy that executive directors may each hold not more than one external non-executive appointment and may retain any associated
fees. Mr Buckles is a non-executive director of Arriva plc for which he received fees of £45,000 in the year ended 31 December 2008. Neither of the
other executive directors currently holds an external non-executive appointment.

39 Performance graph
The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company from its first day of listing, 20 July 2004, until
31 December 2008, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth £100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE 100 constituent companies
over the same period. The directors believe this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison given the
size and geographic coverage of the company and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE 100. The graph also compares the
company’s performance over the same period with the bespoke group of companies which is used now for comparative total shareholder return
purposes in the company’s performance share plan. (Until 2007, the FTSE 100 constituent companies were used for this purpose). The values
attributable to the bespoke comparator group companies have been weighted in accordance with the market capitalisation of the companies and spot
exchange rates were used at each of the relevant dates to obtain constant currency.
The peer group currently comprises: Atkins WS, Brambles, Brink’s, Bunzl, Capita, Compass, Garda, G4S, Hays, MITIE, Prosegur, Rentokil Initial, Rexam,
Securitas, Serco and Sodexho.

42 Directors’ pension entitlements
For the period under review, both Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton participated in non-contributory categories of the group’s defined benefit pension
schemes with a normal retirement age of 60. Trevor Dighton accrued pension at a rate of 1/30ths and Nick Buckles accrued pension at a rate of
1/52ths of their final pensionable salaries. An actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable before normal retirement age. Pension can continue to
accrue at the same rates beyond normal retirement age.
For death before retirement a capital sum equal to four times pensionable salary is payable, together with a spouse’s pension of 50% of the member’s
prospective pension at the age of 60 plus a return of any contributions paid prior to the admission to the non-contributory category.
For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of 50% of the member’s pre-commutation pension is payable.
Post retirement pension increases are payable at the rate of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned up to 31 December 1994 and in line with the
increase in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned after that date.
With effect from 6 April 2006, Grahame Gibson opted for enhanced protection and receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his basic
salary.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the 12 months ended 31 December 2008 (all figures are in £’000s):

Notes:
(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year with the exception
of Mr Gibson whose accrual ended on 5 April 2006.
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii) The value of net increase (4) represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that
service terminated at the year-end. It is based on the increase in accrued pension (2) with the exception of Mr Gibson whose accrual ended on 5
April 2006.
(iv) The change in transfer value (5) includes the effect of fluctuations in such value due to factors beyond the control of the company and the
directors, such as stock market movements.
(v) Mr Gibson receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his base salary.
(vi) A large part of the increase in transfer values over the year is due to the assumptions underlying the year end transfer values being different to
those at the start of the year. This is due partly to changing market conditions over the year, in particular falling government bond yields, on which
the transfer values are based. In the case of Messrs Buckles and Gibson, around 70% of the increase in their transfer values is due to changing
assumptions. In Mr Dighton’s case, the corresponding figure is around 40%.

43 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, and the group and parent company financial statements, in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent
company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and the performance of the
group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements
giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
> for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Report of the Directors, Directors’ Remuneration Report and
Corporate Governance Statement which comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
44 We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of G4S plc for the year ended 31 December 2008
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement,
the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 44.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Operating and
Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.We are not required to consider whether
the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF
RECOGNISED INCOME AND EXPENSE
50 1 General information
G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the company (collectively comprising the group) and the group’s
interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year. The nature of the group’s operations and its principal
activities are set out in note 6 and in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 8 to 25.The group operates throughout the world and in a
wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.The group’s financial statements are presented in
sterling, as the group’s primary listing is in the UK. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.The address of
the registered office is given on page 117.
2 Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for
use in the European Union (adopted IFRSs).The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).These are presented on pages 101 to 110.
3 Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis,
except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting polices which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2007 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued
during the current year. Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by £6.9m and PBT has been reduced by £0.7m compared to
the figures published previously. Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7. In addition, the comparative balance
sheet as at 31 December 2007 has been restated to reflect the completion during 2008 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions
made during 2007. Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to £1.1m, with an
equivalent decrease in the reported value of goodwill.The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17.
(b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, determined either by the group’s ownership percentage, or by the
terms of any shareholder agreement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any
deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to
the income statement in the year of acquisition.The cost of acquisition includes the present value of consideration payable in respect of put
options held by minority shareholders.The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the carrying value of the minority
interest are allocated against the interest of the parent, except to the extent that the minority has both a binding obligation and the ability
to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date
of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in
that strategic financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the group’s share of the results
and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the group’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
51 3 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Basis of consolidation (continued)
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity method of
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the
net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the associates in excess of the group’s interest
in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.Where a group company transacts with a joint
venture or associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
(c) Foreign currencies
The financial statements of each of the group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.Transactions in
currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing
at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not
retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their
acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated into sterling
at the average exchange rates for the period (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). Exchange differences arising are
recognised in equity, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the group’s net investment in
foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that
the hedges are deemed to be effective. On disposal translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the
operation is disposed of.
In order to hedge its translation exposure to certain foreign currencies in which more than 1% of the group’s consolidated net operating
assets are denominated, the group utilises derivative financial instruments (see note 3(d) for details of the group’s accounting policies in respect
of such instruments).
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the group’s exposure to
financial risk, not for trading purposes. Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the group’s variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on
the group’s fixed-rate borrowings, and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the group’s results and on the translation of
the group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies, to the extent that these are not matched by foreign currency borrowings.The group
manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, forward foreign
exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.The gain or loss on re-
measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.Where
derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as
described below.
Fair value hedge
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Cash flow hedge
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and
subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the income statement.The ineffective portion of the fair
value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
52 3 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (continued)
Net investment hedge
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and
subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged net investment impacts the income statement.The ineffective portion of the
fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the purchase method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an additional interest from a
minority in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at
the date of exchange. Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or more
frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included within the
net investment in associates. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets
Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.The fair value of
acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the
use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.The directors review
acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Trademarks up to a maximum of five years
Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years
Technology up to a maximum of five years
Other intangible assets – development expenditure
Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group. Such expenditure is
recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its cost can be
measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has
sufficient resources to complete development. In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a
maximum of ten years.The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for
any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets – software
Computer software is capitalised as an intangible asset if such expenditure (both internally generated and externally purchased) creates an
identifiable asset, if its cost can be measured reliably and if it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits. Capitalised computer
software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on software so as to write off the cost
of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of five years.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
53 3 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on
all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated
residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 2%
Short leasehold buildings (under 50 years) over the life of the lease
Equipment and motor vehicles 10% – 33.3%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.The directors
review the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
(g) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through
the use of an allowance account.The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due in accordance with local
conditions and past default experience.
PFI assets
Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or similar project, where the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely
with the purchaser of the associated services, the group’s interest in the asset is classified as a financial asset and included at its discounted
value within trade and other receivables.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments comprise investments in securities, which are classified as held-for-trading.They are initially recognised at cost,
including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the
income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual
basis using the effective interest method.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(h) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in
bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads. Cost is calculated using either the weighted
average or the first-in-first-out method. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to
completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
54 3 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(i) Impairment
The carrying value of the group’s assets, apart from inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of
impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use, where value in use is assessed as the estimated
pre-tax future cash flows deriving from the asset discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows,
the recoverable amount is determined with respect to the cash-generating unit to which the asset attaches.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually through assessing the carrying values of the cash generating units to which the goodwill
attaches. An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-generating unit is allocated first so as to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill
allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying value of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.The amount of the reversal is limited such that the asset’s carrying amount
does not exceed that which would have been determined (after depreciation and amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(j) Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of any
tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.Where repurchased shares are held by an employee benefit trust, they are classified as
treasury shares and presented as a deduction from equity.
(k) Employee benefits
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit
schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those
arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being
carried out at each balance sheet date.The discount rate used is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations.The expected finance income on assets and the finance cost on liabilities
are recognised in the income statement as components of finance income and finance cost respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
in full in the period in which they occur and presented outside the income statement in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested. Otherwise it is amortised on a straight-line basis
over the average period until the benefits vest.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for
unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised
past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Long-term service benefits
The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the present value of the future
benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be
settled directly.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date
of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of
the shares that will eventually vest.The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of
shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique,
adjusted for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
55 3 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(l) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the
amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Items within provisions include loss-making contracts, claims against the group’s captive
insurance businesses, costs of meeting lease requirements on unoccupied properties and restructuring provisions for the costs of a business
reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at
the balance sheet date.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate
discount rate.
( m ) Revenue recognition
Revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of
the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts,VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue for manned security and cash solutions
products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to reflect the period in which the service is provided. Revenue
on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion
method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts
Where significant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for
work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.Variations
in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs
incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.Where it is probable that
total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Construction contracts are recognised on the balance sheet at cost plus profit recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less
progress billings. Balances are not offset.
Government grants
Government grants in respect of items expensed in the income statement are recognised as deductions from the associated expenditure.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over
the lives of the related assets.
Interest
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.This is the rate
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
(n) Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement.
(o) Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after the share of results of associates but before finance income and finance costs. Exceptional items of
particular significance, including restructuring costs, are included within profit from operations but are disclosed separately.

(p) Income taxes
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in
equity.The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or
deductible.The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures,
except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
(q) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments.The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Amounts due from lessees
under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the group’s net investment in the leases. Lease payments made or received
are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of
interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are
incentives to enter into operating leases.
(r) Segment reporting
A segment is a significant component of the group which is subject to risks and rewards distinguishable from those of other segments either by
the nature of the services provided (business segment) or by the economic environment in which it transacts business (geographical segment).
(s) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use.This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is
available for immediate sale in its present condition.The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to
be classified as held for sale.

(t) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are declared. Dividends proposed but not declared are
not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
(u) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations
At the balance sheet date, the following were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 8 Operating Segments will apply to the group from 1 January 2009.This standard supersedes IAS 14 Segment Reporting and will
require the group to adopt the “management approach” to reporting on the financial performance of its operating segments.This standard
introduces some additional disclosures but will not result in a significant change to the group’s existing segmental analysis, which is closely
aligned to management reporting;
• IFRIC 14 IAS19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction will apply to the group from
1 January 2009.This interpretation provides guidance on assessing the limit under IAS 19 on the amount of any surplus that can be
recognised as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding
requirement.This interpretation does not have any impact on the group’s financial statements as any minimum funding requirements in
excess of eventual actual liabilities are recoverable by the group in the form of either refunds or reduced future contributions paid to the
schemes;
• IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of financial statements will apply to the group from 1 January 2009.This revised standard introduces the
concept of “total comprehensive income”, being all changes in equity other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in
their capacity as owners.T otal comprehensive income can be presented either within a single statement or in two statements, the first of
which is the income statement.The group will elect to continue to present an income statement, but the presentation of the statement of
other comprehensive income will differ from the current presentation of the statement of recognised income and expense; and
• IFRS 2 (amendment) Share based payment will apply to the group from 1 January 2009.This amendment clarifies the definition of vesting
conditions in respect of share-based payments, but will have no impact on the group’s presentation of its current share-based payment
schemes.
At 31 December 2008, a number of statements, revisions, amendments and interpretations had been published by the IASB but not yet
endorsed by the EU.The directors anticipate that the only one of these which, if endorsed, would have a material impact on the financial
statements of the group is IFRS 3 (revised) “Business combinations”.
4 Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the reporting period.These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in
some cases, actuarial techniques. Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which
the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most significance to the group are detailed below:
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
58 4 Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions (continued)
Valuation of acquired businesses
The initial accounting for an acquisition involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities as well as the acquisition cost. In some instances, this initial accounting can only be determined provisionally by the end of the period in which
the acquisition is effected because the fair values and/or the cost is not known with full certainty. In such an event, the initial accounting can be
completed using provisional values with any adjustments to those provisional values being completed within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Additionally, in determining the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets, in the absence of market prices for similar assets, valuation techniques
are applied.These techniques use a variety of estimates including projected future results and expected future cash flows, discounted using the
weighted average cost of capital. Furthermore, management make an assessment of the useful economic life of acquired intangible assets upon
recognition. Full details of the fair values of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are presented in note 17.
Assessment of the recoverable amounts in respect of assets tested for impairment
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that
amounts may be impaired.The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash flows from the use
and eventual disposal of the assets. Such an analysis includes an estimation of the future anticipated results and cash flows, annual growth rates and
the appropriate discount rates.The full methodology and results of the group’s impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations
The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries who use the projected unit
credit method for determining the group’s obligations.This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the
appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and
inflation. Full details of the group’s retirement benefit obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are
presented in note 34.

59 6 Business and geographical segments
The group operates in two core product areas: secure solutions and cash solutions.The group operates on a worldwide basis and derives a
substantial proportion of its revenue and PBIT from each of the following geographical regions: Europe (comprising the United Kingdom and
Ireland, and Continental Europe), North America, and New Markets (comprising the Middle East and Gulf States, Latin America and the Caribbean,
Africa, and Asia Pacific).
The current management structure of the group is a combination of product area and geography, within which the larger businesses generally
report by product area.The group’s primary segmentation is therefore by business segment and its secondary segmentation is by geography.

Current year acquisitions (continued)
Adjustments made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reflect their fair value.These include the recognition of customer-related
intangible assets amounting to £180.5m.The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary
valuation exercise.These estimates may be adjusted to reflect any development in the issues to which they relate.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce and the opportunities to obtain new contracts
and develop the business. Neither of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill. Goodwill arising on
acquisition includes £19.1m arising on the acquisition of minority interests.

Adjustments made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reflect their fair value.These include the recognition of customer-related
intangible assets amounting to £41.5m. On completion of the fair value exercise during 2008, adjustments made to the provisional calculation
amounted to £1.1m, with an equivalent decrease in the reported value of goodwill.The comparative balance sheet at 31 December 2007 has been
restated accordingly.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce and the opportunities to obtain new contracts
and develop the business. Neither of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill. Goodwill arising on
acquisition includes £47.5m arising on the acquisition of minority interests.
In the year of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed £171.2m to revenues, £10.0m to PBITA and £(0.3)m to profit for the
part year they were under the group’s ownership. If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2007, group revenue would have been £4,572.2m,
PBITA would have been £321.0m and profit for the year would have been £162.4m.
Post balance sheet acquisitions
A number of acquisitions were effected after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements were authorised for issue, none of which
were individually material. In aggregate, the acquisitions, primarily within Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa, were satisfied by total consideration
of £26.5m.
It is considered impractical to disclose any further information in relation to acquisitions effected after the balance sheet date because the
preliminary assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is in progress.

Included within software is internally generated software with a gross carrying value of £6.7m (2007: £4.7m), and accumulated amortisation of
£0.9m (2007: £2.2m), giving a net book value of £5.8m (2007: £2.5m). During the year, additions amounted to £3.9m (2007: £1.2m) and the
amortisation charge associated to these assets was £0.9m (2007: £0.8m).
Customer-related intangibles comprise the contractual relationship with customers and the customer relationships which meet the criteria for
identification as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS. Customer contracts and relationships recognised upon the acquisition of Securicor plc on
19 July 2004 are considered significant to the group.The carrying amount at 31 December 2008 was £138.6m (2007: £152.3m), and the
amortisation period remaining in respect of these assets is five and a half years.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) which are expected to benefit from that business
combination.The majority of goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004
which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that
amounts may be impaired.The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is finalised and reviewed
post year end.The group’s impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU to its recoverable amount. CGUs are identified on a country
level basis including significant business units, as per the group’s detailed management accounts. Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is
deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations.These calculations
include forecast pre-tax cash flows for a period of five years.The five year cash flow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year (year
one) and the business plans for years two and three, the results of which are reviewed by the board, and projections for years four and five, all of
which reflect past experience as well as future expected market trends. Budgeted and forecast cash flows are based on management’s assessment
of current contract portfolio, contract wins, contract retention and price increases. Cash flows beyond the five year forecast period are projected
into perpetuity at the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in
which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is reduced progressively in the
projections for years four and five. Growth rates across the group’s CGUs range from 0% to 20%, and the into-perpetuity growth rates for the
significant CGUs are disclosed in the table below. Future cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the
group is 11.4% (2007: 11.3%), and the discount rates for the significant CGUs are disclosed in the table below. Pre-tax cash flows discounted using
pre-tax discount rates broadly approximate to post-tax cash flows discounted at post-tax rates.The group rate is adjusted where appropriate to
reflect the different financial risks in each country in which the CGUs operate. Risk-adjusted discount rates applicable to group entities range from
7.7% in Singapore to 71.7% in Madagascar.

19 Intangible assets (continued)
In applying the group’s model, no impairment has been identified and recognised in any of the group’s CGUs for the year ended 31 December
2008 or for the year ended 31 December 2007. Management believe that there is currently no reasonably possible change in the underlying factors
used in the impairment model which would lead to a material impairment of goodwill.
The following CGUs have significant carrying amounts of goodwill:
Discount rate Discount rate Growth rate Growth rate Goodwill Goodwill
2008 2007 2008* 2007* 2008 2007
£m £m
US secure solutions (manned security) 10.1% 11.0% 5.0% 3.0% 388.9 246.6
GSL 11.4% – 5.3% – 256.1 –
UK cash solutions 11.4% 11.3% 5.3% 4.4% 244.5 226.1
Netherlands secure solutions 10.5% 9.9% 3.9% 3.0% 136.6 103.8
UK secure solutions (manned security) 11.4% 11.3% 5.3% 4.4% 122.8 65.7
UK secure solutions (justice services) 11.4% 11.3% 5.3% 4.4% 95.3 105.8
Baltics secure solutions and cash solutions 14.3% 15.8% 3.9% 5.5% 76.1 55.8
Other (all allocated) 740.1 527.5
T otal goodwill 2,060.4 1,331.3
* Growth rate is the long-term into-perpetuity growth rate
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rates and underlying economic growth rates for each
CGU.With all other variables being equal, a 1% increase in the group discount rate from 11.4% to 12.4% with equivalent increases to the discount
rates in all countries would result in a goodwill impairment to the group of £15m, however no impairment would be required to any of the
significant CGUs. A significant increase of 3% in the group discount rate from 11.4% to 14.4%, and an equivalent increase in all countries, would
result in a group impairment of £125m including impairments of £65m to GSL and £26m to Netherlands secure solutions.
A decrease in the underlying growth rate in all countries of 1% would result in a group impairment of £10m, with no impairment required for any
of the significant CGUs. A more dramatic decrease of 3% in growth rate would result in a group impairment of £93m including impairments to
GSL of £40m and to Netherlands secure solutions of £17m.These approximations indicate the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the
underlying assumptions. However, it is highly unlikely that any variations in the assumptions would impact on all CGUs at the same time.

76 21 Investment in joint ventures
At the year end the group owned 59% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Ltd and 50% of the equity in STC (Milton Keynes) Ltd. In both
cases, the group jointly shares operational and financial control over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of the results
of each, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held.The group’s correctional facilities in South Africa are under a similar
arrangement other than that the group’s holding is 20%.
The group’s 100% interest in the equity of Wackenhut Services, Inc (“WSI”), previously classified as a joint venture, is now accounted for as a
subsidiary as the group now exercises sufficient influence over WSI’s operations for it to be so classified.WSI is governed through a proxy
agreement under which the group is excluded from access to certain information relating to its business.
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies. Amounts proportionately

Credit risk on trade receivables
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the group’s customers are both large in number and dispersed
geographically in over 110 countries.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to reflect the different risks within each country in which the group operates.
There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past default
experience.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is as follows:

Included within trade receivables are trade debtors with a carrying amount of £384m (2007: £290m) which are past due at the reporting date for
which no provision has been made as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the group believes that the amounts are still
recoverable.The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2008 that were
overdue for payment was 36% (2007: 39%).The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end was 68 days (2007: 58 days).
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates to their book value.

Amounts receivable under PFI contracts
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts comprise the group’s proportion of amounts receivable in respect of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI)
projects undertaken by the group’s joint ventures. During the year the group acquired a share of Bloemfontein Correctional Contracts (Pty) Ltd
within the acquisition of GSL Global Ltd.The group’s interests under PFI contracts consist primarily of the design, construction, financing and
management of HM Prison and Y oung Offenders Institution Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, for the Home Office; and the Oakhill Secure Training
Centre for young people in Milton Keynes for the Y outh Justices Board.The Bridgend contract commenced in January 1996 and expires in
December 2022.The Milton Keynes contract commenced in June 2003 and expires in June 2028. Both contracts can be terminated by the
customer either in the event of a severe failure to comply with the contract or voluntarily with six months notice and the payment of appropriate
compensation.The specified assets remain the property of the customers.The group’s joint ventures have the right to provide services using the
specified assets during the life of the contracts.There is currently no obligation to acquire or build further assets and any such obligation would be
agreed with the customers as variations to the contracts.The pricing basis is inflation-indexed.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts are pledged as security against borrowings of the group.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise principally short-term money market deposits, current account balances and cash held in ATM machines and at
31 December 2008 bore interest at a weighted average rate of 1.2% (2007: 3.3%).The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because
the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included in excess of 90 group companies at 31 December
2008. It is anticipated that the number of participants in the group will continue to grow. At 31 December 2008 £128.4m (2007: £82.9m) of the
cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were effectively offset for interest purposes within the cash pool.
Cash and cash equivalents of £33.7m (2007: £28.1m) are held by the group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries.Their use is restricted to
the settlement of claims against the group’s captive insurance subsidiaries.

The group’s committed bank borrowings comprise two multicurrency revolving credit facilities totalling £1,087m with a maturity date of June 2012
and a revolving credit facility of £45m maturing March 2010, and the group’s uncommitted facilities amount to £578.0m (2007: £410.9m). At
31 December 2008, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to £350.4m (2007: £427.9m). Interest on all committed bank borrowing
facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and repriced within one year or less.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk.The management of this risk is discussed in note 33.
The group issued fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m (£382.5m) on 1 March 2007.The notes mature in
March 2014 ($100m), March 2017 ($200m), March 2019 ($145m) and March 2022 ($105m).
The group issued further fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$513.5m (£357.1m) and £69m on 15 July 2008.
The notes mature in July 2013 ($65m), July 2015 ($150m), July 2016 (£25m), July 2018 ($224m) and (£44m), and July 2020 ($74.5m).
The committed bank facilities and the loan notes are subject to one financial covenant (net debt to EBITDA ratio) and any non-compliance with
the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity.The group complied with the financial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2008
and the year to 31 December 2007.The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year.

Capital management
The group’s capital management objective is to ensure that the businesses within it can continue and develop as going concerns whilst returns to
stakeholders are maximised.The group believes that these returns are maximised when the group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is
minimised and that this is the case when the group broadly has the characteristics of an investment grade BBB rated entity.The group therefore
aims generally to maintain its net debt expressed as a multiple of cash generated from operations broadly within a range corresponding to those of
BBB rated entities. On 9 March 2009 the group obtained a BBB credit rating from Standard & Poor’s.
The group has a range of return on capital targets in respect of potential acquisitions, depending upon their size. Most proposals for “bolt-on”
acquisitions must demonstrate a post-tax return of at least 12% on the capital investment within three years. Medium-sized acquisitions are
required to return a minimum of 10% within this timeframe and relatively rare, large, strategic acquisitions a minimum equal to the group’s WACC.
The group’s calculation of its post-tax WACC at 31 December 2008 was 8.2%.
The group monitors the financial performance of acquired businesses during the years following acquisition against the return targets. In addition,
the group monitors the Return on Net Assets (RONA) of all its businesses on a monthly basis.The group regards RONA as a measure of
operational performance and therefore calculates it as EBITA divided by net assets excluding goodwill, tax, dividends payable and retirement benefit
obligations.
The group has no current intention to commence a share buy-back plan.The group operates a programme to purchase its own shares on the
market on a regular basis so as to provide a pool of shares from which to satisfy share awards to employees as the awards vest.
The group is not subject to externally-imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the group’s approach to capital management
during the year.
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it. For more details of the group’s bank
overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 29.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows:
31 December 2007 38%
31 March 2008 29%
30 June 2008 24%
30 September 2008 16%
31 December 2008 19%
The availability of undrawn committed facilities during 2008 has been impacted by the deterioration in the value of sterling against the US dollar
and euro, being currencies in which a significant proportion of drawn facilities is denominated.T o reduce re-financing risk, group treasury obtains
finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of finance terminating on a single date.
The group’s committed facilities have the following maturity dates:
March 2010 £45m March 2017 £139m
June 2012 £1,087m July 2018 £200m
July 2013 £45m March 2019 £101m
March 2014 £70m July 2020 £52m
July 2015 £104m March 2022 £73m
July 2016 £25m
Re-financing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major facility at least 18 months before
its termination date.
The group will continue to seek to diversify its sources of finance and reduce further the proportion of bank supplied finance.

Market risk
Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts
The group conducts business in many currencies.Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its
financing activities in local currency. However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to
foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.The group hedges a substantial proportion of its
exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign
currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
The group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge a high proportion of the translation risk not hedged by way of loans.The
group hedges those foreign currencies in which more than 1% of the group’s consolidated net operating assets are denominated, provided there is
a sufficiently liquid and large enough foreign exchange market in which to hedge the currency. Other currencies below the 1% threshold will also
be considered where the cost of hedging is acceptable. Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in equity.The
notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 was £304.8m (2007: £373.2m). All these contracts had
matured by 28 February 2009. All the foreign exchange hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as net investment hedges and
movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
At 31 December 2008, the group’s US dollar, euro, Canadian dollar and Danish krone net assets were approximately 89%, 97%, 86% and 70%
respectively hedged by foreign currency loans and foreign exchange forward contracts (2007: US dollar 98%, euro 90%, Canadian dollar 93% and
Danish krone 83%).
The financial instruments used to hedge the foreign currency translation exposure had a fair value loss of £28.6m at 31 December 2008.
Assuming a 1% depreciation of sterling against each of the hedged currencies, the fair value loss on these instruments would increase by a further
£3.4m.This additional fair value loss would be posted to equity.
Following maturity of the forward foreign exchange contracts in February, the contracts were not renewed.The group is currently assessing its
options with regards to hedging this portion of translation risk.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £134.2m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the second US Private
Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps
Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 29 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits
approved by the directors. Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion
of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years. At 31 December 2008 the nominal value of such contracts
was £246.9m (in respect of US dollar) (2007: £213.5m) and £271.7m (in respect of euro) (2007: £183.6m), their weighted average interest rate was
5.0% (US dollar) (2007: 4.9%) and 3.8% (euro) (2007: 3.8 %), and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a half years. All the interest
rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate
swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed
coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor +
60bps.These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their
fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 was kept at fixed rate.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling. Although the impact of rising interest rates is partly shielded by fixed rate loans
and interest rate swaps which fix a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains. Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates across the
yield curve in each of these currencies and keeping the 31 December 2008 debt position constant throughout 2009, an additional interest charge
of £8.1m would be expected in the 2009 financial year.

Commodity risk and commodity swaps
The group’s principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses. Commodity
swaps and commodity options are frequently used to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility. Commodity
swaps hedging 24 million litres of projected 2009 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2008.
Counterparty credit risk
The group’s strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by
applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the
transaction.The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored. For short-term transactions (under one year),
at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating
agencies. For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A+/A1 from Standard
& Poor’s or Moody’s.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. At 31 December 2008 the
largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were £61.8m and £36.3m and both held with institutions with long term
Standard & Poor’s credit ratings of A+.These exposures represent 40% and 24% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments, with a fair
value gain at the balance sheet date. Both of these banks had significant loans outstanding to the group at 31 December 2008.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of a AA rated bank. At year end,
credit balances of £131.0m were pooled with debit balances of £128.4m, resulting in a net pool balance of £2.6m.There is legal right of set off
under the pooling agreement.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies. Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances,
counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months. Due to the group’s
global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
34 Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices
within the countries concerned.These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer
contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. Contributions made to defined
contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled £95.6m (2007: £57.9m).
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defined
contribution scheme.
Wackenhut Services, Inc (“WSI”) is the administrator of several defined benefit schemes.WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable
deposits to the various defined benefit schemes as determined by independent actuaries. In each instance, the US Department of Energy (“DOE”)
acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.Therefore,
these schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of industry-wide defined benefit schemes which are not valued on an IAS 19 basis as it is not
possible to identify separately the group’s share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities. As a result the schemes are accounted for as defined
contribution schemes. Contributions made to the schemes and charged to the income statement in 2008 totalled £7.3m (2007: £4.7m).The
estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2009 in respect of the
ongoing accrual of benefits is approximately £7.5m assuming consistent exchange rates.

86 34 Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
Defined benefit arrangements
The group operates a number of defined benefit retirement arrangements where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service. In most
cases these are calculated on the basis of final pensionable pay other than for the smallest of the three UK schemes and one scheme in the
Netherlands where they are based on career average pay. Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benefits
accrued to date, based upon actuarial advice.
Under unfunded arrangements, the group does not hold the related assets separate from the group.The amount charged to the income statement
in respect of these arrangements in 2008 totalled £2.3m (2007: £1.8m). Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held
in separate trustee-administered funds.The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method.The group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes.Whilst the group’s primary schemes are in the UK, it also
operates other material schemes in the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and Israel. During 2007, two defined benefit schemes (one in the Netherlands
and one in Israel) were reclassified, for disclosure purposes, into the material funded defined retirement benefit schemes category.

The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for 90% of the net balance sheet liability on material funded defined retirement benefit schemes.
They comprise three arrangements: the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A/S with total membership of approximately
8,000, the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, with total
membership of approximately 20,000 and the GSL scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of
GSL, with total membership of approximately 2,000. Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2007
in respect of the Group 4 scheme, 5 April 2006 in respect of the Securicor scheme and 5 April 2005 in respect of the GSL scheme. Pension
obligations stated in the balance sheet take account of future service and earnings increases, have been updated to 31 December 2008 and use the
valuation methodologies specified in IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes’ obligations.The mortality tables used for
the schemes in the UK are as follows:

The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2009 in respect of
the ongoing accrual of benefits is approximately £20m and it is anticipated that these will remain at a similar level in the medium term subject to
changes in financial conditions. Additional contributions of at least £28m will also be made in 2009 in respect of the deficit in the schemes.
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.The directors consider that it is
appropriate to apply the average of the yields on those AA corporate bonds which most closely approximate to the timescale of the liability profile
of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 6.3%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2008 (5.8% at 31 December
2007).The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax) by
approximately £25m. 34 Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
Liability calculations are also impacted heavily by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.The weighted average life
expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 has been assumed as 20.3 years.The weighted average life expectancy at 65
of a male currently aged 52 has been assumed as 21.1 years.The directors consider, on actuarial advice, these assumptions to be appropriate to the
profile of the membership of the schemes.The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities
(before associated deferred tax) by approximately £42m.
Pension obligations in respect of deferred members increase in line with inflation. Increases in salaries and increases in pensions-in-payment
generally move in line with inflation. Inflation is therefore an important assumption in the calculation of defined retirement benefit liabilities.The
effect of a 0.1% movement in the rate of inflation assumption applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax) by
approximately £14m.

Employee benefits
The provision for employee benefits is in respect of any employee benefits which accrue over the working lives of the employees, typically including
items such as long service awards and termination indemnity schemes.
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued
operations. Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
Claims reserves
The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey, Luxembourg and the US which underwrite part of
the group’s cash solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies.The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review
and are adjusted as appropriate. Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is
uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or
possible claims.
Onerous contracts
The onerous contract provision comprises mainly the provision against future liabilities for loss-making contracts, all properties sub-let at a shortfall
and for long-term idle, leased properties.The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows.Whilst the likelihood of settlement of
these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.

for financial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities (135.0) (75.9)
Deferred tax assets 155.0 84.5
T otal deferred tax position 20.0 8.6
At the balance sheet date, the group has unutilised tax losses of approximately £526.8m (2007: £126.5m) potentially available for offset against
future profits. A deferred tax asset of £7.6m (2007: £5.1m) has been recognised in respect of approximately £22.9m (2007: £19.3m) of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £503.9m (2007: £107.2m) of gross losses due to the unpredictability of
future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax
authorities. Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of £1.6m, £3.2m, £3.2m, £2.0m, £2.0m and £2.7m which will expire in 2009, 2010,
2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £2,727m (2007: £2,504m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences
on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
At the balance sheet date, the group has total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately £4.0m (2007: £39.0m) relating to unresolved
tax issues in various jurisdictions. No provision has been made for these amounts on the basis that the group considers that the likelihood of the
liabilities crystallising is improbable. It is not possible to estimate the timing or outcome of these issues.

vehicles and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of three and a half years.
Certain leased properties have been sub-let by the group. Sub-leases are negotiated on terms consistent with those of the associated property.The
total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received by the group from sub-let properties amount to £37.2m (2007: £16.4m).

96 42 Share-based payments
The group has two types of equity-settled, share-based payment scheme in place: (1) share options previously held by employees over Securicor
plc shares and rolled over to G4S plc shares with the acquisition of that business on 19 July 2004, and (2) conditional allocations of G4S plc shares.
Share options
Share options rolled over from Securicor plc fall under either the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) or the Sharesave Scheme. Options
under the ESOS were granted at market value, vest three or four years following the date of grant (provided that certain non-market performance
conditions are met and that the recipients continue to be employed by the group during the vesting period) and are exercisable up to ten years
following the date of grant. Options under the Inland Revenue-approved Sharesave scheme were granted at a discount of 20% to market value,
vest after three years following the date of grant and remain exercisable for a period of six months following vesting.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 232.94p (2007: 197.85p). All options
outstanding at 31 December 2008 were vested.
No share option expense has been recognised in the income statement during the year as all share options had previously vested (2007: all vested).
Shares allocated conditionally
Shares allocated conditionally fall under either the group’s performance-related bonus scheme or the group’s Performance Share Plan (PSP). Shares
allocated conditionally under the performance-related bonus scheme vest three years following the date of grant provided certain non-market
performance conditions are met.Those allocated under the PSP vest after three years, to the extent that (a) certain non-market performance
conditions are met as to two thirds of the allocation (one half for awards made prior to 2007) and (b) certain market performance conditions are
met as to the remaining third of the allocation (half for awards made prior to 2007).

42 Share-based payments (continued)
Shares allocated conditionally (continued)
Under the PSP , the vesting of two thirds of the shares allocated conditionally (one half for awards made prior to 2007) depends upon T otal
Shareholder Return (a market performance condition) over the vesting year measured against a comparator group. 25% of the allocation vests
upon the group’s T otal Shareholder Return equalling median performance amongst the comparator group.The fair value of the shares allocated
subject to this market performance condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
T otal expenses of £5.0m were recognised in the income statement in the year (2007: £4.1m) in respect of conditional share allocations, the
calculation of which included an estimate of the number of those shares allocated subject to non-market performance conditions that would vest
based upon the probable achievement against the performance conditions.

Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.They have been prepared under the
historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (UK GAAP).
Exemptions
As permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985, the company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements.The
cash flows of the company are included within its consolidated financial statements.
The company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with other members of
the group.
The consolidated financial statements of the group contain financial instrument disclosures and comply with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Consequently the company has taken advantage of certain exemptions in FRS 29 from the requirement to present separate financial instrument
disclosures for the company.
T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over their expected economic life. Short leasehold property (under 50 years) is depreciated over the life of the lease. Equipment
and vehicles are depreciated over periods up to a maximum of ten years.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments, which comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are
indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
• External debtors
Debtors do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.The company provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those
that are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
• Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts
Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts comprise cash balances and call deposits.
• Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the profit and loss account on an
accrual basis using the effective interest method.
• External creditors
Creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at their fair value.
• Amounts owed to/from subsidiary undertakings
Amounts owed to/from subsidiary undertakings bear interest at prevailing market rates.
• Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of the
amount can be made.
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
102 (a) Significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
In accordance with its treasury policy, the company only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the group’s exposure to financial
risk, not for trading purposes. Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the group’s variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the group’s
fixed-rate borrowings, and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the group’s results and on the translation of the group’s net
assets measured in foreign currencies, to the extent that these are not matched by foreign currency borrowings.The company manages these risks
through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, forward foreign exchange contracts and
currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.The gain or loss on remeasurement
to fair value is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.Where derivatives do qualify for
hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below:
• Fair value hedge
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profit
and loss account.
• Cash flow hedge
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and
subsequently recycled to the profit and loss account when the hedged cash flow impacts the profit and loss account.The ineffective portion of
the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Leases
Annual rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Foreign currencies
The financial statements of the company are presented in sterling, its functional currency.Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated
at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are
denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which
are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items
measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the profit
and loss account.
T axation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date. Deferred
tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on
tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered
more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pensions
The company participates in multi-employer pension schemes in the UK, which provide benefits based on final pensionable pay.The company is
unable to identify its share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. In accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits,
the company treats the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognises charges as and when contributions are due to the
scheme. Details of the schemes are included in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.

103 (a) Significant accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments
The company grants equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date
of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of
the shares that will eventually vest.The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares
that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique, adjusted
for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.When share options are exercised the resulting entries are to
increase share capital and share premium for the new shares issued.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are declared. Dividends proposed but not declared are not
recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Financial guarantees
The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group.The company treats
such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment
under the guarantee contracts.
Own shares held by employee benefit trust
Transactions of the company-sponsored employee benefit trust are included in the parent company financial statements. In particular, the trust’s
purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.

Borrowings consist of £646.0m of floating rate bank loans (2007: £687.0m) and £901.9m of fixed rate loan notes (2007: £290.4). Bank overdrafts,
bank loans and loan notes issued in July 2008 are stated at amortised cost.The loan notes issued in March 2007 are stated at amortised cost
recalculated at an effective interest rate current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair value hedge relationship. The directors believe
the fair value of the company’s bank overdrafts, bank loans and the loan notes issued in March 2007, calculated from market prices, approximates to
their book value. US$265m (£184.3m) of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of £60.9m, the fair value of the remaining
notes approximates to their book value.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk.The management of this risk is detailed in note (h).

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
107 (h) Financial risk
Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts
The group conducts business in many currencies.The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject
to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.The company therefore hedges a substantial
portion of the group’s exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge group translation risk not hedged by way of loans. Gains and losses
on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account.The notional value of outstanding forward foreign
exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 was £304.8m (2007: £373.2m). All these contracts had matured by 28 February 2009.
Following maturity of the forward foreign exchange contracts in February, the contracts were not renewed. The company is currently assessing its
options with regards to hedging this portion of translation risk.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £134.2m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the US Private
Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps
Borrowing at floating rates as described in note (e) exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy
limits approved by the directors. Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a
proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years. At 31 December 2008 the nominal
value of such contracts was £246.9m (in respect of US dollar) (2007: £213.5m) and £271.7m (in respect of euro) (2007: £183.6m), their weighted
average interest rate was 5.0% (US dollar) (2007: 4.9%) and 3.8% (euro) (2007: 3.8%), and their weighted average period to maturity was two and
a half years. All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have
been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue of notes in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by
interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting
the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is
Libor + 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the
movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item. The interest on the
US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 was kept at fixed rate.
Counterparty credit risk
The company’s strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by
applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the
transaction.The total mark to market outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored. For short-term transactions (under one year), at
inception of the transaction the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A+/A1 from Standard & Poor’s
or Moody’s.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the company’s relationship banks all of which have a strong investment grade rating. At 31 December 2008 the
largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were £61.8m and £36.3m and both held with institutions with long term
Standard & Poor’s credit ratings of A+. These exposures represent 40% and 24% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the
balance sheet date. Both of these banks had significant loans outstanding to the company at 31 December 2008.
The company participates in the group’s multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an AA rated
bank.There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.

The company is included in a group registration for UK VAT purposes and is therefore jointly and severally liable for all other UK group companies’
unpaid debts in this connection.The liability of the UK group registration at 31 December 2008 totalled £25.8m (2007: £18.2m).

to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting.A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the
meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him. Completion and submission of
the proxy form will not preclude the member from attending and voting at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If a member attends the
meeting in person, the authority of the proxies will be terminated automatically. In order to be valid, forms appointing proxies must be

time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
(d) A copy of this notice has been sent for information only to persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under
section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (“Nominated Persons”).The right to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; it can

a right or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of
voting rights. Nominated Persons should contact the registered member by whom they were nominated in respect of these arrangements.
(e) In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a corporate
shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the

voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions;
and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not
appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those
corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated
corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators

appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (EUI) specifications and must
contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual.The message regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as
to be received by the Company’s agent (ID number – RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of
meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST
Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.The
Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
CONTINUED G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The board of G4S plc considers the resolutions set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting are likely to promote the success of the company and
are in the best interests of its shareholders as a whole.The directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions as they intend
to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
Explanatory notes in relation to certain of the business to be conducted at the AGM are set out below:
1. Authority to Allot Shares (Resolution 8)
Resolution 8 seeks shareholder approval for the directors to be authorised to allot shares. Under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (the
“1985 Act”) the directors are not permitted to allot shares unless authorised to do so by the shareholders.The 1985 Act provides for such
authority to be granted either by the company in general meeting or by the Articles of Association, and in both cases such authority must be
renewed at least every five years. Notwithstanding the statutory provisions, institutional best practice indicates that this authority should be
renewed annually.
At the last AGM of the company held on 29 May 2008, the directors were given authority to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the company
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £106,500,000 representing approximately 33% of the company’s then issued ordinary share capital.This
authority expires at the end of this year’s AGM.
In December 2008, the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) revised its guidelines on directors’ authority to allot shares (in line with
recommendations of the report issued in November 2008 by the Rights Issue Review Group).The ABI’s guidelines previously stated that the
directors’ general authority to allot shares should be limited to an amount equal to one third of the company’s issued share capital.The new
guidelines state that ABI members will permit, and treat as routine, resolutions seeking authority to allot shares representing up to two-thirds
of the company’s issued share capital.The guidelines provide that the extra routine authority (that is the authority to allot shares representing
the additional one-third of the company’s issued share capital) can only be used to allot shares pursuant to a fully pre-emptive rights issue.
In the light of these revised guidelines, the board considers it appropriate that the directors be granted authority to allot shares in the capital of
the company up to a maximum nominal amount of £234,700,000 representing the new guideline limit of approximately two-thirds of the
company’s issued share capital as at 31 March 2009 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting).
Of this amount, 469,400,000 shares (representing approximately one-third of the company’s issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted
pursuant to a rights issue.This power will last until the conclusion of the company’s next AGM in 2010.
The intention of the directors is to allot shares upon the exercise of options granted over Securicor plc shares and rolled over into options over
the company’s shares.The directors do not have any other present intention of exercising this authority.
The company does not hold any treasury shares as such. However, the 5,832,653 shares held within the G4S employee benefit trust and referred
to on page 94 (note 37 to the consolidated financial statements) are accounted for as treasury shares.
2. Increase in Authorised Share Capital (Resolution 9)
Resolution 9 seeks shareholder approval for an increase in the authorised share capital of the company from £500,000,000 to £587,500,000
representing an increase of 17.5%. As discussed in connection with Resolution 8 above, it is proposed that the directors be given authority to
allot shares up to a nominal amount of £234,700,000, in line with the ABI’s revised guidelines on directors’ authority to allot shares. It is therefore
proposed that the company’s authorised share capital be increased so that the company’s unused share capital is in line with the new authority
to allot.

115 3. Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights (Resolution 10)
Resolution 10 seeks shareholder approval to give the directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the company pursuant to the authority
granted under Resolution 8 above for cash without complying with the pre-emption rights in the 1985 Act in certain circumstances. In light of the
new ABI guidelines described in relation to Resolution 8 above, this authority will permit the directors to allot:
(i) shares up to a nominal amount of £234,700,000 (representing approximately two-thirds of the company’s issued share capital) on an offer to
existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis. However, unless the shares are allotted pursuant to a rights issue (rather than an open offer), the
directors may only allot shares up to a nominal amount of £117,350,000 (representing approximately one-third of the company’s issued share
capital) (in each case subject to adjustments for fractional entitlements and overseas shareholders); and
(ii) shares up to a maximum nominal value of £17,600,000, representing approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company as
at 31 March 2009 (the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of Meeting) otherwise than in connection with an offer to
existing shareholders.
4. Purchase of Own Shares (Resolution 11)
Resolution 11 seeks to renew the company’s authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the 1985 Act and the
company’s articles of association.The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to a maximum of 140,000,000 (representing a
little less than 10% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 March 2009 and sets minimum and maximum prices.This authority will
expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2010.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the company’s ordinary shares but will keep the matter under
review, taking into account the financial resources of the company, the company’s share price and future funding opportunities.The authority will be
exercised only if the directors believe that to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders
generally. No shares were purchased pursuant to the equivalent authority granted to the directors at the company’s last AGM.
As at 31 March 2009 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting), there were options over
2,370,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the company representing 0.168% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the authority to
purchase the company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 0.187% of the company’s issued ordinary share capital.
5. Period of Notice for Calling General Meetings (Resolution 12)
Resolution 12 seeks shareholder approval to preserve the company’s ability to hold general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 days’ notice.
The company’s articles of association allow it to hold general meetings other than AGMs on 14 days’ notice and this is in accord with the current
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”).The 2006 Act provisions relating to meetings are however due to be amended with effect
from August 2009 as a result of the UK implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive (the “Directive”). One of the amendments to be
made will, in accordance with the Directive, increase the minimum notice period for listed company general meetings to 21 days, but with an ability
for companies to reduce this period back to 14 days (other than for AGMs) provided that two conditions are met.The first condition is that the
company offers facilities for shareholders to vote by electronic means. It is not yet clear what this will require and the details will be set out in the
final regulations when published.The second condition is that there is an annual resolution of shareholders approving the reduction in the minimum
notice period from 21 days to 14 days.The board is therefore proposing Resolution 12 to approve 14 days as the minimum notice period for all
general meetings of the company other than AGMs.The approval will be effective until the company’s next AGM in 2010, when it is intended that
the approval be renewed.

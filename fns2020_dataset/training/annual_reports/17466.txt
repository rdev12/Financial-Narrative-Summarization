Services
We offer business processing, technology and procurement 
services to international customers across multiple industries.  
We understand the challenges our customers face within 
and across these industries. We provide practical, pragmatic 
and powerful solutions for addressing those challenges.
Business processing 
Our business processing services help our customers release 
time and energy that can be dedicated to the things that 
really make a difference to their business. Everything we do 
is designed to deliver measurable business advantage for our 
customers: to optimise the things that are essential for the 
customer’s business to operate – but essentially peripheral to 
its reason for being in business. Our processing assets and 
expertise are applicable to almost any back office function 
and we have particular domain expertise in Insurance 
Services and Financial Services.
We have particular expertise  
in complex and critical business 
processing services. We have 
unique domain knowledge in 
insurance where we process 
policies and premiums, and 
handle claims, and in financial 
services where we handle 
securities processing, investment 
account and fund administration. 
But we are not limited to those 
industries. From telecoms to 
insurance to retail, our people 
have expertise in optimising
business processes across many 
industry sectors and multiple 
service areas. This expertise is 
underpinned with assets and 
resources to support outsourcing 
needs, including an extensive 
offshoring capability. For 
example, 2011 saw collaborative 
working in our Insurance Services 
business between the teams 
in Gurgaon, Folkestone and 
Chatham to support our Lloyd’s 
and London Market customers.
We take complex business processes and simplify them, applying 
Six Sigma principles along with subject matter expertise to deliver 
BPO best practice.
  The sum of all premiums and claims accounting transactions 
processed by Xchanging in 2011 was over £54 billion;
  Xchanging processed over one million premium transactions  
and nearly 750,000 Lloyd’s claim advices in 2011;
  We use our two banking licences to support the provision  
of financial services to our customers.
Technology
By using technology to make systems and processes work 
more easily in the business, we give executives the freedom 
to work more strategically on the business. So technology 
encumbered businesses become technology-enabled 
businesses. We serve more than 300 customers in the UK, 
support 160 brokers and insurers in the commercial insurance 
market globally, and deliver services and systems to some of 
the UK’s national infrastructures. We do all this through three 
complementary business units and increasingly blend our 
business processing and technology expertise in a flexible 
way to provide bespoke solutions for customers. We also 
offer consumption-based services in response to the need for 
‘everything-as-a-service’ solutions that enable customers to 
achieve a variable cost base.
In Technology, we offer 
infrastructure including network-
managed services, software 
products and application 
management services. We also 
offer IT outsourcing services for 
complete technology needs, 
whether of a department,  
a business unit or an entire 
organisation.
We have functional depth in our 
range of specialist insurance 
software products covering the 
full Property & Casualty life-cycle. 
We build, implement and 
support, as needed, end-to-end 
innovative software solutions, 
applicable to even the most 
complex insurance requirements.
The technology support we provide is often critical to the functioning 
of a customer’s business.
  We support the customers of the first nationwide 4G telephony 
and data network;
  Our technology supports the world’s busiest single runway airport;
  We provide end-to-end technology for the insurance market.
Procurement and Other BPO
We help our customers deliver superior procurement 
performance. Our procurement services encompass the 
complete S2P (Source-to-Pay) process including sourcing 
procured goods and services as well as the administrative 
activities that turn a customer demand into a fulfilled and 
paid-for order.
We source in excess of £1.65 
billion of indirect procurement 
spend on behalf of our 
customers. By leveraging our 
supplier relationships and 
applying our trading expertise 
and buying power, we drive 
savings to our customers’ 
bottom lines. 
With an end-to-end portfolio  
of capabilities from knowledge-
based sourcing and spend 
management through to 
transaction-based P2P (Procure-
to-Pay), we ensure that savings, 
policy compliance and cost 
efficiency benefits are embedded 
in the business.
Our top categories of indirect spend are associated with human 
resources and environment spend and they include contract labour, 
travel, telecoms, facilities, workforce, IT and communication, office 
supplies and marketing and professional services.
  We manage 20% of the UK’s outsourced indirect spend,  
making us the second largest provider in the UK. We are the 
fourth largest in the world;
  We operate a flexible range of commercial structures and are 
willing to link our fees to results delivered;
  Our pan-European, Asian and American presence allows us  
to compete as one of only a handful of truly global players in  
this market. Company

How we do business
Our business model  
is summarised on the 
following spread which

We compete in all our 
markets and sell our 
services by drawing

Report, measuring 
ourselves against our 
performance culture  
and the Key Performance 
Indicators ‘KPIs’ indicated

Our corporate values and 
our people are core to our 
performance. We describe 
these more fully on pages

Domain 
expertise
Although we work across all industries, 
we have particular domain expertise  
in Insurance Services and Financial 
Services. Our relationship with Lloyd’s 
is unique as we run their policies and 
premiums, and claims handling and 
back office systems. We also own 
intellectual property inherent within 
those systems. We have similarly deep 
relationships with the customers 
for whom we undertake securities 
processing, investment account and 
fund administration through our 
operations in Germany, Italy and India. 
The back office expertise concentrated 
here is fully transferable and delivers 
efficiency and savings for customers 
within industries beyond Insurance 
Services and Financial Services. We 
combine functional and technology 
expertise with this deep industry 
domain knowledge in providing 
services for our customers. 
Our key strengths
In building our ability to compete in our markets we  
have redefined our service offerings and our go-to-market 
strategy. We also draw on six key strengths. Company

Xchanging plc Annual report 2011 7
Complex and 
critical processes
In our Insurance Services and 
Technology businesses in particular,  
we specialise in the management of 
complex and critical processes. This 
takes a major burden away from our 
customers and gives them the flexibility 
to concentrate on their strategically 
important priorities.
Our recently renewed contract with the 
London Metal Exchange, for example, 
sees us providing the transaction 
processing technology that underpins 
trading transactions worth about £30 
billion a day. With our support since 
2005, the customer has effectively 
managed a tenfold rise in electronic 
trading volumes – with all the 
additional administration this entails.
Similarly, we have recently 
strengthened our relationship as a 
strategic IT partner for Gatwick Airport, 
providing end user computer services 
as well as network managed services 
for the world’s busiest single runway 
airport. We now have the opportunity 
to further simplify IT administration 
for this customer, having already 
rationalised 140 legacy systems into 
one common infrastructure. We will 
look to offer this competence at 
working in complex areas to an even 
wider range of customers in 2012/13. 8 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
PPI 267
Our key strengths continued
On/near/
offshore
As reflected on page 14 of this Annual 
Report, there is growing demand for 
global sourcing as organisations seek  
to leverage competitive advantage from 
globally distributed talent pools and 
lower cost bases.
We are well placed to serve the 
resulting market opportunity with our 
deep and diverse expertise in lower-
cost offshore centres in India, Malaysia 
and Singapore, and nearshore centres 
in the countries where our customers 
are located. We have strength in 
delivering the right balance of onshore, 
nearshore and offshore resources for 
each individual customer in a flexible 
way – whether that is in a build-
operate-transfer or build-operate-
retain solution. 
Our scalable managed services use 
well-defined risk management and 
project governance methodologies. 
Our rigorous use of metrics and 
documentation underpin both our 
quality assurance and our customers’ 
own compliance and regulatory 
requirements. 
The scale and scope of such activities 
is driven by the international 
organisations we serve: customers 
that require bespoke solutions rather 
than a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Company

Adaptability
We are a flexible organisation.  
This means that, across our businesses, 
we are adaptable in our approach 
and adopt a consultative way of 
working that provides potentially 
bespoke solutions for each individual 
customer. We can offer as little or 
as much of a service as the customer 
needs, and can blend business 
processing and technology into  
a bundled offering that delivers 
enhanced solutions.
We do not operate rigid hierarchies 
and all our customers have access to 
executives throughout the organisation 
– up to and including the Chief 
Executive Officer.
For mid-size organisations in 
particular, this flexibility can provide 
a good cultural fit. It delivers relevant, 
cost-effective and tailored outsourcing 
solutions which would not normally 
be available from bigger 
business processors. 10 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Our key strengths continued
End-to-end 
services
Due to the breadth and depth of our 
expertise, we have the ability to offer 
customers a full, end-to-end service 
across the life cycle of their business. 
We also have the flexibility to offer just 
the right amount of outsourcing that 
they need, for as short or as long a 
period as they need it. 
For example, in Insurance Services, we 
offer software products and business 
processing covering full back office 
functions across the Property & 
Casualty industry. In IT outsourcing we 
can look after small targeted projects 
or manage complete IT needs for an 
entire enterprise.
To an increasing extent, we are also 
combining our business processing and 
technology services to enhance our 
offerings. We can offer this degree of 
flexibility thanks to our full range of 
assets for designing and delivering 
what our customers need at any stage 
of our business relationship.
This end-to-end capability allows a 
much wider range of organisations to 
utilise the full benefits of outsourcing.  Company

These are set out on the inside

We take our values very seriously and 
seek to embed them into everything

Market review
The overall market for business processing and technology 
services continues to offer opportunities. Companies  
in the low growth economies are seeking to reduce  
costs and improve profitability, whilst the market in the 
so-called ‘developing’ economies is showing increasingly 
encouraging signs. 
However decisions on major projects tend to be delayed by the cautious 
economic outlook. A clear trend in all sectors is the move towards ‘Business 
Processing-as-a-Service’ (‘BPaaS’), with providers making available a combined 
offering of business process outsourcing and technology services in a systems 
aggregator role.
Outsourcing market trends
Market advisory firm Everest advises  
that demand for outsourcing will  
remain tentative in the first half of 2012, 
given macro-economic and political 
uncertainty, particularly in the US and 
Europe
1
. However, business confidence 
is expected to return in the second half 
of the year. Scope for growth remains 
for outsourcing providers who take 
advantage of the trends outlined below.
Global sourcing
Analyst firm Ovum notes that customers 
now look for service providers’ ability 
to meet both global and local needs
2
. 
In parallel, customers are increasingly 
seeking to mitigate the risks associated 
with traditional outsourcing 
engagements by keeping some 
accountability and sourcing management 
in-house and allocating responsibility 
for day-to-day operations to trusted 
suppliers. This dual or hybrid approach 
has led to an increase in the number of 
service lines offered by service providers. 
Ovum data shows that on average, 60% 
of Total Contract Value (‘TCV’) has been 
allocated to a single lead supplier in 
multiple-supplier deals signed since 
2009. This trend is set to continue 
in 2012.
Innovation
Suppliers’ innovation initiatives are  
being applied across all parts of the 
outsourcing process. Everest notes that 
the demand for innovation is likely to 
drive a greater push for focused domain 
expertise, which will in turn drive 
investment in the development of new, 
more customer-centric products and 
services. This trend has already been 
picked up by service providers, of which 
over 56% (according to a recent survey
3
) 
plan to invest in new areas of expertise, 
with their main focus on Cloud 
computing. This trend will also lead to 
new entrants who are focused on 
supplying a niche or specialised market 
– a development that balances the move 
in some markets towards vendor 
consolidation.
Cloud computing and Business-
Processing-as-a-Service
Analyst firm Horses for Sources expects 
the uncertain macro-economic climate in 
mature geographies to encourage some 
organisations to look at more radical 
means to reduce cost and improve 
productivity
4
. BPaaS is one such means. 
BPaaS integrates some or all of Cloud 
computing technology, Software-as-a-
Service and Business Process Outsourcing 
(‘BPO’) functionality, allowing suppliers 
to provide business services through a 
(normally shared) consumption model. 
This helps to meet customer needs for 
innovation, flexibility and cost reduction.
Sector developments
Please see right for some of the key 
global trends in our business sectors.
Business Processing 
Insurance Services
Everest forecasts that the Insurance BPO 
market will grow at 12–15% in 2012 
(year-on-year), with tier 2/tier 3 insurers 
driving most of the growth in the 
Property & Casualty segment
1
. Domain 
expertise will remain important for 
customers in their partner selection 
strategy, along with technology 
capability. Many insurance BPO providers 
are increasingly offering technology-
bundled solutions (such as Software- 
as-a-Service) and these solutions will 
become adopted more widely, along 
with technology-enabled transactional 
pricing for BPO.
In addition BPaaS is expected to be a 
developing trend in this sector, where 
the majority of processes are standard, 
high in frequency, administrative and 
able to be commoditised. A future 
challenge for service providers will be 
to develop competences in both this 
area and in the provision of services 
that require contextual input and 
customisation

Financial Services
Financial Services remains the dominant 
industry sector in the outsourcing 
market, and according to market analyst 
firm Elix-IRR, will continue to grow in 
2012 (although growth may not be 
as rapid as previously)
6
. While labour 
cost arbitrage was once the principal 
motivation behind outsourcing, financial 
services institutions are now looking to 
leverage service provider skills in process 
optimisation and technology innovation. 
In addition, the need to avoid large 
capital investment is trending towards 
tactical outsourcing and new operating 
models – such as pay-per-use, Cloud 
computing and technology platforms.
Service providers are also starting to add 
more value to their services by moving 
upstream in the value chain, including 
financial services specific processes, by 
working with the customer to improve 
business performance and add value.
Technology
According to Everest, macro-economic 
uncertainty will cause buyers in 2012 
to focus their ITO spend on a smaller 
number of deals with simpler pricing 
models
1
. Cloud computing will remain 
a strong trend, with new and 
sophisticated solutions leading to 
new hybrid models and integration 
approaches, making Cloud adoption 
more mainstream. In turn this, along 
with other next generation IT such as 
Remote Infrastructure Management 
Outsourcing (RIMO), will drive growth 
in infrastructure outsourcing. 
In industries facing increased regulatory 
requirements, such as insurance and 
financial services, IT spend will be driven 
by risk and compliance. Master data 
management will see growth and the 
agility and flexibility of technology 
solutions will be crucial in 2012
7
. 
Procurement
Procurement continues to be a rapidly 
growing market, with Everest predicting 
20% year-on-year growth in 2012 to 
reach a market size of around USD250 
billion of managed spend
1
. The US is 
the dominant market but growth will 
increase in the UK, Continental Europe 
and Asia Pacific. In the UK market, the 
public sector is expected to see activity 
in line with the stated government 
policy on procurement optimisation.
Buyers are predicted increasingly to take 
an end-to-end approach, concentrating 
on Source-to-Contract (S2C) or Procure-
to-Pay (P2P) rather than discrete 
processes. Supplier activity will mirror 
this, with an increase in the number of 
partnerships and consolidations and a 
trend towards end-to-end Source-to-Pay 
(S2P) vendor capabilities. Technology 
capability will also grow in importance 
as market adoption of Software-as-a-
Service based solutions increases, with 
providers acquiring or partnering to 
obtain this capability.

Chairman’s statement
Xchanging has emerged from a year of considerable activity 
as it has addressed a number of operating and strategic 
issues. It was a year of transition as we started reshaping  
the business to meet the needs of changing markets.
During the year we generated adjusted 
revenues of £650.0 million and adjusted 
operating profit of £43.2 million. Net 
cash at the end of the year increased 
encouragingly to £45.2 million.
Operating progress 
In early 2011, a Four Part Action Plan 
was developed to address a number of 
strategic and operating issues and to 
stabilise the business. 
By the time of the half year results, 
significant progress with the plan had 
been made. Notably, the US workers’ 
compensation business had been sold. 
In addition, the Group’s bank facilities 
had been re-negotiated. These two 
actions provided reassurance to 
customers, investors and employees alike 
and were significant steps enabling the 
business to move forward. 
By the end of the year, significant cost 
reductions had been made, a new sales 
and marketing framework had been 
established and a cultural change 
programme had been launched. 
It was a busy year. Some initial benefits 
have started to show with cost savings 
and improved working capital 
management feeding into better than 
expected operating cash flow.

Strategic progress
In its first decade, pursuing the 
founding strategy based on Enterprise 
Partnerships, Xchanging became firmly 
established, developed depth of 
expertise and a strong customer base. 
However, growth stalled. In 2011, the 
Board re-examined the appropriateness 
of this strategy in the context of an 
evolving and maturing outsourcing 
market. This is described in more detail 
in the Chief Executive Officer’s report. 
The Board also faced up to the need for 
transition from the entrepreneurial 
phase of Xchanging’s development  
to a strategy for sustainable growth. 
As a result, towards the end of the year, 
Xchanging embarked on a highly focused 
drive to re-generate profitable sales 
growth, and this is also described in 
some detail in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s report. The process will 
continue in 2012 and the impact should 
be increasingly visible as we move 
through the year and into 2013.
Board
There have been a number of changes  
to the Executive and Non-executive 
members of the Board. In June, Ken Lever 
was appointed Chief Executive Officer, 
after a period as Acting Chief Executive 
Officer following David Andrews’ 
departure in February 2011. At the same 
time, David Bauernfeind was appointed 
to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. 
In August, Stephen Brenninkmeijer and 
Johannes Maret retired from their 
Non-executive Directorships. In December 
Bill Thomas and I joined the Board as 
Non-executive Directors. On 1 January 
2012, I assumed the role of Chairman, 
following the retirement of Nigel Rich 
from that role on 31 December 2011. 
These changes represent, in part, 
retirement after long service. They  
also reflect the view that, to address 
Xchanging’s challenges and to drive the 
regeneration of profitable growth in the 
next phase of development, the Board 
will benefit from a higher degree of 
industry-specific expertise. I would like 
to thank all the departing Board 
members, and my predecessor Nigel 
Rich in particular, for their dedicated 
service to Xchanging.
People
In a very active year there have been 
many changes at all levels, including 
amongst our leadership. This has been 
unsettling for customers and employees 
alike. Our business is dependent on our 
people, and so it was greatly reassuring 
to learn from the year’s employee 
engagement focus groups of the high 
degree of dedication felt by our people.  
I would like to thank all our employees 
for their loyal determination through this 
difficult period.
Dividend and share price
Xchanging’s share price ended the year at 
significantly less than its value at the start 
of the year. Together with the suspension 
of the dividend, this has not been a 
rewarding year for shareholders. However, 
the Board believes it is taking the right 
measures to address Xchanging’s 
challenges, and that during this 
regeneration phase it remains prudent  
to conserve cash. Resumption of the 
payment of a dividend will be reviewed  
by the Board at the half year 2012. 
Future
Xchanging is now moving out of a 
period of difficult change and into a  
time of renewal. Having stabilised the 
operations in 2011, attention is now 
focused on building our position with 
existing customers, further simplification 
of the business, on generating profitable 
new sales growth and increasing value 
for our shareholders.
Xchanging has a strong customer base 
and a track record of successful business 
processing, much of it in highly complex 
and technology-critical areas. However, 
we are not exploiting the full potential of 
either. We are clear about our mission in 
2012. We will get closer to our customers, 
listen and respond better, and grow our 
existing relationships. We will develop our 
sales and marketing culture so that we 
can take the significant capabilities and 
offerings that exist within the Group to 
the market much more actively. We will 
do this by focusing on a more targeted set 
of primary offerings where we are 
demonstrably competitive.
We understand our markets better, as 
well as the opportunities they offer to 
Xchanging with our particular strengths. 
The reshaping of the Group is well under 
way, driven by a rigorous assessment of 
how best to generate value in each of 
the businesses.
2012 will be the year in which Xchanging 
focuses on proving itself. I joined the 
Group because I believe it has the talent, 
track record and capabilities – much of it 
unsung – as well as the opportunity to 
succeed. Under Ken Lever’s leadership,  
a great deal of progress was achieved in 
2011, and we will continue this rapid 
progress in 2012.

Chairman

Chief Executive Officer’s report
‘ 201 1 has been a 
challenging year and  
a year of progress for 
Xchanging.’
Stopping the bleeding –  
stabilising the business
In the first quarter, it was clear our 
business had stumbled. We had to 
address some key issues. Our workers’ 
compensation claims operation in the 
United States was incurring accelerating 
losses and absorbing cash, our cost base 
was too high, our revenue growth had 
stalled and the cash generation of our 
business was inadequate.
The Four Part Action Plan was launched 
to address these issues. It was designed 
to stop the bleeding and stabilise  
the business:
Part one: Strategic review
We performed a strategic review 
to identify our good businesses and 
those which were underperforming.  
We aimed to unlock value through 
operational improvement, business 
disposal and improvement in the 
economic value of our contract portfolio. 
This resulted in the disposal of our 
loss-making US workers’ compensation 
business and the introduction of a 
number of improvement actions. We 
stabilised our loss-making business in 
Italy, restructured our 76% owned listed 
business in India and facilitated the 
acquisition of the outstanding equity in 
our Broker Services business when Aon 
exercised the put option in the  
Enterprise Partnership. 
We will continue to hone our portfolio of 
businesses to unlock value if we believe 
disposal provides a better opportunity to 
enhance the intrinsic value of the Group. 
We will also examine contract renewals 
diligently and will not renew contracts on 
unprofitable terms even if this involves 
contraction in overall revenue of 
the Group.
Part two: Operational improvements 
and cost reduction
We established a new Executive Board 
structure and a Chief Executive Officer 
Support group. The new Executive Board 
is shown on page 48. It includes the 
business sector heads that have revenue, 
profit and cash flow responsibility and 
accountability together with our Chief 
Financial Officer and our Chief Human 
Resources Officer. 
The Chief Executive Officer Support 
group includes the senior executives with 
functional responsibility for sales and 
marketing, technology, operations, 
implementation, communications, 
corporate and strategic development, 
and legal and corporate governance 
compliance together with the executive 
responsible for the interface with the 
London Insurance market. This structure 
has provided a basis for greater 
collaboration and coordination of 
activities across the Group as well as a 
sharp focus on value creation. Since the 
year end we have appointed 
Subramanian Gopalaratnam as the Head 
of Innovation. He will coordinate the 
development of services and innovative 
ideas around the Group.
We introduced a number of cost cutting 
measures. These resulted in the 
elimination of a number of management 
positions, delivering annualised savings  
in the order of £16 million, of which  
£8 million has benefitted 2011. Savings  Company

will be offset to some extent in 2012 by 
investment in our insurance growth 
strategy and potential expansion into 
Spain. We exited our Head Office and 
relocated the corporate staff into an 
existing, lower cost operational site in 
the City of London. 
We also focused on reducing complexity 
in our business by starting to simplify 
internal company structures and operating 
units, and by eliminating processes and 
methodologies which were burdensome 
for a Group of our size.
We improved our processes for 
forecasting by introducing rolling 
18-month forecasts so that we are more 
aware of developing trends in the 
business and can take corrective action 
as necessary. 
Part three: Revenue growth
The sales and marketing strategy was 
reconfigured. Rather than focusing only 
on developing Enterprise Partnerships 
with large organisations, we chose  
to compete more widely in business 
processing, technology and procurement 
services markets by engaging more 
actively with third party advisers and  
also more aggressively pursuing smaller 
opportunities which we believe will  
grow in time.
Part four: Cash management 
and funding
We successfully re-negotiated our 
banking arrangements with all of 
our existing banks to provide security  
of funding for the foreseeable future. 
Greater focus on investment and better 
management of working capital resulted 
in an improved cash performance.  
The details of the renewed banking 
arrangements are included in the 
Operating and Financial Review.
Getting fit again – building our 
ability to compete effectively  
across the board
As the business stabilised we moved into 
the ‘getting fit’ phase – building our 
ability to compete effectively in our 
markets and to win new business. 
Here we have redefined the strategic 
direction of our business. We have 
clarified our capabilities and our service 
offerings and further developed and 
refreshed the marketing strategy. 
We have reassessed our position in 
our key markets and identified those 
relationships we want to defend 
and those which we believe we can 
grow. We are also focusing on the 
opportunities we believe we can win. 
As a consequence, we have started to 
rebuild our pipeline of opportunities. 
We have also launched an internal 
programme of change management to 
ensure that, as an organisation, we are 
less inward-looking and process-driven 
and more outward-looking and 
customer-focused. This programme is 
aimed at ‘Changing Xchanging’ and  
has a focus on four primary areas –  
see the box above. 
Through this programme we aim to  
have the whole business aligned to the 
challenges ahead of us in 2012. 
A key element of this programme is the 
focus on innovation. We believe that 
inspiring innovation is a key to building 
long-term relationships with our 
customers, helping us to stimulate 
creative change in their businesses and 
so to create value. A great example of 
our approach to innovation was the 
work we performed with YTL during 
2011 in Malaysia, where we supported 
the roll out of the first national 4G 
network and are now supporting the roll 
out of e-learning to 10,000 schools.
Competing to win –  
regenerating growth
So as we move into 2012 we will focus 
on demonstrating our ability to compete 
to win in the markets where we operate. 
We will measure our success in 2012 by 
the momentum which develops from 
our selling effort and the improvement 
in sales and revenue opportunities.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Trading performance
Business Processing Services
Insurance Services has continued to 
sustain steady growth and maintained 
good profitability and cash generation.  
In the UK we saw a steady advance in 
revenue at good margins. Insurance 
Premium Processing and Claims Handling 
continued to be the mainstay of our 
Insurance Services business.
We continued our proactive dialogue 
with Lloyd’s around the Claims 
Transformation Programme. This in due 
course will lead to an increase in choice 
in the market as Lloyd’s no longer 
mandates the processing of claims 
through one service provider. We also 
continue to participate actively in the 
market modernisation programme, 
which should also lead to greater clarity 
around the role of Xchanging in the 
Lloyd’s market in the future.
Our Broker Services business continued 
to progress well and the move to  
100% ownership provides opportunities 
for developing this business further.
In Australia, we successfully renewed the 
workers’ compensation contract with the 
State of Victoria. We also improved the 
financial performance of the contract 
with the State of New South Wales. We 
are planning entry into the US Insurance 
business processing market in 2012.
Financial Services performed satisfactorily 
in Germany but overall financial 
performance was affected by the losses 
in the Italian business, Kedrios. 
In Germany, we saw further expansion  
of our investment account administration 
processing for Independent Financial 
Advisers within Fondsdepot Bank, 
reducing the dependence of that 
business on Allianz Global Investors.  
At Xchanging Transaction Bank, we were 
able to improve margins as a result of 
cost reduction. In Italy we reduced cost 
and improved operating performance  
as we pursued the plan to achieve a 
breakeven position by the end of 2013.
Our near shore facility at Hof in Germany 
and offshore services facilities in India 
continued actively to support Financial 
Services during the year with much of 
the securities processing business and 
the investment account administration 
business being processed in locations.
Technology
The Technology business was 
disappointing. Our investment in 
resources in our Infrastructure 
management services business ahead of 
anticipated revenue growth caused some 
cost recovery issues when the revenue did 
not materialise. However, we continued  
to achieve good results from our major 
customers at the London Metal Exchange, 
Gatwick Airport and Northgate. Actions 
have been taken to reduce cost and to 
improve cost recoverability. The renewal 
of the IT services contract with the 
London Metal Exchange was secured  
at the end of 201 1.
Following on from a strong year in 2010 
our software business only achieved a 
breakeven result as there were no 
additional sales of our newly developing 
insurance application platform. We have 
defined a new go-to-market strategy 
which should lead to a resumption of 
growth in 2012 through a combination 
of conversions from legacy products, 
direct sales and sales through channel 
partners. Annuity maintenance and 
licence fees continued for the other 
insurance software product offerings. 
Actions taken to reduce costs and the 
benefit of the growing relationship with 
YTL in Malaysia have moved the 
Application management business, 
primarily providing application systems 
development and management services, 
into profit.
Procurement and Other BPO Services
This was a transition year for Procurement 
and Other BPO Services. Many of the 
smaller legacy contracts in the UK 
business were renewed and we 
successfully secured the L’Oréal contract 
in Europe and the BAE Systems contract  Company

in the US. These major contract wins have 
provided good momentum for the 
business going into 2012 when it is 
expected these new contracts will 
contribute to profitability. It was 
disappointing that we did not secure the 
renewal of the BAE Systems Human 
Resources contract. We will continue to 
provide services under this contract to 
BAE Systems through 2012 and we will 
actively participate in the migration of the 
service to a new provider. We continue  
to seek new business opportunities in  
HR services.
All our segments are supported by our 
low cost operations in India where we 
have significant depth of expertise. These 
operations saw revenue and profit 
growth as we continued to secure 
incremental accounts and controlled 
costs tightly. We are also seeing 
increasingly encouraging signs of 
growing activity in the local market. 
Recently we have been awarded pilot 
projects in the Indian domestic market 
with L&T Insurance and L&T Financial 
Services. There is much emphasis in this 
business on expanding through proactive 
account management with existing 
customers and growing accounts from 
small beginnings.
Strategic direction
We expect the growth of the Business 
Processing market to continue for some 
time to come (see Market Review on 
page 14). There is no doubt that the 
market is changing. Once the focus  
of very large businesses, outsourced 
business processing and technology 
services are increasingly available to  
lesser sized businesses as developing 
technology makes available ‘everything-
as-a-service’.
As the economies of the developed 
world struggle to show growth we see 
opportunities to provide services that 
enable our customers to reduce their 
cost base through outsourcing and 
innovative management of processes 
and the use of technology. We also see 
the so-called ‘developing’ economies of 
the world offering opportunities for 
growth as new and developing 
businesses seek to secure services 
through a form of service delivery 
framework made available through 
advances in remote and Cloud 
computing technology.
We are aware of the competitiveness  
of the markets in which we operate and 
seek to differentiate our offering through 
technology, our ability to innovate and to 
provide superior service delivery.
The focus of our service offering will be 
procurement services and indirect cost 
reduction; the provision of offshore 
services; Business-Processing-as-a-Service 
(‘BPaaS’), particularly in areas where  
we have industry strength; insurance 
software, complex processing and  
critical technology; and transformation 
services (particularly in the financial 
services market).
Our industry strength remains in 
Insurance Services and Financial Services 
but we operate in a number of other 
industries such as logistics, healthcare, 
manufacturing, real estate and aerospace 
and defence.
‘ We are aware of the competitiveness of the markets in 
which we operate and seek to differentiate our offering 
through technology, our ability to innovate and to 
provide superior service delivery.’
Outlook
We achieved a number of significant 
milestones for the business in 2011 as we 
implemented the Four Part Action Plan. 
Xchanging is on a sound financial footing 
and has made significant progress in the 
reshaping of its business portfolio. I am 
pleased with the progress we have made.
Now that the business is stabilised we 
are building our ability to compete 
effectively in our key markets so that we 
are in a stronger position to win new 
business. 2012 will be the year in which 
we demonstrate our ability to compete 
to win, and as we build momentum, any 
improvement in year-on-year profitability 
will come from the continuing benefit of 
cost savings made in 2011. Our success in 
2012 will be measured by the extent to 
which we turn new sales opportunities 
into contracts to grow profitable revenue 
in 2013 and beyond.

Key performance indicators
Xchanging uses a number of key performance 
indicators (‘KPIs’) to monitor the Group’s performance 
over time in line with its strategy
Adjusted operating 
profit margin %
201 1: 6.6% (2010: 8.2%)
Adjusted cash 
conversion %
201 1: 1 14.8% (2010: 100.9%)
Adjusted operating profit margin 
measures our ongoing performance 
in managing the efficiency and cost 
effectiveness of the business. 
Adjusted operating profit excludes 
exceptional items, acquisition 
related expenses and amortisation 
of intangible assets previously 
unrecognised by an acquired entity.
Monitoring cash conversion ratios 
over time focuses attention on the 
levels of cash generated by the 
business. This in turn enables the 
Group to ensure that it has the 
financial strength to reinvest in the 
development of the business. The 
Group’s cash flow performance is 
measured based on the percentage 
of adjusted operating profit 
converted to adjusted operating cash 
flow. Adjusted operating cash flow 
is calculated as cash generated from 
operations (after adding back the 
cash impact of exceptional items and 
acquisition-related expenses) less net 
capital expenditure (excluding 
pre-contract costs) and dividends  
to non-controlling interests. Company

Return on  
invested capital %
201 1: 18.3% (2010: 22.2%)
Profitability measures alone may  
not provide a detailed understanding  
of performance as it is possible to 
generate good operating margins, 
but poor value for shareholders,  
if assets are not used efficiently. 
Return on invested capital is 
therefore reviewed alongside 
profitability measures to ensure  
there remains a focus on the 
efficient use of the Group’s assets.
Return on invested capital for  
201 1 of 18.3% compares with the 
Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital of 10%. Return on invested 
capital represents adjusted operating 
profit less a tax charge at the Group 
effective rate divided by invested 
capital. Invested capital is defined as 
the Group’s net assets less net cash.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Xchanging maintains risk registers covering each 
significant operation, business sector and the Group. 
We review our risk assessment four times per year, 
which helps to ensure we have a consistent approach 
and focus on the right risks. The Board approves the 
Group risk register annually.
We analyse the nature and extent of risks 
and consider their likelihood and impact, 
both on an inherent and a residual basis, 
after taking into account mitigating 
controls. This allows us to determine  
how we should manage each risk in 
order to achieve our strategic objectives. 
During 2011 we undertook the 
implementation of the Four Part Action 
Plan which was outlined in the 2010 
Annual Report. 
The execution of the plan has led to a  
year of significant change to the structure  
and positioning of the organisation.  
This period of significant change has 
heightened key risks and uncertainties, and 
this is reflected in the risk table presented. 
Continued execution of the plan/activities is 
fundamental for our long-term profitability 
and growth, and as such continues to be 
the key risk facing the business.
How we manage risk
We divide our risks into strategic, 
commercial, operational and financial 
categories: 
  Strategic risks reflect the potential for 
a significant strategic action to have  
a financial impact on the economic 
value of our business.
  Commercial and contracting risks 
reflect the potential to enter into  
a critical contract or commercial 
arrangement which may have an 
adverse impact on the economic 
value of our business.
  Operational risks reflect the potential 
for the failure of a critical process or 
procedure to have an adverse impact 
on the economic value of our business. 
  Financial risks include risks such as 
interest, foreign exchange, tax, 
pension valuations and liquidity. 
Failure to manage these risks could 
negatively impact the economic value 
of our business. 
We define the economic value of our 
business as the net present value of the 
future sustainable after tax operating 
cash flows discounted at the weighted 
average cost of capital. Economic value 
is also intrinsic value. 
Strategic risks
Key risk Commentary and mitigating plan
Successful and timely execution 
of the Four Part Action Plan is 
fundamental to achieving our 
long-term profitability and cash 
generation goals.
Chief Executive Officer’s Report –  
see page 18
Progress against the Four Part Action Plan is fully explained in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s Report. 
Execution risk is addressed through strong central oversight and focus on 
key initiatives including:
  Competing more widely in key markets by engaging more actively with 
third party advisers and pursuing smaller opportunities more aggressively.
  Greater focus upon appropriate investment and improved management 
of working capital.
  Building our ability to compete effectively in our markets to win new 
business.
  Clearly defining the customer relationships we want to defend and those 
which we believe we can grow.
Our reputation and ultimately 
our profitability are reliant on 
successful implementation of 
large-scale partnerships and 
business processing contracts.
Business sector updates – pages 20-21 
and 32-35
Following significant wins with L’Oréal and BAE Systems North America 
there are reputational and financial risks around implementation.
These are mitigated through:
  Detailed implementation plans with strong management control. 
  Standardised procedures in use for the implementation of new contracts.
  Using experienced employees with strong project, change and people 
management skills in order to ensure successful implementation. Company

Failure to retain and grow 
existing businesses.
Business sector updates – pages 20-21 
and 32-3
Our existing business is coming under increasing pressure as the impact of 
the current economic climate and multiple contract renewals impact our 
competitive position.
This is being managed by:
  Investment by senior management in protecting our existing core 
businesses.
  Looking beyond our existing markets, building upon our proven 
capabilities and domain expertise.
  Ensuring the competitive cost advantage from our India operations is 
delivered to the end customer.
  Investment in technological solutions.
  Active engagement with key customers to ensure mutual agreement 
positions are achieved.
  Proactively engaging with third party advisers.
Failure to win new business.
Business sector updates – pages 20-21 
and 32-35
There are a number of significant changes in the sectors we operate in. 
Successfully winning new business is being managed by:
  The development of a unified sales strategy which enables selling across 
business sectors.
  Clearly defined service offerings and sales strategies which help us to 
attract customers.
  Ensuring utilisation of our competitive cost offshore services and 
technological capabilities.
  Proactively engaging with third party advisers.
Identification and management 
of non-profitable businesses.
All businesses are reviewed including a process of intrinsic economic valuation 
analysis in order to ensure non profitable businesses are identified and actions 
taken to address.
We must be able to anticipate 
and manage changes in the 
economic environment, 
including an inflating cost base 
in India.
Chief Executive Officer’s Report –  
see page 18
Following the economic recession there are risks in the economy which are 
likely to remain for the foreseeable future, affecting our ability to secure 
new revenue opportunities and manage margins.
  Offshoring enables us to conduct our processing activities where they are 
most cost effective.
  Proactively researching offshoring sustainability in other locations, and 
expanding our activities in India Tier 3 cities such as Shimoga.
  We operate in markets outside of the EU and US which are less 
susceptible to the economic recession.
  Quarterly 18-month rolling forecasts help us respond to and recognise 
the impact of the changing financial conditions upon our business. 26 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Commercial risks
Key risk Commentary and mitigating plan
We are exposed to material 
new and existing contracts in 
key markets which may have  
a significant impact on the 
Group’s performance. 
Specifically:
1)  The development of, and 
increased competition within, 
the London Insurance Market.
2)  Increased pricing pressures in 
the Financial Services sector.
Our commercial risks continue to be well managed through legal review, 
delegated authorities and contract monitoring processes.
With regards to the specific risks:
  Significant engagement with the Lloyd’s market as it is opens up to 
competition, ensuring that we continue to utilise our significant domain 
expertise in this area in order to establish ourselves as the leading 
provider to the market using our technology platform to drive change.
  Extensive discussions with customers are ongoing to ensure that returns 
from the key contracts meet with the Group’s strategic objectives.
  Further ways to utilise technology and offshoring capabilities are being 
explored in order to further reduce our cost base.
In certain cases, partners have 
rights to ‘put’ their shares to us, 
creating a cash requirement, or 
to ‘call’ our shares for little 
consideration.
Detailed registers enable close monitoring of all key contractual obligations 
with partners. 
Structured service management identifies issues early and triggers  
corrective actions.
Operational risks
Key risk Commentary and mitigating plan
Our customers and partners 
demand efficient processing 
and high levels of service to 
help them achieve their 
objectives and protect their 
reputation. Failure to meet 
their expectation would have  
a significant impact upon our 
reputation and profitability.
How we deliver – page 6
Service levels continue to be consistently on target, as measured by our customers.
  We measure and monitor performance across all functions and focus on being 
responsive to customer needs, which is one of our core values.
  We have a clearly defined operating strategy and target model.
  Our operations focus upon improving efficiency through standardisation, near 
shoring and offshoring.
  Our quality function focuses on improving processes, controls and performance.
Continuing to retain our key 
personnel and recruit new 
talented individuals is key to 
our success.

This includes ensuring we have 
robust succession plans in place 
at Board level.
  New Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director 
for Technology appointed, and succession plans updated.
  Retention plans are in place for key employees, and demonstrated  
during 2011.
  We have an established structure for employee performance and

  A clear recruitment strategy and graduate programme attract high-potential 
employees.
  Significant investment in leadership training programmes underpins our 
succession plans, and develops our employees.
Our service delivery and 
reputation are highly reliant  
on business continuity and 
information security. 
We continue to work with customers to understand their requirements,  
in addition to continuously improving and achieving relevant quality 
certifications to support our internal requirements.
Business disruption, IT system 
issues or security issues could 
result in loss of service, loss or 
compromise of customer and 
internal data, breach of legal 
and regulatory obligations and 
damage to our reputation. 
We focus on continued development of business continuity and disaster 
recovery planning, and testing in conjunction with our customers and suppliers.
Financial risks 
Key risk Commentary and mitigating plan
The Group’s financial results 
may be subject to volatility 
arising from movements in 
interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, taxation rates, pension 
asset and liability valuations 
and liquidity. 
Operating and Financial Review –  
page 28
Our budgeting, forecasting and working capital controls have been 
strengthened through implementing a quarterly 18-month rolling forecast 
process and a weekly rolling cash flow forecast covering a 12-week period.
With these enhancements our financial risks are well managed, reducing 
the volatility of our financial results, giving the Board greater medium-term 
visibility and ensuring we have required credit facilities in place.
In addition:
  Our Group treasury and pension UK operations are controlled centrally. 
  The Treasury Risk Committee (‘TRC’) meets on a regular basis and 
monitors our key financial risk measurements including bank covenant 
projections. 
  The TRC operates in accordance with clearly defined limits, policies and 
procedures authorised by the Board. 
  Regular discussion with the pension trustees, additional contributions to 
the schemes and prudent assumptions for actuarial valuations control our 
pension-related risks. 28 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

Notes:
1  Adjusted revenue excludes exceptional revenue items. In 2011 and 2010, these relate to contract settlements (2011: £1.2 million, 2010: £6.9 million).
2  Adjusted operating profit excludes exceptional items (2011: £31.8 million, 2010: £53.4 million), amortisation of intangible assets previously unrecognised by acquired 
entities (2011: £4.8 million, 2010: £4.7 million) and acquisition-related expenses (2011: £nil, 2010: £1.1 million).
3  Operating cash flow is calculated as cash generated from operations less net capital expenditure (including pre-contract costs) and dividends to non-controlling interests.
4  Adjusted cash conversion is calculated as cash generated from operations, after adding back the cash impact of exceptional items and acquisition-related expenses, less net 
capital expenditure and dividends to non-controlling interests divided by adjusted operating profit (as defined above).
5  Net cash is calculated as cash and cash equivalents less bank loans and overdrafts and finance lease liabilities.
6 Equity free cash flow is calculated as operating cash flow (as defined above) less cash tax and net interest paid.
7 Return on invested capital is adjusted operating profit less a tax charge at the Group’s effective rate, divided by invested capital. Invested capital is calculated as the Group’s 
net assets, less net cash.
As a result, the results and cash flows  
of the discontinued operation have not 
been included in the Group’s analysis of 
continuing operations. All prior year 
comparatives have been restated to 
allow a like-for-like comparison.
The Group’s adjusted KPIs are calculated 
after adding back a number of non-cash 
and acquisition-related items and 
exceptional items, as noted below,  
in order to present the underlying 
performance of the business.
Group performance
Adjusted revenue 
Adjusted revenue from continuing 
operations for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was £650.0 million 
(2010: £681.8 million).
Organic revenue was £604.9 million,  
a decline of 6.9% on a like-for-like basis. 
In 2011, organic revenue excludes £45.2 
million relating to the full year impact  
of acquisitions completed in 2010, 
including Data Integration (‘DI’),  
Kedrios, FondsServiceBank (‘FSB’)  
and SEB Investment service (‘SEB ISG’) 
transactions. In addition, organic 
revenue excludes positive currency 
movements of 0.6%.
The organic decline was driven primarily 
by lower UK procurement revenues, and 
lower revenues in the UK technology 
sector. These are partially offset by 
higher processing volumes in the UK 
insurance business, additional revenues 
in the Australian workers’ compensation 
business and growth in our South East 
Asian technology business.
Statutory revenue from continuing 
operations was £651.2 million (2010: 
£688.7 million). Statutory revenue 
includes exceptional revenue in respect 
of contract settlements recognised in the 
year of £1.2 million (2010: £6.9 million). 
In both years, these settlements arose in 
the Financial Services sector.
Adjusted operating profit 
Adjusted operating profit from 
continuing operations was £43.2 million 
(2010: £56.1 million). On a like-for-like 
basis, adjusted operating profit 
decreased 17.9%, excluding the full 
period impact of the 2010 acquisitions  
of DI (movement of £(2.0) million),  
SEB ISG (movement of £(0.2) million),  
FSB (movement of £1.2 million) and 
Kedrios (movement of £(2.6) million).

Beneficial foreign exchange movements 
in the Euro and the US Dollar have 
broadly offset adverse movements in  
the Indian Rupee.
The organic decline in adjusted operating 
profit was driven by the impact of lower 
revenues, as noted above, on the Group’s 
profitability, further exacerbated by 
incremental investment costs incurred in 
both setting up the US Procurement entity 
following the contract agreed in August 
201 1 with BAE Systems North America, 
and in establishing an insurance presence 
in the US. These adverse variances were 
offset to an extent by improved 
profitability in the Australian workers’ 
compensation business, in the South East 
Asian technology business, and in the 
Indian BPO offshoring businesses.
Statutory operating profit from 
continuing operations increased to £6.6 
million (2010: statutory operating loss of 
£(3.1) million). Statutory operating profit 
includes the following:
  net exceptional costs of £31.8 million 
(2010: £53.4 million), primarily relating 
to restructuring costs (£18.4 million) 
incurred in respect of the Four Part 
Action Plan, to the impairment of 
goodwill, intangibles and other assets 
(£14.6 million) and in respect of 
contract settlements of £1.2 million;
  amortisation of acquired intangibles 
of £4.8 million; and 
  acquisition-related expenses of £nil. 
The table overleaf sets out the 
reconciliation from statutory to adjusted 
operating profit for continuing operations.
Xchanging’s share of adjusted operating 
profit after tax for the year from 
continuing operations was £19.2 million 
(2010: £29.4 million).
Case study
Innovation
The challenge
YTL Telecommunications is the fastest growing  
4G mobile internet with voice provider in Malaysia. 
Whilst impressive, such dynamic growth also creates 
its own challenges in areas including expertise and 
resourcing. With that in mind, the customer was 
keen to find a partner who could help it jointly 
leverage its 4G platform to the full.
The solution
Our contribution spans operations, consulting and 
architecture, implementation, business processing 
and marketing. We act in close partnership with the 
customer across all these areas.
The benefits
Xchanging provides:
  The primary vendor coordination role
  Control of technology management and end user 
change management
  A service that guarantees availability and reliability
  Participation in innovation and architecture forums 
that determine the business and technical roadmap
  Partnership for determining the growth of the 
customer
  Faster monetisation through support for solutions 
rolled out across YTL group companies 30 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Operating and financial review continued
Margins
Adjusted operating profit margin for 
continuing operations was 6.6% (2010: 
8.2%). Margins have decreased by  
160 bps, driven by a decrease in adjusted 
operating profit margins in the 
Technology sector due to lower levels of 
high margin implementation revenue, and 
in the Procurement and Other BPO sector 
due to initial costs incurred following the 
contract signed with BAE Systems North 
America, offset by an increase in margins 
in Financial Services which benefited from 
the impact of cost savings in the year. 
Please refer to the business sector analyses 
for further details.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
When considering EPS, the Group uses 
Xchanging’s share of adjusted profit from 
continuing operations to represent the 
performance of the business. 
On this basis, adjusted basic EPS for  
the period was 8.01 pence (2010:  
12.30 pence). 
For a reconciliation of Xchanging’s share 
of statutory profit after tax to Xchanging’s 
share of adjusted profit after tax, as used 
to determine adjusted EPS, please refer to 
note 1 1 of this Annual Report.
Exceptional items
The Group recorded total exceptional 
items of £36.1 million (2010: £53.4 
million). In 2011, these related to:
  restructuring costs of £18.4 million 
incurred as part of the review of the 
Group’s overall cost base under the 
Four Part Action Plan;
  impairment of goodwill, intangible 
and other assets totalling £14.6 million 
(see section below);
  exceptional income relating to 
contract settlements totalling  
£1.2 million (2010: £6.9 million); and
  exceptional finance costs of  
£4.3 million (2010: £nil) have been 
incurred in respect of the refinancing 
of the Group’s debt facility, dated 
29 July 2011.
Impairments
Following a review of goodwill and other 
intangible and asset balances, impairment 
charges totalling £14.6 million have been 
recorded. These relate to:
  impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets totalling £10.4 million, 
relating to the HR business, reflecting 
the anticipated impact on the business 
following notification received by  
BAE Systems of their intention not  
to renew a significant contract with 
effect from December 2012; and
  £4.2 million impairment of an 
available-for-sale financial asset,  
on the basis that a sustained decline 
in value of the share price of the 
company in which Xchanging had 
invested is not expected to reverse, 
and the investment holds no further 
strategic value to the Group.  
The £4.2 million had previously  
been recognised through reserves, 
but has been recycled to the income 
statement in the current year. 
Discontinued operation
On 1 June 2011, we announced the sale 
of our US workers’ compensation and 
third party administration business (‘US 
BPO’), of Cambridge Integrated Services 
Group Inc (‘CISGI’), to Sedgwick Claims 
Management Services Inc for £13.6 
million. The sale included virtually all 
contracts, assets, employees, current 
liabilities and future service obligations  
of CISGI. This constitutes a discontinued 
operation, and the associated results and 
cash flows have therefore been presented 
separately on the face of the income and

announced that the residue of CISGI 
would be wound down by means of 
voluntary insolvency and put into an 
Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors 
(‘ABC’ process). All remaining assets and 
liabilities were assigned to the  
insolvency trustee.
The results of the discontinued operation 
show a statutory profit of £4.5 million  
for the period (2010: statutory loss of 
£(51.0) million). This includes an 
exceptional release of deferred income  
of £1 1.5 million on a significant contract 
termination, a loss on disposal from the 
ABC process of £(7 .3) million (including 
£3.3 million relating to net exchange losses 
previously charged to reserves and now

Insurance Services external adjusted 
revenue increased 5.1% to £189.0 million 
(2010: £179.8 million), including a 
positive foreign exchange impact of £1.8 
million related mainly to movements in 
the Australian Dollar. Adjusted operating 
profit increased 9.4% to £36.6 million 
(2010: £33.4 million), representing an 
adjusted operating profit margin of 
19.3% (2010: 18.6%), with a £0.3 million 
adverse variance arising due to foreign 
exchange movements (positive 
movements in the Australian Dollar have 
been offset by adverse movements in the 
US Dollar). 
Revenues for the sector increased due  
to a number of factors. The sector 
benefited from an increase in the volume 
of insurance premiums processed by our 
UK insurance businesses in the Lloyd’s 
market. In addition, the UK completed 
delivery of the Electronic Claims File 
project (‘ECF2’). The Australian workers’ 
compensation business benefited from 
both improved performance fees and 
discretionary payments received under 
the terms of their contract with the New 
South Wales state government, and from 
an increase in market share following the 
renewal of the contract with the Victoria 
state government, effective 30 June 
2011. These positive movements were 
slightly mitigated by lower project 
development revenues in both the Broker 
Services and Premium Processing 
businesses. 
The UK insurance entities have once 
again delivered a stable, and profitable, 
result for the year, with increased 
processing volumes mitigating the 
impact on margins of lower development 
revenues. In the Australian business, the 
benefit of incremental revenue has had a 
positive impact at the adjusted operating 
profit level, as performance fees have 
had a direct impact on profitability. 
These movements have been partially 
offset by investments made in the year 
on developing a global insurance 
strategy, and establishing a US presence 
for the Insurance Services sector. During 
the year, the sector incurred £0.9 million 
of exceptional restructuring costs. 
We no longer expect the contract with 
the New South Wales state government 
to be loss-making in 2012, although the 
longer term profitability of this contract 
remains uncertain. Therefore, at the 
current time, no adjustment has been 
made to the carrying value of the 
onerous contract provision recognised  
in 2010 in respect of this contract (AUD4 
million), which will be reassessed when 
the longer term outlook of the contract 
is known with more certainty.

adverse impact of £1.6 million from

On a like-for-like basis, adjusted

Adjusted revenue for the year includes 
£3.9 million of incremental revenue in

the Fondsdepot Bank (‘FdB’) platform in 
2010 as a result of the acquisitions of FSB 
and SEB ISG, and £5.5 million of 
incremental revenue from Kedrios, the 
Italian Enterprise Partnership established 
with SIA-SSB during 2010. 
In our securities processing business, 
Xchanging Transaction Bank (‘XTB’),  
the impact of indexation on key 
contracts has also had a positive impact 
on revenue for the year. The impact of 
this was offset however by contractual 
discounts offered to key customers by 
XTB. In our investment account 
administration business, FdB, a decline  
in overall investment account numbers 
and discounts on contractual prices with 
key customers has also adversely 
impacted revenue.
Overall profitability for the sector was 
impacted by the €3.9 million loss for the 
year generated by Kedrios. Although 
Kedrios has now been stabilised with 
new management and cost control 
measures, the business is still expected  
to remain loss-making during 2012.

Managed IT services
The challenge
As the world’s largest single runway airport, Gatwick is one 
of the busiest public places in the world and part of the UK’s 
Critical National Infrastructure. Following the acquisition of 
Gatwick by Global Infrastructure Partners in 2009, a £1 
billion investment programme was announced. With over 
25,000 users, and a disparate, legacy network with more 
than 300 wireless and over 700 network devices, there was 
a need to create a common IT infrastructure. Reducing the 
carbon footprint was another challenge. In order to make 
Gatwick the airport of choice for passengers and airlines,  
a common infrastructure was needed that was secure, 
scalable, reliable and fast. 
The solution
Xchanging delivered a managed service for wired and 
wireless networks across the airport. A dedicated onsite 
delivery team were put in place as well as 24 hour, 365 day 
monitoring of services. New design principles rationalised ‘kit’ 
and reduced space. Operational and security improvements 
have been made with virtualisation technologies and 
enterprise class monitoring tools. 
The benefits
As Gatwick’s Network Managed Services partner, Xchanging 
created a common infrastructure for the airport which provides 
greater visibility and control over IT. Powerful dashboards 
enabled our customer to gain control and act quickly to 
threats. We were able to improve the carbon efficiency 
through reducing power thus delivering the green IT Gatwick 
required. We delivered secure flexibility through wireless. The 
ultimate goal of improving the passenger experience has been 
addressed by Xchanging, one example being the development 
of mobile check-in desks to reduce queue time for passengers. 
A second contract means that Xchanging also provides the 
airport’s End User Computing Services – a move that enables 
the partnership to work more closely to deliver improved IT 
services to the airport’s customers. 34 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Operating and financial review continued
improvements identified as part of the 
Four Part Action Plan, especially within 
XTB. In the current year, the sector 
incurred £7.8 million of exceptional 
restructuring costs. Restructuring the 
levels of senior management, and 
achieving other sustainable cost savings 
have offset the impact of lower revenue 
on margins for the current year. The 
sector has also benefited from lower 
depreciation charged in the year, due  
to lower levels of capital expenditure 
compared with levels of depreciation  
and amortisation in recent years.

External adjusted revenue for the 
Technology sector was £97.9 million 
(2010: £116.2 million), including 
incremental revenues of £0.1 million 
relating to the 2010 acquisition of DI, 
and an adverse foreign exchange impact 
of £0.2 million. Adjusted operating profit 
was £7.0 million (2010: £17.3 million) 
representing an adjusted operating profit 
margin of 7.2% (2010: 14.9%), including 
an adverse movement of £(2.0) million 
from 2010 acquisitions and an adverse 
foreign exchange impact of £(0.1) million.
A slow start to the year impacted results 
throughout 2011. Revenue contributions 
from new contracts won in 2010 with 
Gatwick Airport Limited and YTL in 
Malaysia, as well as further growth noted 
from contracts with existing customers, 
including the London Metal Exchange, 
were offset by the delayed timing of 
expected revenue from our new 
insurance software product (Xchanging 
Insurance Application Platform, ‘XIAP’).
The decision was taken at the end of 
2010 to exit the IT reseller programme in 
our data centre hosting business. With a 
negligible impact on profitability, and a 
beneficial impact on working capital, the 
decision to exit the reseller programme 
does however account for £12.5 million 
of the decline in organic revenue in the 
current year (2011: c. £3.5 million of 
reseller revenue; 2010: c. £16.0 million). 
Profit for the Technology sector has 
fallen below expectation. Adjusted 
operating profit has been significantly 
impacted not only by the overall 
decline in revenue, but also by the  
mix of revenue recognised in the year. 
Declines in higher margin insurance 
software service revenue have been 
offset to an extent, but by lower 
margin hosting services revenue.  
The profitability of the sector has been 
further impacted by investment in our 
hosting and network services business 
at the start of the year ahead of 
anticipated revenue growth (which  
did not materialise), and by higher 
amortisation charges in the year, in line 
with the incremental investment over 
2010 and 2011 in the Group’s software 
assets, including XIAP.
With the decline in revenue adversely 
impacting the profitability of the 
Technology sector, the cost structure  
was rationalised during the year in order 
to align the cost base with the changes 
in activity level. During the year, the 
sector recognised £3.5 million of 
exceptional restructuring costs. 
Following on from this restructuring 
exercise, the business and management 
layers of the business have been revised 
to support a more flexible sales strategy, 
targeting intermediaries and partnering 
arrangements to develop further growth 
of the business. Further actions have 
been taken to leverage more offshore 
resources, improve resource utilisation, 
clarify the sales offering and refocus the 
sales effort. We are confident that the 
Technology sector can be more 
profitable going forward as a technology 
enabled business. A new Executive 
Director and a new Finance Director  
have been recruited to drive improved 
performance of the Technology business.

which were adversely impacted in the 
current year from the termination of a 
pensions service contract in 2010. New 
contracts with L’Oréal and BAE Systems 
North America contributed £1.4 million 
of revenue in the current year, as these 
contracts are in their start up phases.
Adjusted operating profit was £7 .2 million 
(2010: £1 1.1 million), representing an 
adjusted operating profit margin of 3.9% 
(2010: 5.3%). Operating profit margins 
have been adversely impacted by the 
investment outlay in establishing the US 
Procurement business following the 
contract signed with BAE Systems North 
America in August 201 1, and maturing 
contracts on certain key contracts.  
A further £1.8 million of investment 
expenditure was incurred in developing 
the procurement business in the US in the 
first half of the year. These costs have 
been recognised within Corporate costs 
(refer to the Corporate section below). 
Margins have however benefited from the 
reduction in the lower margin activity 
associated with defence spending, while 
the recent contracts signed with CHEP 
Europe and L’Oréal have both contributed 
to the sector’s profit for the year.
During the year, the sector recognised 
£2.9 million of exceptional  
restructuring costs.
Corporate
Corporate costs for the year totalled 
£19.9 million (2010: £16.9 million). 
Included within the 2011 costs (and 
incremental to the 2010 numbers) is  
£1.8 million of expenditure on specific 
new business opportunities in the US. 
Subsequent to the half year, and 
following the finalisation of the contract 
with BAE Systems North America, these 
costs are now part of the ongoing cost 
base of the new US procurement entity. 
A further £0.8 million within Corporate 
costs relate to employees previously 
considered part of the US BPO 
operations, but retained by Xchanging 
following the business’ sale to Sedgwick, 
and who transferred to form part of the 
Group’s business development team. 
During the second half of the year,  
these employees have either exited the 
business, or have now been allocated 
to sectors (notably Insurance Services) 
and will form part of their sector results 
going forward.
Corporate costs have been impacted in 
the year by costs associated with the exit 
of the Head Office premises, with the 
restructuring of the Group following the 
disposal of the US BPO operations, and 
with incremental investment in sales and 
marketing. The Corporate cost base has, 
however, benefitted from restructuring 
undertaken during the year, with a focus 
on reducing complexity in processes and 
rationalising headcount. Exceptional 
restructuring costs of £3.3 million were 
recognised in the current year. The prior 
year comparatives benefited from the 
release of accruals no longer required.
Net finance cost
Adjusted net finance costs (pre-imputed 
interest on put options of £0.7 million 
(2010: £0.8 million) and pre-exceptional 
finance costs of £4.3 million (2010: £nil)) 
increased from £3.7 million in 2010 to 
£4.1 million in 2011. The increase in net 
finance cost is due to a combination of 
having a higher margin applied to the 
Group’s debt facilities following the 
refinancing in July and re-denominating 
the currency of bank debt from US Dollar 
to Sterling.
£4.3 million of debt refinancing costs were 
written off during the year as the Group 
refinanced its debt facility in July 201 1. Of 
this, £4.0 million of arrangement fees were 
incurred in the year, with £0.3 million 
relating to pre-existing unamortised 
arrangement fees. The fees, which relate 
to arrangement, legal and advisory 
charges have been written off, and have 
been included as exceptional finance costs.
Adjusted cash conversion
The Group delivered a strong 
performance in the year for adjusted 
cash conversion, improving significantly 
to 114.8% (2010: 100.9%). This 
improvement reflects the increased focus 
on cash and cash management instilled 
as part of the Four Part Action Plan 
across the Group.
Cash flow 
Operating cash flow from continuing 
operations was £35.9 million (2010: 
£49.9 million).
Cash generated from continuing 
operations decreased by 23.6% to 
£61.1 million. The year on year decline  
in operational performance has not been 
fully offset by the efforts made to improve 
our management of working capital in 
line with the Four Part Action Plan.
The level of cash generated from 
operations in 2010 was adversely 
impacted by cash outflows in respect of 
the utilisation of previous restructuring 
provisions (outflow of £12.5 million). 
During 2011, £14.9 million of cash was 
spent on restructuring costs as part of 
the rationalisation of the Group’s overall 
cost base.
Dividend payments to non-controlling 
interests were £7.7 million (2010: 
£8.5 million). 
Equity free cash flow for the year was 
£21.3 million (2010: £33.8 million). No 
dividend was declared or paid in relation 
to 2010 (2010: a dividend of £6.6 million 
was paid in respect of 2009). 36 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Operating and financial review continued
Net expenditure on acquisitions in the 
year was £9.7 million (2010: inflow of

to deferred consideration for the 2010 
acquisition of DI, £4.0 million to the 
acquisition of the remaining 50% of 
Xchanging Broking Services Limited from 
AON Limited, and £0.9 million to an 
interim payment of the Fondsdepot Bank

Capital expenditure
Our net capital expenditure for 
continuing operations for the year was 
£17.5 million (2010: £21.6 million), 
representing 2.7% of adjusted revenue 
(2010: 3.2%) and 61.2% of depreciation 
and amortisation, excluding amortisation 
on assets previously unrecognised by an 
acquired entity (2010: 74.7%). In 2011, 
Xchanging invested in further developing 
our Technology sector insurance 
software product XIAP, and progressed 
in building our additional Indian 
processing centre in Shimoga.
Funding, distribution policy  
and dividends
Funding for sustaining investment and 
organic growth is met initially from 
operating cash flow. Our equity free  
cash flow and available debt finance 
determine the funding available for 
acquisitions and distributions.
To ensure that we have sufficient cash to 
fund future growth, it remains prudent 
to conserve cash, and therefore the 
Board has decided not to pay a dividend 
for 2011. Resumption of the payment of 
a dividend will be reviewed by the Board 
at the 2012 Half Year.
Treasury management
All of our treasury activity takes place 
within a formal control framework, 
under policies approved by the Board. 
We monitor compliance with these 
policies and guidelines through regular 
reporting of treasury activities.

A superior procurement 
service
The challenge
For almost a decade, Xchanging had managed car 
fleet procurement for SELEX Galileo. The customer 
then became part of the Finmeccanica Group and 
the vehicle fleet reduced in size dramatically. As fleet 
is a volume-based category, our challenge was to 
deliver comparable savings and service to those 
which the customer had enjoyed under their previous 
procurement contract.
The solution
Skilled negotiation from Xchanging’s trading  
team with manufacturers, dealers and fleet leasing 
companies secured vehicles for the new contract  
at a similar price to the previous one. To ensure that 
the service remained bespoke, an extranet portal  
was built for SELEX Galileo’s employees to obtain 
quotes online, and a unique telephone line was set 
up. This gave employees the opportunity to make an 
informed decision about their next fleet vehicle and 
the convenience of ordering online or over the phone.
The benefits
We ensured that SELEX Galileo remained in the élite 
sector that is usually reserved for fleets in excess of 
1,500 vehicles despite a smaller fleet volume. We 
also kept fleet management trouble-free for the 
customer and removed much of their administrative 
burden. In addition, a saving of more than 10% of 
total spend was delivered.  38 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

Borrowing facilities
On 29 July 2011, the Group successfully 
agreed the refinancing of its term loan 
and revolving credit facilities, and 
extended the maturity for a period of  
four years to August 2015. The revolving 
credit facility remains at £75.0 million.  
The USD26.0 million term loan was 
redenominated into Sterling and increased 
to £20.0 million. At 31 December 2011, 
£20.0 million (2010: USD34.0 million)  
was drawn under the term loan and cash 
drawn under the revolving credit facility 
was £28.0 million (2010: USD45.0 million). 
Bank guarantees of €20.0 million (£16.8 
million) and USD2.7 million (£1.7 million) 
were also drawn against the revolving 
credit facility (2010: £17.1 million).
The Group has a £10.0 million uncommitted 
overdraft facility linked to its UK notional 
cash pooling arrangement. 
In addition to the above facilities, there  
is a working capital facility of INR330.0 
million (£3.9 million) provided to 
Xchanging Technology Services Private 
Limited in India. The amount outstanding 
at the year end date was £2.9 million 
(2010: £nil).
The Group also has non-fund based 
facilities for the provision of bank

million of guarantees had been issued.
During the year the Group repaid all 
bank term loan and working capital 
facilities provided to Cambridge Solutions

We expect to be able to finance our 
current business plans from ongoing 
operations and our committed  
funding facilities.
Borrowing covenants
The Group is subject to covenants, 
representations and warranties 
commonly associated with corporate 
bank debt for its term loan and revolving 
credit facilities.
As at 31 December 2011, there were 
financial covenants associated with  
the committed debt facilities relating to 
leverage, interest cover and debt service. 
The Group was compliant with all  
three covenants:
  the ratio of consolidated borrowings 
to Xchanging’s share of consolidated 
profit before depreciation and 
amortisation (pre-exceptional items) 
must not exceed 2.0 times. As at  
31 December 2011, the ratio was  
1.1 times;
  the ratio of Xchanging’s share of 
consolidated profit before 
depreciation and amortisation 
(pre-exceptional items) to net 
consolidated finance charges must  
not be less than 6.0 times. As at  
31 December 2011, the ratio was  
18.4 times; and
  the ratio of net cash flow to UK cash 
pool debt service must not be less 
than 1.0 times. As at 31 December 
2011, the ratio was 3.0 times.
Levels of borrowing and seasonality
Xchanging operates in a wide range of 
markets and locations and, as a result, 
the seasonality of our borrowing 
requirements is relatively low. Underlying 
cyclicality before capital expenditure is 
driven principally by collections of 
dividends and royalties from Enterprise 
Partnerships and scheduled repayments 
under the term loan facilities. 
During 2011, the lowest level of net  
cash was £6.8 million (2010: net debt 
£(7.0) million).

Cash balances
We invest surplus cash to maximise 
return, within liquidity and counterparty 
credit constraints that have been 
approved by the Board. 
The majority of our wholly owned  
UK entities are included in a notional 
pooling arrangement, to optimise 
liquidity management. We review the 
efficiency of our other cash balances  
on a monthly basis.
The aggregate cash balances in 
Enterprise Partnerships represents 
working capital, accumulated but unpaid 
distributions to the Group and, in the 
case of FdB, customer cash deposits. 
Although subject to timing variances,  
as a general statement we would expect 
the aggregate cash balance to remain 
relatively stable as a high proportion of 
Enterprise Partnerships’ equity free cash 
flow is distributed to the Group. In 2011, 
total distributions from the Enterprise 
Partnerships to the Group exceeded 
their aggregate equity free cash flow 
due to the phasing of licence fee 
collections from XTB.
Approximately £15.1 million of the  
cash balance in Enterprise Partnerships 
at the year end represented accrued  
but unpaid licence fees that are expected 
to be paid to the Group in 2012, and a 
further £9.7 million is expected to be 
paid to the Group in 2012 as dividends in 
respect of 2011 performance. A further 
£11.6 million represented cash placed  
in customer deposit accounts offered  
by FdB for which an equal liability is 
recognised (2010: £10.4 million). The 
remaining cash balances in the Enterprise 
Partnerships represent dividends due  
to non-controlling interests and  
working capital.
Foreign currency translation 
exposure
We do not hedge foreign currency profit 
and loss translation exposures and our 
reported results may therefore be 
affected by currency fluctuations.
Foreign currency transaction 
exposures
We are subject to foreign exchange 
transaction exposure in our Indian 
operations, where revenues are 
generated in Sterling, US Dollars and 
Euros and the cost base is primarily in 
Indian Rupees. The principal transaction 
exposures arising during 2011 included 
Sterling revenue of £23.0 million and US 
Dollar revenue of USD24.5 million. Under 
our foreign exchange risk management 
policy, exposures may be hedged with 
forward foreign exchange contracts 
when the underlying cash flows are 
deemed to be highly probable. Typically, 
we will look to hedge revenue to protect 
operating cash flow and to support the 
planning cycle. Foreign exchange 
contracts hedging revenue against the 
Indian Rupee amounting to £4.8 million 
and USD4.8 million were outstanding at 
the year end (2010: £nil).
Interest rate risk management
The Group reviews its interest rate 
exposure against acceptable risk profiles 
on a periodic basis and may enter into 
interest rate swap agreements in order  
to achieve an acceptable balance of fixed 
and floating rate interest exposure. At  
31 December 2011 all drawn debt was 
subject to floating rate interest. 
Pensions
The Group has three funded Defined 
Benefit Schemes in the UK, all of which 
are closed to new members. The Group 
works closely with the trustees of the 
schemes to manage risk in the schemes 
and, during 2012, will review the 
investment strategy on all three schemes, 
following the completion of the actuarial 
valuation exercises. 
The cash contribution to the UK plans 
(Insurance Services and Technology 
sectors) includes £1.9 million per year in 
respect of recovery plans agreed with the 
trustees on two UK Plans, one in 2008 
and the other in 201 1. Recovery plans are 
agreed on completion of the triennial 
actuarial valuations and therefore new 
recovery plans for two UK schemes that 
currently have valuations underway will be 
put in place during 2012 following 
discussions with trustees. It is expected 
that contributions in respect of the UK 
defined benefit schemes during 2012 will 
be £5.4 million (of which £1.8 million is 
expected to be funded from UK Enterprise 
Partnerships, and the remainder from a 
wholly owned subsidiary) and these 
figures include the anticipated level of 
deficit recovery payments.
Around 60 UK employees are members 
of various BAE Systems defined benefit 
pension schemes; however, the 
contributions made by the Group to the 
BAE Systems schemes can only vary in 
respect of future service contributions 
and are therefore accounted for on a 
defined contribution basis. The Group 
has various indemnities in place with BAE 
Systems and therefore could only be 
exposed to deficits in the BAE Schemes 
in the event that BAE Systems were to 
become insolvent. 
In Financial Services, the Group operates 
various unfunded defined benefit plans, 
the largest of which is supported by a 
Contractual Trust Arrangement (‘CTA’).

Operating and financial review continued Company

the Group seeks to match asset 
movements to changes in the value  
of the liabilities. It is expected that 
contributions in respect of the Financial 
Services defined benefit schemes during 
2012 will be £2.8 million (all of which is 
expected to be funded from Financial 
Services Enterprise Partnerships). 
The Group works closely with the 
trustees of each of the pension plans 
to manage the risks associated with the 
defined benefit pension provision. The 
factors that most affect the value of the 
liabilities are interest rate and longevity, 
and the Group’s sensitivity to these 
particular risks is shown in notes to  
the accounts.
Capital structure
The Group seeks to maintain a strong 
credit profile to aid its ability to partner  
in business and will aim not to exceed 
consolidated borrowings of 2.0 times 
Xchanging’s share of consolidated profit 
before depreciation and amortisation.  
In order to achieve its desired capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders and  
adjust asset holdings to reduce or  
increase debt.
Regulatory capital
Xchanging operates in a number of 
regulatory regimes. The key businesses 
affected by regulatory requirements are 
XTB and FdB, which conduct securities 
processing and retail investment account 
administration in Germany. They both 
maintain full banking licences and are 
regulated under the German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). 
Sufficient regulatory capital must be held 
in these entities to cover the operating 
and credit risks of the business. The 
regulatory capital requirement is based 
on market, operating and credit risk 
factors applied to asset classes. The 
regulatory capital in the business is 
calculated as total equity less total 
intangible assets. There is no obligation 
to set cash aside to meet regulatory 
capital requirements but funding may  
be required from the holding company  
if the required regulatory capital is less 
than the calculated regulatory capital.
No additional regulatory capital was 
contributed to the German banking 
group during 2011.
Components of the Insurance Services 
business are regulated in the United 
Kingdom by the Financial Services 
Authority (‘FSA’). 
Weighted average cost of capital
The Group uses a weighted average cost 
of capital of 10%. 
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate on adjusted 
operating profit from continuing 
operations was 36.3% (2010: 29.2%). 
The cash tax rate on adjusted profit from 
continuing operations was 34.5%  
(2010: 28.7%).
The 2011 rates have been adversely 
affected by losses in Italy and the US, 
where no tax benefit has been 
recognised, by profits arising in overseas 
jurisdictions with higher tax rates and by 
other non-deductible items.
The statutory tax charge and tax rate 
have been distorted by the effect of 
restructuring and by the discontinuance 
of the US BPO business, which have 
been treated as exceptional. Planning  
has been undertaken to mitigate the 
associated cash tax costs.
Non-controlling interests
In 2011, the profit after tax for total 
operations attributable to non-
controlling interests was £4.8 million 
(2010: £7.5 million).
Non-controlling interest calculations  
for the Group’s Enterprise Partnerships 
are dependent upon the individual 
contractual terms. Some define 
adjustments in relation to certain items 
prior to calculating profit share based on 
the percentage share ownerships. These 
may include, for example, adjustments 
for differences between local and 
international accounting standards, and 
adjustments for any discounts or fees 
payable between parties.

Corporate social responsibility
Delivering our business responsibly 
Corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’) is fundamental 
to the way we plan and run our business, and is 
closely aligned with our Values. We divide CSR into 
four categories: people, environment, communities 
and marketplace.
Headcount by sector People
2011 has seen a period of change for  
our people. We are evolving into an 
organisation that is stronger, leaner and 
more focused. In March, a campaign was 
launched to focus our people on this 
change journey and our Four Part Action 
Plan, and in July we launched our new 
Values. These Values reflect what 
Xchanging stands for, what we believe in, 
and most importantly, how we behave.
Our new Values represent six key 
behaviours around: Customer Focus, 
Innovation, Speed and Efficiency, People, 
Excellence and Integrity. All six have been 
chosen because they define what is 
important to us. We recognise that 
changing the way people work requires 
investment and commitment at all levels 
in the organisation. To support this we 
have launched a programme of change 
across our business that is committed to 
delivering a series of projects that move 
us towards closer integration of our 
global business, creating value and 
growing our business and ensuring that 
Xchanging is a place that people want to 
work. These projects are involving our 
people at all levels in the organisation.
Following the 2010 enhancement of our 
performance development review process 
and the increased rigour of objective 
setting, we have continued to invest in 
the development of our people. We have 
developed and launched three bespoke 
Talent Programmes which provide 
focused development for identified 
groups of high potential leaders to 
improve their readiness to succeed in 
larger business leadership roles. The 
programmes include participants from 
across our global businesses and include 
facilitated sessions by faculty from top 
business schools.
We have held employee focus groups 
across all Xchanging locations and 
responded to the feedback in multiple 
ways. We have ensured priority topics 
were included in our change programme, 
and have introduced more regular 
communication at all levels across the 
organisation. We have quarterly global 
webinars hosted by members of the 
Executive Board and each business area 
has a schedule of regular communications 
to their teams. We have regular ‘news 
flashes’ that keep all employees updated 
on activities within the organisation, from 
business changes to corporate social 
responsibility and charity events. Two-
way communication is very important  
to us and we encourage all employees to 
use ‘Ask Xchanging’ which ensures that 
all questions Xchanging people may have 
are answered openly and honestly by the 
leadership team.
Environment
All of our business operations apply 
Xchanging’s environment policy in 
order to minimise the impact on 
the environment.
Xchanging’s most significant 
environmental impacts are: 
  Greenhouse gas emissions  
as a result of our energy use. 
  Greenhouse gas emissions  
from business travel.
  The production of waste  
going to landfill.
  The environmental impact  
of our suppliers.
Our carbon footprint
We have published our carbon footprint 
each year since 2008. In 2011 Xchanging 
saw a reduction of approximately 7%  
or 1,515 tonnes in its carbon footprint 
relative to the previous year on a 
like-for-like basis (ie excluding the 
influence of discontinued operations  
and annual updates to emission factors).

Carbon Disclosure Project (‘CDP’)
Xchanging participates in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project and continues to 
review the most professional approach  
to corporate governance, in respect of 
climate change disclosure practices.
Communities
We support the communities in which 
we operate, with an approach aligned to 
our people value of creating value and 
being empowered to make a difference, 
and our Integrity Value of being 
dependable, responsible and committed 
to being open, transparent, honest and 
direct in all our activities. 
This means that we look to create 
long-term sustainable relationships  
with our communities, and focus on 
projects linked to youth and education. 
For example, our partnership with 
Vinoba Vidyalaya, a school in Shimoga, 
India, has a direct and positive impact  
on the Shimoga community. In 2011, 
Xchanging employees raised £11,972  
for Vinoba Vidyalaya.
Each of our sites supports local charities, 
as well as national partners including 
Children in Need. In 2011, we donated 
our call centre facilities to the BBC and 
over 100 of our employees volunteered 
their time to take calls. 
We are primarily focused on supporting 
youth and education and in 2011 we 
supported 24 charities worldwide. In the 
UK we continued to support our local 
educational charity partners, working 
and meeting the needs of their customers.  
Our Service professionals manage our 
relationships with our customers and  
we invest a considerable amount of time 
obtaining feedback on our service delivery. 
We track this feedback in a consistent and 
measured way. 
Many of our customers have 
sustainability agendas. They are keen to 
reduce their environmental impact and 
to ensure that their business operates in 
a sustainable and ethical manner. 
Xchanging has a part to play here. For 
example, the London Insurance Market 
use the Insurers’ Market Repository in 
support of electronic premium and policy 
submissions, to reduce the use of paper 
by over 90%. This is one example of our 
search for opportunities to reduce 
wasted capacity and lower the energy 
consumed by our customers.
Suppliers
We are committed to working with 
suppliers who respect our ethical and 
environmental standards. As a result,  
we have rolled out an ethical supply 
programme in our UK and German 
operations. We invited our suppliers  
to complete an online survey and sign  
up to our supply policy. The programme 
is based on ethical principles, such as 
environmental protection, anti-
corruption standards, and labour  
and human rights.

CSR programme and overseeing  
its performance.

Leading Edge Programme
The challenge
Succession management is a key factor in building 
corporate confidence – especially in a context of 
rapid and turbulent change. We needed to identify 
and develop a pool of senior talent from across the 
business, ensuring that a wider range of leaders 
were equipped with the capabilities and experience 
required of executive roles.
The solution
We introduced the Leading Edge Programme. 
Participants were selected from across the business 
and each region. A long-term development 
programme was designed to include work with 
business psychologists, experience with a number  
of top business schools, executive coaching and 
opportunities to work with the current Executive 
Board on a range of live, strategically important 
issues. Each element of the programme was 
specifically tailored to meet the carefully identified 
needs of each participant.
Benefits
All participants are committed to robust personal 
development plans; each has a range of new tools 
and techniques to improve their skills in areas like 
influencing, strategy formulation, innovation, leading 
change and organisational transformation, which 
they are applying now and each has contributed to  
a live strategic challenge, sponsored by the Executive 
Board, providing real solutions to current challenges.  46 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

same date) in each case as a result of that change of control,

Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover

Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association contain a qualifying 
third party indemnity provision (as per the Companies 
Act 2006) that provides, for the financial year ended on 
31 December 2011 and as at the date of this document,  
that the Company may pay for Directors’ indemnities out  
of its own assets. The Company has procured directors’  
and officers’ insurance for this purpose.
Share capital
At the date of this report, 239,509,739 ordinary shares of 
5 pence each have been issued, are fully paid up and are

Directors, are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House or from the Company’s website,  
or by writing to the Company Secretary.
There are no general restrictions on the voting rights 
attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares (and the times 
by which proxies must be lodged are specified in the Articles 
of Association) or on the transfer of ordinary shares. No 
person holds ordinary shares in the Company carrying special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company 
is not aware of any agreement between holders of ordinary 
shares that may result in restrictions on voting rights or on 
the transfer of ordinary shares. Unless expressly specified to 
the contrary in the Articles of Association of the Company, 
the Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
The Articles of Association contain provisions governing the 
appointment, retirement and removal of Directors. 
The Articles of Association grant the Company power to 
purchase its own shares subject to specific authority being 
granted by the shareholders. An authority to purchase 
ordinary shares was granted at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) held on 18 May 2011. A resolution to renew this

Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to employment policies which 
follow best practice based on equal opportunities for all 
employees, irrespective of gender, race, nationality, colour, 
disability, marital status, sexual orientation, age or religion. 
All decisions relating to employment practices are objective, 
free from bias and based upon work criteria and individual 
merit. The Group’s policy is to offer appropriate training and  52 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
career development to disabled persons that are, as far as

practice. In the event of a member of staff becoming 
disabled, the Group makes every effort to continue 
employment, arrange appropriate retraining and offer 
opportunities for promotion.
Policy on payment of creditors
The Company aims to pay suppliers in accordance with the 
suppliers’ contract terms. The Company had an average of 
31 days purchases outstanding (2010: 41 days) in trade 
payables in 2011.
Policy on financial instruments
The policy with respect to financial instruments is covered in 
the accounting policy xvii at note 2 on page 74 and note 36 
to the financial statements.
Independent auditors
A resolution will be proposed at the 2012 AGM to reappoint 
our current auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’), 
for 2012 and also to allow the Board to set their 
remuneration. The Board is satisfied that the external 
auditors remain independent and PwC have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’). Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Parent Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing  
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently.
  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
  State whether applicable IFRS, as adopted by the EU,  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in the Board of Directors, on pages 46 and 47, confirm that, 
to the best of each person’s knowledge and belief:
  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit/(loss) of the 
Group and the Company.
  The Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report 
include a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Group’s website, www.xchanging.com. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the 
Company at the date when the report was approved:
  So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware.
  Each of the Directors has taken all the steps he/she ought 
to have taken individually as a Director in order to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
Corporate governance
Details relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code for the financial year are given 
in the Corporate Governance Report.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity position of the 
Group for the period ending 30 June 2013. The cash flows 
of the Group have been assessed against the Group’s 
available sources of finance on a monthly basis to determine 
the minimum and maximum expected levels of headroom. 
Based on this analysis and an assessment of the potential 
cash risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 
34 Leadenhall Street, London, EC3A 1AX at 10.00 am on 
Wednesday 16 May 2012. The notice convening the meeting, 
together with details of the business to be considered and 
explanatory notes for each resolution, is distributed separately 
to shareholders. It is also available on the Group’s website.

Corporate governance report
Xchanging plc and its subsidiaries (‘Xchanging’) remain 
committed to the principles of corporate governance 
applying to UK companies with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The Code is published by the 
Financial Reporting Council and is available from its website 
(www.frc.org.uk). 
Throughout the year, the Board has complied with the Code 
in all respects, except whilst Nigel Rich assumed the role of 
Executive Chairman, during which period there was not a 
written division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer agreed by the Board (A.2.1). As 
Stephen Brenninkmeijer was determined by the Board to be 
non-independent, the Remuneration Committee did not 
comply with the Code requirement of having at least three 
independent Non-executive Directors (D.2.1). On Stephen 
Brenninkmeijer’s resignation from the Board on 31 August 
2011 and Michel Paulin’s appointment to the Remuneration 
Committee in September, the Company became compliant 
with D.2.1 of the Code. On the appointment of Geoff Unwin 
his Terms of Appointment did not comply with D.1.3 of the 
Code. Further details of these instances of non-compliance 
are set out in the relevant sections of the Corporate 
Governance Report and Remuneration Report.
As at the date of this report Xchanging is compliant with the 
Code save in relation to D.1.3 of the Code.
The Board considers that this statement provides the 
information necessary to enable shareholders to evaluate 
how Xchanging has applied the principles of the Code 
during the year ending on 31 December 2011.
The Board
The Board currently comprises a Non-executive Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and four further Non-executive 
Directors who together have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Group.
Responsibilities
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for 
creating and sustaining shareholder value through the 
management of the Group’s businesses, and the long-term 
success of the Group. It sets the Group’s strategic plan and 
budgets, monitors their implementation and, with the 
assistance of the Audit Committee, ensures that executive 
management maintain a system of internal operational, 
financial and regulatory controls that identify and manage 
appropriately the risks set out on pages 24 to 27.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision, including:
  The approval of half-year and full-year financial statements.
  Significant changes in accounting policy and practice.
  The appointment or removal of Directors or the Company 
Secretary.
  Changes to the Group’s capital structure.
  Any significant investments, contracts, acquisitions, 
mergers and disposals.
These Reserved Matters were last reviewed by the Board on 
28 February 2012. Other specific responsibilities are 
delegated to the Board Committees, which operate within 
clearly defined terms of reference.
Full details of the schedule of Reserved Matters for the Board 
and the responsibilities delegated to the Board Committees

Board composition and structure
From 1 January 2011 to 9 February 2011, the roles of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer were clearly 
segregated, and the division of responsibilities between the 
two roles was set out in writing and approved by the Board. 
The resignation of David Andrews on 9 February 2011  
was unforeseen and resulted in the Company not being 
compliant with provision A.2.1 of the Code. Nigel Rich 
undertook the role of Executive Chairman, supporting 
Kenneth Lever as he took on the role of Acting Chief 
Executive Officer in addition to Chief Financial Officer.  
This was a temporary arrangement, designed to facilitate 
clear leadership while ensuring that no one individual had 
unfettered powers of decision. The Board deemed such 
measures necessary for the successful stewardship of the 
Company during this period and that extraordinary measures 
were justified in order to provide the Company with clear 
leadership in challenging circumstances.
On 7 June 2011, the Board, acting upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, appointed 
Kenneth Lever as Chief Executive Officer, and David 
Bauernfeind as Chief Financial Officer. At this point, Nigel 
Rich resumed his previous role as Non-executive Chairman. 
From this point onward the roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer have been clearly segregated in line with 
best practice as set out in the Code and the Company has 
been compliant with provision A.2.1.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, and 
ensuring its effectiveness. The agenda is set by collaboration 
between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Company Secretary. The Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director are available to shareholders, should 
they have concerns which contact through the usual channels 
has failed to resolve or is otherwise inappropriate. For further 
information about communication between the Board and 
shareholders, please refer to communication with shareholders 
on page 59.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for running 
Xchanging’s business, and providing strategic leadership  
to the Group, in consultation with the Board.
David Bauernfeind was appointed to the role of Chief 
Financial Officer following a search facilitated by the Chief 
Human Resources Officer and third party consultants, and 
was awarded the role based on merit, against objective 
criteria determined by the Nomination Committee, and  
with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, 
including gender.
On 23 August 2011, Stephen Brenninkmeijer and Johannes 
Maret each notified the Board of their independent decisions 
to retire from the Board, effective on 31 August 2011. While 
the contribution of both will be missed, each felt that it was 
an appropriate time to pursue other interests. The Nomination 
Committee undertook to evaluate the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge on the Board and, 
in the light of this evaluation, prepared descriptions of the role 
and capabilities required for two additional Non-executive 
Directors to join the Board. In addition, following a period  
of acting as Executive Chairman during the first half of 2011, 
Nigel Rich indicated his willingness to step down in the event 
that an appropriate candidate for the role of Chairman 
became available, and the Nomination Committee prepared 
an appropriate job description accordingly. 
On 1 November 2011, the Board announced that 
Geoff Unwin would join as a Non-executive Director  
on 1 December 2011, and would become Chairman on 
1 January 2012, on the retirement of Nigel Rich from the 
Board. Further, on 7 November 2011, the Board announced 
that Bill Thomas would join on 1 December 2011, as a 
Non-executive Director.
The Board reviewed the independence of all Non-executive 
Directors at its meeting on 13 December 2011, and 
determined that they are all independent for the financial 
year commencing on 1 January 2012. Although the terms of 
Geoff Unwin’s remuneration are not compliant with D.1.3 of 
the Code (as further outlined in the Remuneration Report), 
after careful consideration the Board determined that upon 
his appointment as Chairman Geoff Unwin was considered 
to be independent because the non-compliant remuneration 
arrangements will not affect his judgement and character.
Directors’ induction, training and development
The Board has a full induction programme for all new 
Directors, covering their duties and responsibilities as 
Directors. On 7 June 2011, David Bauernfeind was promoted 
to Chief Financial Officer from his previous role as Chief 
Operating Officer and Commercial Director of the Xchanging 
UK Region, and underwent a full induction programme to 
equip him for a role as a Director of a UK main market listed 
company, which included meeting with advisers and 
attending training on directors’ duties by our advisers. In 
addition, Geoff Unwin and Bill Thomas joined the Board on 
1 December 2011, and a full induction programme has 
commenced and will continue during the first quarter of 
2012. The programme includes meetings with the principal 
business heads and management teams in each of the 
business sectors. Each newly appointed Director has access 
to the Company Secretary’s assistance both in orientation 
and guidance around the Xchanging Group, in addition to 
the exposure gained at regular Board meetings.
All Directors receive ongoing legal and regulatory updates to 
improve their knowledge and enable them to discharge their 
duties. During 2011, with the impact of the UK Bribery Act 
2010 and the new UK Corporate Governance Code, specific 
briefings were held during Board meetings.
Formal papers are circulated to the Directors before each 
Board meeting, which enable them to make an informed 
decision on the issues under consideration. In addition to 
formal Board meetings, during 2011 the Chairman 
maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer to discuss specific issues, which 
was extended during his period as Executive Chairman.  
The Company Secretary acts as an adviser to the Board on 
matters concerning governance and ensures compliance with

Board procedures. All Directors have access to his advice and 
during 2011 this was sought from time-to-time. Directors 
may also take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. In the event that any Director has 
concerns which cannot be resolved within the Board forum 
about the running of the Company, or a proposed action, 
such concerns may be reflected in the Board minutes. 
Minutes of each Board meeting are circulated by the 
Company Secretary following the meeting to allow such 
comments to be raised. 
Directors’ interests
Under Xchanging’s Articles of Association, the Board may 
authorise any actual or potential conflicts of interest for 
Directors. Each Director provides the Company Secretary with 
information regarding any actual or potential interests that may 
conflict with those of Xchanging, such as other directorships, 
and any other potential interests that each thinks may cause a 
conflict requiring prior Board authorisation on an annual basis. 
If the circumstances of any of these disclosed interests change, 
the relevant Director is required to update the Company 
Secretary promptly.
The register setting out each Director’s current disclosures 
(where relevant) was last reviewed and approved by the 
Board at its meeting on 13 December 2011. In each such 
situation, the Director under consideration did not vote on 
the matter. The Board will continue to review the register  
of interests regularly to ensure the authorisations, and any 
conditions attached to them, are appropriate for the relevant 
matter to remain authorised. The Company Secretary 
maintains a list of all authorisations granted to Directors, 
setting out the date of authorisation and its expiry, scope 
and any limitations imposed.
Board performance evaluation
Each year the Board undertakes an evaluation process in 
respect of itself and its Committees, under the leadership of 
Nigel Rich, the Chairman until 31 December 2011. Given the 
significant Board changes in the second half of 2011, the 
Board determined, as in previous years, to conduct an 
internal evaluation comprising the following steps:
  A questionnaire based on the provisions of the Code  
was circulated to all Board and Committee members.
  Each Director discussed their responses to the 
questionnaire with the Company Secretary, together with 
any other general issues that each Director wished to raise 
regarding the operation of the Board and the 
Committees.
  The Company Secretary met with the Chairman to discuss 
the results of the questionnaire and other feedback from 
the Directors.
  The Company Secretary prepared a briefing note for the 
Board setting out the principal issues raised and suggesting 
appropriate action points. 
The principal issues raised in the 2011 performance 
evaluation were discussed at the 13 December 2011 Board 
meeting. The Board concluded that the Board and its 
Committees continue to operate effectively, but action  
will be taken to address any identified issues in 2012. 
On 13 December 2011, Nigel Rich and Geoff Unwin conducted 
the performance review of Kenneth Lever, taking into account 
the views of the other Directors. Given the departure of Nigel 
Rich on 31 December 2011, no performance review of the 
departing Chairman was carried out. The performance of the 
Non-executive Directors during 2011 was reviewed by Nigel 
Rich, taking into account the views of the other Directors. 
Election and re-appointment of Directors
Under the Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) at intervals 
of no more than three years. At its meeting on 13 December 
2011, the Board agreed that all Directors should seek re-
election at the 2012 AGM. Each of Kenneth Lever, Dennis 
Millard, Michel Paulin and Pat O’Driscoll will, therefore, retire 
and seek re-election at the 2012 AGM. In addition, David 
Bauernfeind, Geoff Unwin and Bill Thomas will be put forward 
separately for their initial election to the Board by the 
shareholders. The Board believes that each of the Directors 
makes a valuable contribution to Xchanging, and supports 
their re-election or initial election in each case. 
 
All Non-executive Directors have three year appointments, 
save for Geoff Unwin who has a four year appointment from 
1 December 2011. All Non-executive Director appointments 
may be terminated by either party upon three months’ (or in 
the case of Geoff Unwin, six months’) written notice, or by 
shareholder vote at the AGM. 
The Non-executive Directors do not have any entitlement to 
compensation if their office is terminated. Full details of the 
Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors can be found 
on page 66 of the Remuneration Report.
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Nomination, Remuneration 
and Corporate Social Responsibility Committees, each of which 
works from terms of reference which are reviewed annually 
and are available on the website: www.xchanging.com. The 
terms of reference for each Committee were last approved by 
the Board at the 28 February 2012 meeting. The minutes of 
the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committee meetings 
are sent to all Directors and oral updates are given at Board 
meetings. Details of the Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee are set out on pages 44 to 45.

In addition to the Audit Committee members, the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Company 
Secretary, Group Financial Controller and Head of Internal 
Audit were also invited to be present at the meetings.
Key areas of responsibility
  Monitoring the integrity of the Company’s financial 
statements, together with any announcement relating to 
financial performance, and reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements within them.
  Monitoring the risks and associated controls over financial 
reporting processes, including the consolidation process.
  Reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls, and 
reviewing the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems as discussed in internal control and 
risk management on page 58.
  Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal 
audit team, including management’s responsiveness to 
the findings and recommendations of internal audit.
  Making recommendations to the Board or the 
shareholders (as appropriate) in respect of the 
appointment of the external auditors, and approving  
the external auditors’ remuneration and terms of 
engagement.
  Reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity, and the effectiveness  
of the audit process in light of relevant regulatory 
requirements.
  Developing and implementing policy on the engagement of 
the external auditors to provide any non-audit services, and 
reporting to the Board on such engagement, recommending 
relevant actions where improvement is required.
During 2011, the composition of the Audit Committee 
complied with the Code, comprising three Independent 
Non-executive Directors: Dennis Millard (Chairman), Pat 
O’Driscoll and Michel Paulin. The Chairman Dennis Millard was 
deemed by the Board on his appointment to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. The Audit Committee maintains 
a formal agenda for each year to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the Code. Key items considered during 2011 
include the review of key accounting policies; material 
judgements; quality of earnings and estimates; scope of work 
and findings of the 2011 internal and external audits; half-year 
and full-year financial statements; risk register process; 
non-audit services; and the effectiveness of internal control 
and risk management systems.
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s Annual Report  
and Accounts, as well as reports from the external auditors 
identifying any accounting or judgemental issues requiring 
its attention. In its July 2011 and February 2012 meetings, 
the Audit Committee approved the half-year and full-year 
financial statements respectively, and confirmed agreement 
with key accounting policies and material judgements. 
In February 2012, the Audit Committee conducted its annual 
assessment of the suitability and performance of the external 
auditors in making its recommendation to the Board for  
their reappointment. 
To ensure that the objectivity and independence of the audit 
is not compromised, a review was undertaken of the level of 
non-audit services provided by the external auditors and to 
ensure that relevant safeguards are in place. The level of 
non-audit services provided was agreed to be acceptable. In 
addition, the policy for the engagement of external auditors 
to supply non-audit services is reviewed annually by the 
Audit Committee.
In addition to the Audit Committee, each UK Enterprise 
Partnership (‘EP’) has its own audit committee whose 
members and chairman are independent of the EP. Such 
committees are attended by Xchanging’s partners, 
nominated Xchanging Executive Directors, senior EP 
management and the Head of Group Internal Audit on a 
regular basis. EP audit committees have similar terms of 
reference to the Audit Committee. In Continental Europe, 
XTB, FdB and Kedrios have shareholder committees attended 
by representatives from Xchanging’s partners and nominated 
Xchanging Executive Directors or senior management members.

Key areas of responsibility
  Evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board and, in light of such evaluation, 
preparing descriptions of the role and the capabilities 
required for any appointment.
  Ensuring that plans are in place for orderly succession for 
appointments to the Board and senior management, to 
retain an appropriate balance of skills and experience 
within Xchanging and on the Board.
During 2011, the composition of the Nomination Committee 
complied with the Code, comprising a majority of 
Independent Non-executive Directors. The Nomination 
Committee leads the process for all Board appointments, 
preparing role descriptions, reviewing candidates and 
making a final recommendation to the Board, in compliance 
with the Code. 
During 2011, at the direction of the Board, the Nomination 
Committee led the successful search for all new Board 
members, subsequently approved by the Board, as follows:  
a new Independent Non-executive Director (Bill Thomas 
appointed on 1 December 2011), a new Chief Executive 
Officer (Kenneth Lever appointed on 7 June 2011), a new 
Chief Financial Officer (David Bauernfeind appointed on 
7 June 2011) and a new Chairman (Geoff Unwin appointed 
Non-executive Director on 1 December 2011 and Chairman 
on 1 January 2012).
The Board has recruited Non-executive Directors of a high 
calibre with broad commercial, international or other relevant 
experience. Non-executive Directors are expected to bring an 
objectivity and independence of view to the Board’s 
discussions, and to help provide the Board with effective 
leadership in relation to the Company’s strategy, performance, 
risk and people management as well as ensuring high 
standards of financial probity and corporate governance.
For each of the new Board appointments, the Nomination 
Committee considered the requirements of the respective roles 
and authorised the Chief Human Resources Officer to engage 
an external search consultancy to assist in identifying candidates 
with the appropriate skills and experience for each position.  
In addition, for the role of Chairman a job specification  
was prepared which included an assessment of the time 
commitment needed, particularly noting the need for availability 
in the event of crises. During meetings of the Nomination 
Committee where the role of Chairman was considered,  
Dennis Millard acted as chair of the Nomination Committee.
For both the executive and non-executive roles, as 
appropriate, members of the Nomination Committee met 
with a number of candidates from varied backgrounds and, 
in consultation with the Chief Human Resources Officer, 
identified the successful candidates for each role.
The Nomination Committee meets as and when required. 
During 2011 it met eight times, in February (twice), May, 
June, July, September, October and December.

Key areas of responsibility
  Deciding the policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors and members of senior 
management. The objective of such policy shall be to 
ensure that members of the executive management of the 
Company are provided with appropriate incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Company.
  Reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of 
the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, including 
short- and long-term incentive arrangements that are 
stretching and designed to promote the long-term success 
of the Company.
  Making recommendations to the Board on the Group 
framework of remuneration for all Group employees, 
retaining sensitivity to pay and employment conditions 
across the Group.
  Judging where to  position the Group’s remuneration 
policy relative to other companies in a similar sector. 
  Reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for 
approval by the Board and shareholders. For any such 
plans, determining each year whether awards will be made 
and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual 
awards to Executive Directors and designated senior 
management and the performance targets to be used.
  Monitoring the compensation commitments incorporated 
in the Directors’ terms of appointment which would 
become effective in the event of early termination to 
ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.
  To be exclusively responsible for establishing the selection 
criteria, selecting, appointing and setting the terms of 
reference for any remuneration consultants who advise 
the Committee.
During 2011, the Remuneration Committee was not 
compliant with Code provision D.2.1 because Stephen 
Brenninkmeijer remained a member of the Remuneration 
Committee until his retirement on 31 August 2011, despite 
being declared non-independent in December 2010. The 
Board felt that he continued to show clear judgement in 
remuneration matters, particularly given his period as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee during 2010   58 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
and considered that his continued role was helpful in 
ensuring that the Remuneration Committee’s workload was 
evenly distributed across a depleted Board during 2011. On 
Stephen Brenninkmeijer’s resignation, Michel Paulin was 
appointed a member of the Committee with effect from 
13 September 2011 and the Committee became compliant 
with the Code. Michel Paulin stepped down as a Committee 
member on 13 December 2011 and Bill Thomas was 
appointed in his place. On 8 February 2012 Bill Thomas was 
appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and 
Geoff Unwin was appointed a member of the Remuneration 
Committee. The composition of the Remuneration 
Committee now complies with the Code, and it is intended 
that it shall remain compliant during 2012.
Only Remuneration Committee members and the Company 
Secretary (except when his own remuneration is being 
considered) are entitled to attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee. However, in 2011 the Chairman, 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Human 
Resources Officer and others attended by invitation.
Further details of the activities of the Remuneration 
Committee in 2011 are given in the Remuneration Report  
on page 61.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for regularly reviewing the operation 
and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. The internal 
control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material errors, losses or fraud. The Board is also responsible 
for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to enable it 
to identify, assess and manage key risks.
The financial reporting process and control system (which 
includes the preparation of consolidated accounts) is 
monitored and maintained through the use of internal 
control frameworks which address key financial reporting 
risks, including risks arising from changes in the business  
or accounting standards. Effectiveness is assessed through 
self-certification and independent testing of the controls.
The Group’s key internal control and risk management 
procedures include the following:
  Review of the Group’s strategy and the performance of 
principal subsidiaries and EPs, through a comprehensive 
system of reporting based on variances to annual budgets, 
key performance indicators and regular forecasting.
  Well-defined Group policies and processes, 
communicated through the Group Financial Reporting 
Procedures Manual and intranet portal, and a strict 
process governing the approval of sales opportunities  
and capital expenditure.
  A defined organisational structure with appropriate 
delegation of authority.
  Formal authorisation procedures for all investments with 
clear guidelines on appraisal techniques and success 
criteria (Xchanging’s ‘Authority to Invest’ process).
  Formal authorisation procedures for all significant sales 
opportunities and bid management, with clear guidelines 
on success criteria (Xchanging’s sales opportunities 
approval process, including ‘Bid review approval’, 
‘Solution approval’ and ‘Contract approval’).
  A quarterly business review for each business sector. This 
covers financial performance, a detailed range of strategic 
risks and opportunities and KPI metrics measuring the 
overall performance of the business sector. This identifies 
the key operational issues and actions required to address 
any deficiencies.
  The work performed by the Group’s Internal Audit 
department is focused on areas of greatest risk to the 
Group, as well as issues identified by the quarterly 
performance reporting. Internal Audit’s objective is to 
provide independent assurance to the Board and Audit 
Committee over financial, operational and compliance 
controls and to assist the Board in its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal controls. The Head of Internal 
Audit reports directly to the Chief Finance Officer, but  
has the right to report to the Audit Committee Chairman 
independently of the Executive Directors. All significant 
internal audit reports are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and made available to the external auditors.
  Each business sector has a delegated person responsible 
for the quality of controls and processes within that 
business sector as well as for ensuring compliance with 
policies and procedures, legislation and the operation of 
risk management procedures. Each responsible person 
reports to the business sector management team on an 
operational basis, but has an additional dotted reported 
line into the Head of Internal Audit. They also attend,  
by invitation, the EP audit committees within their 
business sector.
The Group’s key risk management procedures have been in 
place throughout 2011 and up to the date of approval of this 
Annual Report, including the maintenance of a hierarchy of 
risk registers for each business sector, which are monitored 
on an ongoing basis within the relevant management teams. 
The Group risk register incorporates risks pervasive or 
material to the whole Group and is reviewed at least 
annually by the Board and the Audit Committee, with the 
last review occurring on 28 February 2012.
The Audit Committee has, on behalf of the Board, reviewed 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems for 
2011 and the period prior to approval of this Annual Report. 
The Audit Committee reported its findings to the Board at 
the 28 February 2012 Board meeting. It considered all 
material controls in accordance with the Turnbull guidance.
The internal control environment will continue to be monitored 
and reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee.

Xchanging is committed to the highest standards of business 
integrity in each country where it operates, maintaining an 
Ethical Business Code of Conduct which applies to all 
employees and provides guidance regarding their conduct, 
and how Xchanging conducts business.
Xchanging will not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption 
by its employees. Measures have been taken to ensure Group 
wide compliance with the Bribery Act 2010. In the event of 
any bribery or corruption incident brought to the Group’s 
attention, Xchanging would take immediate steps to effect 
corrective action and report it to the relevant authorities as

duty to the Group to act with integrity and good faith in their 
role, and avoid any circumstance which either conflicts, or 
could potentially conflict, with Xchanging’s interests.

blowing) Policy to allow employees to voice any concerns in  
a responsible and effective manner, without fear of reprisal. 
Employees can communicate concerns in confidence to a 
dedicated email address, to which only the Group Compliance 
Officer and the Company Secretary have access.
Reported concerns are investigated at the earliest opportunity 
by the Group Compliance Officer, the Company Secretary 
and, if appropriate, by management of the respective 
businesses. The concerns raised and actions taken are 
reported to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Communication with shareholders
The Board places importance on communication with 
shareholders and gives them the opportunity to meet the 
Chairman and Directors as appropriate. Shareholders will 
continue to be given the opportunity to meet the Chairman 
and Directors in the coming 12 months. Arrangements can  
be made for major shareholders to meet with any newly-
appointed Directors. The Company’s Investor Relations team 
organises an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings 
between the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
and institutional investors, fund managers and analysts. 
Brokers’ reports and investors’ feedback are circulated regularly 
to the Board, who discuss these and any other key matters 
relating to investors. In each case the Board, in conjunction with 
advisers where appropriate, determines the strategy to address 
significant issues raised.
The Company’s AGM on Wednesday 16 May 2012 will 
provide a valuable opportunity for the Board to communicate 
with private investors. We encourage shareholders to attend 
the meeting and to ask questions of any of the Directors 
following the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting. 
Details of proxy voting by shareholders, including votes 
withheld, will be made available on request and will be  
placed on the Company’s website following the meeting.

Remuneration report
Foreword
Xchanging has successfully emerged from a number of business 
and operational challenges in 2011. During this time Kenneth 
Lever and David Bauernfeind were appointed Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively, and the business 
was successfully stabilised. The appointment of Geoff Unwin as 
Chairman from 1 January 2012 was also announced towards 
the end of the year and has helped complete the stabilisation 
process and accelerate the turnaround.
As outlined on pages 18 to 21 over the next 12 months we 
will seek to move towards the next phase of our growth plan 
which includes a focus on maximising the economic value of 
the business and the growth of profitable and sustainable 
revenue streams. The Board has taken the view that 
managing for growth in this way will help lead to superior 
levels of medium- and longer-term value creation for 
our shareholders.
Embedding this philosophy across the Company will take 
some time to implement. The proposed revisions to our 
executive incentive arrangements in 2012 outlined in this 
report represent some of the first steps towards achieving 
our growth aspirations.
After a review of our executive remuneration arrangements 
over 2011 the Committee has determined that:
  There will be no change to our policy of calibrating base 
salaries for Executive Directors around appropriate 
mid-market norms over time, taking account of corporate 
performance, market conditions and individual 
performance.
  There will be no change to pensions or benefits 
arrangements which remained positioned towards the 
lower end of the market; with the exception of the 
introduction of an annual health screen.
  We will implement a revised annual bonus plan with 
payouts linked to three measures: operating profit, revenue 
growth and cash flow performance. In 2012 we plan to 
maintain the maximum and target bonus opportunity at 
150% and 90% of salary, respectively.
  One third of any bonus award will be deferred into  
shares for three years for Executive Directors and other 
senior executives.
We will continue to make awards under the Performance 
Share Plan (‘PSP’) with vesting after three years although the 
Committee intends to make changes to the performance 
conditions and vesting arrangements for awards made in 
2012 and thereafter. Full details will be published in the 2012 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
To be clear, the proposed changes outlined above will not 
result in any increases to the quantum of pay opportunity in 
2012, and the Remuneration Committee is committed  
to only paying for demonstrable returns to shareholders. 
In conclusion, the Remuneration Committee will continue to 
closely review the appropriateness of the revised arrangements 
during 2012 as the business develops and grows.

Remuneration Committee
Over 2011 the Remuneration Committee was chaired by Pat 
O’Driscoll who was appointed on 22 July 2009 by the Board.
At the start of 2011, the Remuneration Committee consisted 
of the following Non-executive Directors: Pat O’Driscoll, 
Dennis Millard and Stephen Brenninkmeijer. Stephen retired 
from the Board on 31 August 2011 and was replaced by 
Michel Paulin who was appointed to the Remuneration 
Committee for the period from 13 September 2011 to 
13 December 2011. Bill Thomas was appointed to the 
Remuneration Committee with effect from 13 December 
2011, and when Pat O’Driscoll stood down as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, on 8 February 2012, Bill took 
over as Chairman. Pat O’Driscoll remains a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Geoff Unwin was appointed as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee with effect from 8 February 2012.
Stephen Brenninkmeijer was deemed not to be independent 
for the year commencing 1 January 2011. All other members 
were deemed independent throughout the year.
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration 
Committee. Only Remuneration Committee members and 
the Company Secretary (except when his own remuneration 
is being directly considered) are entitled to attend meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee. However, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief HR Officer and others may 
attend by invitation of the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee’s primary purpose is to review 
the ongoing appropriateness of the remuneration policy  
as it applies to the Executive Directors and key senior 
management and to make recommendations on the 
framework for their remuneration and to determine  
their specific remuneration packages. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
remuneration strategy and policy of the Group. In making  
its decisions, the Remuneration Committee considers the 
Employee, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) implications in 
making its decisions. It is also mindful to ensure that 
inappropriate risk-taking is not incentivised.
The Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference can  
be found under the corporate governance section of the 
Xchanging website. The current Terms of Reference were 
adopted on 28 February 2012.
The Remuneration Committee received advice from Towers 
Watson (our appointed advisers) and Clifford Chance during 
2011. Towers Watson has also provided remuneration advice 
more widely to the Company with the permission of the 
Remuneration Committee. Towers Watson has signed the 
Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and has made 
the code available to Xchanging. Clifford Chance provided 
legal advice on the operation of share schemes, employment 
matters and legal advice more widely to the Company. 
Remuneration policy
Xchanging’s remuneration policy is to ensure that we attract 
and retain key talent in order to create sustainable long-term 
value for shareholders. To help inform the Remuneration 
Committee, total remuneration is benchmarked periodically 
against relevant FTSE 250 companies (excluding financial 
services) taking into account the geographic reach of each role 
in determining competitive remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee has determined that the FTSE 250 still remains the 
most appropriate peer group for its UK-based executive talent 
during its current transformation phase. The Remuneration 
Committee has also agreed that the remuneration philosophy 
for 2012 will remain as follows:
  To position base salaries around competitive market 
practice over time. Mid-market base salary benchmarks 
will be determined by reference to the local geographic 
market for the role, and its size and scope. 
  To reward for business success with a significant proportion 
of the reward opportunity for our senior employees linked 
to sustainable performance in the form of variable 
compensation:
 –  annual bonuses will reward business performance 
delivered in the year above pre-agreed and appropriate 
thresholds and based on affordability. Performance 
measures will be based on a balanced set of key value 
drivers of the business;
 –  long-term incentives will form part of a market 
competitive remuneration package. Making awards in 
the form of shares aligns the interests of our executives 
with those of shareholders.
  To encourage our senior team to build a personally 
significant stake in the business over time.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration 
policy described above is aligned to Xchanging’s business 
objectives and is in the interests of shareholders. The 
Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor performance 
against the total remuneration policy to ensure that it achieves 
its aim of attracting, motivating and retaining the senior 
management talent that is required to develop the Company 
and deliver shareholder value.
Remuneration for Executive Directors in 2012
Remuneration packages for the Executive Directors will 
continue to consist of base salary, annual bonus, awards under 
long-term incentive schemes and other benefits. Following a 
review of remuneration policy and feedback from investors  
the Remuneration Committee intends to make a number of 
changes in 2012. These changes, which are outlined below in 
more detail, will maintain levels of target and maximum total 
pay for Executive Directors at the same levels as for 2011 but 
will seek to more closely align Xchanging’s executive incentive 
plans with our key value drivers going forward.
Base salary
In light of the current economic circumstances, base salaries 
for the Executive Directors will remain fixed at £475,000 and 
£300,000 for 2012 for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer respectively. 62 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Annual bonus plan for 2012
Maximum annual bonus opportunity will remain at 150% of 
salary and the target opportunity, for reaching the challenging 
business plan for 2012 will remain at the current level of 60% 
of maximum (ie 90% of base salary). Maintaining this policy 
reflects the current environment in which the business 
operates whilst also providing management with an incentive 
to deliver the agreed business strategy. No bonus will be paid 
in the event that threshold profit-based hurdles are not 
achieved. Performance will be measured over three equally 
weighted key metrics:
  Operating profit;
  Revenue growth; and
  Cash flow targets.
Payment of bonuses will be delivered in light of performance 
across these three measures and appropriately challenging 
hurdles determined at the outset of the year. Performance 
will be assessed between each respective hurdle rate and 
plan maximum on a sliding scale basis.
For Executive Directors one third of any bonus earned will be 
deferred into equity which will vest into nil-cost options after 
three years and will continue to be exercisable for a further 
seven years to increase alignment with shareholders. A similar 
bonus deferral structure will also be extended to the wider 
senior management team in 2012.
Long-term incentives in 2012
Over the course of 2011 the Committee undertook a review 
of existing long-term incentive arrangements to ensure that 
they remain appropriate. In assessing the new arrangements 
the Committee was mindful of the following guiding 
principles for incentives:
  They should be simple to understand and communicate.
  They should provide management with incentives that are 
appropriately geared and represent an acceptable cost to 
the company and shareholders.
  They should be based on goals that are challenging but 
achievable.
It was determined that long-term incentive awards under  
the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) will continue under the 
current policy for Executive Directors and a more focused 
selection of senior management than in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee also intends to revise the 
existing performance test to align them with our current 
business priorities and at the same time preserving the 
current, ‘Basic’ and ‘Stretch’ awards approach in place in 
2011. Therefore Basic awards will continue to represent an 
annual award of up to 100% of base salary and the Stretch 
award up to an additional 50% of salary. The Remuneration 
Committee will communicate the new arrangements to its 
major investors and will disclose them in the 2012 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
A shareholding policy continues to apply to the Executive 
Directors that requires a minimum shareholding equivalent 
to 100% of base salary to build up over a maximum period 
of five years.
Pay mix in 2012
Assuming the proposed changes described are implemented, 
the two charts below illustrate the resulting pay mix for 
Executive Directors based on target and maximum 
performance. In both cases, variable pay forms a significant 
portion of total remuneration in accordance with the 
Remuneration Committee’s policy described earlier.

and after his appointment as acting Chief Executive Officer 
his base salary remained unchanged but he received a 
£60,000 per annum pro rata allowance in recognition  
of the additional responsibilities. On appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer, the payment of the allowance ceased  
and his salary was increased to £475,000 per annum.

Additionally 12 employees were granted restricted shares  
in April 2011 where a three-year service is the only vesting 
condition applied. Those granted an award included David 
Bauernfeind prior to his appointment as Chief Financial Officer.
Share Purchase Plan (‘SPP’) 
At the start of 2007, prior to the listing of Xchanging plc, 
certain Directors, and members of senior management 
(excluding David Andrews) (the ‘F Share Loan Participants’), 
purchased class F common shares (in Xchanging BV), under 
the terms of the SPP, at the prevailing market price. Upon 
IPO, the class F common shares in Xchanging BV were split 
into shares in Xchanging plc on a one-for-four basis, with  
an equivalent value of £1.325 per share (the ‘SPP shares’). 
Under the terms of the SPP, the Xchanging BV 2007 
Employee Benefit Trust provided non-interest-bearing loans 
to 12 F Share Loan Participants, who were deemed key to 
retain following IPO, to enable them to fund the purchase  
of the class F common shares. The SPP shares were subject 
to an 18-month lock-in period, which expired in August 
2008. The SPP shares could then be sold on the condition 
that a pro-rata proportion of any loan from the Xchanging 
BV 2007 Employee Benefit Trust was repaid.
The non-interest-bearing loans provided to the F Share  
Loan Participants become repayable on the earliest of  
the F Share Loan Participants ceasing employment,  
the transferring or otherwise disposing of their shares  
(or attempting to do so), accepting another loan from  
a member of the Group to refinance the loan and the  
‘long stop’ date of 31 December 2011. 
Annual bonus for 2011
Executive Directors, Kenneth Lever, Chief Executive Officer 
and David Bauernfeind, Chief Financial Officer will receive a 
performance bonus in respect of 2011 of £150,000 and 
£60,000 respectively. The Committee determined that both 
Directors made a strong contribution in stabilising the 
Company and in particular through:
  Renegotiating our banking covenants. 
  Restructuring of the business.
  Restructuring of the senior management team.
  Initiating the Changing Xchanging Programme.
  The successful implementation of the Four Point  
Action Plan. 
  the liquidation of Cambridge Integrated Services Group Inc.
One third of bonuses will be deferred into shares, for  
three years. 
Long-term incentive plans
The Company established a number of equity-based share 
incentive plans around the time of the initial public offering 
(‘IPO’), namely an Approved and Unapproved Executive 
Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) and a Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’). Other share plans, namely the Share Purchase Plan 
and earlier Approved and Unapproved G Share Options Plans 
were also in existence at the IPO, but no further awards will 
be made under the pre-IPO Plans. 
Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
An ESOP award was made on 4 March 2011 to 45 senior 
managers including David Bauernfeind, who was appointed 
Chief Financial Officer in June. This award was made partially 
as approved options and partially as unapproved options.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
The Remuneration Committee chose the PSP as the primary 
vehicle through which share-based long-term incentives 
were offered to Executive Directors and other senior 
executives in 2011. 
The Awards made will vest three years after grant, 
depending upon the Company’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) performance when compared to the TSR performance 
of the constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding 
investment trusts) (the ‘Comparators’) and continuous 
employment over the vesting period.
The ‘Basic award’ will vest ranging from 25% if the Company’s 
TSR is equal to the median TSR of the Comparators, through  
to 100% if the Company’s TSR performance is at or above the 
upper quartile of the Comparators. The ‘Stretch award’ will 
only begin to vest if the Company’s TSR performance is at least 
upper quartile of the Comparators, with full vesting of the 
Stretch award only for upper decile performance. In any event, 
the Basic and Stretch awards will vest only if the Company’s 
annual average EPS growth over the relevant three-year period 
is no less than the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) +3%. 
The extent to which the performance conditions are achieved 
will be determined by the Remuneration Committee, having 
received appropriate third-party advice. 64 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Remuneration report continued
As at 31 December 2011, a loan of £662,500 made to 
Richard Houghton remains outstanding with repayment due 
on or before 31 March 2012. A mortgage has been taken 
over his SPP shares by the Xchanging BV 2007 Employee 
Benefit Trust to secure this loan.
Other benefits 
Kenneth Lever is eligible for a cash allowance of 10% of base 
salary per annum in lieu of pension contributions. His cash 
allowance is non-bonusable.
David Bauernfeind is a member of the Xchanging Pension 
Scheme, a defined contribution scheme, and he receives 6% 
of his base salary capped at a base salary of £129,600. 
No payments other than base salary are pensionable.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive other benefits 
including Life Assurance and Permanent Health Insurance 
(‘PHI’), and are also eligible to join Xchanging’s private 
medical insurance scheme in accordance with the scheme 
terms and conditions under which cover is provided. 
The Group’s Life Assurance and PHI scheme provides a 
benefit equal to four times their basic salary at the time of 
death and 75% of their basic salary should an individual be 
unavailable for work due to a critical illness for 26 continuous 
weeks. David Andrews was a participant and David 
Bauernfeind is a participant in the insured Death in Service 
Pension Plan.
David Andrews was not a participant in any Xchanging 
pension scheme, however, had he died in service his widow 
would have received a pension. The liabilities of this plan 
ceased when his employment terminated.
Dilution and the pre-IPO share pool for 
entrepreneurial achievement 
As disclosed in Xchanging’s IPO prospectus, 4,006,388 
shares authorised by shareholders prior to the IPO, but not 
allocated to employees at that time, may be placed under 
option or issued under the Company’s share incentive plans 
without counting towards the ongoing Association of British 
Insurers (‘ABI’) guideline dilution limits. The Remuneration 
Committee has subsequently approved that such pool of 
options may be awarded to employees under any of the 
shareholder approved schemes.
Service contracts 
Executive Directors have service contracts with notice 
periods of 12 months from either the Director or the 
Company. This is in line with best practice for listed 
companies. The Company has the right to terminate the 
employment of an Executive Director without notice or with 
less than 12 months’ notice by making a payment in lieu of 
notice equal to the base salary the Executive Director would 
be entitled to receive during any unexpired period of the 
notice period.
Executive Director appointments
Kenneth Lever was appointed as Acting Chief Executive 
Officer on 9 February 2011. At this time his base salary was 
not increased although he received an allowance of 
£60,000 per annum pro rata and on 11 April 2011 was 
awarded 572,519 PSP shares with a Basic award of 458,015 
shares and a Stretch award of 114,504 shares.
On 7 June 2011, Kenneth Lever was appointed Chief Executive 
Officer and his base salary was increased to £475,000 per 
annum to reflect his increased responsibilities and the 
allowance was withdrawn. In addition, on 23 June 2011 he 
was granted an additional Basic award of 94,451 and Stretch 
award of 135,773 shares under the PSP bringing the total 
shares awarded under the PSP in the year to a grant value of 
150% of salary.
In addition, 150,000 shares will vest on 6 October 2012 
providing that Kenneth Lever remains in continuous service.
This award represents the second tranche of an award 
previously disclosed in the 2010 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. On a similar basis this award will not vest if he has 
given, or received, notice of termination of his employment 
with Xchanging on the anniversary of the date of grant, and  
to the extent not vested; will lapse in the event he ceases 
employment with Xchanging during this period.
It was contractually agreed on Kenneth Lever’s appointment as 
Chief Financial Officer that should there be a change in control 
in the period to 31 December 2011 the Company would pay a 
discretionary bonus of no less than 60% and no more than 
150% of base salary for the period of notice. Any entitlement 
to a guaranteed bonus ceases after the 2011 bonus payment 
date (March 2012).
David Bauernfeind was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 
7 June 2011 and on 23 June 2011 received a Basic award of 
129,207 shares and Stretch award of 64,604 shares under the 
PSP. In aggregate over 2011 he received Basic awards of 
219,207 and Stretch awards of 64,604 with a grant value 
totalling 150% of salary.
Additionally David Bauernfeind received Approved Executive 
Share Options over 38,772 shares on 4 March 2011 at an 
option price of £0.77375, and Unapproved options over 
56,228 shares on the same date and at the same option price.
Leaving arrangements 
David Andrews’ employment with the Company ended on 
31 March 2011. The amount payable on departure was 
£505,685 payable in 11 equal monthly instalments 
commencing in April 2011.
Following his departure David Andrews entered into a 
consultancy agreement with Xchanging plc until 28 February 
2012 as a special adviser to the Chairman to support the 
Company’s business development initiatives. The agreement 
expired automatically on 28 February 2012. Under the terms 
of the consultancy agreement, Xchanging paid David Andrews 
a monthly retainer of £8,500. In total he received £76,500 in 
retainer fees during 2011. Company

Non-executive Directorships, and other external 
appointments
Kenneth Lever continues to be a member of the Accounting 
Standards Board for which he received fees of £15,000 
during 2011.
He was also appointed a Non-executive Director of  
FM Insurance Company Limited, a subsidiary of FM Global,  
and has received fees of £17,000 during 2011.
Non-executive Directors 
The Board aims to recruit Non-executive Directors of a high 
calibre with broad commercial, international or other 
relevant experience. Non-executive Directors are expected to 
bring objectivity and independence of view to the Board’s 
discussions, and to help the Board with effective leadership 
in relation to the Company’s strategy, performance, risk and 
people management as well as ensuring high standards of 
financial probity and corporate governance.
The fees paid to Non-executive Directors are reviewed 
regularly. In setting the fees, a review of current market 
practice is undertaken which takes into account time 
commitment and responsibilities. The fees payable to 
Non-executive Directors are ratified by the Board, based 
both on the recommendations of the Executive Directors and 
the Chairman. The Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in the Company’s incentive or pension schemes, 
nor do they receive any employee benefits. The Company 
will reimburse all expenses reasonably incurred by the 
Non-executive Directors in the performance of their duties. 
The Company has obtained appropriate directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance. All fees to Non-executive 
Directors will cease to accrue with effect from the date of 
ceasing to be a Non-executive Director for whatever reason.
Nigel Rich stepped down as Chairman with effect from 
31 December 2011 and he received no compensation on 
departure. 
Stephen Brenninkmeijer and Johannes Maret resigned as 
Non-executive Directors on 31 August 2011 and received  
no compensation on departure.
Geoff Unwin was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 
1 December 2011 and was appointed Chairman on 1 January 
2012. His appointment is for an initial term of four years 
from 1 December 2011, unless terminated earlier by either 
party with six months’ notice.
Geoff Unwin will receive a fee of £160,000 per annum 
which is subject to review after three years and thereafter 
annually. In accordance with his Terms and Conditions of 
Appointment, Geoff Unwin purchased with his own funds 
270,908 shares in Xchanging which he is expected to hold 
for at least four years.
In the event that Xchanging is acquired by a third party for a 
price per share in excess of £1.00 before 2 December 2015 
the Company will match Geoff Unwin’s purchased shares he 
still holds on a one-for-one basis.
Should Geoff Unwin cease to be a director at any time  
as a result of death, disability or any other reason but not 
including resignation before 2 December 2015 and before 
such date Xchanging is acquired by a third party for a price 
per share in excess of £1.00, the Board may in its sole 
discretion match Geoff Unwin’s purchased shares on a 
one-for-one basis. 
He is under no obligation to hold such matched shares for  
a set period of time.
Though the share matching and the absence of a 
requirement to hold the matched shares for a period of time 
is not compliant with D.1.3 of the Code, the terms of Geoff 
Unwin’s remuneration were discussed with the major 
shareholders in advance of his appointment.
Bill Thomas was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 
1 December 2011 for an initial term of three years with an 
annual fee of £40,000. With effect from 8 February 2012

Bill Thomas
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 70 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
We have audited the group financial statements of 
Xchanging plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, the reconciliation of net 
cash flow to movement in net cash, the movement in net 
cash, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 52, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
n n give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2011 and of its loss and cash flows for 
the year then ended; 
n n have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
n n have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
n n the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Group financial 
statements; and
n n the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement set out on pages 53 to 59 with respect to 
internal control and risk management systems and  
about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
n n certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
n n we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
n n a corporate governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Parent Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
n n the Directors’ report, set out on page 50 to 52, in relation 
to going concern; 
n n the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review; and
n n certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company 
financial statements of Xchanging plc for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and on the information in the 
Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

1 General information
Xchanging plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) provide a range of business processing services, 
primarily to the financial services and insurance industries, as well as procurement, and technology services across industries. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are discussed further on pages 2 to 15.
Xchanging plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 
34 Leadenhall Street, London, EC3A 1AX. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(i) Basis of preparation of the financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the European Union (EU) endorsed International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as 
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.  
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The comparatives as presented for the year ended 31 December 2010 have been restated for the following reasons:
n n During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group sold its US workers’ compensation and third party administration 
operations, which constituted the Group’s US BPO cash-generating unit within the Insurance Services business segment. 
Subsequent to this sale, the legal company Cambridge Integrated Services Group Inc. (‘CISGI’) was put into an Assignment 
for the Benefit of Creditors and the Group’s control over the remaining assets and liabilities of the US BPO business ceased. 
These transactions constitute a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5, ‘Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations’, as the transaction represented the disposal of a separate major line of business and, at the time, 
was the primary business in the US. The results and cash flows of the discontinued operation have therefore been 
presented separately on the face of the income statement and cash flow statement, and are not included within the 
Group’s analysis of continuing operations. Prior year comparatives have been re-presented to allow for like-for-like 
comparisons. Further details are provided in note 13 of these consolidated financial statements.
n n As indicated in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group has moved from reporting underlying 
operating profit to reporting adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating profit is now the primary measure used to 
evaluate the performance of the Group and its operating segments. Adjusted operating profit excludes all material 
non-recurring operating items and adds back both acquisition-related expenses and amortisation of intangible assets 
previously unrecognised by an acquired entity. The adjusted results of the Group, instead of the underlying results, have 
therefore been presented on the face of the income statement and the prior year comparatives have been re-presented. 
Underlying profit for the year ending 31 December 2010 from total operations was £46.0 million, however adjusted profit 
for the year ending 31 December 2010 from total operations is presented as £36.2 million as a result of the exclusion of 
non-recurring contract revenue of £4.9 million relating to the discontinued operation and non-recurring contract 
settlements of £4.9 million, net of tax, relating to the continuing operations.
n n Following a strategic review in 2011 of the investment account administration business of Fondsdepot Bank GmbH (FdB), 
part of our Financial Services sector, the revenue recognition accounting policy in respect of initial load fees has been 
changed with effect from 1 January 2010. Initial load fees are received from customers on the acquisition of funds. These 
fees are then passed on to independent financial advisers as commission for placing the funds for the customer. Previously, 
the fees received from customers were recognised as revenue and the commission payable was recognised as an expense 
within cost of sales. It has been determined that the amounts collected on behalf of customers are not economic benefits 
which flow to the Group and do not result in an increase in the Group’s equity. Consequently, the corresponding revenue 
recognition accounting policy has been changed so that neither the revenue nor the expense is recognised. The prior year 
comparatives have been restated as a result of this change in accounting policy. Revenue and cost of sales for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 have been reduced by £13.7 million. There is no impact on the overall profitability, or equity of 
the Group.

for the year ended 31 December 2011 80 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
n n On the acquisition of FondsServiceBank by FdB on 3 April 2010, it was identified that £8.9 million of cash accounts were 
transferred to FdB. These accounts held cash deposits paid in by customers. In the provisional acquisition accounting 
presented for the year ended 31 December 2010, these accounts were not included as part of the assets acquired as 
management believed that this cash was held on behalf of customers with no right of use by FdB. During 2011 it was 
determined that there is no set agreement between FdB and its customers on how the funds in the cash accounts are to 
be administered and that FdB has full legal rights to use the cash, earning interest income as a result. Consequently, the 
revised business combination disclosures for this acquisition (refer to note 33) have been prepared to include the £8.9 
million of cash in these accounts as part of the assets acquired. As FdB is liable to repay these funds on demand to its 
customers, an £8.9 million customer accounts current liability has also been recognised on acquisition. In addition, the 
comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2010 for the balance sheet, cash flow statement, reconciliation of net cash 
flow to movement in net cash, movement in net cash, the cash and cash equivalents, financial instruments, and segmental 
reporting disclosures have been restated to take into account the £10.4 million of cash held in the customer accounts at 31 
December 2010. 
The table below summarises the restatements to the ‘adjusted’ results for the year ended 31 December 2010:

(ii) Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity position of the Group for the period to 30 June 2013. The cash flows of the Group 
have been assessed against the Group’s available sources of finance on a monthly basis to determine the level of headroom 
against committed bank facilities. Based on this analysis, and an assessment of the potential cash risks, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
(iii) Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
(a) New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2011 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group (although they may affect the accounting for 
future transactions and events).
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued, but not effective for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2011 and not early adopted:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and 
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s 
business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For 
financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value 
option is taken for financial liabilities, fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive 
income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full 
impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to 
endorsement by the EU.

IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, was amended in June 2011 but the amendments are not applicable until 1 January 2013. The 
impact on the Group will be to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (or asset). The Group is yet to assess the full impact 
of the amendment.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective that would be expected 
to have a material impact on the Group.
(iv) Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities such as an employee benefit trust) over which the Group has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting 
rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group also assesses existence of control where it does not own 
more than 50% of the voting rights but is able to govern the financial and operating policies by virtue of de facto control. 
De facto control arises in respect of the Group’s Enterprise Partnerships through the specific contractual arrangements giving 
the Group power over the financial and operating policies. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control passes to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 
date control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by 
the Group. 
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Profits 
and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the income statement, balance sheet and other comprehensive income 
based on the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share, except where there are specific contractual arrangements where 
this is not applicable, for example, where guaranteed dividends payable to non-controlling interests exist instead of 
proportionate profit-sharing arrangements.
(b) Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. A business combination is deemed to have 
occurred where the Group acquires a third party business, either in whole or in part, so that it obtains overall operational and 
financial control of that business. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a business is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred 
to the former owner of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the 
fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or a liability is recognised either in the 
income statement or as a change in other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at 
their fair values at acquisition date. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis, either at fair value or 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of 
non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than 
the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 82 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(c) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. That 
is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid 
and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity; specifically other 
reserves. Gains or losses arising on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(d) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control of a subsidiary, any retained interests in the equity is remeasured to its fair value at 
the date when control is lost, with the change in the carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. Any amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in respect of that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group 
had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income or taken directly to equity are recycled to the income statement.
(e) Discontinued operation
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business. This may 
be the whole of or part of a subsidiary’s operations. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when 
the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. 
(v) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, rebates and 
discounts. It comprises the value of services provided for customer administration services, including investment 
administration services, business process services, claims servicing, securities processing, maintenance contracts and software 
sales, software development services, procurement services, as well as human resources, finance and accounting services. The 
Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities described below.
n n Customer administration services
Revenue in respect of the provision of administration services comprises amounts receivable for subscription fees, a 
transaction charge for the provision of administration services and fees for other ad hoc services. Subscription fees are 
recognised in the income statement according to the period to which they relate. Transactional revenue for these services 
is recognised in the period in which the transaction takes place. Ad hoc revenue is recognised in the period in which the 
service is provided.
n n Business process services
Revenue in respect of business process services contracts is divided into an implementation phase and a service  
provision phase. 
Revenue in respect of the implementation phase is accounted for on a long-term contract basis, where it is separable from 
the provision of administration services. The percentage completion method is applied, based on the proportion of costs 
incurred to the total estimated costs. Profits are recognised on an implementation phase where the final outcome can be 
assessed with reasonable certainty. A full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract 
immediately, once forecast.
Revenue in respect of the provision of post-implementation administration services to business process services customers 
is recognised in the period to which the service relates.
n n Claims servicing
Revenue from the servicing of claims is recognised over the period of the underlying service contract, where there is a 
defined service period. Revenue from incentive schemes associated with the provision of claims servicing is recognised  
on the basis of estimates of the amounts which are considered reasonably certain to be received.
n n Securities processing
Revenue from the provision of securities processing services is recognised according to the period to which the service 
relates, net of guaranteed rebates to customers.

information
n n Maintenance contracts, hosting services and software sales
Revenue in respect of the rental or maintenance of computer software programmes, hosting and other services is 
recognised as earned. Billings are included in trade receivables in accordance with the terms of the relevant rental or 
maintenance contract. To the extent that billings are recorded in advance of the relevant revenue, such advance billings  
are included in deferred income.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance contract. 
Revenue from the sale of perpetual software licences, including revenue relating to both the initial licence fee and 
implementation phase, is recognised over the length of the implementation of the software. Revenue from the sale of 
subsequent licences, where no implementation is required, is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership are considered to have passed to the buyer and all obligations have been fulfilled; usually considered to occur 
on delivery of the licences to the buyer.
n n Software development services
Revenue from software development services is recognised as related services are performed when the contract is based 
on time and materials or under the percentage completion basis where work is performed under a fixed price contract. 
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance contract. 
n n Procurement services
Revenue from the provision of procurement services is recognised on a gross basis where the Group is responsible for the 
whole supply chain process and associated business process from end-to-end. Where the Group acts as an agent, revenue 
is recognised on a net basis. Revenue is recognised, net of guaranteed rebates to customers, according to the period to 
which the service relates and only when all obligations are fulfilled.
n n Human resources/finance and accounting services
Revenue from the provision of human resources and finance and accounting services is recognised according to the period 
to which the service relates, net of guaranteed rebates to customers, when all obligations are fulfilled.
(vi) Deferred income
Deferred income relating to claims handling income received at claim inception in our workers’ compensation business is 
released in line with an estimate of the cost to service the claims based on actuarial table profiles. The profiles determine, for 
each class of claim that the Group processes, the estimated life cycle and work effort of a typical claim. The majority of this 
revenue is released over a two year period.
Deferred income relating to software maintenance and licence fees received in advance is predominantly in our insurance 
business. This income is released evenly over the year to which it relates.
(vii) Finance costs 
Finance costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method. 
(viii) Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset 
as part of the cost of that asset. The amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised will depend on whether directly attributable 
borrowings or general borrowings are used to finance the asset. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss. 
(ix) Finance income
Finance income is reported in the income statement as it arises through the application of the effective interest rate method.
(x) Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
(xi) Foreign currency transactions 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency.  84 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in 
the income statement. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income 
statement within ‘finance income or cost’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement 
within ‘foreign exchange (loss)/gain’ in cost of sales or administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as available-for-sale are included in the 
revaluation reserve in equity. 
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss 
are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
(c) Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency 
as follows: 
n n All assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.
n n Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at monthly average exchange rates (unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions).
n n All resulting currency translation differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. 
On consolidation, currency translation differences arising from the translation of long-term monetary items designated as part 
of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Cumulative currency translation differences recognised in equity in respect of a subsidiary disposed of are recycled to the 
income statement in the same period that the disposal is recognised. The effect of the cumulative currency translation 
differences is taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
(xii) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives 
as either: 
(a)  hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction  
(cash flow hedge); or
(b)  hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is 
less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
(a) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or 
loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of 
forward contracts hedging foreign currency revenues is recognised in the income statement within ‘revenue’.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
(b) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed 
of or sold.
(xiii) Goodwill 
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of transition to IFRS, 1 January 2003, is stated at net book value at the 
date of transition. This goodwill had been amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life (being 10 years). 
Goodwill recognised subsequent to 1 January 2003, arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, represents the 
excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) 
acquired. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill recognised 
subsequent to 1 January 2003 is not subject to amortisation.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
(xiv) Other intangible assets
(a) Development costs
Where development costs meet the criteria for capitalisation, these are stated at cost less a provision for amortisation and any 
provision for impairment. Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs incurred during the development period of new contracts, including the costs of process and system designs that 
substantially improve those processes and systems already installed in either the Enterprise Partnerships or recently acquired 
subsidiaries, are treated as development costs. Expenditure relating to these clearly defined and identifiable development 
projects is recognised as an intangible asset only where costs can be reliably measured and after the following criteria have 
been met:
n n The technical feasibility and commercial viability of the development project have been demonstrated.
n n The availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have 
been confirmed.
n n There is an ability to use or sell the project.
n n Future economic benefits are expected.
Costs that are capitalised comprise directly attributable incremental costs incurred during the development period, including 
wages and salaries of staff employed solely for the purpose of improving the processes and systems, and third party costs. 
Development costs do not include restructuring costs, (including redundancy, early termination penalties and such like), which 
are expensed to the income statement as they are incurred.
Amortisation of development costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract to which they relate (between 
6 and 12 years). This period represents the useful life of the intangible asset. 
(b) Software costs
Software costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Software costs include purchased software licences and software development expenditure, which are capitalised where they 
meet the criteria for recognition under IAS 38. Where the criteria for capitalisation are not met, software development 
expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Software development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis at an annual rate of 20% or over the life of the related 
contract, where appropriate, so as to write off the asset cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life. 
Purchased software is stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over three years. 86 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(c) Assets in the course of development
Assets in the course of development are not amortised until the asset is brought into use.
Subsequent expenditure undertaken to ensure that an asset maintains its previously assessed standard of performance, for 
example, routine repairs and maintenance expenditure, is recognised in the income statement as it is incurred. Subsequent 
expenditure that significantly enhances an asset is capitalised.
(d) Contractual customer relationships
Contractual customer relationships are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Contractual customer relationships are capitalised on acquisition where they meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS 3 
and IAS 38. Amortisation of customer contractual relationships is in line with the expected length of the customer 
relationship, which is between 1 and 7 years.
(xv) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for 
assets in the course of development and land. Assets in the course of development are carried at cost less any recognised 
impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Land is carried at cost less any 
recognised impairment. No depreciation is charged on land.
The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
All repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease
Computer equipment  20–33% per annum
Fixtures and fittings  10–33% per annum
Motor vehicles   25% per annum
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
the income statement.
(xvi) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill)
Property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment if a trigger event is deemed 
to have happened, unless the asset has an indefinite useful life, then these assets are reviewed at least annually. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of 
the time value of money. Future cash flows are adjusted to take account of any risks specific to an asset. Fair value less costs 
to sell is determined by reference to either the expected proceeds of sale or the expected discounted cash flows in respect of 
the asset, less any costs that are expected to be incurred to secure the sale. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to 
the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
Any impairment losses identified in respect of goodwill are not reversed.

(xvii) Financial instruments
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-sale and 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets 
were acquired. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition:
n n Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. These are classified as non-current assets.
n n Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of 
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
n n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includes residual equities purchased as part of a requisitioned trade on 
behalf of a client of the Financial Services sector and are held at their fair value until the opportunity arises to sell the 
equity as part of a new requisitioned trade by a client. They are included within current assets and classified as held-for-
trading assets within trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not 
carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at 
fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to 
receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables 
are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through 
profit and loss.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in 
other comprehensive income are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
Dividends from available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of finance income when 
the Group’s right to receive payments is established. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of other financial 
assets at fair value through profit and loss are presented within finance costs or income in the period in which they arise. 
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair 
value of the security below its cost is considered to be an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists 
for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the 
current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from other 
comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on 
equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt 
instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the 
impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
(xviii) Put options granted to non-controlling shareholders
In accordance with IAS 32, when non-controlling interests hold put options that enable them to sell their investments to the 
Group, the net present value of the future payment is reflected as a financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet. At the 
end of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in the income statement for the 
period through finance costs. 
(xix) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.  88 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
(xx) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for 
impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. Impaired debts are 
derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of 
the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Pre-contract costs comprise legal and other professional expenses and other directly attributable staff costs incurred in order 
to obtain specific customer contracts. Costs that are directly attributable to a contract are deferred when they are separately 
identifiable, can be reliably measured and it is probable that the contract will be awarded and the contract will result in future 
net cash inflows with a present value at least equal to all amounts recognised as an asset. 
Pre-contract costs are included within trade and other receivables and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of 
the contract, starting from the date when the contract commences.
(xxi) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments which are readily 
convertible to cash and are subject to minimal risk of changes in value.
(xxii) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(xxiii) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Fees paid on the arrangement of debt facilities are recognised as transaction costs to the extent that some or all of the facility 
will be drawn down. Fees are capitalised as a prepayment against the borrowings and amortised over the period of the 
facility to which they relate.
An exchange or a modification of a debt facility arrangement is accounted for as an extinguishment where the terms of the 
new arrangement are substantially different to the original arrangement. Both qualitative and quantitative factors are 
considered in determining whether the terms of an arrangement have substantially changed. 
On extinguishment, all unamortised transaction costs related to the extinguished facility are released to the income 
statement. All fees paid in respect of the exchange or modification of a debt facility are also taken directly to the income 
statement. These amounts are presented within finance costs.
(xxiv) Operating and finance leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. Lease incentives provided by lessors to the Group are amortised over the lease term together with any related 
costs of acquiring the lease.
Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of 
minimum lease payments with an equivalent liability categorised as appropriate under current or non-current liabilities. The 
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful economic life. Finance charges are allocated to 
accounting periods over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance. 
(xxv) Taxation including deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the associated tax is 
also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions adopted in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are 
not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for a deferred income 
tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(xxvi) Employee benefit costs
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates, or participates in, both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. All the pension 
schemes are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Scheme assets are measured using closing market values at the balance sheet date. Pension scheme liabilities are measured 
using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent 
term and currency to the liability. Variations between the scheme assets and liabilities identified as a result of these actuarial 
valuations (actuarial gains and losses) are recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income (‘SOCI’) in the 
period in which they arise. Current service costs, expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to the income 
statement. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on 
the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group participates in a number of defined benefit schemes which are multi-employer schemes and where insufficient 
information exists to be able to account for the schemes as defined benefit plans as there is no consistent and reliable basis 
for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to individual entities participating in these schemes. In accordance with 
IAS 19, such schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes and contributions are charged to the income 
statement as incurred.
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of an equity-settled transaction, for example options, is recognised as an expense over the 
periods in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date of the award. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Awards, where 
vesting is conditional upon a market condition, are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised. 90 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
2 Principal accounting policies continued
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is 
treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised in the Company accounts over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, 
with a corresponding credit to equity.
(xxvii) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as the result of a past event and it is probable 
that this will result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be reliably estimated. 
Restructuring provisions are only recognised if an obligation exists at the balance sheet date, ie a formal plan exists and those 
affected by that plan have a valid expectation that the restructuring will be carried out. Employee termination payments are 
included within restructuring provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.  
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
(xxviii) Share capital
Share capital comprises the nominal value of all issued shares. On subscribing for shares any excess consideration over the 
nominal value of the shares issued less any issue costs is credited to the share premium account.
(xxix) Fair value estimation
The fair values of short-term loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their 
book values. For loans due in more than one year the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by 
discounting the future contractual cash flows at the market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial 
instruments. The fair value for quoted available-for-sale financial assets and held-for-trading equity securities is based on their 
quoted market price. The fair value of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets and held-for-trading equity securities is 
estimated by reference to a discounted cash flow calculation.
(xxx) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the Group, and which by virtue of their 
size or incidence, have been separately disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. 
These include items relating to the restructuring of a significant part of the Group, impairment losses, expenditure relating to 
the integration and implementation of significant acquisitions and other one-off events or transactions.
(xxxi) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Board.
3 Critical accounting estimations and judgements
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in note 2 of these financial statements. Management is required to 
exercise significant judgement and make use of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies.
Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting judgements are:
(i) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans. The retirement benefit obligations recorded are based on actuarial 
assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, inflation and mortality rates. These 
assumptions are based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with, and input from, actuaries. 
Management reviews these assumptions annually. If they change, or if actual experience is different from the assumptions, 
the funding status of the plan will change and the retirement benefit obligation will be adjusted accordingly. The assumptions 
used are detailed in note 34.

The assumed discount rate and life expectancy have a significant effect on the measurement of pension liabilities. 
The following tables show the sensitivity of the valuation of the pension obligations, and of the 2011 income statement 
charge, to changes in these assumptions for the material UK and German schemes at the end of the year:
UK
Decrease/(increase)
in liability
£m
At 31 December 2011
0.25% increase to discount rate 5.2
One-year increase to life expectancy 2.5
Germany
Decrease/(increase)
in liability
£m
At 31 December 2011
0.25% increase to discount rate 1.7
One-year increase to life expectancy 0.8
The impact of the 0.25% increase in the discount rate and 1 year increase in life expectancy on the service costs of both the 
UK and German pension schemes was assessed as insignificant.
The Group participates in various BAE Systems’ pension schemes. The terms on which the Group participates in these 
schemes give the Group protection against any requirement to fund future deficits that arise in the schemes, and against 
future exit debts that may arise on withdrawal from these schemes. However, in the event of BAE Systems becoming 
insolvent, there is a risk that the Group could become liable to fund the wider pension schemes of these companies, which 
would result in a significant exposure should these events occur. The Directors consider the risk of this event to be extremely 
remote and consequently the schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes as per note 34. 
(ii) Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests at least annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy 
stated in note 2(xvi). The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use or fair 
value less costs to sell calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (see note 14).
(iii) Exceptional items
The Directors consider exceptional items to be items of income or expense that fall outside the ordinary activities of the 
Group, and which by virtue of their size or incident, should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to reflect a 
full understanding of the financial position and underlying financial performance of the Group on a comparable basis (see 
note 6). Consideration of what should be labelled as ‘exceptional’ requires management judgement to be applied.
(iv) Calculation of pre-contract costs and appropriate amortisation period
The original cost of pre-contract costs includes project development costs (including appropriate direct internal costs) which 
are deferred from the point that it is virtually certain that the project will proceed to completion. The Directors consider that 
this point of virtual certainty is normally reached when the memorandum of understanding related to the contract is signed 
by all parties involved (see note 18).
The amortisation of these pre-contract costs is charged so as to write down the value of the asset to its residual value over 
the life of the contract.
(v) Assumptions on put options
Three put options are accounted for as financial liabilities under paragraph 23 of IAS 32 at year end. These liabilities are 
carried at fair value through profit and loss and measured at the fair value of the future cash flows associated with them.  
The levels of these cash flows and the relevant discount rates used in the fair value calculations are based on future 
projections and incorporate a certain element of management judgement (see note 22). 92 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
3 Critical accounting estimations and judgements continued
(vi) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the Group-wide 
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will 
impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group is required to estimate the corporate tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an 
estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence 
of different accounting and tax treatments. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are 
included within the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the asset 
will not be realised in the future. This evaluation requires judgements to be made, including the forecast of future 
taxable income.
(vii) Acquisitions
When acquiring a business, the Group has to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the 
purchase price. The Group tests the valuation of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These tests require the use of estimates (see note 3 (ii)). 
(viii) Deferred income recognition
The Group applies judgement in determining the most appropriate method to use in estimating the amount of deferred 
income to be recognised in a financial period. Following the acquisition of Cambridge Solutions Limited on 1 January 2009, a 
significant amount of deferred income was recognised on acquisition relating to a number of claims service contracts. The 
amount of deferred income released in relation to these contracts was then based on management’s estimation of the 
services performed to date as compared with the total estimated cost to fulfil all obligations. Following the disposal of the US 
workers’ compensation and third party administration business on 31 May 2011, the remaining deferred income of £11.5 
million in respect of one claims service contract was recognised as revenue in the income statement. Management believe 
that no further costs will be incurred in respect of this contract as all contractual obligations have been fulfilled (see note 21).
(ix) Valuation of provisions
Due to the nature of provisions, an element of their determination is based on estimates and judgements, including 
assumptions regarding the future anticipated cash outflows required to settle obligations, and the period over which these 
outflows will arise. The actual outcome of these uncertain factors may differ from these estimations, giving rise to differences 
with the estimated provisions. Any such differences between actual outcomes and the provisions recorded may impact the 
Group’s results over the periods involved. The timing of the outflow of resources required to settle these obligations is subject 
to similar uncertain factors. See note 23 for a discussion of critical estimates and judgements on specific provisions. 
4 Segmental reporting
Management has determined the operating segments based on the information presented to and reviewed by the Executive 
Board, the chief operating decision-maker for the period, on which strategic decisions are based, resources are allocated and 
performance is assessed. 
During the period, and in line with the changes explained in the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group has revised its 
management organisational structure, moving from a regional focus to one based on global business sectors. This 
restructuring was undertaken in order to make better use of available resources and expertise around the Group.
A brief description of each reportable segment is as follows:
n n Insurance Services provides technology infrastructure and managed services to the insurance market. It includes the 
workers’ compensation claims processing services business in Australia, and prior to disposal, the US workers’ 
compensation and third party administration business.

Insurance Services and Financial Services form a significant part of our business processing services offering.
Management uses adjusted operating profit as a measure of segment result. Adjusted operating profit excludes exceptional 
items, amortisation of intangible assets previously unrecognised by an acquired entity and acquisition-related expenses. 
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to sectors, as this type of activity is driven by the Group treasury function, 
which manages the cash position of the whole Group. 
Management makes regular use of this measure to evaluate performance in the operating segments, both in absolute terms 
and comparatively from period to period, and to allocate resources among its operating segments. Management believes that 
this measure provides a better understanding, for both management and investors, of the operating results of its business 
segments for the period under review.
The Group’s reportable segments account for inter-segment sales, and transfers, as if the sales or transfers were to third 
parties, ie at current market prices. 
Corporate costs reallocated to operating segments includes investments in Enterprise Partnerships, depreciation and 
amortisation of centrally recognised other intangible assets, lease payments and other costs incurred centrally on behalf  
of other operating segments.

6 Exceptional items from continuing operations continued
During the year ended 31 December 2011, a £9.8 million goodwill impairment charge and a £0.6 million other intangible 
assets impairment charge have been recognised in respect of goodwill and software assets attributed to the Xchanging 
Human Resources Services Limited business, part of the Procurement and Other BPO sector. The goodwill and software assets 
have been impaired due to the uncertainty over the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the remaining 
business following notification received by a customer of their intention not to renew a significant contract with effect from 
31 December 2012.
The impairment of available-for-sale financial assets of £4.2 million relates to cumulative revaluation losses recycled from 
equity, of which £0.8 million was incurred in 2011, in respect of listed equity securities held in an Italian company. The market 
value of these securities has suffered a significant and prolonged decline in value.
Restructuring costs of £18.4 million incurred in the year relate primarily to redundancy costs in the Financial Services sector of 
£7.8 million, the Technology sector of £3.5 million, the Procurement and Other BPO sector of £2.9 million, the Corporate 
centre of £3.3 million and the Insurance Services sector of £0.9 million. These costs have been incurred as part of the review 
of the Group’s overall cost base under the Four Part Action Plan.
£4.3 million of debt refinancing costs were written off in the year in respect of the refinancing of the Group’s debt facilities. 
These costs include upfront fees paid to the bank of £2.1 million, legal fees of £1.2 million, advisory fees of £0.7 million  
and £0.3 million in respect of the write off of the remaining unamortised debt fees associated with the original debt  
facility agreement. 
The exceptional revenue of £1.2 million recognised in the year relates to a revenue contract settlement fee in the Financial 
Services sector.
The tax credit arising in respect of exceptional items is £4.3 million (2010: £3.1 million).
In the year ended 31 December 2010, exceptional costs totalling £57.8 million related to the impairment of goodwill, other 
intangible, available-for-sale financial and held-for-trading assets in the Insurance Services and the Procurement and Other 
BPO sectors. A £2.6 million exceptional provision was recognised for an Australian workers’ compensation processing 
contract deemed to be onerous in the Insurance Services sector. Exceptional revenue of £6.9 million was recognised in respect 
of two contract settlements in the Financial Services sector and an exceptional gain of £0.1 million also arose within the 
Financial Services sector on the acquisition of 51% of Kedrios S.p.A. (refer to note 33).

11 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares of the Company. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence is adjusted to include all potential 
dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has three types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: share options, share awards under 
the Performance Share Plan and other share awards to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are 
expected to be met.

13 Discontinued operation
The discontinued operation represents the assets and liabilities associated with the workers’ compensation and third party 
administration operations of Cambridge Integrated Services Group Inc. (‘CISGI’), which constituted the Group’s US BPO 
cash-generating unit within the Insurance Services business sector. 
The business was sold on 31 May 2011 for a cash consideration of USD22.4 million (£13.6 million). Subsequent to the business 
sale, the CISGI legal company was put into an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, effective on 26 September 2011.  
All residual assets and liabilities of CISGI were assigned to Lawrence M Adelman, as the CISGI insolvency trustee. Cash of 
USD10.6 million (£6.8 million) was disposed of, and directly attributable costs of £1.6 million were incurred.
Financial information relating to the discontinued operation for the period to 26 September 2011 is set out below. The 
income statement and the cash flow statement distinguish discontinued operations from continuing operations. Comparative 
figures have been restated.

Impairment testing of goodwill
The key assumptions applied in the impairment testing of goodwill as at 31 December 2011 are set out in the table below.
  Basis of cash flows Operating margin range Growth rate¹
Terminal 
growth rate Discount rate
Insurance Services Value in use 1.0% – 20.0% 0% – 5.3% 0% 10.0% – 1 1.0%
Financial Services Value in use 9.1% – 17.1% 1.3% 0% 10.0%
Technology Value in use 0% – 12.4% 2.0% – 10.5% 0% 10.0%
Procurement and Other BPO Value in use 6.4% – 19.3% 10.7% 0% 10.0%
1 Based on compound growth rate over five years.
Where the recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined based on value-in-use, the value-in-use calculations use 
pre-tax cash flow projections based on budgets approved by the management of the CGU and the Board (which cover a  
one year period) as well as cash flows for years 2 to 5 using management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and 
margin based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each individual CGU. 
With the exception of Data Integration Limited (included within the Technology sector), a terminal value is then added using a 
nil growth rate assumption. For Data Integration Limited, a terminal value has been calculated using a long-term growth rate 
of 2.0% given the high growth profile of the markets in which this CGU operates. The long-term growth rates used do not 
exceed the long-term average market growth rates in which the CGU operates.
A discount rate ranging between 10.0% and 11.0% (2010: 10.0% and 11.0%) is applied to cash flow projections. The discount 
rate is based on management’s estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, with an appropriate risk adjustment 
depending on the CGU. Management believes it is appropriate to use rates within this range on the basis that cash flows are 
adjusted as considered appropriate to reflect any risks associated with operating within specific geographic or operational 
segments. The increase in discount rate applied to certain CGUs reflects the increased risk profile within the respected markets.
Impairment charges
All impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement within exceptional administrative expenses.
The impairment charge relates to Xchanging Human Resources Services Limited (which sits within the Procurement and  
Other BPO sector). Further explanation of this impairment is provided in note 6.
Sensitivity analysis
In relation to remaining goodwill balances across the Group, sensitivity analysis performed on the current base case 
assumptions fully supports the carrying value of the remaining goodwill. However, in some cases, a significant change in 
material key assumptions could cause the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to certain CGUs to exceed their recoverable 
amount. Reasonably possible changes to key assumptions are not anticipated to result in the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeding the recoverable amount. 108 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

As at 31 December 2011, trade receivables of £14.0 million (2010: £30.0 million) were past due but not impaired. These relate 
to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. All trade receivables, whether current 
or past due, are reviewed for impairment on a case-by-case basis to identify impairment taking into account the ageing of the 
debt, the likelihood of recoverability and other external factors. The ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as follows:

The Group has non-controlling shareholders in three Enterprise Partnerships that hold the right to sell their shares to the Group 
at a future date. The estimated future cash flows associated with these options are discounted back to their present value.
On 28 September 2011, Aon Limited (‘Aon’) exercised the put option it held to transfer its entire shareholding in Xchanging 
Broking Services Limited (‘XBS’) to Xpanse Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. A consideration of £10.0 million 
will be paid in two instalments to Aon for their 50% shareholding. £4.0 million was paid on the date of exercise and the 
remaining £6.0 million will be paid on 28 September 2012, along with interest of £0.5 million. The £6.0 million deferred 
payment is included in the current deferred consideration on acquisitions amount of £7.9 million, along with £0.1 million of 
accrued interest.

The fair value of the current financial liabilities equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.  116 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
22 Borrowings and other financial liabilities continued
The fair values of the put options not yet exercisable are based on the cash flows expected to settle the obligation discounted 
using a rate based on the year end effective interest rate. No discounting is applied to determine the fair value of put options 
exercisable. At the year ended 31 December 2011, one put option (2010: three put options) is not yet exercisable and is 
disclosed as a non-current other financial liability. The fair value of this Euro-denominated instrument has been determined by 
using a discount rate of 5.25% (2010: 4.00%). 
The fair values of the bank loans and overdrafts are assumed to equal their carrying value as these are recent arm’s length 
transactions, and are subject to floating rate interest rates determined by movements in LIBOR.
Credit facilities and liquidity management
The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its ongoing operations. 
During the year, the Group refinanced its syndicated loan facilities and extended the maturity to August 2015. The facilities 
comprise a £75.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and a £20.0 million term loan. There is a subsidiary cross 
guarantee arrangement on the committed facilities and the Group has provided security in the form of share pledges over  
its investments in its subsidiaries. The facilities are subject to debt service, leverage and interest cover financial covenants  
and contain representations and warranties commonly associated with corporate bank debt. As at 31 December 2011,  
£28.0 million (2010: USD45.0 million (£29.1 million)) was drawn as cash under the revolving credit facility and a further  
€20.0 million (£16.8 million) and USD2.7 million (£1.7 million) (2010: £17.1 million) were utilised for letters of credit issued on behalf  
of the Group. At the end of 2011, the balance outstanding against the term loan was £20.0 million (2010: USD34.0 million 
(£22.0 million)). As at 31 December 2011, the Group had £28.5 million (2010: £28.8 million) of headroom available under its 
committed debt facilities. 
In addition to these facilities there is a working capital facility of INR330.0 million (£3.9 million) provided to Xchanging 
Technology Services India Private Limited (‘XTSI’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. The facility is secured by way of a 
charge on the current assets of XTSI and is subject to a corporate guarantee. The working capital facility is uncommitted and 
renewed on an annual basis. As at 31 December 2011, the amount outstanding was £2.9 million (2010: £nil). 
During the year the Group repaid all bank term loan and working capital facilities provided by various Indian banks to 
Cambridge Solutions Limited (2010: £5.1 million).
The Group has a £10.0 million (2010: £10.0 million) uncommitted overdraft facility linked to its UK notional cash pool.

1 The £0.1 million impact of unwinding the effect of discounting on provisions in the year is recognised within the finance costs of the discounted operation in note 13.
Included within the provided in the year amounts for the litigation provision, employee related provisions and other provisions 
are provisions created in respect of the discontinued operation.
Provisions have been analysed between current and non-current as follows:
 
 
2011 
£m
2010 
£m
Current 22.1 23.2 
Non-current 7.1 7.9 
29.2 31.1 
Included in the onerous leases and contracts provision is an onerous contract provision in the Australian workers’ 
compensation business of £2.6 million. The value of this provision is based on the best estimate of the costs to exit this 
contract; these are expected to be lower than the future losses expected to be incurred on continuation of this business.
The £10.3 million restructuring provision recognised at the year end relates to an estimate of the cost of the Four Part Action 
Plan restructuring programmes. The estimated costs include expected termination and redundancy payments along with 
employee related taxes. We expect the majority of this to be utilised in 2012.
The operational risk provision comprises an estimated liability in respect of identified operating errors which had occurred  
in the ordinary course of business in the Financial Services sector up to 31 December 2011. This is an ongoing provision 
representative of the nature of the securities processing market. The timing of expected outflows is uncertain as utilisation  
of the provision is dependent on when claims are made for past errors.
The litigation provision relates to a number of ongoing claims and potential exposures. The utilisation of the provision is 
dependent on the timing of the settlement of the underlying cases. The settlement is, to an extent, outside the Group’s 
control and there is therefore an element of uncertainty regarding the timing of the provision’s utilisation. Estimates have 
been made of the expected cash outflows in relation to future and current litigation. 118 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
23 Provisions continued
The employee related provision includes gratuity provisions, early and part-time retirement provisions, long service provisions 
and workers’ compensation claims provisions for former employees of CISGI. Long service awards are based on actuarial 
valuations which are updated at each reporting date. The gratuity provisions as well as the early and part-time retirement 
provision both have an element of uncertainty surrounding their amount and timing of utilisation. The workers’ compensation 
claims provisions are based on the best estimate of the expected medical insurance claims that former CISGI employees will 
submit. There is uncertainty over the timing of payments therefore the provision has been classified as current.
The other provisions primarily include provisions for archiving required under banking regulations and costs to migrate an IT 
platform following the disposal of the US BPO operations. The provision is based on a best estimate of the costs of the 
migration solution and it is expected to be fully utilised in 2012.
24 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 25% (2010: 27%) for 
differences arising in the UK, and at the relevant local statutory rates for differences arising in other countries.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legal right of offset and there is an intention to settle the 
balance net. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

Tax losses arising in the current and previous years from continuing operations, total an estimated carried forward amount of 
£2.6 million in the UK (2010: £9.2 million) and losses of £39.2 million in the US (2010: £33.7 million) and £14.9 million (2010: 
£12.3 million) in other tax jurisdictions. US losses expire 20 years from the year in which they arise.
The principal deferred tax assets recognised for losses are £0.7 million (2010: £2.5 million) in respect of the UK and £1.8 
million (2010: £nil) in respect of the US.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £17.8 million (2010: £16.1 million) which principally arise on losses in 
Italy and the US. The Directors consider that it is unlikely that there will be sufficient profits in the future to realise these 
deferred tax assets, and therefore the assets have not been recognised in these financial statements.
The Finance Act 2011, which was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, includes legislation reducing the main rate of 
corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012. The change from 26% to 25% has been reflected in the closing 
deferred tax balances included in these financial statements.
Proposed further reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be 
enacted separately each year. These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are 
not included in these financial statements. The annual impact of the 1% reduction is expected to reduce the net deferred tax 
asset included in the financial statements each year end by approximately £0.6 million.

Share option valuation and measurement
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs 
into the model were as follows:
Share Option Plans   2011
Vesting period (years) 3
Option life (years) 10
Expected life (years) 3.25
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield (%) 1
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting (%) 10
Risk free interest rate (%) 1.9
Expected volatility (%) 56
Weighted average share price at grant date (£) 0.81
Weighted average fair value of options granted in the period (£) 0.31
The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life is the average expected period to 
exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed 
option life. 
The weighted average share price for options granted during the year was £0.81 per share (2010: £nil). The total income 
statement impact for the year relating to employee share-based payments under the share option plans was a debit of  
£0.3 million (2010: credit of £0.2 million), all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
(ii) Performance Share Plan 
Awards have been granted under the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) to Executive Directors and certain members of the 
Group’s management group. Under the terms of the scheme, two types of awards are granted: conditional awards which will 
vest at the end of a three-year performance period; and non-conditional awards. In both cases, awards are granted to 
Directors and employees on a merit basis, and are subject to continuous employment over the length of the vesting period, or 
at the discretion of the Group if determined to be a ‘good leaver’ upon leaving. Awards granted vest three years from the 
date of the award. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the awards in cash.
The number of conditional Basic and Stretch awards that will vest is dependent on the performance of the Company’s total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’) as compared with the performance of its comparator group (defined as the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts) and on the attainment of an earnings per share growth underpin. 25% of the 
Basic awards will vest if TSR is at a median position and 100% if TSR is in the upper quartile. In between these positions, the 
Basic award will vest on a straight-line basis. The Stretch award will also vest on a straight-line basis, with 0% vesting if TSR is 
at an upper quartile position, up to 100% if TSR is in the top decile. The earnings per share underpin is the UK RPI plus 3%. 
Conditional awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model used for valuing 
PSP awards with a TSR performance condition requires additional assumptions. A coefficient assumption of 18% for the  
April 2011 and 17% for the June 2011 awards (2010: 21%) (based on historical analysis) has been used in the current year, 
representing the level of correlation of growth in TSR between the comparator companies simulated in the model. The 
three-year historical volatility for each company in the comparator group at grant date has been analysed and this historical 
volatility has been used in the model to project TSR for each company. 
The share awards granted and the assumptions used as inputs into the fair valuation model are as follows:
PSP  2011 June 2011 April 2010
Vesting period (years) 3 3 2.75
Expected life 3 3 2.75
Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield (%) 1 1 1
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting (%) 10 10 20
Risk free interest rate (%) 1.21 1.95 1.87

Total 2010 6,666,745 4,893,320 – (654,712) 10,905,353 
Of the 9,584,003 PSP awards outstanding at 31 December 2011, 2,003,917 are non-conditional awards which will vest only 
upon continuous employment over the length of the vesting period. These awards do not have a TSR performance condition.
The total charge for the year relating to the PSP, including social security charges on the awards, was £3.0 million (2010: 
£2.2 million).
(iii) Share Purchase Plan 2007 (SPP)
The Group adopted the SPP during 2007, in which Executive Directors and certain members of senior management were 
invited to participate. Under this scheme, set up in February 2007, an employee benefit trust loaned money to the 
participants in order to allow them to purchase class F shares in Xchanging BV at the market value at the time of £5.30 (the 
Company equivalent value £1.33). These loans are non-interest bearing and the terms and conditions are described further in 
note 37. Participants may not normally sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares awarded under the scheme for a 
period of 18 months from issue. Shares may now be sold on the condition that a pro-rata proportion of any loan from the 
employee benefit trust is repaid. As the shares were granted at the fair market value at the time there is no share-based 
payment charge as a result of this scheme.
(iv) Share Awards
In October 2010, share awards were granted to the newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. 150,000 ordinary shares in the 
Company vested in October 2011 and 150,000 ordinary shares in the Company will vest in October 2012. These awards are 
subject to the continuous employment within the Group up to October 2012.
 
27 Shareholders’ equity
Ordinary shares
The balance classed as ordinary shares is the nominal proceeds on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 5p 
ordinary shares.
Share premium
The amount paid to the Company by shareholders over and above the nominal value of the shares issued to them, less the 
direct costs of issuing the shares, is classified as share premium.
Merger reserve and reverse acquisition reserve
The merger and reverse acquisition reserves arise as a result of the share for share exchange undertaken in advance of the 
initial public offering. The merger reserve comprises the excess of the market value of the Company shares issued to the 
Xchanging BV shareholders over the nominal value of those shares and arises as a result of the application of merger relief 
under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. The reverse acquisition reserve consists of the difference between the market 
value of the Company shares issued to the Xchanging BV shareholders and the total share capital and share premium of the 
Xchanging BV shares.
Other reserves
Composition of the other reserves is described in note 28. 
Retained earnings
These represent the accumulation of the Group’s net profits retained within the business, after the payment of any dividends.
Non-controlling interest in equity
These represent the non-controlling interest’s share in the assets and liabilities of both the Enterprise Partnerships and of 
Cambridge Solutions Limited, in which the Group had a 75.62% interest at 31 December 2011.

Non-controlling interest calculations for the Group’s Enterprise Partnerships are dependent upon the individual contractual 
terms. Some define adjustments in relation to certain items prior to calculating profit share based on the percentage share 
ownerships. These may include, for example, adjustments for differences between local and international accounting 
standards, adjustments for any discounts or fees payable between parties.
30 Transactions with non-controlling interests
a) Acquisition of additional interest in XBS
On 28 September 2011, Aon exercised the put option it held over its 50% shareholding in XBS. Aon’s entire shareholding was 
transferred to Xpanse Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, for a consideration of £10.0 million. The Group now 
holds 100% of the equity share capital of XBS. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest in XBS on the date of the 
acquisition was £nil. There has been no overall impact on the equity attributable to the owners of the parent from this transaction.

On 28 July 2010, Cambridge Builders Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, signed an agreement with the 
State of Karnataka, India to purchase the leasehold for, and jointly develop, land in a new Special Economic Zone in Shimoga, 
a Tier 3 (rural) town north-west of Bangalore, India. Construction of a state-of-the-art processing centre on this land is 
expected to be completed in the next financial year. The expected development costs of this project are £3.9 million, of 
which £1.7 million has already been incurred (2010: £0.5 million).
During 2008, the Group put in place a guarantee covering contributions to one of its pension schemes as part of an 
agreement reached with the scheme’s trustees for funding the scheme at the 2007 actuarial valuation. The guarantee will 
remain in place until 30 April 2017 and will reduce in value in line with contributions paid to the scheme under the agreed 
contributions schedule. The value of the guarantee was £5.5 million at 31 December 2011 (2010: £11.2 million). The Group 
would be required to make contributions to the scheme under the guarantee following any of the below occurring:
n n An insolvency event of the sponsoring employers of the scheme.
n n A failure by the sponsoring employers to make contributions to the scheme under Section 75 or Section 75a of the 
Pensions Act 1995.
n n A failure by the sponsoring employers to make contributions to the scheme under the agreed contributions schedule 
within 15 business days of that payment becoming due.
On 15 December 2011, Xchanging Resourcing Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, signed an 
agreement with Elemense Limited, to sell its business of sourcing and placing contingent labour for a consideration of £0.4 
million. The assets included in the sale are primarily the contracts of the business, the staff and the databases required to 
carry out the business and a contract to supply UK entities of the Group with contractors for a period of two years. The sale 
completed on 16 January 2012. 
The Group has provided £21.1 million (2010: £22.2 million) of bank guarantees in respect of non-performance of obligations 
under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and lease property deposits. £18.5 million of the guarantees 
(2010: £17.1 million) are issued under the Group’s £75.0 million revolving credit facility and a further £2.3 million (2010: £4.9 
million) are issued under a separate guarantee facility. The remaining £0.3 million (2010: £0.1 million) are cash collateralised 
with cash from the operating business for which they are issued.
The Group has contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in respect of subsidiary undertakings, which are entered into in 
the normal course of business. It is not practicable to estimate the magnitude of possible obligations that may arise in respect 
of subsidiary undertakings.
On 31 May 2011, following the sale of the US workers’ compensation and third party administration operations, certain 
guarantees were made to the buyer as part of the sale and purchase agreement, in respect of any claims that may arise 
relating to periods prior to the sale. Amounts have been provided within the litigation provision for claims that the Directors 
reasonably believe may arise.
In the normal course of the Group‘s business, legal proceedings are pending or may be brought against the Company and its 
subsidiaries arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, 
antitrust and premises-liability claims. The Directors believe that the impact of these legal proceedings on the Group‘s results 
of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material, apart from those matters specifically provided against at year 
end. Refer to note 23.

33 Business combinations
a) Current year business combination
On 1 August 2011, Xchanging Pty Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired a 14 month insurance services 
contract and the related employees to service this contract from Elumina Group Pty Limited for a total consideration of 
AUD0.7 million (£0.5 million based on the exchange rate prevailing on the date of acquisition). AUD0.3 million was paid up 
front with the remaining balance settled in equal monthly instalments to 31 March 2012. £0.2 million is included in the £7.9 
million deferred consideration on acquisition recognised at the year end, refer to note 22. A fair value of £0.5 million was 
attributed to the customer contract on acquisition.
The Directors do not consider this transaction to be material to the Group and therefore disclosure as required under IFRS 3 
(Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ has not been included in the consolidated financial statements.
b) Changes to the prior period business combinations
As at 31 December 2010, the book and estimated fair values of significant assets and liabilities of the prior year business 
combinations were presented as provisional amounts. Following the lapsing of the measurement period, 12 months from the 
date of acquisition as permitted by IFRS 3 (Revised), ‘Business Combinations’, the fair values of the net identified assets of all 
prior year business combinations are now presented as final.
The only change made to the provisional amounts presented in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2010, relates to the FondsServiceBank business combination. The contracts migrated from DAB bank AG were subsumed 
onto the existing FdB investment account processing platform from 3 April 2010. The acquired customer accounts were 
disclosed net of the cash assets. In the current year, this was disclosed gross to reflect the current year consolidated cashflow 
statement impact as disclosed in note 2(i).
(i) FondsServiceBank
On 13 May 2009, the Group entered into an agreement with DAB bank AG to acquire the trade and assets of their 
FondsServiceBank (‘FSB’) business unit, an investment funds administration business. As a result of this agreement, on 3 April 
2010, the Group migrated all contracts with distribution partners and customers relating to the safekeeping and 
administration of investment fund shares. This transaction meets the definition of a business combination under the principles 
of IFRS 3 (Revised), ‘Business Combinations’ and has therefore been accounted for under the acquisition method of 
accounting, in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised). 128 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
33 Business combinations continued
The total cash paid in consideration for the acquisition was €21.6 million (£19.1 million based on the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date of acquisition), of which €9.95 million was paid in 2009.
The contracts migrated from DAB bank AG were subsumed onto the existing FdB investment account processing platform 
from 3 April 2010. This is consistent with the Group’s strategy to grow existing platforms and derive benefits from economies 
of scale, with overall performance being measured at the combined FdB business unit level. Consequently, revenues and 
profits or losses earned from investment account processing services in relation to the FSB contracts are not separately 
identifiable from the pre-existing FdB contracts. Therefore, it is impracticable to disclose the revenue and profit or loss in 
relation to FSB since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period 
ended 31 December 2010 or for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date had been on 1 January 2010.
The book and estimated fair values of significant assets and liabilities as at 3 April 2010 are set out below:

Net assets acquired – 6.9 6.9
The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the recognition of customer relationships.
Goodwill represents the value of both sales and cost synergies expected to arise from combining and integrating the 
operations of FSB onto the Group’s existing FdB banking platforms.

(ii) SEB Investmentservice (‘SEB ISG’)
On 31 December 2009, the Group entered into an agreement with SEB Bank and SEB Asset Management to acquire 100% 
of the share capital of SEB ISG, a B2B investment accounts business. This transaction completed with effect from 12 March 
2010. The results of SEB ISG have been consolidated by the Group from 1 March 2010 and the company has been renamed 
Xchanging Investmentservice GmbH.
The total consideration paid for the acquisition was €0.2 million (£0.2 million at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of 
control being assumed).
SEB ISG contributed revenue of £7.7 million and statutory profit for the year of £3.1 million to the Group for the period from 
acquisition to 31 December 2010. If the acquisition date had been 1 January 2010 SEB ISG would have contributed revenue of 
approximately £8.9 million and statutory profit of £3.1 million to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010.

The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the impairment of £0.7 million of software assets 
deemed to have no future economic benefits at date of acquisition. The adjustment to deferred tax assets relate to the write 
off of a deferred tax asset recognised under Italian GAAP which would not meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS due 
to uncertainty over future taxable profits. The adjustment to the pension liability is as a result of bringing Kedrios’s accounting 
policies in line with the Group policies and IAS 19. The adjustment to provisions relates to the recognition of a restructuring 
plan provision under IFRS. This plan was announced in January 2010 and was being implemented prior to the acquisition. 
Management will continue to implement the plan as originally intended over the period to December 2012.

34 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of pension plans for its qualifying employees. The principal plans are three defined benefit 
schemes in the UK, four defined benefit schemes in Germany and one long-service obligation in Italy, which are presented 
together under the heading ‘Continental Europe’. In the UK, the defined benefit schemes are funded and assets are held in 
separate trustee administered funds. In Continental Europe, only the largest scheme (the XTB Scheme) has assets held in a 
separate Contractual Trust Agreement (‘CTA’). The remaining schemes do not have assets in a CTA and as a result, pension 
liabilities are fully recognised on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit obligation with pension assets being integrated 
with the business assets. The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes and operates a 
number of defined contribution schemes. 
(i) Defined benefit schemes
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK and Continental Europe which are accounted for as 
defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent 
actuarial valuations undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 
19 in order to assess the funding position of the plans at 31 December each year. Plan assets are shown at the market value 
at 31 December each year. 132 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

Financial assumptions
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions are as follows:
2011 2010
UK 
%
Continental 
Europe 
%
UK 
%
Continental 
Europe

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.75 2.50 4.15 2.50

Rate of increase in pensions in payment (RPI up to 2.5%) 2.20 n/a 2.00 n/a

Inflation assumption (RPI) 3.00 2.00 3.40 2.00

– Equities 7.25 n/a 7.70 n/a
– Gilts 2.80 n/a 4.20 n/a
– Bonds 4.80 n/a 5.50 n/a
Following a government announcement in July 2010, some of the UK schemes’ benefits are linked to CPI rather than RPI.  
A CPI assumption equivalent to RPI less 0.8% has been adopted as at 31 December 2011 (2010: RPI less 0.5%). For the  
Rebus and LPC schemes this change was allowed for in the 2010 financial statements. For the XDBS scheme this change  
has been allowed for in the current financial statements as a change in the actuarial assumptions in the statement of other 
comprehensive income. The liability in this scheme has been reduced by £0.1 million as a result of this change.
To develop the assumption around the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the Group considered the current level  
of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated 
with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.  
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected 
long-term rate of return assumption for the portfolio. 
The post-retirement mortality tables used for the schemes are based on country specific mortality tables, namely the PA 00 
series for the Rebus and XDBS schemes in the UK (based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 110% with allowance for 
the CMI 2011 future improvement projections and a 0.75% long-term improvement rate), the SAPS Light table for the LPC 
scheme in the UK (rated up by one year and based on year of birth with allowance for the CMI 2011 future improvement 
projections and a 1% long-term improvement rate) and the Richtaffeln 2005 G, Heubeck-Richtaffeln GmbH, Köln 2005 table 
in Germany. The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for current pensioners and future pensioners 
aged 45 for the UK schemes at the accounting date and at age 65 for current pensioners and future pensioners aged 17 for 
the material Continental Europe schemes at the accounting date:

(ii) BAE Systems defined benefit schemes
The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes run for the employees of BAE Systems.
The terms on which the Group participates in these schemes were set in commercial agreements reached with BAE Systems 
during 2006. Under the terms of these agreements, the contributions payable by the Group represent the cost of accrual of 
future service benefits and the Group’s share of the deficit contributions made by BAE Systems to the schemes only (not 
including any one-off contributions made by BAE Systems during 2006). The contributions are expressed as fixed percentages 
of pensionable payroll. The Group’s contribution rates to the schemes are contractually fixed and will only be affected by 
changes to the cost of accrual of future service benefits, as determined at the triennial valuations of the schemes. The 
Group’s contribution rates are not affected by any future changes in the past service position of the schemes, relating to past 
service of its own employees or other members of the scheme. 
It is not possible to identify the Group’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes on a consistent and 
reasonable basis. Accordingly, the Group accounts for contributions to the schemes as if they were defined contribution 
schemes under IAS 19.
The pension cost that was charged in the income statement relating to current year contributions was £0.4 million  
(2010: £0.6 million).
(iii) Defined contribution schemes
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes for the employees of various subsidiary companies. 
Pension costs for the Group that were charged to the income statement for the year relating to current year contributions 
were £7.5 million (2010: £7.2 million).

Fair value estimations
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been 
defined as follows:
n n Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
n n Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, 
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
n n Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry 
group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on 
an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These 
instruments are included in level 1. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. 
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on 
entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included 
in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
n n Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
n n Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial 
instruments.

36 Financial risk management
The multi-national nature of the Group’s operations and their financing exposes it to a variety of financial risks: market risk 
(including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge 
certain risk exposures but the Group does not undertake any speculative trading in financial instruments.
The Group’s treasury function acts as a service centre and all treasury activity takes place within a formal control framework 
under policies that are approved by the Board. Compliance with key policies and exposure limits is monitored through regular 
reporting of treasury activities and reviews by internal audit. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from long-term debt obligations which 
carry a floating interest rate charge. The Group reviews its interest rate exposure against acceptable risk profiles on a periodic 
basis and may enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to achieve an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate 
interest exposure. Currently all financial liabilities are subject to floating rate interest. 
The Group holds a Euro denominated financial asset which carries a fixed coupon. 
Working capital is generally held in variable rate operational accounts, with surplus cash placed on fixed rate short-term deposits.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impact on the income statement and equity 
of a reasonably possible change in market interest rates of 25bps to 100bps for each class of financial instruments, with all 
other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
n n Changes in market interest rates affect interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments.
n n Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed 
interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value.
With all other variables held constant the Group has assessed that this reasonably possible change in market interest rates 
does not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet and income statement.
Foreign exchange risk
The international nature of the Group’s operations exposes the Group to a number of foreign currencies. The Group does not hedge 
foreign currency profit and loss translation exposures and the reported results may therefore be affected by currency fluctuations. 140 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
36 Financial risk management continued
The Group is not generally subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure except in its Indian operations where revenues 
are generated in Sterling, US Dollars and Euros and the cost base is primarily in Indian Rupees. Under the Group’s foreign 
exchange risk management policy, exposures may be hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts when the underlying 
cash flows are deemed to be highly probable. It is the Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match 
the terms of the underlying cash flows in order to maximise hedge effectiveness. At 31 December 2011 the Group had 
forward FX contracts of £4.8 million and USD4.8 million in place to mitigate foreign exchange volatility relative to the Indian 
Rupee. Of these, £4.7 million and USD4.2 million were designated as cash flow hedges of highly probable US Dollar and 
Sterling revenue. The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective as at the year end date and a net unrealised loss 
of £0.6 million was recognised in equity. There were no outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 December 2010.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impact on the income statement and equity 
of a reasonably possible change in foreign currency exchange rates for each class of financial instruments, with all other 
variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis is based on material non-functional currency financial instruments within  
each entity within the Group.
The Group has assessed that a reasonably possible change of 10% in non-functional currency foreign exchange rate does not 
present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet and income statement. Foreign exchange sensitivity on the Group’s 
assets other than financial instruments is not included in this assessment.
Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage  
this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position,  
past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing 
basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not material. The Group has a concentration of credit risk  
with respect to trade receivables due to the nature and structure of the Enterprise Partnerships. An analysis of all debts which 
are past due is included in note 18. Credit risk assessments are performed when signing up new customers. Credit risk is 
mitigated to an extent by the profile of companies with whom the Group has entered into Enterprise Partnerships, being  
blue chip companies. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, the principal assets being cash and cash 
equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The Group’s treasury function only 
transacts with counterparties that have a strong investment grade rating from a credit rating agency and ensures that no 
exposure to any one institution at any given time exceeds the Board approved exposure limit.
Liquidity risk
The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to 
meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations, including organic growth and acquisition activities, and to meet any 
unforeseen obligations and opportunities. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a daily cash management 
process and through regular cash reporting. These processes consider the maturity of both the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s policy is to ensure that all projected borrowing needs are 
covered by committed facilities, maintaining minimum funding headroom defined by the Board.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had available cash of £97.9 million (2010: £91.1 million) and undrawn committed debt 
facilities of £28.5 million (2010: £28.8 million).

Price risk
The Group holds listed investments, classified as available-for-sale financial assets, which expose the Group to equity 
securities price risk. Potential investments are thoroughly analysed in respect to their past financial track record (mainly cash 
flow and return on investment), their market potential, their management and their competitors. These investments are 
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their suitability according to the Group’s risk profile.
A 5% increase or decrease in the market value of the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets would have a £1.2 million 
impact on equity (2010: £1.2 million) and no impact on the income statement.
Capital risk 
The Group’s objective in managing its capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation below a target level reviewed by the Board. The Board sets the dividend policy and reviews 
uses of cash and debt to ensure that the capital structure ratio remains within the target and therefore comfortably below the 
financial covenants contained within the Group’s debt facilities.

The Group operates in a number of regulatory regimes. The securities processing and retail investment account management 
businesses in Germany, Xchanging Transaction Bank (‘XTB’) and Fondsdepot Bank (‘FdB’), maintain full banking licences and 
are regulated under the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (‘BaFin’). The holding of full banking licenses requires 
XTB and FdB to maintain Risk and Compliance departments that ensure the German businesses comply with German banking 
laws and are appropriately capitalised and maintain liquid assets in a pre-planned and controlled manner. Operationally the 
Risk & Compliance departments report directly to the Chief Financial Officer of XTB and FdB and maintain independent 
checks and balances to ensure the operations follow all BaFin required risk and compliance processes, such as running a 
Sub-Risk Committee Board. 142 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011

Xchanging plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Company balance sheet, the Company cash 
flow statement, reconciliation of operating loss to net cash 
inflow/(outflow) from operating activities and the related 
notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 52, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Parent Company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements: 
n n give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its cash flows for 
the year then ended;
n n have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
n n have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
n n the part of the Directors’ Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
n n the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Parent Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent 
Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
n n adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
n n the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
n n certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
n n we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Xchanging plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the more important Company accounting 
policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below.
No profit and loss account has been presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
(i) Going concern
The Directors believe that preparing the financial statements on the going concern basis is appropriate based on projections 
for the foreseeable future.
(ii) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are conducted at the end  
of the first full year following acquisition and thereafter where indicators of impairment are present. As permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006, cost is the aggregate of the nominal value of the relevant number of the Company’s shares and the  
fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the share capital of the subsidiary undertakings.
(iii) Financial instruments
The accounting policy for the Company for financial instruments is the same as that shown in the Group accounting policies. 
This policy is in accordance with FRS 26, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
(iv) Dividend income
Dividends receivable from the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised when the Company’s right  
to receive payment is established.
(v) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of an equity-settled transaction is recognised as an expense over the periods in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date of the award. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Non-market vesting conditions 
are reflected in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Awards where vesting is 
conditional upon a market condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 
Equity-settled share-based compensation plans that are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are 
treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised. 
(vi) Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available in FRS 8, ‘Related party disclosures’, not to disclose 
transactions with its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings. There are no other external related parties.
2 Directors’ emoluments
Disclosure of the Directors’ remuneration is contained in the Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 69 and in note 37 of the 
Group financial statements.
3 Auditors’ remuneration
The audit fees payable in relation to the audit of the financial statements of the Company are £0.1 million (2010: £0.1 million). 
Fees paid to the auditors and their associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual 
financial statements of the Company because Group financial statements are prepared which disclose such fees on a 
consolidated basis.

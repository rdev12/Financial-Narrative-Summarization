Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
While market conditions in the group’s principal activity, commercial printing, remain highly competitive, it is pleasing to
announce substantially improved underlying results.
The figures in this paragraph exclude the exceptional items in both 2003 and 2004 referred to below. Turnover for the year
increased by 7% to £42.73m from £39.93m. Operating profit increased by 39% to £4.00m from £2.89m, representing an
operating margin of 9% (2003 – 7%). Profit before tax increased by 54% to £3.41m from £2.22m, representing a pre-tax
margin of 8% (2003 – 6%). Earnings per share increased by 57% to 8.5p from 5.4p.
The £0.34m exceptional charge in 2004 relates mainly to the costs of reorganisation and relocation of W E Baxter in May 2004
and related loss on sale of fixed assets, together with the costs of closure of the specialist greetings card finishing department
within Royle Corporate Print. The £0.90m exceptional gain in 2003 relates mainly to the sale of unused freehold properties.
After exceptional items, operating profit was up 28% at £3.70m from £2.89m, pre-tax profit was down 1% at £3.08m 
from £3.12m, and earnings per share were down 13% at 7.7p from 8.9p.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £24.94m, up from £24.77m, giving net assets per share of 92.5p, up from 
89.4p, following the purchase by the company for cancellation of 750,000 of its ordinary shares at 71.5p per share, for 
a total consideration of £0.54m. Year end net indebtedness reduced to £9.10m from £12.95m with resultant gearing of 
36% (2003 – 52%), reflecting lower than normal levels of capital expenditure at £1.13m (2003 – £3.53m) and the £1.6m
proceeds from the sale in 2003 of a freehold property in Lewes. Net interest payable at £0.59m (2003 – £0.67m) was 
covered 6.8 times (2003 – 4.3 times) by operating profit before exceptional items.
Our commercial and financial printing businesses successfully reversed the decline in sales experienced in 2003, increasing
turnover by 4% to £28.94m (2003 – £27.74m) despite the continuing weakness of demand and pressures on prices. Our 
book related businesses continue to do well, also increasing turnover, to £13.79m (2003 – £12.19m), up 13%; this reflects
good levels of demand for both our jacket and cover services as well as for mass market paperback books.
Our group continues to achieve awards success with Royle Corporate Print being voted ‘Environmental Company of the Year’
and highly commended in the ‘Report and Accounts’ category in the Printing World magazine annual awards. Fulmar Colour
similarly achieved awards success, being voted overall winner in the McNaughton Review.
The improved trading results, together with the continuing awards success, have been achieved through the strenuous efforts
of our staff and I commend them for their commitment in this competitive market.
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 3.4p per share, which, if approved at the AGM on 11 May
2005, will be paid on 18 May 2005 to those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 April 2005. Together
with the unchanged interim dividend per share of 1.8p paid on 8 November 2004, dividends per share total an unchanged
5.2p, which are covered 1.6 times (2003 – 1.0 times) by earnings per share before exceptional items.
Our commercial printing businesses have benefited from some increase in demand, but price pressure remains. Our book
related businesses operate in a more benign commercial environment. All our businesses have under-utilised capacity and 
as a result would benefit from any upturn in activity.
Jonathan Dutton, Chairman 
23 March 2005  Our COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL PRINTING businesses successfully reversed the decline in sales 
experienced in 2003, INCREASING TURNOVER BY 4% despite the continuing weakness of demand and
pressures on prices. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 7
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL PRINTING
Our commercial and financial printing operations accounted for 68% of group turnover (2003 – 69%) producing
advertising literature, corporate brochures, annual reports and overnight City financial print.
These businesses have achieved a 4% increase in sales to £28.94m (2003 – £27.74m) against a background of continuing
weakness of demand and severe price pressures.
Due to relatively high levels of investment in prior years, there was no significant capital expenditure in our commercial 
and financial printing businesses during the period under review and we do not anticipate any change during 2005.
As a result of continuing losses, W E Baxter was relocated and reorganised in May 2004 and now shares the Mitcham
premises of Pegasus Colourprint. The resultant reduced fixed costs and shared facilities benefit both companies.
Royle Corporate Print, our specialist annual report printer, achieved a 13% increase in turnover, having been successful 
in attracting additional annual reports, together with an increase in commercial work undertaken during our traditionally
quieter periods, which resulted in the more efficient use of our capacity.
Fulmar Colour, our specialist high quality commercial printer, achieved a 9% increase in turnover, having taken steps to
strengthen its sales team. This growth was further enabled by the increased utilisation of existing capacity, particularly 
of the two Heidelberg 12 colour perfecting presses installed in 2002 and 2003.
BOOK PRINTING
Demand for the group’s book cover, jacket and mass market paperback book printing services, which accounted for 
32% of group turnover (2003 – 31%), remained high throughout this period. This enabled a return to double-digit 
growth of 13%.
We announced in July 2004 the purchase of our third Timson book press, which was successfully installed in 
January 2005. In preparation for this increase in print capacity, the manning of our existing binding line was changed, 
from two shift to three shift working, in the latter part of 2004.
A further investment of £0.24m was made with the installation, during the Christmas break, of a thermal, large format,
fully automatic plate setter, capable of outputting up to 24 plates per hour, being more than three times faster than 
the previous device and therefore able to keep pace with our increased demand for plates.
These improvements in our production facilities at Bookmarque, the group’s mass market paperback book operation, 
have lifted our capacity to approximately 50 million books, against the 30 million books actually produced in 2004.
Following the completion during 2004 of a 767 sq m (8,300 sq ft) extension to our jacket and cover production facility, 
we have increased the number of our printing presses deployed in The White Quill Press to five by transfer of a 6 colour
Speedmaster from elsewhere in the group following some reorganisation. Our group continues to achieve AWARDS SUCCESS with ROYLE CORPORATE PRINT being voted
‘Environmental Company of the Year’ and highly commended in the ‘Report and Accounts’ category in the
Printing World magazine annual awards. FULMAR COLOUR similarly achieved awards success, being voted
overall winner in the McNaughton Review. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
9
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
BOOK PRINTING CONTINUED
Further investment was made during the year with the installation of two fully automatic thermal platesetters, replacing 
two older units coming to the end of their useful life. Additionally, an automatic cutting station was installed in 
July 2004 to enable us to keep pace with the rapidly increasing numbers of paperback book covers being produced.
FREEHOLD PROPERTY
The group sold, in 2003, a vacant freehold property in Lewes, previously occupied by W E Baxter, for an initial
consideration of £1.6m in cash. An additional subsequent minimum payment of £0.8m becomes due on receiving 
suitable planning consent. Conditional consent was granted in January 2005, subject to the completion of a section 
106 agreement.
OUTLOOK
Both our commercial printing businesses and our book production facilities are well organised and well invested, with
under-utilised capacity. Our group is therefore well prepared to gain advantage, should the modestly improved trading
conditions experienced during 2004, by the commercial printing businesses, continue through 2005.
Mike Taylor, Chief Executive

grounds of their disabilities.

basis in preparing the financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Shareholders will find on pages 44 to 46 the notice of the forthcoming annual general meeting of the company to be 
held on 11 May 2005. 
In addition to the ordinary business of the meeting, three resolutions (numbered 6 to 8) are proposed as special business. DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
CONTINUED
12
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
AUTHORITY OF DIRECTORS TO ALLOT SHARES
Resolutions 6 and 7 are similar to the authorities given to the directors at the last annual general meeting of the company.
By law, directors are not permitted to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) unless authorised to do so by
shareholders. In addition, directors require specific authority from shareholders before allotting new shares (or rights 
in respect of shares) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 6 gives the directors the necessary authority for the period of five years from the date of the passing of such
resolution to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £449,234 (being equal to approximately one-third of 
the issued share capital of the company). 
Resolution 7 empowers the directors, for the period of five years from the date of the passing of such resolution, to 
allot shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis, up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £67,385, which is the equivalent of 5% of the issued share capital of the company. It also enables the directors, 
in the case of an issue by way of rights, to deal with fractional entitlements and to make such exclusions or other
arrangements as may be appropriate to resolve legal, regulatory or practical problems which might arise, particularly 
with regard to overseas shareholders.
It is intended that these authorities and powers are renewed at successive annual general meetings.
There is no present intention of issuing any ordinary shares, except perhaps in connection with the company’s share 
option scheme. As at 23 March 2005 the company holds no equity securities in treasury.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES 
Resolution 8 renews the authority for the company to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 163 of 
the Companies Act 1985) on the London Stock Exchange up to an aggregate of 2,695,405 ordinary shares (equivalent 
to 10% of the issued share capital of the company) at a minimum price per ordinary share of 5p and a maximum of 
105% of the average of the middle market quotations of the ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange
Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which that ordinary share is contracted to 
be purchased. This proposal should not be taken as an indication that the company will purchase shares at any particular 
price or indeed at all, and the directors will only consider making purchases if they believe that such purchases would 
result in an increase in earnings per share and are in the best interests of the shareholders.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company, or, if earlier, the expiry 
of 15 months from the date of the passing of such resolution.
It is intended to renew this authority and power at successive annual general meetings.
AUDITORS
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming annual
general meeting.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board.
D J Harris FCA, Secretary
23 March 2005 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 13
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
The directors support The Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003 (the ‘Combined Code’). 
The board sets out its report on how the group has applied the principles and whether it has complied with the 
Combined Code during the year.
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
DIRECTORS
The board is responsible for the group’s strategic direction, and its operating and financial performance. The board
comprised three executive and two independent non-executive directors (three between 30 June and 28 September), 
all of whom met on eight occasions in 2004, following a formal agenda. 
Directors’ biographies are given on page 2.
The separate roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly defined. The Chairman conducts board and shareholder
meetings and ensures that all directors are properly briefed. The Chief Executive is responsible for developing and 
co-ordinating the business and implementing group strategy.
There is an agreed procedure for the directors to take independent professional advice at the company’s expense, 
to have access to the Company Secretary and receive appropriate training where necessary, including an induction 
on appointment.
All directors are required to retire by rotation at least every three years when they can offer themselves for re-election if eligible.
All members of the remuneration and nominations committee met once during 2004. They monitor, review and make
recommendations to the board on all elements of the remuneration and performance of the directors of the company.
They also consider the award of options under the company share option plan and make recommendations to the board 
in respect of the appointment of directors of the company. The committee consists solely of non-executive directors, and 
its terms of reference are available from the Company Secretary on request. The report on remuneration is set out on 
pages 16 and 17.
Annual performance appraisals of the executive directors are conducted by the remuneration and nominations committee, 
and feedback given to the individuals throughout the year. The executive directors similarly appraise the performance of the
non-executive directors. There is ongoing evaluation of the board and its committees, by the directors, throughout the year.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
The company encourages meaningful dialogue with both its institutional and private investors. The executive directors
undertake presentations following the announcement of the interim and final results, and the directors are available 
for comment throughout the year and at the annual general meeting. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED
14
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT 
The responsibilities of the directors and auditors are set out on pages 15 and 18.
The board has established the necessary procedures to implement the Combined Code provisions, except as mentioned
below. These have been in place throughout 2004 and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group and this
process is regularly reviewed.
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s systems of internal control and reviewed them for their
effectiveness during the year by examining reports from individual directors and the external auditors. Any system of 
internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The principal components of the systems for planning, executing, controlling and monitoring the group’s activities in 
order to achieve its objectives and minimise major risks are:
• an organisational structure with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority;
• a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system which enables the board to evaluate the performance of 
the group on a monthly basis and take action where necessary on a timely basis;
• continual review and development of the group’s internal control, risk management and management information systems;
• clearly defined guidelines for capital investment.
Steps continue to be taken to further embed internal control and risk management procedures into the operations 
of the business and to deal with areas of improvement which come to management’s and the board’s attention.
The board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function but does not consider it necessary at the current time.
All members of the audit committee met twice during 2004. They assist the board in discharging its duty to ensure that the
financial statements presented by the company to its shareholders conform with all legal requirements and that the group’s 
systems of internal control and whistle blowing procedures are adequate. They consider the re-appointment of auditors,
their fees, and the scope and findings of their audit. The committee consists solely of non-executive directors, 
and its terms of reference are available from the Company Secretary on request.
An account of the group’s position and prospects is given in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review on
pages 5 to 9.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2004 the company has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code except for the following matter:
• directors‘ notice and contract periods are set at more than one year as explained on page 16. STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 15
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the 
profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 16
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the auditors to report to the company’s members on the
‘auditable part’ of the directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). All information relating to
the ‘auditable part’ of the report is shown in note 4 to the accounts. In all other respects the report contains unaudited
information.
Information about the emoluments and share options of the directors is given in note 4 to the accounts. Their interests in
the share capital of the company are shown on pages 10 and 11.
The remuneration policy for executive directors is controlled by the remuneration and nominations committee of the 
board, comprising the independent non-executive directors, J K McKay and J D Dutton. Their aim is to ensure that the
remuneration packages for executive directors are designed to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals. The
packages reflect the executives’ own responsibilities and the performance of the group as a whole.
The remuneration policy is as follows:
• competitive salaries are provided by reference to information on similar positions in the printing and related industries;
• each executive director will receive an annual bonus if the percentage increase in the group’s earnings per share in that
year exceeds a threshold of the percentage increase in the retail price index in that period plus 3%, such bonus to be at
a rate of 1.5% of the executive director’s basic salary for each 1% that the earnings per share exceeds the threshold;
• where circumstances exist beyond the scope of the policy (such as negative earnings per share in the prior year), the
remuneration and nominations committee will use its discretion to determine whether any bonus is payable and, if so,
the amount of such bonus. In forming its view, the committee will take account of the bonus arrangements set out in
the directors’ contracts;
• the company makes fixed payments into the group’s main defined contribution pension scheme having taken account 
of the level of basic salary;
• directors may be granted options under the share option plan and hold options under the sharesave scheme;
• a benefits package is provided including an appropriate company car, or alternative, and medical expense and
permanent health insurances;
• service contracts are of two years duration and are terminable by not less than two years notice by either party. Whilst
the committee acknowledges that there is a case for setting one year notice and contract periods, the committee
considers the current arrangements to be in the best interests of the group in maintaining the services of its key
directors. Any compensation payments will be determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole in line with fees paid to 
non-executive directors of similar companies. They are normally appointed under fixed term contracts of two years 
duration and are terminable by not less than one years notice by either party, except where mentioned below.  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

The committee also approves the terms, conditions and allocation of the company share option and sharesave schemes.
Options are granted under the schemes in phases to offer long term incentives to the group’s employees (including the
company’s directors who participate with the other employees) and to allow them to have a stake in its growth.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS 
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the company’s directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are 
also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the annual report including the directors’
remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and that part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements
and auditing standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report 
is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company and other members of the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the July 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and 
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all 
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures. We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above
year as described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the group, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of
the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group 
as at 31 December 2004 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended and the financial statements and the part
of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular
accounting policies adopted are described below.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings for 
all financial periods ended 31 December, except that subsidiaries held exclusively with a view to subsequent resale are
excluded from consolidation. For acquisitions made in the year the acquisition method of accounting is used. The results 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the separable net assets
acquired. For acquisitions made before 1998 goodwill has been eliminated against the consolidated profit and loss account
reserve as a matter of accounting policy. This goodwill would be charged in the consolidated profit and loss account on
subsequent disposal of the businesses to which it related. Goodwill arising on subsequent acquisitions is capitalised and
written off over its estimated useful life.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. On other assets depreciation is
provided on cost or net book value in order to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful lives of 
the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
• Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings – 2% per annum
• Short leasehold land and buildings – over the term of the lease
• Plant and machinery – 10 – 25% per annum
• Motor vehicles – 20% per annum
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 10 – 25% per annum.
The group capitalises directly attributable interest on all tangible fixed assets in the course of construction. Rates of
capitalisation depend on whether a specific loan has been taken out (when the actual interest rate and interest paid is
used), or where the construction is financed by general borrowings (when a weighted average rate is calculated on all 
non-specific borrowings).
INVESTMENTS
Shares in group companies are stated in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment in value. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

25
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STOCKS
Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes materials, direct labour
and appropriate production overheads.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates
and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in
periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing
differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The group manages its financial risks using a limited number of financial instruments. These comprise cash and money
market deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases and other debtors and creditors arising directly from operations.
The group does not undertake any trading in financial instruments.
LEASES AND HIRE PURCHASE CONTRACTS
Assets obtained under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion 
to the capital element outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged to income in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
PENSION COSTS
For the defined benefit scheme the expected cost of providing pensions, as calculated periodically by professionally
qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of the 
scheme members in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected 
future pensionable payroll.
Payments to the defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
2 TURNOVER
Turnover represents amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the group’s ordinary
activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax. The turnover and pre-tax profit, all of which arises 
in the United Kingdom, is attributable to the group’s principal activity. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Deferred tax has not been provided in respect of gains realised that have been rolled over into the acquisition cost of
replacement assets. This tax will become payable if the replacement assets are sold and further rollover relief is not
obtained. The estimated amount of tax that would become payable by the company and the group in these circumstances
is £167,000 (2003 – £167,000).
Group deferred tax assets of £381,000 (2003 – £435,000) and £1,289,000 (2003 – £1,289,000) 
(company £ nil (2003 – £ nil) and £868,000 (2003 – £868,000)) have not been recognised in respect of timing 
differences relating to revenue losses and capital losses respectively as there is insufficient evidence that the assets 
will be recovered due to the uncertainty of the availability of future profits against which the losses can be recovered. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

The group’s banking facilities are secured by legal charges over the assets of the group. The bank loans not wholly payable
within five years are repayable by monthly or quarterly instalments, and bear interest at 1% or 1.1% over the banks’ 
base rate.
The parent company has guaranteed certain bank loans, overdrafts and obligations under finance leases and hire purchase
contracts of the subsidiaries. The extent of this liability at the balance sheet date was £6,878,000 (2003 – £10,179,000).
However, the directors consider it to be highly improbable that any liability will crystallise. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

21 PENSION SCHEMES
The group operates a number of funded pension schemes which are administered independently of the group’s finances. 
The schemes covering the largest number of employees are of the defined contribution type. The group also operates a
defined benefit scheme.
The pension cost of the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries using the
attained age method. The main actuarial assumptions used in the most recent formal valuation were:
• an investment return of 6.5% per annum for pre-retirement and 5.5% for post-retirement
• salary increases of 4.5% per annum
• pension accrued before 1 April 1988: no increase per annum on non-GMP
• pension accrued between 1 April 1988 and 6 April 1997: 3% increase per annum on non-GMP
• pension accrued post 6 April 1997: 3% increase per annum.
The contribution levels are maintained in accordance with the advice of the pension scheme’s actuarial advisers at 12.2%.
The most recent formal valuation was at 1 April 2002. At that date the market value of the scheme’s assets was £5.64 million
and the actuarial valuation of the assets was sufficient to cover 109% of the benefits that had accrued to members after
allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The scheme also met the Minimum Funding Requirement set out in the
Pensions Act 1995.
The disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits, are set out below; the scheme assets are
valued at market value and the liabilities are estimated by an actuary using the projected unit method. The financial
assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities by the actuary under FRS 17 are:

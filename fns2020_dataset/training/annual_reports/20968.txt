Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 02
At Arrow Global, we are the debt experts, 
specialising in the purchase and collection 
of non-performing loans – NPLs.
We are a regulated business and use 
sophisticated analytics to identify, acquire 
and manage defaulted consumer credit 
portfolios, primarily from banks and other 
financial institutions, such as credit  
card companies, and we have a simple, 
powerful ethos.
We believe that by putting the interests 
of our customers – those struggling with 
debt – first, we can also best serve the 
interests of creditors, our own business 
and people, and those of our investors, 
partners and society at large.
In the 10 years since our founding, we 
have applied this ethos to achieve strong 
and sustained growth, becoming one of 
Europe’s leading purchasers and managers 
of debt.
A business taking flight
The point of the arrow 
The arrow is a symbol of our business. At its 
point, we are here to purchase and manage 
debt in a way that benefits our customers, 
our business and all our stakeholders. 
Behind this are the culture, craft and 
expertise that drive our business: our 
customer-led ethos, our data driven business 
model, our strategic and innovative 
approach to purchasing and managing debt, 
the high standards we set, the structure of 
our business and above all, the quality, skills 
and experience of our people. It’s the 
fletching – the feathered flights – behind 
the point of the arrow that guides it and 
enables us to deliver on our promises and 
achieve positive results.
Over the past year, we have continued to 
move forward at a pace, diversifying  
in both geographies and asset classes.
As part of this process, we have acquired 
and invested in further debt collection 
companies, seizing strategic opportunities 
and improving our already strong 
business model.
There is the sense of a step-change, as the 
Company’s growth seems set to continue 
and accelerate, a feeling of never standing 
still, and of a successful and dynamic 
business ready to move on to the next 
stage of its evolution.
Introduction Overview
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 03
Arrow Global Group Plc (the ‘Group’) continues 
to target profitable growth in both the UK  
and mainland Europe to ‘achieve our vision’ of 
becoming Europe’s leading purchaser and 
manager of debt
In 2015, Arrow Global grew significantly.  
We successfully integrated Capquest in the 
UK, and in April, we also acquired Whitestar 
and Gesphone in Portugal. 
During the year, we made further 
investments in Portugal and acquired a 
number of portfolios in the Netherlands. 
We saw positive results from the first  
full year of our 15% interest in French market 
leader, MCS. 
We have a clear strategy in place to help us achieve this, which reflects the  
core strengths and direction of the business.
As a result of our acquisitions, we now 
employ approximately 750 people and have 
total assets under management in excess  
of £19 .2 billion.

In 2015, Arrow Global continued  
to grow, diversifying by asset class,  
geography and revenue stream Overview
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 07
Measured growth that pays dividends 
2015 saw us celebrate our 10th anniversary 
and another year of strong results.  
The Group remains focused on pursuing  
a programme of both organic and 
acquisitive growth in a controlled and 
deliberate manner. 
We are confident that the foundations  
laid during the year will see us continue to 
prosper, and aligned to our on going success, 
have proposed a final dividend of 5.4p, 
bringing the full-year dividend to 7.1p, an 
increase of 39.4% on 2014. 
With our acquisitions in Portugal and our 
continued growth in the UK, we were able  
to welcome more than 250 new colleagues 
to the Group, and I would like to thank 
them and all our colleagues for a strong 
year which yielded record results. 
Changes to the board as the  
business grows
During the year, we re-shaped our board  
of directors to ensure that it was well-
equipped to continue to guide the business 
as it grows, diversifies and delivers on its 
proven strategy. 
In March, Lan Tu was appointed as a 
non-executive director and also to the audit 
and risk and nomination committees. She 
brings a wealth of experience to the business 
in European financial services, data, digital 
and technology arenas. 
In April, we announced changes in the 
responsibilities of Arrow Global founder, 
Zachary Lewy, who stepped down from the 
board to allow him to focus on leading  
the expanded origination team, and on his 
board positions with our recently acquired 
European subsidiaries and interests. 
At our annual general meeting in June,  
Sir George Mathewson retired from  
the board. As Chairman of Arrow Global  
from 2009 to 2013, Sir George guided  
the Company through its successful IPO  
in October 2013, and then became our  
Senior Independent Director. He made  
a significant contribution to the success  
of the Company and left with the gratitude  
of the entire board.
We were delighted to announce on  
3 March 2016 the appointment of Maria Luís 
Albuquerque as non-executive director 
with effect from 7 March 2016. As a serving 
member of the Portuguese Parliament who 
has held senior finance and treasury positions 
in the Portuguese public sector, she brings  
a wealth of international and financial sector 
experience and will complement the existing 
experience of the board.
Full authorisation. Fair and  
balanced reporting
During 2015 we submitted our Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) authorisation 
applications and look forward to receiving 
confirmation of authorisation later in 2016. 
We continue to engage with our regulator 
and welcome the significant changes that  
it has helped bring to the industry as a whole.
Having reviewed the information in this 
report, my fellow directors and I confirm that 
the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Chairman’s statement
We increased our expertise and holdings in areas of strategic focus such as secured loans, 
became the clear market leader in Portugal, as well as significantly increasing our portfolio 
holdings in the Netherlands. In the UK, we retained our position as a market leader and 
added a number of new clients to our franchise.
As we realised the benefits of the Capquest acquisition, and started to realise the benefits 
of the Whitestar and Gesphone acquisitions, we increased our servicing revenues and 
further diversified the business' income streams – a trend we expect to continue into  
2016 and beyond. Overview

Chief executive officer
3 March 2016 Overview
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 09
Chief executive  
officer’s review 
We continued to lay the foundations of 
further success by increasing both the 
volume and diversity of the assets we hold, 
while at the same time, increasing our 
servicing capabilities.
By focusing on doing the right thing  
for our customers, we have made significant 
strides towards achieving our vision of 
becoming Europe’s leading purchaser and 
manager of debt.
Our proven strategy continues to 
provide the roadmap for all our activities. 
We are already a leading player in the UK 
and Portuguese markets, and we have a 15% 
interest in the French market leader, MCS, 
and have increased our asset base in the 
Netherlands. We have also invested in our 
servicing capabilities, significantly enhancing 
our client and customer proposition.
In summary, we are a well diversified 
business that continues to pursue disciplined 
growth and remains confident in its  
ability to deliver growth in operating cash 
flow and EPS and a ROE percentage in the 
mid-twenties.
Transforming the customer journey
This year, we developed a new set of values, 
designed to better reflect the evolving 
culture of our growing business (see page 12). 
Importantly, they outline the behaviours 
we aspire to when striving to achieve our 
mission of helping our customers repay 
their debts in a timely and affordable way.
In 2015, we also implemented a number 
of new initiatives which will further  
enhance our customer journey. Our new 
integrated customer service platform went 
live, we enhanced our digital offering and  
we continued to rationalise our servicer panel 
to create a core group of highly capable 
and compliant specialist providers. 
Improving performance and profitability
During the year, our profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders increased 
by 73.8% to £31.7 million. 
We grew the Group’s underlying net 
income by 19.6% to £35.4 million, delivering 
an underlying return on equity (ROE)  
of 26.5%.
We also achieved a record level of organic 
portfolio investments of £176.3 million,  
with total portfolio purchases for the year 
totalling £180.3 million, well in excess of  
our 2015 replacement rate of £68 million.
2015 is a balanced vintage of portfolio 
purchases, and we are particularly pleased 
at investing at an expected average 
120-month cash-on-cash multiple of 2.0 
times (84-month 1.7 times) from date of 
purchase. Importantly, 32.3% of purchases 
by purchase price were in secured assets, 
more than in any previous year of our 
Group’s history. 
Enhancing our servicing and our portfolios 
Following the acquisitions of Capquest at 
the end of 2014 and Whitestar and Gesphone 
in the first half of 2015, we significantly 
enhanced our servicing capabilities and 
during the year our servicing businesses 
generated £14.7 million of revenue. This is up 
from £1.9 million in 2014 and we expect 
servicing revenues to be circa 15% of Group 
revenue in 2016.
Our new portfolio purchases increased 
our total purchased loan portfolios by 
22.8% to £586.3 million as at 31 December 
2015. Our 120-month Estimated Remaining 
Collection (ERC) increased by 12.8% to 
£1,224.5 million and our 84-month ERC 
increased by 14.6% to £1,028.6 million.
In 2015, we also successfully issued a 
€110 million bond, ensuring we continue to 
have the right capital structure in place to 
help us grow.
Strength in four core markets
We now operate and hold significant assets 
in four core markets, with each of them 
contributing to our strong results in 2015:
•  In the UK, as well as integrating the 
Capquest business, we successfully migrated 
the servicing of the Erudio Student Loans 
portfolio in-house, and continued to benefit 
from a number of forward-flow purchase 
agreements
•  In Portugal, in addition to the purchase  
of two servicing businesses, we made 
significant portfolio purchases, especially  
in secured assets. We also entered into  
a strategic origination and servicing 
partnership with one of our key fund partners, 
and secured a number of deals from the 
agreement throughout the year
•  In the Netherlands, we continued to  
build our presence with the purchase of  
two portfolios
•  In France, we saw our first full-year results 
from our 15% interest in market leader, 
MCS, and we saw our first positive results 
from this investment
Addressing regulation. Deepening 
understanding
We continue to use data and additional 
research to deepen our understanding of 
our customers and have completed a  
new piece of research called Debt Britain 
(see page 22 and 23 for more detail),  
which provides insight into the current debt 
landscape, as well as making predictions 
about what will happen as lending increases 
in line with improving economic conditions.
In 2014, we saw the change in regulator 
from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to  
the FCA, and as our new regulator gets to 
grips with the consumer credit sector, we 
have continued to see a wave of consolidation 
reflecting the high cost of meeting 
regulatory standards.
The year ahead
We will continue to evolve our business 
model to make sure we offer our customers 
and clients the service that best suits  
their needs.
We are a well diversified business with  
a strong origination pipeline – starting  
2016 with awarded purchases of £71 million.
We are confident in maintaining 
portfolio investments at approximately 
twice our average annual replacement  
rate of £78 million. This, combined with the 
continued delivery of the Capquest and 
Whitestar businesses, supports continued 
high earnings growth in 2016, and we  
remain confident of our ability to deliver  
a medium-term ROE percentage in the 
mid-twenties and a progressive  
dividend policy. Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 10
The debt purchase and management 
industry plays a key role in helping create 
an efficient credit market
How we generate value –  
our business model
We generate value in our business in  
one of two ways:
•  We buy debt at a discount from its  
face value and use our expertise in data,  
analytics and collections to help us 
establish affordable repayment plans and 
settlements with our customers. We  
expect to collect approximately twice  
our investment over a period of  
10 years
•  We also advise on and manage debt 
portfolios on behalf of others and charge  
a fee for this service

economics (£m)
Debt purchase markets in Europe
The size of the European debt purchase 
market has grown significantly in recent 
years. Industry reports from Deloitte and 
PwC estimate the total value of debt sold  
in the European market in 2015 at between 
approximately €105 billion and €160 billion, 
significantly up from the €46 billion estimated 
sold in Europe in 2012. 
There continues to be a number of 
structural and economic drivers contributing 
to this increase, including, but not limited to:
•  Increase in the sale of government  
held debts
•  Increased regulation and associated  
capital adequacy requirements, especially 
for financial institutions, such as the  
Asset Quality Review (AQR) and accounting 
changes, such as IFRS 9
•  On going consolidation amongst financial 
institutions (and subsequent disposal of 
non-core assets)
•  On going consolidation within the debt 
purchase industry, with resulting 
opportunity to purchase portfolios in the 
secondary market
•  Efficient debt purchasers being able to pay 
sellers attractive prices
•  Generally improving economic conditions 
in many European markets have seen a 
corresponding increase in the volume of 
lending and thus an associated increase  
in new NPLs coming to market
By passing the debt on to us, our clients, who are typically financial services institutions, are 
able to focus on their core activity of lending, safe in the knowledge their customers are  
in good hands. Our ultimate aim is to help our customers clear their debts and rehabilitate 
their credit file, which in turn, allows them to gain access to more affordable main-stream 
financial products. For our customers, we provide a number important services. In the UK, 
for example, we do not charge interest or fees once a customer account is in arrears or in 
default. When we buy a non-performing loan, in effect, we freeze the amount owed. 
We then look to make contact with the customer, so we can fully understand their 
circumstances and then, and only then, will we agree a payment plan that will help them 
repay their debts in a timely and affordable way. We are patient owners of customer  
debt, as we look to establish long-term relationships with clients and customers alike.

The acquisitions we made in the UK (Capquest) and mainland Europe (Whitestar and 
Gesphone) have added to and enhanced our existing offering. 
We continue to operate in the traditional debt purchase arena, buying debt portfolios  
at a discount with a focus on collecting more than double our initial investment over a 
10-year period. However, in the last year, we have also significantly grown our servicing 
solutions and our ability to offer advisory services.

Delivering on our strategy 
Throughout 
the year, we 
have remained 
firmly focused 
on delivering 
on our five-
point strategy 
1
To be a top 3 player in each of our  
chosen markets, building on our market 
leading platforms.
We continue to enjoy long-term relationships 
with our creditor partners in both the debt 
purchase and third-party servicing markets. 
A comprehensive compliance and risk 
management framework is core to our 
offering. In an industry that continues to 
consolidate, we benefit from a good 
reputation for consistency of service. As one 
of the larger players in the European 
market, we are seen as a sustainable business 
and are one of the net beneficiaries of the 
consolidation process.
We actively participate in industry bodies 
that help lead change in legislation and 
best practice. In the UK, our executives hold 
senior positions in organisations such as the 
Credit Services Association (CSA), the 
national association for our industry, and the 
Steering Committee on Reciprocity (SCOR), 
which administers the usage of credit data.
•  For debt purchase in the UK, we remain on 
the panels of all the major financial service 
providers. We have rationalised our servicer 
panel to ensure greater oversight
•  In Portugal, we have established a leading 
position, acquiring servicers with more than 
eight and 15 years experience respectively, 
and have set up a strategic origination and 
servicing contract. The agreement provides 
for long-term sustainable revenues
•  In both the UK and Portugal, we benefit from 
industry leading in-house servicing 
capabilities. In Portugal, we are the market 
leading debt servicing business, with circa 
€6.8 billion of assets under management, of 
which circa €3.4 billion are owned
•  In the Netherlands, following a small initial 
investment in 2014, we have also made 
significant progress. In Q4, we purchased 
loan portfolios with a face value of 
approximately €300 million
•  In France, we saw positive results from the 
first full year of our 15% interest in French 
market leader, MCS
•  Across the Group we have 100+ creditor 
client relationships
•  And in 2015, we increased our total purchased 
loan portfolios from £477 .5 million in 2014 
to £586.3 million (excluding £23.5 million of

120-month ERC increasing to £1,224.5 million 
(84-month ERC £1,028.6 million). This 
increase was driven by organic portfolio 
purchases of £176.3 million

To focus on delivering strong returns 
through deep understanding of our 
customers and clients.
We purchase portfolios where we believe  
we have the strongest competitive 
advantage and which offer the best returns 
for our investment, and we source attractive 
portfolio investments from a wide range  
of leading institutions.
We operate a well-defined underwriting 
and investment process and have a robust 
governance structure in place, helping to 
ensure that we acquire portfolios in line with 
our risk-adjusted target returns. 
The investment process draws on expertise 
from across the Group. As a business, we 
have long-term capital in place that provides 
on going funding and allows us to take 
advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Because of the significant portfolio 
assets we hold, and the unique data systems 
at our disposal, when we assess a portfolio, 
we are able to identify and match a large 
percentage of its customers. This allows us 
to price more accurately and supports us  
in treating customers fairly when we look to 
collect on the portfolio. 
We target a net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of 3.8 times and cash interest cover  
of more than 4 times and a ROE percentage 
in the mid-twenties. 
•   Profit attributable to equity shareholders 
up 73.8% and underlying net income up

20.3 pence (2014: 17 .0 pence)
•  Total purchases in 2015 achieved a gross 
cash-on-cash multiple of 2.0 times over  
120 month and 1.7 times over 84 months

To be industry leaders in data  
and analytics.
We are continuously looking to evolve our 
data assets and models to keep improving 
our understanding of our customers’ 
individual circumstances. The volume, 
accuracy and richness of the data we  
have access to is key. As well as developing 
our own in-house tools and data sets, we 
also invest in third party raw data.
Data analytics informs decision making 
throughout our business. It not only helps 
inform our initial investment decision, but 
allows us to ensure the best contact strategy 
and treatments for our customers. It also 
and makes sure that, when we do use third 
party servicers, we are placing the 
customer with the servicer best placed to 
help them. 
We believe that superior data provides  
a competitive advantage. It allows us to pay 
a fair price for a portfolio whilst still 
maintaining our returns.
•  The number of records in our Proprietary 
Collection Bureau (PCB), our unique data 
matching tool designed in conjunction with 
Experian, has grown to 22.5 million (2014: 
18.5 million)
•  Our data driven model is constantly evolving 
and PCB now works alongside other elements 
of a wider data warehouse developed after 
our acquisition of Capquest. All of this feeds 
into our new integrated IT platform 
•  For a typical UK financial services portfolio, 
we are able to match approximately 50%  
of records. We therefore know or already 
have a relationship with this proportion  
of the portfolio
•  In Portugal, we now have over 650,000 
owned customer accounts. In 2015, match 
rates on portfolio sales in Portugal reached 
approximately 30%
•  After two significant portfolio purchases  
in the Netherlands in Q4 2015, we have 
substantially enhanced our data capabilities 
in the geography and now hold information 
on customers across multiple asset classes, 
including secured, unsecured, commercial 
real estate, and telco. These represent 
approximately 40,000 customer accounts
4
To transform the customer journey 
within our industry and deliver great 
customer outcomes.
We work with our customers, leading debt 
charities, industry bodies and third party 
research agencies to help us understand our 
customers’ needs. We aim to establish 
long-term affordable repayment plans, which 
help our customers rehabilitate their credit 
listing and gain access to more affordable 
mainstream financial products.
Through our data models, we are able to 
build consolidated customer profiles that 
reflect customers’ current circumstances and 
invest in leading customer service platforms 
to ensure that all our customers get the 
best service.
In the UK, our collections colleagues are 
rewarded based on the customer outcomes 
they achieve, rather than the amount  
they collect. 
•  2015 saw further development of our digital 
capability, with a significant increase in the 
number of customers choosing to interact 
with and repay us online
•  In the UK, our customer net promoter score 
(NPS), a measure of customer satisfaction 
on a scale of 0-9 , regularly exceeds 6.5, which 
is a strong performance given the nature  
of the relationship
•  In the UK, our new fully integrated customer 
service platform gives us greater flexibility 
to work across multiple asset classes, 
performing and non-performing loans.  
This allows us to develop a true single 
customer view and assist in making more 
informed collections decisions
•  In the UK, we commissioned our new  
‘Debt Britain’ research, which built on our 
previous barriers-to-entry study and has 
highlighted where those in financial difficulty 
can struggle and the impact debt can have 
on their lives
•  In the Credit Today Debt Collection  
Awards 2015, where we were named Debt 
Purchase & Collection Provider of the Year 
– UK/Europe, the criteria judged included 
‘positive, appropriate and improving 
customer outcomes’
•  In Portugal, predominantly a litigated 
collections market, we are piloting a number 
of initiatives designed to lessen the use of 
litigation and reduce the stigma
•  Every collections colleague receives specialist 
training in handling vulnerable customers 
and all collection staff regularly undertake 
refresher courses
5
To diversify the business.
A major part of our strategy is to further 
diversify the business by investing in  
new geographies and asset classes, and  
by adding additional services to our 
business offering. 
We have an established approach to 
purchasing ‘pilot’ portfolios in new 
geographies and asset classes across Europe, 
to understand the market and potential 
collection capabilities and returns.
Our flexible business model gives us  
the ability to enter new geographies and 
asset classes in a controlled and low-risk 
manner. By partnering with specialist 
servicers and our fund partners, who often 
have existing knowledge of the markets, 
we can diversify our business confident in 
the knowledge that we have the right 
strategic relationships in place.
•  We have opened up new markets and 
pioneered new deals. In Portugal, in 2014, 
we were the first to purchase NPL loan 
portfolios from a leading domestic 
Portuguese bank, post credit crisis. Then, in 
2015, in partnership with one of our fund 
partners, we became the first to be involved 
in the purchase and outsourcing of a major 
bank’s collections operations
•  In Portugal, we bought the Whitestar and 
Gesphone servicing businesses
•  In the UK in 2015, we bought a portfolio of 
secured assets from a challenger bank, and 
we also acquired more of the Erudio 
Student Loans portfolio
•  We continued to develop forward flow/
committed purchasing contracts, with  
a number of our contracts progressing into 
2017 and beyond
•  In the Netherlands, we have progressed 
from a pilot investment phase, completing 
a number of portfolio investments in Q4 
2015, which means we now operate across 
numerous asset classes in this geography
•  Overall, in 2015, we achieved a 34% and 66% 
split of purchases by purchase price in  
the UK and mainland Europe respectively
•  Across the Group, we grew our servicing 
revenue from £1.9 million in 2014 to  
£14.7 million
•  Our service contracts provide long-term 
revenue, with some extending as far as  
10 years Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 16
Principal risks and uncertainties 
At Arrow Global, we have 
an enterprise-wide risk 
management framework, 
which sits alongside the 
strategic business plan and 
is designed to support the 
identification, assessment, 
management and control 
of the principal risks that 
threaten the achievement 
of our business objectives
The overall framework is underpinned by our risk appetite statements and  
a suite of high level risk policies. Risk is governed by the board, executive 
management and various risk committees, and the Group has a formal three 
lines of defence model, with third line provided by Deloitte LLP, our  
internal auditor.
Our principal risks are categorised as strategic, conduct, operational and 
financial. The disclosures below should not be regarded as a comprehensive 
list of all the risks and uncertainties facing the Group, but rather provide  
a summary of some of the key areas that could have the biggest impact.
1
Strategic risk
The risk to earnings arising from  
changes in the business environment  
and from adverse business decisions, 
improper implementation of decisions  
or lack of responsiveness to changes  
in the business environment.
The Group’s growth strategy is primarily 
based on the future purchase of, and 
collection from, distressed loan portfolios. 
Changes in the economic, political or 
regulatory environment could impact our 
ability to collect from portfolios, or the 
amount of debt portfolios that are sold. 
The Group is also exposed to Eurozone 
economic uncertainty through its 
investment in mainland Europe. 
Negative attention and news regarding 
the debt collection industry and/or the 
Group’s collections activity may impact our 
reputation and therefore the Group’s  
ability to acquire portfolios and customers’ 
willingness to repay the debt that the 
Group acquires.
Key mitigating actions
Management monitor the economic, 
political and regulatory environments in 
which we operate to influence future 
strategy. In addition, appropriate currency 
liquidity management and scenario 
planning is in place. 
Strong relationships have been developed 
with our creditor client base in order to 
mitigate the risk of reduced debt purchase 
opportunities in the market, and our 
reputational risk is managed by meeting all 
regulatory requirements and jurisdictional 
industry best practice.
2
Conduct risk
The risk of inappropriate strategy, systems, 
behaviour, or processes that leads  
to poor customer outcomes or impacts 
market integrity.
In the UK, we operate in a highly regulated 
environment and any action that leads  
to poor customer outcomes or customer 
detriment could lead to our inability to 
secure or maintain FCA authorisation, result 
in regulatory censure, financial loss and 
reputational damage to our brand. Poor 
customer outcomes or customer detriment 
could arise through the debt collection 
activities within our in-house operations or 
the third-party servicer network of collection 
agencies, whether we are collecting  
debt which we have acquired or on behalf  
of clients. Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 17
The Group is exposed to a range of 
financial risks including; market risk as  
a result of foreign exchange and interest 
rate fluctuations; funding and liquidity  
risk as a result of our funding model; credit 
risk through our use of counterparties;  
and investment risk through new  
portfolio purchases.
Key mitigating actions
The Group’s overarching financial risk 
management strategy is governed by  
a robust policy framework and is overseen 
by the treasury and tax committee, which  
is a delegated committee from the board 
and executive risk committees. 
The Group aims to mitigate foreign 
exchange risk (a market risk) by matching 
foreign currency assets with foreign 
currency liabilities. The Group manages 
remaining exposures to foreign exchange 
at a Group level principally through the  
use of forward contracts. Interest rate risk 
is managed principally using interest  
rate swaps.
Funding and liquidity risk is managed 
through matching the maturity of our 
funding facilities with the maturity of our 
assets; forecasting funding requirements 
and applying appropriate stress testing, and 
ensuring that we maintain a balanced 
maturity profile of debt facilities. We are 
highly cash generative and aim to maintain 
a flexible cost base. Portfolio investment  
is largely discretionary and this provides  
us with a large degree of control over  
working capital.
Counterparty credit risk is managed 
through regular monitoring of the quality 
of new and existing counterparties and  
of our exposure to each. Counterparty risk 
with debt sellers is managed through 
warranties. Credit risk is taken on through 
the purchase of customer debt and is 
governed by the performance and inventory 
committee which meets monthly to review 
collection performance.
Tax risk is addressed through the use  
of tax specialists who advise the Group on 
its tax compliance obligations, application  
of tax legislation, and the transactions and 
activities undertaken by the Group.
Investment risk is managed through 
rigorous due diligence and controls to 
accurately price new investment 
opportunities. These include executive 
review through an investment ‘gate’ process 
prior to purchase execution. Portfolio 
performance is regularly monitored by senior 
management and the risk committees.
Key mitigating actions
Conduct risk and Treating Customers Fairly 
(TCF) are at the heart of our business.  
All employees and third parties acting on 
our behalf receive mandatory training, 
including conduct risk, handling vulnerable 
customers and complaints. We consider 
customer outcomes when developing our 
strategy, systems, policy and processes  
and ensure that our HR framework and 
Company values support appropriate 
customer outcomes. 
We have a rigorous oversight framework, 
focused on compliance, independent 
assurance, performance, and customer 
outcomes across both our in-house 
operations and third party ‘partner’ network, 
with a continuous programme of reporting 
and reviews. Governance over conduct  
risk is provided by the risk committees, 
principally through the conduct and 
compliance committee. This committee 
provides oversight of the Group’s 
processes and procedures, monitoring their 
effectiveness in fulfilling regulatory 
obligations and the management of risk 
that may result in non-compliance and  
/or poor outcomes for customers. Conduct 
risk exposures are also managed and 
monitored against the board’s risk appetite. 
In non-UK jurisdictions, FCA consumer 
credit regulation does not apply; however, 
we always seek to ensure we adhere to all 
local best practice collections approaches.
3
Operational risk
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate 
or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events, including 
those relating to legal issues and IT  
security weaknesses.
In the UK, we are partly reliant on a panel  
of outsourced third party partners to manage 
customer accounts and collect on our 
behalf. Should these partners experience 
sustained business interruption or are 
subject to takeover by an unfriendly 
competitor, we could suffer financial loss.
The Group relies on IT systems for 
customer and data management and data 
analytics. Should these systems experience 
performance issues or outage through, for 
example, cyber attack, our customers would 
be impacted, and we could experience 
financial loss.
Failure to comply with relevant legal  
and regulatory requirements through failed 
internal processes could result in the 
suspension or termination of our ability  
to conduct business, and could lead  
to regulatory censure and financial loss.
There is also a risk of documentation 
deficiencies in purchased portfolios that 
are unable to be remediated or mitigated 
through contract and/or warranties.
Key mitigating actions
We have on going oversight of our partner 
network, including consideration of  
their business continuity arrangements.  
We monitor industry consolidation activity 
and have a diversified panel to ensure  
that we are not reliant on any particular 
third party servicer.
IT systems are regularly tested, backed 
up and managed through a tight set of 
quality and security policies, supported by 
a robust disaster recovery plan. In the UK, 
we adhere to ISO27001 standards and we 
practise ITIL-based procedures. 
We have a quarterly Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment (RCSA) process to identify 
and assess key operational and regulatory 
risks. We employ industry specialists to 
monitor the latest regulations and update 
our internal policies accordingly, and  
where required, we take external specialist 
advice. We also engage in regular training 
and assurance activity to ensure compliance 
with internal policies.
Due diligence is undertaken on 
prospective investment purchases to identify 
potential documentation weaknesses. Our 
legal team are involved in all purchases and 
external legal advice is taken where required.
4
Financial risk includes
Market risk: the risk of losses in portfolios 
due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
and the level of interest rates.
Funding and liquidity risk: the risk that 
the Group is unable to meet its obligations 
as they fall due.
Credit risk: the risk to earnings or capital 
arising when a customer or counterparty 
defaults on its contractual obligations, 
including failure to perform obligations in  
a timely manner.
Tax risk: tax compliance risks arise  
from the complex nature of tax legislation  
and practice.
Investment risk: the risk of returns adverse 
to forecast as a result of inadequate 
portfolio purchase analysis and consequent 
mispricing therefore affecting ERC. Strategic report

Diversification
Diversification by  
revenue stream
In 2015, we continued to diversify our business offering, and we now combine a growing 
in-house servicing capability with a network of compliant third party providers. 
Our Capquest and Whitestar businesses offer our clients a well-invested customer focused 
service platform. This allows us to offer our clients data, analytics and collections services 
(asset management), the ability to place portfolios with us and then sell them to us at a later 
date (place to sell), or sell portfolios to us initially (sell).
Our servicing businesses also provide us with greater economies of scale, and enable us 
to offer greater customer insights. We are able to better challenge, test, and champion 
collection strategies, and work more effectively to find the best solutions for all involved.
Diversification by asset class 
We also diversified our business by asset 
class, as shown in the graph. In 2015,  
we added new asset classes to both our 
Portuguese secured and telco, and  
Dutch secured and SME asset holdings.
In 2016, we expect to diversify our  
revenues still further, with 15% coming  
from asset management services.

Diversification by originator/client 
We sourced portfolio purchases and asset 
management contracts from 32 different 
providers in 2015. Approximately 70% in the 
UK and 30% in Portugal were from clients 
we already held a commercial relationship 
with prior to the start of the year (i.e. 
repeat sources).
Diversification by geography 
2015 also saw us ramp up our investment  
in the Netherlands, by purchasing assets 
with a total face value of approximately 
€300 million. This is in addition to our existing 
holdings and investments in the UK, 
Portugal and France.
With the acquisition of Whitestar, 
Gesphone and other portfolio investments 
in 2015, Europe now represents 29.8% of 
Group ERC and 7% of revenue.

Debt can be a very emotive topic. 
Unmanageable debt can often carry a 
social stigma and prevent people accessing 
more affordable mainstream financial 
products. Our approach is always to work 
with customers and find the most suitable 
solution for their individual circumstances.
In the UK, we commissioned our Debt Britain 
study to further enhance our knowledge 
and understanding of customers in 
unmanageable debt. The study revealed  
a number of key findings across different 
customer groups, which we will take forward 
and use to help shape our service offering.
Customers Financial  
literacy and 
understanding 
amongst  
young adults
Over two thirds 
of debt defaulters 
avoid talking  
to their lenders
4.7 million 
households likely 
to experience 
unmanageable 
debt problems  
by 2020
Most borrowers 
default through no 
fault of their own
Findings
•  25% of borrowers 
admit to having made  
a late payment
•  The most common 
cause for default is 
illness – 25% of debt 
defaulters
•  Borrowers are most 
likely to miss paying 
credit card debts
•  60% of borrowers 
struggling with 
repayments have 
trouble sleeping  
and 16% have abused 
drugs or alcohol as  
a result
Findings
•  66% of young adults 
who have sought a loan 
either do not know 
what APR means or see 
it as unimportant
•  45% of young adults 
say it is not very 
important to repay 
their debts on time
•  22% – nearly a quarter 
of young adults 
struggle with the basic 
numeracy that is crucial 
to understanding 
borrowing
Findings
•  69% of defaulters have 
avoided talking to their 
lenders 
•  47% said that even  
the possibility of 
restructuring the loan 
would not encourage 
them to communicate 
with lenders
•  However, 63% would 
communicate more  
if it would improve their 
access to credit in  
the future
Findings
•  A rise in consumer 
borrowing, coupled 
with higher interest 
rates will fuel a 17% 
increase in the  
number of households 
in default by 2020
•  The rise is expected  
to see an additional 
700,000 households 
default by 2020, 
increasing the current 
estimate of 4 million 
households to  
4.7 million
Call to action
•  Do not deal with 
financial problems in 
isolation. It is important 
to understand the 
underlying cause and 
deal with this as well  
as the financial issues 
themselves
Call to action
•  Debt needs to be 
discussed more, so that 
everyone understands 
how to borrow and 
manage their finances 
effectively, without 
taking on more debt 
than they can afford  
to repay
•  The s e conver s ations 
need to happen earlier 
in life, so that everyone 
understands how  
to use debt positively  
and not risk it being  
a problem that they 
simply don’t understand
Call to action
•  Although there is 
always more that can 
be done to help 
prevent people getting 
into unmanageable 
debt in the first place, 
it is important to 
communicate why 
addressing the problem 
early on can benefit 
them in the future
•  The credit and data 
industry needs to 
develop tools that 
demonstrate and show 
how positive action 
contributes to 
rehabilitating your 
finance
Call to action
•  The consumer debt 
industry needs to work 
closely with consumer 
advisory bodies now 
to plan for the rise, so 
that borrowers in 
difficulty can be given 
the best help and 
advice in managing

In the UK, Arrow Global collection 
colleagues receive a minimum of 150 hours 
training in their first year. After their first 
year, they are then given an additional  
45 hours training annually and in addition, 
we operate a buddy/mentoring system.
In the UK, our customer net promoter 
score (a measure of customer satisfaction 
of a scale of 0-9) regularly exceeds 6.5. 
In the last year, across the Group, we

Supporting debt charities  
and the local communities  
in which we work
Moving and making a difference
Throughout the year, our colleagues 
participate in a variety of organised charity 
events. This year, for example, Arrow  
Global celebrated its 10-year anniversary, 
and as part of our celebrations, we 
launched our ‘Move and Make a Difference’ 
charity challenge. 
Here, colleagues are encouraged to 
‘donate a mile’ to one of the charities we 
support, completing a mile in any way they 
choose. The Company then makes a fixed 
donation on their behalf, or they can gain 
additional sponsorship and we will match 
the funds that they raise. The challenge will 
run into 2016, and to date some of the  
more adventurous and fun activities that 
people have come up with are a team  
sled pull, rowing, running and cycling, and  
a group skydive over a vertical mile. 
A Centre of Excellence
In Manchester, we have supported the 
Oakwood Academy School for some time 
in its work to become a Centre for 
Excellence in financial education, combining 
both our local community and financial 
education charitable goals. 
Working alongside the Personal Finance 
Education Group (PFEG) over a two-year 
period, in November 2015, the school was 
successful in achieving this sought after 
status, and Oakwood is now seen as a beacon 
of financial education and good practice  
in the local education community.
As well as providing financial sponsorship 
to the Academy, Arrow Global colleagues 
gave over 120 hours of volunteering support 
to the school.
Corporate and social responsibility
Arrow Global takes its corporate and social responsibilities very seriously, and has a clear 
charity strategy that focuses on financial education, financial support, and the communities 
in which we work. 
We work closely with the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) and a range of debt charities, including 
StepChange, which we supported once again this year, by taking part in and publicising  
 ‘Debt Awareness Week’. In addition to supporting charities like these, we support charities 
local to our sites; such as Oakwood Academy, the youth and education charity, City Year, 
and the Christie Charity in Manchester; the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre in 
Glasgow; the children and young people’s charity, Creating Futures, in Farnborough, 
Hampshire; and the family education, rehabilitation and care charity, Cerci Oeiras, in Lisbon.
We also support colleagues’ contributions to the community by matching funds raised  
by them for our chosen charities and we encourage our staff to volunteer and assist local 
community organisations, both in and out of company time. Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 25
Volunteering and mentoring  
with City Year
As with Oakwood, our involvement with 
City Year combines both sponsorship and 
volunteering activities. City Year challenges 
young adults to tackle inequality through 
the life-changing power of a year in service 
in school. It encourages young adults to 
become ‘near peer’ role models, mentors 
and tutors to support children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds, and help 
them enjoy and succeed at school. 
In turn, the volunteers are helped to 
develop as leaders, receiving coaching  
on presentation and vocational skills. Arrow 
Global colleagues act as mentors, helping 
them with business skills, such as looking for 
employment, preparing CVs, interviewing 
and networking.
Caring for the environment
Our concern for the environment and the 
environmental impacts we make as a 
business are considered more thoroughly 
in the report of the directors on pages 40 
and 41, but given the nature of our business 
as a debt purchaser and manager, they are 
relatively minimal.
With the acquisition of Whitestar and 
Gesphone, the Group now has a site in 
Portugal, in addition to the four across the 
UK. This has inevitably seen an increase in 
international travel, but to reduce the impact 
of this and other travel on our carbon 
footprint, we actively encourage colleagues 
to increase the use of video and telephone 
conferencing facilities. 
In the UK, we offer colleagues a cycle to 
work scheme and at appropriate sites, we 
have car shares and group transport schemes 
in place.
Supporting human rights
All the Group’s current activities are carried 
out in developed countries that have 
strong legislation governing human rights, 
and Arrow Global complies with applicable 
legislation in every country where it operates. Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 26
During the year, we made a number of significant portfolio purchases in Portugal and  
the Netherlands, as well as acquiring the Whitestar and Gesphone servicing businesses  
in Portugal, extending our growth in mainland Europe (for details see note 30).
Our strategic UK and mainland European purchases continue to provide significant 
opportunity and a platform for future growth in both existing and new asset classes  
and geographies.
2015 was a year of record growth  
for Arrow Global with a total  
investment of over £216.3 million,  
of which £180.3 million represented 
portfolio acquisitions

ERC overview
Our 84-month ERC – the expected 
collections from our back book – after 
taking into account movement in foreign 
exchange rates and portfolio put backs 
– has increased by 14.6% from £897 .3 million 
as at 31 December 2014 to £1,028.6 million, 
(120-month ERC 12.8% increase to £1,224.5 
million) (31 December 2014: £1,085.4 million). 
The ERC is underpinned by paying 
accounts that have a current face value of 
£1.5 billion, which represents 1.4 times 
84-month ERC cover (1.2 times 120-month 
ERC cover). As at 31 December 2015, we 
estimate the amount we would need to 
invest over the next 12 months to maintain 
our current 120-month ERC level is circa  
£78 million.
Purchased loan portfolios
During 2015, we acquired debt portfolios 
(including those through acquisitions) with 
a face value of £1,505.8 million for a purchase 
price of £180.3 million equating to an 
average purchase price of 12p per £1. For the 
year to 31 December 2015, the 120-month 
gross cash-on-cash multiple for this vintage 
was 2.0 times (84-month: 1.7 times) from 
the date of purchase. Of the purchase price 
invested 32.3% related to secured portfolios.
These portfolios acquired, net of 
amortisation, have increased the balance 
sheet value of our purchased loan portfolios 
to £586.3 million as at 31 December 2015 
(2014: £477.5 million). The balance excludes 
a £23.5 million portfolio of assets which had 
been acquired at the year end, and will 
shortly be resold to an investment partner. 
As at 31 December 2015, the total face 
value of acquired purchased portfolios was 
£14.2 billion (2014: £12.7 billion) across  
8.6 million customer accounts.

Cash flow - core collections
Core collections increased to £218.5 million 
(2014: £148.5 million), reflecting the increase 
in our portfolio asset base. During the 
period, collections in Portugal returned to 
their run rate pre court closures, albeit 
more slowly than expected. In addition, 
Portuguese collections were affected  
by exchange rate movements. During the 
period, there was a higher than anticipated 
portfolio putback claim, which we are 
progressing with the creditor and have 
reflected in the ERC.
As at 31 December 2015, we have 
cumulatively collected 102% of our original 
underwriting forecast on a constant 
exchange rate basis, reflecting the success 
of our data driven approach to origination 
and underwriting. During the year, cash 
collections came from over 7 .5 million 
individual payments, with an average UK 
monthly payment of circa £27 , reflecting our 
focus on working with customers to create 
long-term sustainable payment plans. 
Cash flow – collection costs
We continue to use our data capabilities and 
the benefits of our outsourced model to 
maintain cost collection efficiency. During 
the year, there was an increase in the 
collection cost ratio to 23.9% (2014: 23.0%), 
reflecting additional collection related 
costs associated with Portugal and asset 
management and additional staff costs 
incurred for the set up and training on the 
Erudio migration.
Financial review
Money multiples: gross 
collections to date and ERC 
from 1 January 2016
The gross cash-on-cash money multiple 
over all portfolios is expected to be 1.9 times 
on an 84-month basis from the date of 
purchase. Recent vintages reflect a higher 
proportion of paying accounts and  
secured assets and, therefore a lower gross 
cash-on-cash money multiple.
Revenue
Total revenue for the period was £165.5 
million, an increase of 49.5% from total 
revenue in 2014 of £110.7 million. This was 
largely due to an increase in income from 
purchased loan portfolios of £41.9 million, 
reflecting the increased size of the portfolio 
assets. There was also a £12.8 million 
increase in income from asset management, 
due to a full year of results from our UK 
collections specialist, Capquest, and the 
acquisition of our Portuguese collections 
specialist, Whitestar, in April 2015.
Income from asset management in 2015 
was 8.9% of total revenue, and we expect 
this to increase to approximately 15% in 2016.

Cash generated by operations 
Cash generated by operations increased 
from £97.2 million in 2014 to £150.2 million 
in 2015. The key driver for operating cash 
flow is adjusted EBITDA. During the year, 
adjusted EBITDA increased by £52.0 million 
(51.5%) to £153.1 million (2014: £101.0 million). 
This was mainly driven by an increase in 
core collections net of collection costs. The 
adjusted EBITDA ratio was 70.0% (2014: 
68.0%), this ratio has improved reflecting 
the successful integration of Capquest  
and Whitestar acquisitions. 
Profit attributable to shareholders 
Profit attributable to equity shareholders 
increased 73.8% from £18.3 million to  
£31.7 million for the year ended 31 December 
2015. This was largely driven by increased 
operational profit of £28.3 million, offset by 
an increase in finance costs of £14.2 million. 
The latter was largely due to the introduction 
of the €110 million bond following the 
acquisition of Capquest in November 2014. 
We saw positive results of £1.2 million from 
the first full year of our 15% interest in French 
market leader, MCS. 
During the year, non-recurring items of 
£4.3 million were incurred, with an associated 
tax impact of £0.7 million. The main 
non-recurring items were £1.5 million arising 
on the Portuguese strategic corporate 
acquisitions, £1.4 million due to IPO related 
staff costs and £1.5 million due to servicer 
migration and Capquest integration. See 
note 10 on page 91 for further information. 
After taking account of the non-recurring 
items discussed above, underlying net 
income increased 19.6% from £29.6 million 
to £35.4 million for the year ended  
31 December 2015.
Funding, net debt and net assets
In 2015, we successfully increased our RCF 
to £165 million, provided by five banks, to 
support business growth and balance sheet 
liquidity. This has subsequently increased  
to £180 million in February 2016. The RCF was 
drawn by £75 million as at 31 December 2015. 
As at 31 December 2015, we had cash and 
RCF resources of £100.2 million available and 
cash interest cover of 4.9 times (2014: 5.4 
times). Successful issuance of the €110 million 
bond in September 2015, providing additional 
RCF headroom. We continue to assess the 
additional funding options as required and 
subject to market conditions.
Net debt at 31 December 2015 was £588.6 
million, being 3.8 times adjusted EBITDA 
and a net debt/84 month ERC loan to value 
ratio of 57 .2% and a secured loan to value 
ratio of 51.8%, which is significantly below our 
financial covenants of 75%. The drivers of 
the increase in net debt of £148.3 million from 
31 December 2014 were the acquisitions  
of Whitestar and Gesphone and significant 
portfolio purchases in the last two months  
of 2015. See note 24 on page 102 for further 
information on the maturity profile of  
our debt.
Net assets increased to £145.4 million 
during the year, mostly reflecting the retained 
profit of the year offset by the declared 
dividends of £8.9 million. 
Shareholder returns
Underlying basic and diluted EPS for the 
year was 20.3p (31 December 2014:  
17.0p), representing an increase of 19.7%.
The underlying ROE was 26.5%  
(2014: 26.1%). 
A final dividend of 5.4p is proposed, 
bringing the total dividends for the year  
to 7 .1p. See note 12.

We will also be looking to enhance our 
service offering through our well invested 
in-house servicing platforms in the shape 
of Capquest and Whitestar.
We have already generated a number of 
long-term origination and servicing contracts 
with our fund partners and continue to 
benefit from joint origination opportunities, 
continually assessing our funding position  
to ensure that we maintain a strong balance 
sheet, which in turn, will provide us with 
the necessary capital for future investments.
Regulation and compliance
Overview
In the UK, we submitted our FCA 
authorisation applications in September 2015 
as planned and anticipate receiving full 
authorisation later in 2016 (these timescales 
align with other firms’ experience). This  
will mark the completion of our migration 
from regulation by the OFT to that of the 
FCA, a journey that began in 2013.
We believe that the risk, governance 
and compliance frameworks that are called 
for under the FCA regulation will require 
on going investment, and as a consequence, 
will continue to drive consolidation within 
the UK industry.
Looking forward to 2016 and beyond, 
improving economic and market conditions 
and developing regulation seem likely to  
be the main drivers of change in the industry 
across Europe
Economic and market conditions
Overview 
Market forecasters continue to assert  
that the growth seen in the European NPL 
market in recent years shows little sign of 
abating, and this is supported by independent 
research from PwC, which suggests that 
European NPL loan sales may well be up from 
€46 billion in 2012 to €160 billion in 2015. 
Bank restructuring across Europe is also 
driving consolidation among our clients,  
as well as in portfolio sales and here, banks 
are often looking to sell assets which 
require them to tie up capital that could be 
deployed more effectively elsewhere.
A recent OC&C strategy consultants 
report published in November 2015 
observed that one of the notable trends of 
the year was the opportunity presented  
by public sector debt and we believe this is 
a trend that will continue across Europe  
as a whole. 
The OC&C report also notes a 
momentum towards forms of Business 
Process Outsourcing (BPO), which we think 
will mean many more clients choosing to 
pursue hybrid models, selling NPL portfolios 
in some instances and employing servicing 
solutions in others. 
Outlook
Economic conditions are forecast to 
continue to improve, albeit at reduced rates 
to that initially anticipated. As such, we 
expect to see an increase in consumer and 
business lending but will continue to monitor 
the risk from changes in economic and 
market conditions, especially with respect 
to any impact on forecast collections. A 
feature of previous cycles has been that an 
increase in lending has led to a corresponding 
rise in NPLs, and we see no reason for this 
to change. 
In the UK, our recent Debt Britain 
research predicted that by 2020 the level 
of consumer default will have increased  
by 17%, mirroring a similar rise in lending 
over the same period, tied to the  
economic cycle.
Our approach
At Arrow Global, we are known for seeking 
to create strong and enduring relationships 
with our creditors and fund partners.
With a European origination capability, 
we will continue to look for opportunities  
in new asset classes and geographies, while 
at the same time, working hard to build a 
market leading position in those we 
already operate. Strategic report
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 31
In Europe, the lobbying efforts of the 
Credit Services Association (CSA) and others 
have resulted in a generally favourable 
outcome on the new EU data protection 
regulation, which will be finalised  
mid-2016 and implemented in 2018.
Our approach
We are constantly evaluating and evolving 
risk and compliance activities across the 
entire Group, regardless of geography, and 
wherever possible, share best practice. 
In the UK, we are continuing to operate 
under our FCA interim permissions and  
will work with the regulator as we progress 
through the authorisation process.
Via our external affairs team, 
representation on industry bodies, and 
participation in European initiatives, we  
are able to monitor developments in debt 
purchasing and data sharing. Where 
appropriate, we will join others in consulting 
on changes to legislation to understand  
its impact on our clients and customers.
Pricing
Overview
We maintain a positive outlook on NPL loan 
portfolio supply dynamics in both the  
UK and mainland Europe. Supply has grown 
significantly in recent years and all the 
indicators suggest that this trend will 
continue, especially in financial services. 
The need to employ capital more 
profitably, and in many cases, build additional 
capital reserves is not going away. Banks 
have entered a new era, where the need to 
manage balance sheets more actively is 
now the norm.
We have already started to see  
portfolios coming to market earlier in the 
cycle and we expect this to carry on  
being the case, as originating creditors 
prepare for changes to accountancy 
standards, notably IFRS 9, and how NPLs 
are recognised.
Although portfolio pricing remains 
competitive, especially in the UK NPL 
auction market, we believe that larger,  
well capitalised debt purchasers, which 
continue to invest in their businesses to 
drive efficiencies and enhance collection 
strategies, will continue to prosper in  
what are consolidating markets.
Our approach
We remain focused on a disciplined 
approach to investment, and in particular, 
to diversification, by both asset class  
and geography. 
Our Capquest acquisition in 2014, and 
those of Whitestar and Gesphone in 2015, 
provide us with a high quality service 
offering, while also helping us open up new 
debt purchase markets.
We continue to drive synergy benefits 
from these acquisitions. Following the 
completion of our initial Capquest integration 
work, we updated our forecast for synergy 
savings in 2016, adding an additional  
£2 million to the £6.5 million anticipated at 
the time of acquisition. We are reinvesting 
this into our UK market proposition.
Our servicing businesses, which require 
low capital investment, also prove to 
underpin our earnings growth. We have 
visibility of servicing contracts lasting five  
to 10 years, providing us with a solid platform 
to invest from.
Our ability to generate a high proportion 
of off-market trades – 57.4% of invested 
capital was off market in 2015 – means that 
we can continue to be selective in the 
investments we make, investing for profit 
and not absolute volume.
The significant investments that we made 
in the Dutch market in 2015, gave us a final 
balance of investments by purchase price of 
34% in the UK and 66% in mainland Europe 
respectively. This capacity for operating 
across multiple geographies enables us to 
seek investments that allow us to deploy 
capital in the most profitable manner.
The money multiples we target for our 
investments will continue to reflect the 
balance of assets within the portfolio  
and vintage, for example, secured versus 
unsecured, paying versus non-paying.
2016 outlook 
As we enter 2016, we will continue to evolve 
our business model to make sure we offer 
our clients and customers the service that 
best suits their needs. As we continue to 
grow our service capabilities and actively 
seek out new strategic partnerships  
and opportunities, we anticipate servicing 
revenues of around 15% of Group revenue  
in 2016.
We are a well diversified business, with  
a strong origination pipeline – starting  
2016 with awarded purchases of £71 million.
We are confident in maintaining 
portfolio investments at approximately 
twice our average annual replacement  
rate of £78 million. This, combined with the 
continued delivery of the Capquest and 
Whitestar business cases, will support 
earnings growth in 2016 and we remain 
confident of our ability to deliver a medium-
term ROE percentage in the mid-twenties 
and a progressive dividend policy.

Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 32
The directors are required to make an 
assessment of the Group’s ability to 
continue to trade as a going concern for  
the three-year period of assessment  
used to assess the business
The directors have given this matter due consideration through a review of forecast cash  
flow models and scenarios and current cash availability and have concluded that it is appropriate  
to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
The main considerations were as follows:
The Group is highly cash generative 
receiving weekly cash flows and has a low 
fixed cost base. As at 31 December 2015, the 
Group had an available £165 million revolving 
credit facility (increased to £180 million  
in February 2016), drawn by £75 million. The 
Group also had £10 million cash balance  
as at 31 December 2015. The directors have 
reviewed the available headroom of the 
Group, and confirmed that the Group has 
sufficient resources to meet future 
obligations as they fall due.
The principal covenants of the revolving 
credit facility that the Group currently  
has in place are loan to value (LTV) ratio of 
no more than 75% and a super senior loan 
to value (SSLTV) ratio of no more than 25%, 
both tested quarterly.
The SSLTV ratio as at 31 December 2015 
was 7.3% and the LTV ratio 57.2%. Both 
covenants were comfortably met throughout 
the year to 31 December 2015. The directors 
have reviewed the Group’s financial 
projections covering a minimum period of 
at least 12 months from the date of signing 
of these financial statements and the 
projections show covenant compliance.
Furthermore based on the three-year 
forecast and funding plan the Group will 
continue to be in compliance.
The Company had a profit for the year 
to 31 December 2015 of £21,725,000  
(2014: £4,360,000). With net current assets 
of £65,257,000, the directors deem this 
sufficient to cover a minimum period of at 
least 12 months from the date of signing 
these financial statements.
The Group is able to generate strong 
cash flows even in difficult general  
market conditions. The Group’s cash flow 
projections confirm that the Group will 
remain well within its facilities for a minimum 
period of at least 12 months from the  
data of signing these financial statements.
In addition, the directors have 
considered the Group’s viability in detail 
over a three-year period to December 
2018. This assessment is in accordance with 
provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. It has been made taking 
into account the current position of the 
Group, the corporate planning and budget 
process, and the Group’s principal risks  
as detailed in the strategic report on pages 
16 and 17. 
The Group prepares annually a five-year 
plan as part of its corporate planning 
process, which is aligned to the strategic 
goals approved by the board. The plan is 
predicated on a detailed year one budget, 
and extrapolated forecasts in outer years. 
As a matter of good practice a variety of 
stress tests are performed on the plan. The 
tests selected consider the principal  
risks faced by the Group. The principal risk 
modelled within the stress tests is a 
reduction in collections. 
Following the assessment of the above, 
the board concluded that the viability 
statement should cover a period of three 
years. This is based on three years of the 
strategic plan, which gives greater certainty 
over the forecasting assumptions used.
The directors have concluded that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due  
over the three-year period of their detailed 
assessment.

Directors’ and committee reports
Results and going concern
The Group’s results are discussed in the 
financial highlights, Chairman’s statement, 
chief executive officer’s review and strategic 
report starting on pages 4, 6, 8 and 10 
respectively, which are incorporated into 
this report by reference.
Consideration of going concern can be 
seen on page 32. After making appropriate 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group will be able to continue in operational 
existence for the three-year period of 
assessment, owing to the fact that forecasts 
show sufficient resources are available 
throughout the period under review. Thus, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements. 
Fair, balanced and understandable 
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 Edition (‘the Code’), 
the directors confirm that they consider 
that this annual report and accounts,  
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
The board came to this view following  
a rigorous review process throughout  
the production schedule. The annual report 
is drafted by appropriate members of  
the reporting and leadership teams and  
is managed by the investor relations 
co-ordinator to ensure consistency. A series 
of planned reviews are undertaken by the 
reporting team, leadership team and 
directors in advance of final consideration 
by the board. The annual report is also 
reviewed by the audit and risk committee.
Dividends
The directors recommend the payment of  
a final dividend of 5.4p per ordinary share for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2015 
(2014: 3.4p) to be paid (assuming shareholder 
approval is obtained) on 7 July 2016 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register on  
10 June 2016. This together with the interim 
dividend of 1.7p per share (2014: 1.7p) paid 
on 8 October 2015 brings the total dividend 
declared and proposed for the year to 7 .1p 
per share (2014: 5.1p).
Share capital
As at 31 December 2015, the Company had 
174.4 million ordinary shares in issue, of one 
class, with a nominal value of 1p each. On  
a show of hands at a general meeting of the 
Company, each member present in person 
or by proxy, and entitled to vote, shall have 
one vote and, on a poll, every member  
shall have one vote for every ordinary share 
held. There are no issued shares in the 
Company with special rights with regard  
to control of the Company.
The directors present their annual report  
on the affairs of the Group, together with the 
financial statements and auditor’s report, for 
the year ended 31 December 2015. The corporate 
governance report set out on page 43 forms  
part of this report. The Company’s principal 
subsidiaries are listed in note 23
Report of the 
directors Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 39
Directors’ and committee reports
Purchase of own shares
At the 2015 annual general meeting, 
shareholders authorised the Company to 
make market purchases of up to 17,443,902 
ordinary shares representing 10% of the 
issued share capital at that time, and to allot 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,162,926.84. These authorities expire at the 
2016 annual general meeting. During the 
year to 31 December 2015, no shares were 
allotted or repurchased. Resolutions to 
renew these authorities will be proposed  
at the 2016 annual general meeting.
The Company operates an independent 
employee benefit trust for future benefit  
to employees of the Group. Bedell Trustees 
Limited is the trustee of the Arrow Global 
Group Plc employee benefit trust (‘the 
Trust’). During the financial year, the Trust 
transferred shares to the Trustee of the 
Arrow Global Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’) 
to satisfy awards of shares to participating 
employees under the SIP.
As at 31 December 2015, the Trust held 
392,484 ordinary shares (2014: 154,562 
shares) representing 0.2% (2014: 0.1%) of the 
Company’s issued share capital. The Trust 
deed contains a dividend waiver provision 
in relation to these shares. There were  
no purchases of shares by the Trust during 
the year.
Transfer of securities
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
shares, limitations on the holding of shares 
or requirements to obtain prior approval of 
the Company, or of other holders of securities 
in the Company, to a transfer of shares, 
except as laid out below.
In light of the share placing completed on  
13 October 2015, Tom Drury, Rob Memmott 
and Zachary Lewy, have agreed with the 
Company that, following completion of the 
placing, they and their connected persons 
and affiliates will not dispose of further shares 
in the Company for a period of at least  
180 days (subject to customary exceptions) 
from 12 October 2015.
The board may decline to register a 
transfer of any share which is not fully paid. 
Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances 
set out in the uncertificated securities rules 
(as defined in the articles of association) 
and where, in the case of a transfer to joint 
holders, the number of joint holders to 
whom the uncertificated share is to be 
transferred exceeds four.
The board may decline to register a 
transfer of a certificated share unless the 
instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped 
or certified or otherwise shown to the 
satisfaction of the board to be exempt from 
stamp duty and is accompanied by the 
relevant share certificate and such other 
evidence of the right to transfer as the board 
may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect  
of only one class of share; and (iii) if joint 
transferees, is in favour of not more than 
four such transferees.
Further, the board may decline to register 
a transfer of a certificated share where the 
transfer is requested by a person with more 
than a 0.25% interest in the issued share 
capital of the Company (excluding treasury 
shares) if such a person has been served 
with a restriction notice after failure to 
provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares 
required to be provided under the 
Companies Act 2006, unless the transfer  
is shown to the board to be pursuant  
to an arm’s length sale (as defined in the 
articles of association).
The articles of association also contain 
certain restrictions on transfer which are 
designed to ensure that the assets of the 
Company are not deemed to constitute 
‘plan assets’ within the meaning of the Plan 
Asset Regulations (as defined in the articles 
of association) because the directors  
have been advised that this could result in 
the Company becoming subject to  
certain onerous obligations under US law. 
Accordingly, the articles of association 
provide that the board may refuse to 
register a transfer of shares, or compulsorily 
require the transfer of shares, where a 
transfer of shares, or continued holding of 
shares, would cause, or is likely to cause (i) 
the assets of the Company to be considered 
‘plan assets’ under the Plan Asset Regulations 
or (ii) the Company to suffer any pecuniary 
disadvantage, including any excise tax, 
penalties or liabilities, under ERISA or the  
IR Code (each as defined in the articles  
of association).
No shares carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the Company and 
there are no restrictions on voting rights 
except that a shareholder has no right to 
vote in respect of a share unless all sums due 
in respect of that share are fully paid. There 
are no known agreements between holders 
of securities that may result in restrictions  
on the transfer of securities or voting rights 
and no known arrangements under which 
financial rights are held by a person other 
than the holders of the shares.

Report of the 
directors
Directors
Biographical details of the directors of the 
Company during the year and to the date of 
this report can be seen on pages 36 and  
37. Lan Tu was appointed as non-executive 
director with effect from 9 March 2015.  
Sir George Mathewson retired from the board 
as a non-executive director of the Company 
with effect from the conclusion of the 
Company’s annual general meeting held on 
3 June 2015. Zachary Lewy stepped down 
from the board as executive director on  
30 April 2015. Post year end, with effect from 
7 March 2016, Maria Luís Albuquerque was 
appointed as a non-executive director.
The directors are aware of the retirement 
by rotation provisions in the Code that apply 
to FTSE 350 companies and have adopted 
these provisions. Maria Luís Albuquerque 
offers herself for election by shareholders 
for the first time at the 2016 annual general 
meeting. All other directors will offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2016 annual 
general meeting.
Directors’ interests
The directors’ interests in the share capital  
of the Company at 31 December 2015 are set 
out on page 56.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has granted indemnities  
to all of its directors on terms consistent  
with the applicable statutory provisions. 
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the purposes of section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in 
force during the course of the year, and 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Interim report
Current regulations permit the Company 
not to send copies of its interim reports  
to shareholders. Furthermore, the 2016 
interim results will not be sent to 
shareholders. Interim results and other 
information about the Company will  
be available on the Company’s website at 
www.arrowglobalir.net
Electronic and website communication 
with shareholders 
The Company’s articles of association 
permit electronic communication with 
shareholders as provided in the Companies 
Act 2006. The Company obtained authority 
from its shareholders at the 2014 annual 
general meeting to implement electronic 
communication. It is intended that the  
2015 annual report and notice of annual 
general meeting 2016 will be distributed 
electronically again and via the Company’s 
website to shareholders who have 
consented, or deemed to have consented. 
Shareholders who have requested 
shareholder information in hard copy form 
will continue to receive this.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on  
the involvement of its employees and uses 
a number of ways to engage with the  
team on matters that impact them and the 
performance of the Group. These include 
regular Company-wide update meetings 
and email communication, use of the 
colleague council, the distribution of a 
weekly newsletter, focus group meetings, 
annual employee surveys and regular 
Company-wide business update meetings 
and workshops. Our people managers 
carry out monthly one-to-one meetings 
with their direct reports and the senior 
management team has an open door policy 
which allows all employees to discuss any 
concerns or new initiatives.
The Group also has a whistleblowing 
policy available on the employee intranet 
and employees are made aware of this  
at induction and through regular on going 
refresher training.
Disabled persons
The Company adopts a consistent, non-
discriminatory approach to all applicants, 
with due regard to their skills and abilities. 
In the event of an employee becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that 
their employment within the Company 
continues and that appropriate training is 
arranged where necessary. It is the policy 
of the Company that training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible,  
be identical to that of other employees.
Environmental policy
Due to the nature of its business activities, 
the Group’s environmental impact is 
considered minimal. An environmental policy 
is in place to increase employee awareness 
of environmental issues and complies with 
all relevant regulatory requirements. The 
Group’s environmental impacts are through 
resource use and business travel. Key  
areas of the policy addressing the business’ 
environmental impact are as follows:
•  Minimising paper usage and the  
purchase of recycled paper and packaging 
where possible
• Energy efficient office products
• Recycling office waste
•  Increased use of video and conference calls
•  Supporting cycling to work through a cycle  
to work scheme
Carbon reporting – methodology 
We have followed the requirements of  
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
and the Carbon Trust conversion factors  
to measure and report greenhouse gas 
emissions, as well as the disclosure 
requirements in Part 7 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013.
The financial control method, which 
captures the sources that fall within our 
consolidated financial statements, has been 
used. Although we operate an outsourced 
model working with partners, these partners 
do not work exclusively for the Group  
and therefore it is not deemed appropriate 
to include emissions outside of the Group 
consolidated financial statements. The 
reporting period aligns to the financial period 
(i.e. the year to 31 December 2015) and  
the Group’s carbon reporting falls under 
three scopes: Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 41
Directors’ and committee reports
CO
2
 omissions have increased during the year 
due to the acquisitions of Capquest at the 
end of 2014 and Gesphone and Whitestar in 
Q2 of 2015. Whilst we consider our carbon 
emissions to still be relatively low, with the 
Group expanding globally, the main area 
we can control is business travel and we will 
continue to make employees aware of 
environmental impacts.
Statement of disclosure of  
information to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a director at the 
date of approval of the financial statements 
confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
2.  the director has taken all steps he ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ responsibilities 
statement
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements 
on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and  
then apply them consistently
•  make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
•  state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Group and the  
parent company will continue in business
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
•  the strategic report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face
We consider the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

The directors are responsible for preparing  
the annual report and the Group and  
Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing  
a strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that complies with 
that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 43
Directors’ and committee reports
Corporate  
governance report
Compliance statement 
This corporate governance report, 
together with the reports of the audit and 
risk committee, nomination committee, 
disclosure committee and the directors’ 
remuneration report, provide a description 
of how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published  
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in 
September 2014 (‘the Code’), have been 
applied by the Company in 2015. The Code 
is available on the FRC website at  
www.frc.org.uk
During the year, the Company was in 
compliance with the relevant provisions of 
the Code and intends to continue to comply 
with the requirements of the Code, which 
sets out standards of good practice in relation 
to board leadership and effectiveness, 
remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders.
The board currently comprises six 
members, including me, as Chairman,  
two executive directors (Tom Drury and 
Rob Memmott) and three independent 
non-executive directors (Iain Cornish, Robin 
Phipps and Lan Tu). The board regarded 
me, as Chairman, as independent upon my 
appointment, and considers that I continue 
to meet the independence criteria. 
As mentioned in my statement on  
pages 6 to 7 , Lan Tu joined the board on  
9 March 2015 as an independent non-
executive director. Sir George Mathewson 
and Zachary Lewy stepped down from the 
board on 3 June 2015 and 30 April 2015 
respectively. Maria Luís Albuquerque joins the 
board on 7 March 2016, as an independent 
non-executive director, bringing the board 
to a total of seven members. She will join 
also the audit and risk committee.
Iain Cornish was appointed the Company’s 
senior independent director, following  
Sir George Mathewson’s retirement from the 
board. The board is satisfied that Iain Cornish 
is independent in character and judgment 
and with skills and experience that make him 
well suited to the role. Where a company is 
outside the FTSE 350, the Code recommends 
that the board of directors includes at least 
two ‘independent’ non-executive directors. 
The Company (being outside the FTSE 350) 
currently has four independent non-
executive directors (and will have five with 
effect from 7 March 2016), including me as 
Chairman, and therefore complies with the 
recommendations of the Code.
Biographical details of all the directors 
are set on pages 36 and 37. The board 
adopted the provision regarding the annual 
re-election of all directors at the first 
annual general meeting in 2014 and intends 
to continue this at the 2016 annual general 
meeting. Maria Luís Albuquerque will  
offer herself for election by the shareholders 
for the first time at the 2016 annual  
general meeting.
Shareholder, bondholder and revolving 
credit facility provider engagement
The board considers that active dialogue 
with its shareholders, bondholders and 
revolving credit facility providers to be vital 
to the success of the business. Further 
details regarding these engagements are 
set out on page 46.

Leadership
The board
The board is responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company, its strategy, values 
and governance. The board maintains a 
formal schedule of matters for consideration, 
which include:
•  establishing long-term strategic objectives
•  approving annual operating and  
capital budgets
•  reviewing business performance and 
development
•  overseeing the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems
•  reviewing corporate governance 
arrangements
• succession planning
• approving shareholder return policy
•  ensuring appropriate resources are in  
place to enable the Company to meet  
its objectives
•  ensuring appropriate oversight of portfolio 
investments
• approval of external reporting
Specific key considerations of the board  
in 2015 also included:
•  the acquisition of Whitestar and Gesphone 
in Portugal
• bond refinancing
• FCA authorisation application
• the Erudio IT platform in-house migration 
•  the appointment of non-executive 
directors, Lan Tu and Maria Luís Albuquerque
• European expansion considerations
Chairman and chief executive officer
The positions of the Chairman and chief 
executive officer are held by separate 
individuals and the board has clearly defined 
their responsibilities. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the effective working 
of the board and ensuring that each director, 
particularly the non-executive directors, is 
able to make an effective contribution. The 
chief executive officer has responsibility  
for operational matters, which includes the 
implementation of the Group strategy and 
policies approved by the board.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for 
periods of three years, subject to shareholder 
approval. Terms in excess of six years are 
subject to a more rigorous review. The 
non-executive directors meet periodically 
without the executive directors present.
Recruitment of directors
Executive search firms are appointed on  
an as needed basis. JCA Group was retained  
in relation to the appointment of Lan Tu. 
This firm has no other connection with the 
Company. The procedure used in relation to 
the appointment of Maria Luís Albuquerque 
as a non-executive director is set out on 
page 47 .
Diversity
The board supports the proposals outlined 
in Lord Davies’ report ‘Women on Boards:  
February 2011’ and the ‘Five Next Step 
Recommendations’ contained in ‘Women on 
Boards Davies Review – Five Year Summary: 
October 2015’, and is committed to applying 
these in accordance with the Group’s 
Equality and Diversity policy. With effect from 
Maria Luís Albuquerque’s appointment on  
7 March 2016, the Company has a 29% female 
representation on the board (two female 
directors out of seven board members).
Effectiveness
Time commitment
The individual letters of appointment set 
out the expected time commitment for 
non-executive directors and are available 
for inspection at our registered office. 
Other significant commitments are disclosed 
to the board on each occasion that these 
commitments change.
Undertakings are given that non-
executive directors will have sufficient time 
to meet the requirements of the role. 
Details of the Chairman’s and other directors’ 
commitments can be seen in the director 
biographies on pages 36 and 37 .
Board activity
The board discharges its responsibilities 
through an annual programme of board 
and committee meetings which are held  
at the various operational sites of the 
company. Following the acquisition of our 
Portuguese operations in April 2015,  
the board visited the Whitestar offices  
in November 2015.
Board and committee meetings  
and attendance
The board held eleven scheduled meetings 
in 2015. Details of board and committee 
attendances by all directors who held office 
during the year are set out below:
Corporate  
governance report Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 45
Directors’ and committee reports
Continued professional development 
undertaken during the year
Training is offered to all new directors  
as necessary. The Chairman, together with  
the chief executive officer and company 
secretary, ensure new directors receive a full, 
formal and tailored induction upon joining 
the board, including full briefing packs. 
As part of a tailored induction programme, 
new directors receive a comprehensive 
induction pack which includes background 
information on the Company, material  
on matters relating to the board and its 
committees, and governance related 
information (including the duties and 
responsibilities of directors). New directors 
meet with key advisors and members of  
the executive team. Visits to operational 
sites are arranged as well as meetings with 
the external and internal auditors. On going 
training was provided during the year for 
existing directors. Major shareholders are 
welcome to meet newly appointed 
non-executive directors should they express 
a desire to do so. This induction process 
was applied following the appointment of 
Lan Tu in March 2015.
Access to independent advice
An approved procedure for all directors to 
take independent professional advice,  
at the Company’s expense, is in place. The 
committees are provided with sufficient 
resources, including the ability to appoint 
external advisors when they deem it 
appropriate to call upon a particular 
resource. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the company 
secretary and are entitled to rely on the 
impartial and independent nature of such 
advice and services. The company secretary 
is responsible to the board for both the 
proper administration of procedures and 
arrangements established by the board  
for the conduct of its own business, and the 
Company’s compliance with internal and 
external rules and regulations. The board 
receives agendas and supporting papers 
well in advance of board meetings.
Evaluation of the board and committees
The board undertook a process of 
self-evaluation of its performance during 
the year. A questionnaire, including the 
main themes from the 2014 evaluation, was 
issued to board members for review and 
completion and was subsequently submitted 
to the Chairman, who has reviewed the 
responses and reported on the conclusions 
to the nomination committee and to the 
board. A number of areas for further 
improvement were identified and will be 
acted upon. None were considered material, 
and, overall, board members were satisfied 
with the performance of the board during 
the year. An internal evaluation of both the 
audit and risk and remuneration committees 
took place adopting the same procedure. 
Meetings of the non-executive directors 
led by the Chairman, without the executive 
directors being present, took place.  
Iain Cornish, as senior independent director, 
led the meeting of the non-executive 
directors (without the Chairman being 
present) to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance. No actions were considered 
necessary as a result of these evaluations. 
The board has confirmed that its 
performance, as well as the contribution  
of each of the executive and non-executive 
directors continues to be effective, that 
they continue to demonstrate commitment 
to their respective roles and that the  
board members’ respective skills 
complement one another and enhance the 
overall operation of the board. The board 
therefore recommends that shareholders 
approve the resolutions to be proposed  
at the 2016 annual general meeting in 
relation to the election and re-election of 
the directors.
Accountability
Adequacy of risk management  
and internal control systems 
The board complies with this Code provision 
in line with the guidance published by  
the FRC, ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial  
and Business Reporting (September 2014)’. 
In this context, the board is responsible  
for, and monitors, the Group’s systems of 
internal controls (which include financial, 
operational and compliance controls) and 
risk management systems. The risk 
management framework is designed to 
identify and mitigate risks, but it does not 
eliminate all risks. The board has approved 
an appropriate suite of policies on internal 
control, and seeks regular assurance that 
the systems of internal control are effective 
in managing risks in line with its articulated 
risk appetite. The Group has a formal three 
lines of defence model, with the third line 
provided by Deloitte LLP. During the year, 
the board carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. These are documented on pages 
16 to 17 of the strategic report. 
The following activities are considered to 
cover the most critical business processes 
and associated risks:
•  A disciplined underwriting process, 
overseen by the board, with delegated 
authority to the executive committee for 
certain transactions. This process ensures 
an objective, rigorous and consistent 
approach to pricing and due diligence. 
Additionally, any transactions greater  
than £20 million in investment value are 
escalated to the board for approval. The 
processes and controls are documented  
in a portfolio acquisition policy
•  A strong risk and compliance framework  
is embedded across the business via  
the audit and risk committee, executive 
and management teams and supported  
by the risk management framework and 
maintenance of the Group and 
departmental risk registers
•  Regular monitoring of portfolio performance, 
overseen by the portfolio review committee, 
which considers actual versus forecast 
results at an individual portfolio level, 
re-forecasts cash flows on a quarterly basis, 
signs off the latest ERC forecast, assesses 
the carrying value of the portfolio assets and 
reviews revenue recognition
•  Internal controls exist over all key processes 
of the Group that have an impact on the 
financial results. Full documentation of these 
processes is well progressed via the Group 
accounting manual and other departmental 
manuals and new processes are documented 
as business need arises. The committee  
has not identified or been advised of any 
material failing or weakness 
Comprehensive reporting to the audit and 
risk committee and the board on the above 
activities takes place throughout the year. 
The audit and risk committee carried out  
a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. In carrying out this 
review, the committee received a report from 
the chief financial officer on the Group’s 
internal financial controls, which concluded 
that the control environment was effective 
and protected the Group against material 
financial risk. 
This is also reflected in the assessment 
of financial risk reported through the risk 
management framework, and in the reduced 
volume of control findings identified by  
the external auditor, KPMG, which 
importantly did not include any significant 
(red graded) issues for 2015. The Group’s 
risk function provided a further report to 
the audit and risk committee concluding 
that the risk management and control 
environment was considered to be effective, 
with improvements noted in risk reporting  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 46
Directors’ and committee reports
Corporate  
governance report
against key risks in 2015, with no material 
breaches, losses or regulatory censure. The 
introduction of a risk management framework 
has provided increased assurance and 
evidence that risks are understood and being 
appropriately managed. The committee 
concluded that the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems were effective, 
and there were no material failings or 
weaknesses identified following such review, 
though management continue to further 
embed the framework as expected in a 
maturing organisation. On the committee’s 
recommendation, the board concluded 
that, overall, the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems were effective.
Non-audit services provided by the auditor 
The provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor is monitored throughout  
the year, and there were none carried out in 
2015. Audit related assurance services were 
performed by the auditors, namely mandatory 
auditor opinions in relation to the issuance of 
the €110 million bond. The level of non-audit 
fees and audit related assurance services, 
provided by the external auditor, for the year 
can be seen in note 9 on page 90.
The Chairman of the audit and risk 
committee regularly reviews the level of 
non-audit fees with all non-audit services 
requiring approval, in advance of being 
incurred. The committee has concluded that 
the provision of non-audit services to date 
has not compromised auditor independence 
and objectivity. Future non-audit services 
will be undertaken in line with the non-audit 
services policy approved by the committee, 
taking into account ethical guidance 
regarding the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors. This includes the 
rotation of senior partners and professional 
staff and the involvement of additional 
partners and specialists to carry out reviews 
of the work performed and to advise  
where necessary.
Internal audit function
The audit and risk committee is responsible 
for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal audit activities. 
The audit and risk committee approved the 
appointment of an outsourced internal 
audit provider, BDO, in April 2014, and as 
stated in the audit and risk report on page 
66, Deloitte replaced BDO and were 
appointed with effect from October 2015.
Conflicts of interests
Company policy requires that if a director 
becomes aware that they have a direct or 
indirect interest in an existing or proposed 
transaction with the Company, they should 
notify the board at the next board meeting 
or by providing a written declaration. 
Directors have a continuing duty to update 
any changes in such interests. See also the 
related party transactions note 22.
Approving significant transactions  
and investment decisions
The business acquires non-performing loan 
portfolios as part of its ordinary course of 
business. The Group applies a multi-stage 
approach to its underwriting and pricing 
process, with the aim of achieving attractive 
adjusted returns, based on the Group’s 
underwriting models, analytical processes 
and servicing strategies.
The origination team reviews 
approximately 100 transactions per year, 
with approximately 25 completed 
transactions. Transactions range from repeat 
transactions with creditors and asset classes 
familiar to the Group, through to more 
complex consortium trades with special 
purpose vehicle structures.
An authority matrix sets out the delegated 
authority to the investment committee  
and executive committee. The board retains 
authority for any new asset classes or 
geography, complex deals over £10 million 
and any transaction over £20 million.  
Based upon recent performance, the board 
will be asked to consider circa four to five 
transactions per annum.
Bribery Act compliance
The Company has an anti-bribery policy 
available to both to its employees and 
generally, with a summary on the Company’s 
website, that is in line with Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ) Guidelines. The policy contains 
a gifts and hospitality procedure and 
prohibits facilitation payments. Adequate 
and regular training on the policy and  
the principles outlined therein is provided 
to staff and directors.
The Company considers it to have 
adequate procedures within the meaning 
of the MOJ Guidelines. The chief risk  
officer has primary and day-to-day 
responsibility for implementing this policy.
Remuneration
In line with the Code and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Disclosure Regulations  
2013, details on remuneration including the 
annual report on remuneration and the 
directors’ remuneration policy, which was 
approved at the 2015 annual general 
meeting, can be seen on pages 48 to 65.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders, bondholders 
and revolving credit facility providers
In 2015, the Company held a capital markets 
day for institutional investors and analysts  
at our Farnborough office, which included 
presentations on results, information  
on the Group’s activities and a tour of the 
offices. The capital markets presentation 
can be accessed on the Group’s website at 
www.arrowglobalir.net
Following meetings or telephone 
conversations with brokers, the Chairman 
communicates to the entire board the 
views of shareholders, bond holders and 
revolving credit facility providers (‘key 
stakeholders’). The chief executive officer 
and the chief financial officer regularly 
speak and meet with key stakeholders. The 
Chairman is available to discuss governance 
and strategy with key stakeholders.  
Non-executive directors and the SID have 
the opportunity to attend meetings  
with key stakeholders and would attend  
if requested.
Following the announcement of the 
preliminary and interim results and the 
executive directors’ presentations to analysts 
and shareholders, the board receives a 
report on institutional feedback prepared 
by the Company’s advisors.
The chief executive officer and the chief 
financial officer also verbally report on  
their meetings with shareholders. Copies  
of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings are 
circulated to the board.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting is an 
opportunity for all shareholders to both 
vote on resolutions put forward and ask 
the board any questions they may have. 
See page 119, for information on the  
2016 annual general meeting. The notice  
of meeting and annual report will be  
sent out at least 20 working days before  
the meeting. Separate votes will be held  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 47
Directors’ and committee reports
for each proposed resolution and a proxy 
count will be given in each case. 
The proxy forms will provide a ‘vote 
withheld’ option. The chairmen of the audit 
and risk, remuneration and nomination 
committees attend and are available to 
answer questions.
Disclosure committee
The disclosure committee is made up of 
one non-executive director, Iain Cornish, 
who chairs the committee, and one 
executive director, Rob Memmott, the 
chief financial officer. The disclosure 
committee meets at such times as may be 
necessary or appropriate.
The disclosure committee is responsible 
for monitoring, evaluating and enhancing 
disclosure controls and procedures of the 
Group. In particular, responsibilities set out in 
the terms of reference include identification 
of inside information and maintenance of 
insider lists, the design, implementation and 
evaluation of disclosure procedures and 
the resolution of any questions concerning 
the materiality of certain information. The 
disclosure committee is also required to help 
the Company and the Group to make timely 
and accurate disclosure of all information 
where disclosure is required to meet legal 
and regulatory obligations. 
Audit and risk committee
Details regarding the audit and risk 
committee and its responsibilities can be 
seen on pages 66 to 70.
Nomination committee 
The nomination committee is responsible for 
considering and making recommendations 
to the board in respect of appointments  
to the board, the board committees and the 
Chairmanship of the board committees.  
It is also responsible for keeping the 
structure, size and composition of the 
board under regular review, and for making 
recommendations to the board with regard 
to any changes necessary. Furthermore, 
the nomination committee is required to 
manage the process for evaluating the 
performance of the board.
The work of the committee in 2015  
has included:
•  Reviewing the terms of reference of  
the committee
•  Continued monitoring of the structure, 
size, composition and diversity of both the 
board and its committees
•  The appointment of Iain Cornish as  
SID following the retirement of Sir George 
Mathewson from the board
•  Recommending to the board the 
appointment of Robin Phipps to the audit 
and risk committee and Iain Cornish to  
the remuneration committee following the 
retirement of Sir George Mathewson from 
the board
•  The recruitment of Lan Tu and Maria Luís 
Albuquerque as a non-executive directors
•  Making recommendations to the board  
on the re-appointment of non-executives 
directors
•  Approaches to the 2015 board and 
committee performance evaluation review 
and reviewing summaries compiled from 
responses received from board members
•  Approving a Board Diversity policy
Diversity, whether in terms of skill, 
knowledge, experience or gender, is 
considered by the nomination committee 
when reviewing board composition  
and making recommendations for board 
appointments
The Code recommends that a majority of 
the members of the nomination committee 
should be independent non-executive 
directors. The committee should be chaired 
by the Chairman of the board or an 
independent non-executive director. The 
nomination committee is chaired by the 
Chairman, Jonathan Bloomer, who was 
regarded as independent on appointment, 
and also comprises of two other independent 
non-executive directors, Iain Cornish  
and Lan Tu, who joined the committee as 
an independent non-executive director 
following her appointment to the board with 
effect from 9 March 2015. The Chairman will 
not chair the committee when it is dealing 
with the matter of succession to the 
Chairmanship. There is compliance with the 
Code on this committee’s composition. 
JCA Group was retained in relation to 
the appointment of Lan Tu. In relation to the 
appointment of Maria Luís Albuquerque as  
a non-executive director, neither an external 
search consultancy nor open advertising 
has been used in the appointment process. 
Following the board evaluation exercise  
in 2014, the committee had noted views of 
board members that there needed to be 
more European experience on the board, 
especially with knowledge of the areas of 
financial risk in which the Group operated, 
following the expansion of the Group. 
Maria Luís Albuquerque was Minister of 
State and Finance in Portugal until the 
general elections in October 2015. Following 
these elections, she remained a member  
of the Portuguese Parliament. Given her 
availability and high profile, the committee 
concluded that the appointment of  
Maria Luís Albuquerque, as a non-executive 
director, would bring a wealth of international 
and financial sector experience, and would 
complement the existing experience of the 
board. Accordingly it was felt inappropriate 
to rely on traditional methods of 
recruitment, given the availability, high 
profile, and particular expertise offered by 
such a candidate. There was, however, a 
rigorous appointment process undertaken 
including interviews and standard 
background check procedures.
Recognising the benefits that diversity 
can bring, the board seeks to recruit 
directors from different backgrounds with  
a range of experience, perspectives, 
personalities, skills and knowledge which is 
in line with the current Arrow Global Group 
Plc Equality and Diversity Policy for the 
wider workforce. The board agrees with the 
conclusions of the Lord Davies report 
“Women on Boards: February 2011” and the 
Five Next Step Recommendations contained 
in “Women on Boards Davies Review – Five 
Year Summary: October 2015”.
The Company will shortly have two female 
directors, Lan Tu, who was appointed in 
March 2015, and Maria Luís Albuquerque, who 
will be appointed as a non-executive director 
with effect from 7 March 2016. Together they 
represent 29% female board membership.
Both the nomination committee and  
the board have a fundamental obligation  
to ensure that appointments are of the  
best candidates, selected on merit against 
objective criteria. Subject to this, the 
availability of suitable candidates and 
compliance with the requirements of the 
Equality Act 2010, the board is committed  
to strengthening female representation at 
board and senior management level. It  
has not, however, set prescriptive targets 
as it does not believe these are in the  
best interests of either the Company or  
its shareholders.
Remuneration committee
Details on the remuneration committee  
can be seen on pages 48 to 65.
The terms of reference for the audit  
and risk committee, remuneration 
committee and nomination committee  
can be found on the Group’s website  
(www.arrowglobalir.net).

Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ remuneration 
report
Remuneration disclosure
The report complies with the Large  
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, the 2014 edition of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the 
Code’) and the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules.
This report is split into two sections: the 
Annual Report on remuneration which 
follows this statement and then the directors’ 
remuneration policy which was approved  
at the 2015 annual general meeting. The 
directors’ remuneration report (excluding 
the directors’ remuneration policy) will  
be subject to an advisory vote at the 2016 
annual general meeting.
Annual statement
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to 
present our directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
Remuneration policy and link to strategy
Last year we made a number of minor 
changes to our remuneration policy to 
ensure that it is consistent with the intended 
operation of the share plans adopted at 
IPO. I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank shareholders for supporting our 
updated remuneration policy, which was 
approved by 100% of shareholder votes  
at last year’s annual general meeting. Since 
then, we have not made any changes to our 
remuneration policy and we continue to take 
a disciplined approach to execution to ensure 
that our remuneration framework rewards 
the right behaviours and supports the 
strategic goals of the Group. The following 
is an overview of how our remuneration 
policy supports the strategic objectives of 
the business:
•  The performance metrics for the annual 
bonus aim to balance profit growth with 
other key financial and non-financial targets 
and specific personal objectives linked  
to our strategic goals of protecting and 
enhancing our market leading position, 
diversifying the business (into new 
geographies, asset classes and revenue 
streams), delivering strong risk adjusted 
investment returns and developing our 
customer proposition. We ensure that the 
strategic goals are specific, measurable  
and fairly assessed
•  A proportion of any annual bonus payment 
is deferred into shares to ensure that 
executive directors consider the longer term 
impact of decisions that are made and the 
sustainability of the business. For 2015 and 
2016, 33% of any bonus earned is deferred 
into shares for a three-year period
•  The LTIP is designed to encourage 
behaviours which facilitate the delivery  
of sustainable growth of the business, 
whilst delivering value to stakeholders and 
promoting the long-term success of the 
Group. For 2015 and 2016, 50% of the LTIP 
award is based on EPS which aligns clearly  
to the Company’s strategy to deliver earnings 
growth; 25% is based on return on equity 
(ROE) which is a key driver of shareholder 
value and reflects the importance of 
purchasing debt of a suitable quality with an 
appropriate return; and 25% is based on 
TSR relative to the FTSE 350 which is clearly 
aligned to shareholders and maintains a 
link to share price performance
•  The variable remuneration targets are set  
at a level which rewards high performance 
whilst not encouraging inappropriate 
business risk
Last year, we also increased our 
shareholding requirement to 200% of salary 
for the chief executive officer and 150%  
for the other executive directors further 
aligning the long-term interests of 
executives and shareholders. The actual 
shareholdings of our executive directors  
are significantly higher 5028% of salary for 
of our chief executive officer, Tom Drury, 
and 2167% of salary for our chief financial 
officer, Rob Memmott based on the 
number of shares held and closing share 
price at 31 December 2015.
Performance and variable pay outcomes 
for the year ended 31 December 2015
As described in the Strategic Report, the 
Company continues to perform strongly 
delivering profitable earnings growth and 
strong progress against our strategy of 
diversifying by geography, asset class and 
revenue stream, while driving strong 
returns on investment. Underlying profit 
for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders is up 19.4% to £35.4 million, 
underlying earnings per share (EPS) has 
increased to 20.3p representing growth of 
19 .4% and underlying return on equity (ROE) 
of 26.5% has been delivered. In addition, 
the executive directors and their teams have 
worked hard to achieve the successful 
integration of the Capquest and Whitestar 
acquisitions, overlaying continued growth 
from attractive organic investments.
Taking into account the performance 
achieved during the year, the executive 
directors have earned annual bonuses of 
£312,137 for the chief executive officer  
and £229,373 for the chief financial officer. 
Mr Lewy earned a bonus of £86,949  
during the period of the year that he was an 
executive director, until he stepped down 
from the Arrow Global Group board. Further 
rationale for these payments can be found 
on pages 51 to 54. Before approving the level 
of performance in 2015, the remuneration 
committee sought the views of the Group

Base salary increases
In our remuneration report last year, we 
explained that the committee was proposing 
to increase the base salaries of our chief 
executive officer, Tom Drury and our chief 
financial officer, Rob Memmott phased 
over two increases. We provided detailed 
rationale behind this decision, which is 
summarised on page 51.
Our major shareholders were supportive 
when we consulted with them and we 
subsequently received a 99 .67% vote in favour 
of our Annual Report on remuneration at 
the 2015 annual general meeting. The first 
of these salary increases took effect from  
1 March 2015 when Tom Drury’s and  
Rob Memmott’s salaries were increased to 
£360,000 and £285,000 respectively.
The second stage of the increase was 
not guaranteed and was subject to strong 
corporate and individual performance. 
Following assessment at the end of the 
financial year of corporate financial and 
strategic performance against plan, and  
the on going performance of the chief 
executive officer and chief financial officer 
and their contribution to the business,  
the committee confirmed that the second 
increase should be awarded and this took 
effect from 1 March 2016, taking Tom Drury’s 
salary to £395,000 and Rob Memmott’s 
salary to £310,000.
Executive director change during the year
As announced on 14 April 2015, Zachary Lewy 
stepped down from the Arrow Global Group 
Plc board with effect from 30 April 2015 to 
allow him to focus his time on continuing to 
lead the expanded Arrow Global debt 
purchasing team as well as his board positions 
on our European subsidiaries and interests 
including Whitestar, Gesphone and MCS. 
Details of his remuneration up until 30 
April 2015, for the period he was an executive 
director on the Arrow Global Group Plc 
board, are set out in this report. His 2014 LTIP 
award will continue, subject to the same 
performance conditions as apply to all other 
2014 LTIP awards. Other than as regards 
payments to him under his new employment 
contract, there were no payments to past 
directors during 2015. 
Committee evaluation
As part of the overall board evaluation 
review, the committee reviewed the findings 
in relation to its overall effectiveness. A 
number of areas for further improvement 
were identified and will be acted upon. 
None were considered material, and overall 
committee members were satisfied with 
the performance of the committee during 
the year.
Changes to the committee composition
Iain Cornish joined the committee following 
Sir George Mathewson’s retirement from 
the board on 3 June 2015. Jonathan Bloomer 
is the other non-executive director on  
this committee.
Overall, given the Group’s performance,  
I am comfortable that the absolute amounts 
awarded to our executive directors are 
appropriate. The following pages describe 
in further detail how we have implemented 
our remuneration policy in respect of 2015, 
together with our plans for 2016.

Annual report on remuneration
The following is an overview of how the remuneration policy supports the business strategy:
•  Ensuring remuneration is competitive but not excessive by reference to pay levels in comparable groups
• Taking into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive
•  A substantial proportion of the remuneration is variable and linked to Group performance, in particular, to the delivery of our vision and our 
strategy and the performance of the individual
•  To encourage behaviours that facilitate profitable and maintainable growth and the future development of the business, short-term 
performance is assessed against both profit and a balanced range of specific strategic, personal and other key Group objectives
•  Long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in EPS, ROE and TSR. These metrics are a key measure of the success of the 
delivery of shareholder value
•  The committee considers the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance (including values and behaviours), risk, 
market and other factors
•  Malus and clawback provisions apply under the variable incentives and the reward framework is designed to ensure an appropriate level 
of risk is maintained by the executive directors
•  To best align the interests of executives with shareholders a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related and delivered  
in shares

Base salary
As referred to in the 2014 directors’ remuneration report, following consultation with, and support from, our major shareholders, the 
committee determined that base salaries should be increased with effect from 1 March 2015 as detailed below.
         Base salary  Base salary  
         as at  from  
         1 March 2015  1 March 2014

Rob Memmott         285  260  9 .6%
Zachary Lewy         300  280  7 .1%
The committee considered that the increases were appropriate taking account of:
• the strong performance of the executive directors and the strength of the management team
• the continued transformation of the Group since IPO, including the transition to FCA regulation
• the overall scale and complexity of the Group (including the international nature of the business and the range of assets classes)
•  the strong view of the committee that, in hindsight, the base salaries set at IPO were lower than would be anticipated when considering the 
relative complexity of the business
•  internal relativities and the risks posed by uncompetitive executive remuneration packages were also considered recognising the importance 
of ensuring that salaries reflect individual skills, experience and scope of responsibility
The increases taking effect from 1 March 2015 were part of a two stage approach to base salary; the implementation of that approach with 
effect from 1 March 2016 is set out on page 58.
Determination of the 2015 annual bonuses (audited information)
For 2015, executive directors were eligible for an annual performance related bonus of up to 125% of salary, subject to meeting stretching 
performance targets. To encourage behaviours that facilitate continued profitable growth and future development of the business, the 
2015 annual bonus was based on the following:
• 50% of the bonus was based on underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders (‘financial element out-turn’), and 
•  50% was based on a balanced range of financial, strategic, personal and other key Group objectives (‘strategic business/personal objectives 
out-turn’) Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 52

Notes:
 • Mr Lewy’s bonus represents the bonus for the period 1 January – 30 April 2015, when he stepped down from the board
 • Annual bonus payments to executive directors also have the following restrictions:
  - 33% of the bonus is deferred into shares in the Company for a period of three years
  -  Malus and clawback provisions are operated which give the committee the right to reduce any deferred bonus award which has not yet vested or clawback any vested cash bonus or vested 
deferred bonus in the circumstances detailed in the policy report
Financial element out-turn:
The financial element of the 2015 annual bonus was based on achieving underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders, in 
accordance with the schedule below:
         Threshold  Target  Stretch
Target*         £33.44m  £35.2m  £36.96m

 *Straight line vesting between these points.
Strategic business/personal objectives out-turn:
This element of the bonus was measured on achievement of clear personal objectives and targets which supported the strategic objectives 
of the business. The committee made a judgment based on the committee’s view of the relative importance and impact of each of the 
objectives and factors over the course of the year. Before approving the level of performance in 2015, the remuneration committee sought 
the views of the Group chief risk officer and the audit and risk committee chairman on the effectiveness of the executive’s management of 
risk during the year.

Long-term Incentive Plan (audited information)
The Arrow Global Group Plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for the grant of nil cost options, at the discretion of the committee, 
with the level of vesting to be subject to stretching performance conditions. As noted in last year’s report, LTIP awards will remain at 2015 
levels (150% of salary) until 2017 at the earliest and will only be increased at that point if the committee considers there to be a strong 
commercial rationale. Part of the LTIP awards can take the form of a tax advantaged qualifying option over shares to the limit prescribed 
by the applicable tax legislation (currently £30,000).
No LTIP awards vested during the year.

2015 LTIP awards (audited information)
The table below outlines LTIP awards made to executive directors during 2015:

15 June 2015 Tom Drury  150% of salary  205,206 ** 540,000  1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2017

 *Based on the average closing middle market quotation price during the five business days ending on the business day before the Award date being £2.6315.
 **Each executive director was also granted a tax advantaged option over 11,400 shares at a per share exercise price of £2.6315 per share. Each such option is subject to the same performance 
conditions as apply to the LTIP award. If the tax advantaged option is exercised at a gain the number of shares that may be acquired under the LTIP is reduced at exercise by the same value 
to ensure that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award is not increased by the grant of the tax advantaged option.

In each case, performance will be measured over three years with straight line vesting between each point for each performance metric. 
Further detail on the performance measures is set out below. 
•  EPS: The committee retains flexibility to include or exclude one-off items on a case-by-case basis depending on the circumstances when 
finalising base year and final-year EPS (base year for the underlying and diluted EPS for the 2015 grants is 16.9p as reported in the annual 
report and accounts 
•  TSR: In calculating TSR, a three-month average is used at both the start and the end of the performance period to ensure that the 
calculation is not impacted by potential volatility arising from day-to-day share price fluctuations. The TSR data and relative positioning 
will be independently verified
•  ROE: ROE will be measured by reference to the three-year average of ROE as reported in the annual report and accounts. Underlying Return 
on Equity as set in the annual report and accounts is calculated by dividing underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by 50% of the opening plus closing total equity attributable to shareholders
The committee will have the overall discretion to reduce the level of LTIP vesting based on the committee’s assessment of whether vesting 
delivered by the formulaic output of the three performance measures reflects the underlying performance of the Company, having regard 
to, amongst other things, objective measurement of other financial metrics, customer satisfaction and assessment of regulatory compliance. 
The committee’s review will also include an assessment of risk management throughout the performance period.
Malus and clawback provisions are operated in relation to the 2015 LTIP awards which give the committee the right to reduce any LTIP award 
which has not yet vested or clawback any vested LTIP award in the circumstances detailed in the policy report. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 56
Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ shareholdings (audited information)
As set out in the remuneration policy, the committee encourages share ownership by the executive directors in order to align their interests 
with those of shareholders. It does this by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is delivered in shares (as well as being 
subject to performance conditions).
The shareholding requirement for executive directors was increased in March 2015 from 100% to 150% of salary (and 150% to 200% for the 
CEO). Newly appointed directors are expected to acquire shares with a value of 100% of base salary within five years of appointment and 
150% of base salary as soon as possible thereafter. Until the requirement has been met, executive directors must retain 50% of all vested 
LTIP awards (net of tax). 
The actual shareholdings of our executive directors are significantly higher – 5028% of salary for of our chief executive officer, Tom Drury, and 
2167% of salary for our chief financial officer, Rob Memmott based on the number of shares held and closing share price at 31 December 2015.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2016
No changes are proposed to the policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 annual general meeting, and that policy will, therefore, 
apply for the year ending 31 December 2016 as follows:
(a) Base salaries
As referred to in the 2014 directors’ remuneration report, the executive director base salary increases awarded with effect from 1 March 2015 
were the first part of an intended two stage increase. The second stage of the increase was not guaranteed and was subject to strong 
corporate and individual performance. Taking into account relevant performance, as outlined in the remuneration committee chairman’s 
statement on page 49, the following base salary increases have been awarded with effect from 1 March 2016.

Directors’ and committee reports
(b) Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity will remain at 125% of base salary. As for 2015, the 2016 annual bonus will be based on:
• 50% of the bonus will be based on underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
• 50% of the bonus will be assessed against a balanced range of financial, strategic and other key Group objectives 
The directors consider the targets under the annual bonus plan to be commercially sensitive because they provide the Group’s competitors 
with insight into the Group’s business plans, expectations and strategic actions. However, the committee will continue to disclose how the 
bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
33% of any bonus for 2016 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP in line with the approved remuneration policy. The approved policy 
states that the bonus deferred will be calculated on the pre-tax (gross) value of the bonus or the post-tax (net) value.
The deferred element will be subject to continued employment with the Company and will lapse unless the individual is considered a good 
leaver by the committee. Malus and clawback provision will continue to apply (clawback will apply for a period of three years after vesting), 
with the committee resolving that clawback will also be applied in the event of significant regulatory risk failure.
(c) LTIP
The maximum LTIP opportunity for 2016 will remain at 150%. As noted above, the LTIP awards will remain at this level until at least 2017 .
The 2016 LTIP awards will be subject to the same performance conditions, being EPS growth, ROE and relative TSR performance, with the 
same weightings and vesting schedules, as apply to the 2015 LTIP awards as referred to on page 55. Each performance condition will be 
measured over a three-year performance period from 2016 to 2018.
Malus and clawback will apply to the LTIP with clawback continuing to apply for a three-year period after vesting and will also apply in the 
event of a significant regulatory risk failure.
The remuneration committee
During the year the committee consisted of two independent non-executive directors, namely Robin Phipps as Chair and Sir George 
Mathewson (until 3 June 2015), who was replaced by Iain Cornish (appointed with effect from 4 June 2015). In addition, the Company 
Chairman, Jonathan Bloomer, who was considered independent on appointment, is a member of the committee. The Company complies 
with the recommendations of the Code for companies outside the FTSE 350, concerning the number of independent non-executive 
directors that the committee should have.
The terms of reference of the committee are on the Company website at www.arrowglobalir.net
Advisors
During the year the committee was assisted in its work by Deloitte LLP, who were appointed as advisors in July 2014. Deloitte is a member 
of the remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to Deloitte for providing remuneration advice were £43,930 for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
Deloitte also provided internal audit services and advice in relation to taxation during the year.
The committee will assess from time to time whether the appointment of Deloitte remains appropriate or should be put out to tender. 
The CEO has also attended committee meetings to provide advice and respond to specific questions, but is not in attendance when his own 
remuneration is discussed. The company secretary acts as secretary to the committee.

•  The remuneration committee may, at its discretion 
structure awards as qualifying LTIP awards 
consisting of both an HMRC tax qualifying option 
and an LTIP award. Qualifying LTIP awards enable  
the participant and the Company to benefit from 
tax advantaged treatment in respect of part  
of the award without increasing the pre tax value 
delivered to participants. The qualifying LTIP 
awards will be structured as a tax qualifying option 
and an LTIP award with the vesting of the LTIP 
award scaled back to take account of any gain made 
in the exercise of the tax advantaged option
•  The remuneration committee may make a 
dividend equivalent payment to reflect dividends 
that would have been paid over the period to 
vesting on shares that vest and over the period to 
exercise in the case of options (and which may 
assume the reinvestment of the dividend 
equivalents). The payment may be in form of 
additional shares or a cash payment equal to the 
value of those additional shares
•  Malus and clawback provisions apply (see pages  
62 and 63)
•  Maximum award of 200% of annual base salary. For  
2015 and 2016, awards will be made at 150% of annual 
base salary for Tom Drury and Rob Memmott. 
Furthermore, any LTIP awards to Tom Drury and  
Rob Memmott above the 2015 levels will only  
be made where the committee considers there to be 
a commercial rationale (for example, there is a change 
in the scope of the role or increase in responsibility,  
a reduction to other elements of the remuneration 
package; or a significant change in the size and 
complexity of the Group)
•  Tax qualifying option may be granted. Shares subject 
to a tax qualifying option granted as part of a qualifying 
LTIP award are not taken into account for the purposes 
of the individual limits because, as referred to in the 
operation column, the LTIP award will be scaled back 
to reflect the gain made on the exercise of the tax 
advantaged option
•  Performance targets based on financial measures, such 
as EPS growth, ROE and TSR
•  25% of award vests for threshold performance rising 
to 100% for maximum performance. Where a tax 
advantaged option grant is made the same performance 
conditions apply as applies to the LTIP award

Notes to the policy table
(a) Salaries
Salary positioning takes into account the complexity of the role and performance of the individual, overall corporate performance, movements 
in the employment market and the general economic environment. They should be sufficiently competitive to enable recruitment and 
reward of executives of a suitable calibre for the role and duties required. Setting salaries within a range provides the remuneration committee 
with flexibility to take account of experience and performance and to recruit new hires. It also recognises the limitations of market data 
by not targeting a specific statistical point.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, though not necessarily increased, having regard to market conditions, benchmark data and other 
relevant factors, such as pay increases for the Group’s employees, internal relativities and individual performance. The committee is mindful 
of institutional investors’ concerns on the upward ratchet of base salaries and does not consider benchmark data in isolation.
(b) Annual bonus – performance metrics
The annual bonus is assessed against both financial and a balanced range of specific strategic, personal and other key Group objectives 
determined by the remuneration committee. This incentivises executives to focus on delivering the key financial goals of the Company as 
well as specific strategic objectives which are aligned to delivering the overall business strategy and to encourage behaviours which facilitate 
profitable growth and the future development of the business.
The precise choice of measures and the weightings between them will be reviewed by the committee year-on-year. Performance targets 
will be set at the beginning of each year, and bonus pay outs are determined by the remuneration committee after the year end, based on 
performance against targets.
(c) LTIP awards – performance metrics
Performance is based on financial performance targets, such as EPS growth, return on equity and total shareholder return measured over 
three years.
The committee will review these performance conditions when determining LTIP awards in each year, in order to reflect changes in the 
outlook of the sector and the Group, and to ensure that the targets remain challenging.
Performance measures are set in line with the key drivers of sustainable performance. Targets are set by the committee at the start of the 
performance period, taking into account external advice on market and best practice. Performance is assessed at the end of the relevant 
period to determine the extent to which awards may vest. The committee also monitors progress against targets throughout the period.
The committee retains the ability to adjust/or set different performance measures if events occur (such as a change in strategy, a material 
acquisition and/or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions) which cause the committee to determine 
that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards may be adjusted in the event of a variation of capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
(d) Malus and clawback
All cash bonuses paid are subject to potential malus and clawback, at the committee’s discretion, for a period of three years from the date 
of payment where there are exceptional circumstances, such as a material misstatement of the published results of the Group, any error 
in the calculation of any performance condition linked to the calculation of a bonus, material risk failure or gross misconduct.
The committee will also operate malus and clawback if there is a major regulatory issue including significant regulatory risk failure. In any 
of the above clawback circumstances, the committee have discretion to operate malus provisions on share based incentive plans (other 
than any HM Revenue & Customs qualifying plans) operated by the Group instead of pursuing clawback on the cash bonuses.
The LTIP and DSBP awards are subject to malus provisions such that, at the discretion of the committee, unvested awards may lapse where 
there has been a material inaccuracy or misleading results, or there has been a loss to the Group’s business which could have been reasonably 
risk managed by the participant. In addition, malus may take place where there is conduct, capability or performance of a participant which 
would make the operation of malus appropriate, or where the committee deems there to be exceptional circumstances which appear 
relevant. The committee will operate malus if there is a major regulatory issue including significant regulatory risk failure. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 63
Directors’ and committee reports
The LTIP and DSBP include a clawback facility where, at the discretion of the committee, during a three-year period post vesting, shares 
acquired through vesting or where held by the participant can be transferred to the Group or the employee benefit trust where there has 
been a material inaccuracy or misleading results, or there has been a loss to the Group’s business which could have been reasonably risk 
managed by the participant. In addition, clawback may take place where there is conduct, capability or performance of a participant which 
would make such transfer appropriate, or where the committee deems there to be exceptional circumstances which appear relevant to 
such a transfer. The committee will operate clawback if there is a major regulatory issue including significant regulatory risk failure. In any 
of the above circumstances, in place of pursuing clawback on the LTIP and DSBP, the committee have discretion to operate malus provisions on 
share based incentive plans (other than any HM Revenue & Customs qualifying plans) operated by the Group. Clawback will apply to HM 
Revenue & Customs qualifying plans to the extent permitted by HM Revenue & Customs.
Differences between remuneration policy for executive directors and employees generally
The remuneration policy applied to the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy for the executive directors in that a 
significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance. The key principles for the remuneration policy are 
applied consistently across the Group below executive director level taking into account seniority and local market practice.
Consideration of remuneration of employees generally
When determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, the remuneration committee takes into consideration, as a 
matter of course, the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. In particular, the remuneration committee is kept informed of 
salary increases for the general employee population, the overall spend on annual bonus and participation levels in the annual bonus and 
share plans.
No consultation with employees takes place in relation to determining the directors’ remuneration policy, although the Group has  
various ways of engaging with its employees collectively as teams and one to one, and the board receives updates and feedback on 
employee engagement.
Consideration of shareholder views
The committee is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on the issues of executive remuneration. Where 
appropriate, the committee will actively engage with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, seeking views which may be 
taken into account when making any decisions about changes to directors’ remuneration policy. The committee chairman is available to 
answer questions at the annual general meeting.   
Discretion
The areas of policy where the committee has discretion are set out in this report. In addition, the committee may exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under the relevant plan rules as set out in those rules.
The committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the 
committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Emergency discretion
The committee retains discretion to grant variable performance remuneration outside of the approved policy where this discretion is 
required to comply with applicable legislation or regulation. In such circumstances, the committee has confirmed that it will not exercise 
discretion in a manner that would exceed the maximum opportunity noted in the policy table and the committee will endeavour to consult 
with shareholders ahead of such exercise as well as clearly disclosing and explaining the details in the annual report. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 64
Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ remuneration 
report
Executive director service contracts
Each executive director has been appointed under a service contract which is terminable on 12 months’ notice by either the Company or 
the director. Contracts are available for inspection at our registered office. Contracts may be terminated immediately with payments in 
lieu of notice being paid in phased instalments and reduced by amounts earned from alternative remunerative positions obtained during 
the notice period.
Termination policy
Notice period/pay in lieu •  Rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods
•  Payment in lieu of notice at Group discretion – monthly instalments with appropriate reductions  
for mitigation. Payment calculated by reference to base salary and the cost to Group of  
providing contractual benefits (including pension contributions/ cash in lieu of pension contributions),  
but excludes bonus
Long-term incentives •  Lapse on cessation of employment, unless ‘good leaver’ circumstances (ill health, injury, disability,  
retirement, transfer of employing company or undertaking, redundancy or at the discretion  
of the remuneration committee)
•  If good leaver, generally award to vest on normal vesting date following application of performance  
targets at a pro-rata reduction for proportion of vesting period elapsed unless exceptional  
circumstances considered
Annual bonus •  No bonus payable (unless special circumstance exists) if under notice at payment date
Deferred share bonus awards •  Lapse on cessation of employment, unless good leaver
•  If good leaver, generally vest on normal vesting date unless exceptional circumstances considered
Where deemed suitable, the committee reserves the right to agree additional exit payments where they are in the best interests of the 
Group and shareholders and reflecting the directors’ contractual and legal rights. Any discretion exercised by the committee would be 
reported to shareholders in the subsequent annual report. The Group, in any settlement agreement recording the terms of the termination, 
may include provisions as to out placement counseling, the payment of the director’s reasonable legal costs up to an agreed amount and 
other reasonable payments of a similar nature.
Non-executive directors receive no payments for loss of office.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
Where a new executive director is appointed, the principles outlined above in relation to the structure, components and maximum 
opportunities of the existing executive directors’ remuneration package and service contract terms will also apply to any newly appointed 
director. Salaries for new hires will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Group’s intended pay positioning and the market rate 
for the role. Existing incentive arrangements will be used where possible and guaranteed bonuses will not be offered.  The level of pay will 
be what is necessary but not excessive to recruit the new executive director.
The committee will have the discretion to determine additional remuneration which constitutes compensation for the forfeiture of awards 
under variable remuneration arrangements with any previous employer on a like-for-like basis (comparable time horizon, value and subject 
to performance conditions) and/or any additional remuneration relating to relocation or similar expenses. Similarly, the committee will 
have discretion to retain existing contractual arrangements for employees who are internally promoted to board level. In addition, in 
exceptional circumstances, the committee reserves the right to grant additional remuneration which it feels is appropriate, taking into 
account the specific circumstances of the individual in order to facilitate such recruitment, provided that the total variable pay (excluding 
any buy-out awards) for the first year will not exceed 400% of salary (i.e. 75% above maximum in the policy table).
Fees for newly appointed non-executive directors will be determined in line with the policy set out on the following page. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 65

Components and structure of remuneration – non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance 
attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors. This table sets out the elements which are 
included in the remuneration package for non-executive directors and explains how they operate:

•  With the agreement of the Chairman of the Group,  
non-executive directors can carry out specific project  
work for the Group on fees to be agreed
•  Non-executive directors may be eligible for benefits such  
as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other  
benefits that may be appropriate
•  Reviewed periodically to comparable  
companies’ pay
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
The terms of appointment of independent non-executive directors (including the Chairman) are contained in letters of appointment rather 
than under service contracts. The duration of the appointment is usually three years, and it is anticipated that the period will be extended 
for a second term of three years with the agreement of the board and the non-executive director, although a reappointment is not automatic.
Either party may terminate on one month’s written notice.
The reappointment of all non-executive directors is subject to election by the Group’s shareholders at the first annual general meeting, and 
re-election at any subsequent annual general meeting where they are due for re-election.

Audit and risk  
committee report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to provide a report of the audit and risk committee’s activities in 2015.
The committee’s agenda in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2015 has again been full. In addition to its primary roles, of 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and reviewing the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, the 
committee has overseen steps taken by management to further enhance the systems of risk management and internal control.
The principal issues on which the committee focused in 2015 are set out in the report. It is an extensive list, and given the Group’s expansion 
both in the UK and in Europe, following the acquisition of Whitestar and Gesphone in Portugal, and the growing complexity of the UK 
regulatory risk regime, the committee has agreed that it will increase the number of regular meetings which it holds in 2016 from four to 
six. These will be supplemented by additional meetings on specific issues as required.
Following a review of its requirements in the light of the increased scale and complexity of the Group, and in particular the significant 
expansion of our Portuguese operations the committee decided to change its internal audit outsource partner. Deloitte was appointed 
from October 2015, and the committee considers that its geographic reach and greater depth of resource will further strengthen the 
Group’s assurance controls, and provide the committee with additional comfort that risk is appropriately identified and monitored following 
this expansion.
In accordance with best practice, the committee has continued to keep the provision of non-audit services under review. No fees were 
paid to our external auditors, KPMG, for non-audit services in the year, with payment for audit related assurance services’ fees of £182,500, 
being mandatory work performed in relation to the issuance of the €110 million bond. We expect the ratio of the Group’s non-audit fees 
to audit fees will continue to be low in future reporting periods.
In relation to the financial statements, the committee continues to focus on those matters it considers to be important by virtue of their 
size, complexity, subjectivity or impact, and these are set out in this report.
On behalf of the board, the committee has also carried out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and found them to be effective.
As part of the overall board evaluation review, the committee reviewed the findings in relation to its overall effectiveness. A number of 
areas for further improvement were identified and will be acted upon. None were considered material, and overall committee members 
were satisfied with the performance of the committee during the year. Both Lan Tu and Robin Phipps joined the committee during the 
year, and I am grateful to them and to our colleagues throughout the Group who supported the work of the committee last year.
Iain Cornish
Chairman of the audit and risk committee

Directors’ and committee reports
The committee focuses particularly on 
compliance with accounting policies and 
ensuring the maintenance of an effective 
system of internal financial control. It also 
monitors and reviews the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal audit function.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the annual report remains 
with the board. The committee is also 
responsible for advising the board on the 
Group’s overall risk appetite and strategy, 
and for overseeing and advising the board 
on the current risk exposures of the Group 
and the overall risk management approach 
and systems of internal control. As part of 
this, the committee reviews the Group’s risk 
assessment processes and methodology and 
its capability for identifying and managing 
risk. In addition it considers material 
proposed transactions and reviews reports 
on significant incidents and position against 
risk appetite.
The committee normally meets four 
times a year at the appropriate times in the 
financial reporting and audit cycle, and  
at such other times as required. The board 
has agreed there will be two additional risk 
meetings in 2016. 
During 2015, the committee also met 
separately with representatives of the 
external auditor and the head of the internal 
audit function without any management 
present.
The Code recommends that, for 
companies outside the FTSE 350, the audit 
and risk committee comprises at least two 
members who are independent non-
executive directors and includes one 
member with recent and relevant  
financial experience. For meetings held in  
2015, the committee comprised of the  
following members:
Iain Cornish as Chair; Robin Phipps, who 
replaced Sir George Mathewson when he 
resigned from the board on 3 June 2015; and 
Lan Tu, who was appointed to the board on 
9 March 2015. All are independent non-
executive directors and therefore satisfy the 
Code’s requirements. Iain Cornish has recent 
and relevant financial experience, having 
held senior positions at Yorkshire Building 
Society until his retirement in 2011, as well  
as a number of other non-executive 
directorships as outlined on pages 36 and 37 . 
The committee’s responsibilities are set  
out in its terms of reference. They include 
responsibility for external, internal audit, 
financial reporting, narrative reporting, internal 
controls and risk management. The terms  
of reference also set out the authority of the 
committee to carry out its responsibilities Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 68

Directors’ and committee reports
Significant areas 
Significant areas considered by the 
committee and discussed with the external 
auditor during the year were:
Estimation of future cash collections  
from purchased loan portfolios:
The estimation of remaining collections 
from debt portfolios is complex and requires 
management to make significant judgment 
in relation to expected life, probability and 
value of related cash flows for each loan. 
The committee considered the value of  
the loan portfolio by reference to cash flow 
models. Management’s key assumptions 
were examined carefully by the committee, 
including the profile of expected future cash 
collection based on the Group’s historical 
collection experience and changes in 
collection strategies.
Value of purchased loan portfolio  
assets and setting of the EIR:
On acquisition of purchased loan portfolios, 
a short period of time is required to 
determine the EIR due to the complexity of 
the loan portfolios acquired. The committee 
considered the EIR of all portfolios and the 
judgments made by management relating 
to the expected life and related cash flows. 
The committee, together with the external 
auditor, considered the robustness of the 
EIRs which were found to be acceptable and 
agreed to incorporate the external auditor’s 
observations on improving the processes 
around model governance, reconciliations 
and data inputs. The portfolios are reviewed 
by management for any possible indications 
of impairment or enhancement at the 
balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 
39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition  
and Measurement. The committee, together 
with the external auditor, considered  
the value of the loan portfolio by reference  
to cash flow models.
Whitestar and Gesphone acquisition:
During the year the Group acquired the 
entire share capital of Gesphone and  
33% of the share capital of Whitestar, with 
an agreement in place to purchase the 
remaining 67% over the next two years. 
Management used the acquisition  
method in considering the appropriate 
acquisition accounting, following the steps 
required by IFRS 3 (revised) – business 
combinations, to recognise assets 
acquired, liabilities assumed and measure 
goodwill. The committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of management’s fair value 
considerations and recognition of assets 
and liabilities on acquisition and approved 
management’s methodology.
Accounting for material transactions:
The Group is increasingly making equity 
investments in addition to purchasing 
portfolios in different asset classes and 
geographies, which can lead to new  
and sometimes complex transactions and 
accounting. The buying process is a 
multi-stage approach. The underwriting 
process includes a four-stage approval, or 
gate, process before presentation of the 
investment memorandum to the investment 
committee. The committee then determines 
whether to recommend the purchase to 
the board (when material or complex) in 
advance of submission of a final bid. Where 
accounting during the year was complicated, 
the finance team was brought into the 
process early and accounting papers were 
produced and disclosed for discussions 
with the external auditor and approval by 
the audit and risk committee.  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 70

Audit and risk  
committee report
External auditor
The external auditor, KPMG, was appointed 
in July 2014 following a comprehensive and 
thorough competitive tender. The committee 
carried out the following in relation to the 
external auditor:
•  Considered and approved the proposed 
materiality and audit plan prepared
•  Monitored the independence of the 
external auditor and the effectiveness of the 
external audit process taking into account 
the experience and expertise of the external 
auditor, fulfillment of the agreed audit plan, 
the robustness of their handling of key 
accounting and audit judgments, assessment 
of significant risks and the content of the 
external auditor’s report
•  Concluded and implemented the Group’s 
policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor
•  Both the committee and the external 
auditor have in place safeguards to avoid 
any compromise of the independence  
and objectivity of the external auditor. The 
committee considers the independence of 
the external auditor annually and the Group 
has a formal policy for the engagement  
of its external auditor to supply non-audit 
services. The policy is designed to ensure 
that neither the nature of the service to be 
provided nor the level of reliance placed  
on the services could impact the objectivity 
of the external auditor’s opinion on the 
Group’s financial statements
•  The policy precludes the appointment of 
the external auditor to provide any service 
where there is involvement in management 
functions or decision making, or any service 
on which management may place primary 
reliance in determining the adequacy  
of internal controls, financial systems or 
financial reporting. Proposed non-audit 
fees are notified to the Chairman of the audit 
and risk committee for his approval in 
advance of being incurred
•  Having considered KPMG LLP’s 
independence, compliance with regulatory 
and ethical standards, and assessed its 
objectivity, the committee unanimously 
recommended to the board that a 
resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG 
LLP as the Group’s external auditor  
be proposed to shareholders at the 2016 
annual general meeting
Internal audit
Following a comprehensive and thorough 
competitive tender, BDO were appointed 
by the board in April 2014 to provide an 
internal audit function to the Group.
Following a review of its requirements  
in the light of the increased scale and 
complexity of the Group, and in particular 
the significant expansion of our Portuguese 
operations the committee decided to 
change its internal audit outsource partner. 
As a consequence, a request for proposal 
was carried out and Deloitte was appointed 
from October 2015. The committee 
considers that Deloitte’s geographic reach 
and greater depth of resource will further 
strengthen the Group’s assurance controls 
and provide the committee with additional 
comfort that risk is appropriately identified 
and monitored following this expansion.
During the year the committee has 
considered and approved the Group’s internal 
audit plan, which is based on an assessment 
of the key risks faced by the Group. It has 
monitored progress of the internal audit 
function against that plan, ensuring that 
the internal audit function has sufficient 
resource to carry out its duties effectively. 
Reports on internal audit work have been 
received by the committee and, where 
necessary appropriate actions have been 
recommended to the board. The results  
of this work, together with the committee’s 
engagement with the management 
information of the Group and the executive 
directors, have enabled them to conclude 
that the statements given on pages 45 and 
46 of the corporate governance report 
relating to the Group’s systems of internal 
control and its management of risk  
are appropriate.

Independent  
auditor’s report
Opinions and conclusions arising from  
our audit.
1 Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements  
of Arrow Global Group PLC for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 
75 to 118. 
In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU); 
•  the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation
Independent auditor’s report to the  
members of Arrow Global Group Plc
2 Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
We summarise below those risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit and our key audit procedures 
to address those risks in order that the 
company’s members as a body may better 
understand the process by which we arrived 
at our audit opinion. As described on pages 
66 to 70 these are also areas that have 
been focused on by the Group’s audit and 
risk committee. 
Estimation of future cash collections  
from debt portfolios
Refer to critical accounting estimates and 
judgments in note 4 on the financial 
statements, the audit and risk committee 
report on page 69. 
Income from purchased loan portfolios  
is recognised using the Effective Interest 
Rate (‘EIR’) method. The key variable in 
determining the EIR and any subsequent 
revenue adjustments is the Group’s 
estimate of the future cash collections from 
the debt portfolios. Given the nature of  
the company’s debt portfolios, estimation 
of future cash collections requires 
significant judgment. The Group uses cash 
flow forecasting models to calculate an 
initial estimate of future collections. The 
assumptions used in the models include  
the value, probability and timing of expected 
future cash flows for each type of asset 
class within a portfolio. Estimates of  
future cash flows can also depend on 
management’s approach to managing the 
portfolios (e.g. changes in collection 
policies, litigation strategies, anticipated 
portfolio sales). Therefore, where 
management believe changes in the 
approach to managing portfolios may lead 
to changes in these estimates these  
are factored into the Group’s future cash 
collection forecasts.
Due to the level of subjectivity inherent 
in the assumptions used in the cash flow 
forecast model and the manual adjustments 
applied, these are key judgment areas  
for our audit. 
Our response:
Our audit procedures included:
•  ass e ssing the design and operating 
effectiveness of controls over key 
assumptions and customer data used  
in the cash flow forecasting models  
driving the estimated future cash flows;
•  assessing the design and operating 
effectiveness of controls that cover the 
outputs of the models and manual 
adjustments to ensure that these have 
been scrutinised by appropriate 
management personnel;
•  critically assessing the cash flow forecast 
and any manual adjustments made by the 
Group with reference to our understanding 
of the Group, and the current and past 
performance of the Group’s portfolios, 
including recent cash collections 72
Independent  
auditor’s report
Fair value of the net assets in  
acquisition accounting 
Refer to the critical accounting estimates 
and judgments in note 4 of the financial 
statements, the audit and risk committee 
report on page 69.
During the year ended 31 December 
2015, the Group acquired Silver Parallel S.A 
and Gesphone S.A and their subsidiaries 
(Whitestar Asset Solutions S.A and Gesphone 
STC) with the assets and liabilities purchased 
being accounted for at fair values at the 
date of acquisition. 
The Group prepared the acquisition 
balance sheets based on their estimate of the 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.  
In particular they prepared discounted cash 
flow models to arrive at their estimates  
of fair value for loan asset portfolios and 
customer relationships. This required  
them to exercise judgment in relation to 
determining the expected cash flows from 
the assets and the discount rates used.
Our response:
Our audit procedures included:
•  ass e ssing the completeness of assets and 
liabilities acquired with reference to  
the sale and purchase agreement and  
our knowledge of the industry 
•  challenging the assumptions, including the 
value, probability and timing of cash flows, 
used in calculating the fair value of the 
acquired loan asset portfolios as outlined in 
the ‘Estimation of future cash collections  
on debt portfolios’ section of this report
•  assessing the discount rates used in 
calculating the fair value of the acquired loan 
asset portfolios with reference to the  
risks associated with similar loan portfolios 
previously acquired
•  challenging the assumptions, including 
value, probability and timing of cash flows, 
made in calculating the fair value assigned  
to the customer relationship intangible with 
reference to the business plan, existing 
customer contracts and our knowledge of 
the industry
•  assessing whether the discount rate used  
in calculating the fair value of the customer 
intangible reflected market conditions 
based on our knowledge of the industry 
In our prior year report, we had assessed that 
the mathematical integrity and input of 
data to the EIR and net present value models 
represented a risk of material misstatement 
that had the greatest effect on our audit. 
We continue to perform procedures over this 
area, however due to the enhancements  
in the controls over these areas, we have not 
assessed this as a risk having the greatest 
effect on our audit this year and, therefore, 
it has not been separately identified in our 
report this year.
3 Our application of materiality 
and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £1.8 million, 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax of which it 
represents 4.6%. 
In 2014, the materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole was set at 
£1.7 million, determined with reference to  
a benchmark of Group adjusted profit before 
tax, of which it represented 5%. The statutory 
profit before tax balance was adjusted  
to add back one off, non-recurring items.
We report to the audit and risk 
committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £90,000 
(2014: £85,000), in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
How we scoped our audit:
Audits for Group reporting purposes  
were performed on all three reporting 
components, which were:
• Group holding company;
•  UK operating and non-operating subsidiaries; 
•  The Portuguese operating and non-
operating subsidiaries 
Of the Group’s three reporting components, 
we subjected all three to audits for Group 
reporting purposes. These audits covered 
100% of Group revenue, 100% of Group profit 
before tax and 100% of Group total assets. 
The audit of the Portuguese entities 
component was performed by a component 
audit team and the audit of the Group 
holding company, UK operating and 
non-operating subsidiaries and consolidation 
was performed by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team instructed the 
component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information  
to be reported back. The Group audit team 
approved the component materiality of 
£1.0 million, having regard to the risk profile 
of the component. 
The Group audit team managed and 
co-ordinated the component auditors in the 
following ways:
At the planning stage, the Group audit 
team visited the component audit team, 
participated in site visits, and held telephone 
calls and face-to-face discussions with  
the component audit team to discuss audit 
risks and strategy. 
During the audit, the Group audit  
team held weekly telephone calls with the 
component audit team. At the calls and 
meetings, the findings and observations 
reported to the Group audit team were 
discussed in more detail and any further work 
required by the Group audit team was  
then performed by the component auditor. 
In addition, the Group audit team 
participated in the component audit close 
out meeting to ensure that they were 
involved in all of the material issues affecting 
the Group.  73

Financial statements
1  General information
Arrow Global Group Plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and is the ultimate parent company of the Group. The address of 
the registered office is presented on page 119 . The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and rounded to the nearest thousand.
The Company’s subsidiaries and associates, both direct and indirect, at this date are listed in note 23.
Through its subsidiary companies, the Group acquires certain pools of semi-performing and/or charged-off consumer loans pursuant to 
the terms of each specific purchase agreement. In addition, the Group enters into contractual servicing agreements with other third parties to 
collect the receivables, to administer and disburse the proceeds of the receivables.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in 
the EU, and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IFRS Regulation. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current 
and prior periods.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes of the Company have not been 
presented in this annual report and accounts.
2  Adoption of new and revised standards
There were no new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the year beginning 1 January 2015.
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been endorsed but are not yet effective for these financial statements:
• IAS 19 (amended) Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2010-2012 Cycle
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2011-2013 Cycle
No new or revised standards and interpretations that have been endorsed but are not yet effective in these financial statements are deemed 
to have a material impact on future financial statements.
The following standard is not yet endorsed, however, may have a material impact and affect disclosure requirements in future periods:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 will impact the measurement and disclosures for financial instruments, as this new standard will focus further on classification, 
measurement and impairment considerations, such as expected credit losses. Whilst  management are still assessing the impact of IFRS 9 
on future periods, they believe that the impact of on the Group’s results will not be significant, as the Group buys portfolio assets, which are 
at a deep discount. Also, the Group’s adoption of an effective interest rate is thought to be in line with current IFRS 9 guidance. The Group 
will be required to produce additional disclosure requirements, over and above those from IFRS 7, in particular, more specific disclosures 
around compliance with applicable regulation and the management of risk. 
3  Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and also, the Group financial 
statements comply with EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair value of derivative 
contracts and the amortised cost value of portfolio assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2015 and comparative period. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with its investee entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the 
investee entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Also see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee benefit trust’ (EBT).

Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Going concern
The directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future. 
The directors have given this matter due consideration through a review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios and current cash 
availability and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate  
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred 
tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance 
with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the date of acquisition.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net 
of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If after reassessment, the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the 
excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. 
Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate 
discount rate.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis in relation to 
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On a business combination the portfolio investments are remeasured to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, 
calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss on disposal.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 to 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity or evidence through a 
number of aspects such as representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making and decisions, material transactions 
between the entity and investee, interchange of managerial personnel or provision of essential technical information. Associates are 
accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share 
of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of the associate from the date that significant influence commences until the 
date that it ceases.

Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (EIR) Income from purchased loan portfolios
Income from purchased loan portfolios represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments. Purchased loan portfolios are financial 
instruments that are accounted for under IAS 39 and recognised at fair value at the purchase date that equals the price paid. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a purchased loan portfolio and of allocating interest income over the 
expected life of the portfolio. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 84-months of estimated future cash receipts of the purchased 
portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). On acquisition, there is a short 
period that is required to determine the EIR, due to the complexity of the portfolios acquired.
Upward revaluations (‘write ups’) are increases to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result of 
reassessments to their estimated cash flows and are recognised in the income from purchased loan portfolios line within revenue, with 
any subsequent reversals to write ups also recorded in this line. If these reversals exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups 
then an impairment is recognised as a separate line in the statement of comprehensive income.
Unallocated cash is held as a liability in the balance sheet until it is reconciled. Unallocated cash is held for a period of six years, only being 
released to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at this point as this cash is not held in statutory trust.
Where the Group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases, there is no 
difference in accounting treatment than described above.
Impairment of purchased loan portfolios
The portfolios are reviewed for indications of impairment at the balance sheet date, such as variances to historical cash curves, in accordance 
with IAS 39. This is considered on a portfolio basis. Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, an adjustment, being the 
difference between the current carrying value and the net present value of future estimated cash flows, is recorded to the carrying value of 
the portfolio.
Revenue on assets under management
The Group receives asset management revenue on portfolios managed for third parties in the UK and Portugal. In accordance with IAS 18, 
the Company recognises revenue on its managed services contracts when the right to receive such revenue is reasonably assured and can be 
measured reliably. The nature of the revenue is contingency collection fees, which are received either as a fixed fee, or as a percentage of 
collections or the outstanding portfolio asset value.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size and nature (i.e. outside of the normal underlying operating 
activities of the Group) to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. These are disclosed separately on the face 
of the statement of comprehensive income. Current year non-recurring items are explained in notes 8 and 10.
Interest income from secured loan notes
The Group has entered into lending arrangements with third parties to provide capital to purchase non-performing consumer debt portfolios 
(see note 16). Interest income is recognised throughout the year using the EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as the employees provide services to the Group.
The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, only made contributions to defined contribution plans to provide 
pension benefits for employees upon retirement and, otherwise, has no residual obligation or commitments in respect of any defined 
benefit scheme.

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary 
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value 
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions entered 
into to hedge certain foreign currency risks.
For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the other-comprehensive income.
Leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis 
is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit for the year and is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date. 
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Current taxation is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case 
the corporation taxation is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, 
using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in 
which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at each reporting date. The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred taxation is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case 
the deferred taxation is also dealt with in equity.

Share based payment transactions
Share based payments transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
accounted for as equity-settled share based payments.
The grant date fair value of the share based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted 
is measured using an option valuation model were required, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were 
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards 
that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share based payments with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes. Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, the 
costs are recharged to the subsidiary in line with the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’.
Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore, reflected in these financial 
statements.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as discussed below, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line 
method on the following basis:
Furniture five years
Computer equipment three years
Leasehold improvements five years
Software licences   shorter of contractual life and useful economic life
IT platform  ten years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles is determined  
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. Acquired licences, such as software licences, are capitalised at cost and amortised over the shorter of contractual 
life and useful economic life.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes
The Group’s purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. Under IAS 39, such assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and are measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method less any impairment.
Purchased loan portfolios are acquired at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cash flows reflect the likely credit losses 
within each portfolio. The portfolio investments are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The portfolio asset is analysed between current and non-current. The current asset is determined using the expected cash flows arising in 
the next 12 months after the balance sheet date. The residual amount is classified as non-current.

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Litigation costs
As part of the Group’s litigation strategy to recover customer balances, the Group incurs recoverable upfront legal costs, which are deferred 
as other receivables and amortised over the period that cash is collected.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence 
that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of 
the investment have been affected.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does 
not retain control of the financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the 
portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability 
assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in the OCI is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate 
asset or liability.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the consideration required to 
settle that obligation at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities, such as loan notes, or as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangement and in conjunction with the application of IFRS.
Financial liabilities are held at amortised cost using the EIR method. The EIR is calculated by estimating the cash flows arising from the 
contractual terms of the instrument over its expected life. Transaction costs are included within the EIR and deducted from the initial carrying 
value of the debt instrument.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage the interest rate 
and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s derivatives 
are cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. Derivatives are 
initially recognised at the fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at each reporting 
date at their fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately 
within the statement of comprehensive income. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where the hedge accounting 
criteria are met, the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as part of finance costs. Amounts accumulated in 
equity are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the income or expense on the hedged item is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
• it is evident from testing that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
• the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or,
• the underlying hedged item matures or is sold or repaired

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are stated 
subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Capitalisation of legal transaction fees
Legal transaction fees associated with the purchase of portfolios are allocated to the purchase price of the portfolio and included within 
the EIR applied against the asset value.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated with collection activities. All operating costs are accounted for on an 
accruals basis.
Fair value measurements
The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 in the manner described in note 25.
Other reserves
Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are further explained on the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 78.
4  Critical accounting judgments and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year 
in which the estimate is revised.
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgments that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies and that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
a) Approach to substance of loan notes as portfolios
During the year, the Group purchased a number of loan portfolios in the form of securitisation loan notes. Management have assessed the 
substance of the loan notes under the criteria set out in IAS 39. Management have concluded that the portfolios purchased in the form of 
loan notes are presented as loan portfolios in the Group’s balance sheet and the Group’s revenue accounting policy for loan portfolios is also 
applied. This treatment has been concluded on the basis that the assets relating to the loan notes are segregated as separate silos within the 
securitisation vehicle, in such a way that the assets and loan notes are bankruptcy remote. This results in the securitisation vehicle having no 
rights to the risks and rewards of the underlying assets. The assets and liabilities within the silos meet the derecognition criteria under IAS 39 .

4  Critical accounting judgments and estimates (continued)
b) Control of a subsidiary
On 22 April 2015, the Group acquired 33% of the share capital of Silver Parallel S.A (‘Silver Parallel’) (the holding company of Whitestar Asset 
Management S.A. (‘Whitestar’)). The Group will increase its holding to 100% in two stages over two years. Voting control and economic 
interest passed to the Group on payment of the initial consideration on 22 April 2015. Silver Parallel is an acquisition vehicle, therefore 
management consider it is appropriate to assess control of Whitestar rather than for Silver Parallel for the purposes of IFRS 10. IFRS 10 defines 
control as having power over the relevant activities of the entity, exposure to variability of the returns and a linkage between this power and 
the returns. Management have considered the criteria required by IFRS10 and conclude these criteria were met from the initial purchase date, 
when voting control and economic interest passed to the Group, resulting in the consolidation of Silver Parallel and Whitestar from 22 April 
2015. In addition, management have concluded that no non controlling interest should be recognised on the basis of the binding agreement 
which is in place to purchase the remaining holding in Silver Parallel.
Key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies
The following are the key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
a) Fair value of acquisition balance sheet and carrying value of goodwill
The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the 
consideration paid over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of 
management judgment, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired 
investment portfolios where valuations reflect estimates and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the 
goodwill arising and to the post acquisition performance of the acquisition.
The fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested 
for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining 
whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the 
value in use requires an estimate and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the reduced CGU after a suitable discount rate has 
been applied to calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgments in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods 
that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.
b) Carrying value and EIR of purchased loan portfolios
For UK portfolios, a 12-month cash flow forecast is prepared for each account, based on predictions of probability to pay and value of total 
payments within the 12-month period. These predictions are generated using a bespoke statistical model (the PV model), which utilises 
customer and account level data, credit agency data and our historic experience with accounts which have similar key attributes. Management 
also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account unforeseen external factors, which have impacted historical performance. 
Where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into account these known factors. For European portfolios, 12-month cash flow forecasts 
are based on information from servicers, which management validate against recent performance.
A separate model, using an ERC forecasting methodology, then takes the 12-month estimate and uses this to form an 84-month forecast of 
ERCs at a portfolio level, by extrapolating the data over a decaying rate. Key factors in this model are the assumptions made on the 
conversion of accounts from non-paying to paying, and vice-versa either through breakdown of the account or settlement/pay down of 
the balances due, and the impact of placing accounts into litigation. Campaign overlays are also built into the model which allows the 
effect of performance improvements resulting from new initiatives to be factored into future cash flows. The ERCs created from the ERC 
forecasting model, are regularly benchmarked at a portfolio level against actuals, which forms the impairment review.
The key assumption is the Group’s determination of the future cash flows. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by -1/+1% would 
impact the closing carrying value of the purchased loan portfolios as at 31 December 2015 by £10,286,000 (2014: £8,973,000).

5  Segmental reporting
The Group represents a single reportable segment. The Group head office in the UK, with subsidiaries also based in wider Europe.
Collections information is available for the UK and the wider European operations. This is the only information analysed between the UK 
and Portugal received on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), and does not constitute sufficient information upon 
which to base resource allocation decisions, consequently one segment has been identified. In line with the business strategy we expect 
this to be developing in the next 12 months. The CODM is considered to be the board of directors collectively.

10  Staff costs and other operating expenses (continued)
Non-recurring items include items that, by virtue of their size and nature (i.e. outside of the normal operating activities of the Group), are 
not considered to be representative of the on going performance of the Group. Due to transformation changes to the Group brought about 
by the IPO and strategic acquisitions, such as the sterling senior secured notes leading onto the IPO in 2013 and the euro senior secured 
notes to acquire the Capquest Group in 2014, significant costs have been incurred in the current and comparative period, which the Group 
believe are not reflective of expected principal Group activity. The Capquest acquisition took place on 28 November 2014 and therefore 
there is still an element of acquisition costs being incurred in 2015.
In the year to 31 December 2015, £1.5 million of costs were incurred relating to the completion of two strategic Portuguese entity acquisitions, 
Gesphone and Whitestar. The majority of these costs related to fees incurred for legal advice and due diligence on both acquisitions.  
£1.4 million of staff costs were incurred as a result of the share option charges in relation to the share options issued as part of the IPO in 
2013. As these optioned vested in October 2015, these have been recognised as non-recurring items since the IPO. £1.5 million of costs 
have been incurred due to Capquest integration, that relate to the termination of debt servicing contracts, as the Group moves from an 
outsourced model to a partially insourced model, and redundancy costs that relate to removal of duplicate roles as the Group combines 
operating and finance functions. 
In the year to 31 December 2014, costs incurred due to the acquisition of Capquest Group amounted to £6,026,000, being fees incurred of 
£5,452,000 and specific staff costs including £374,000 redundancy costs, as a direct result of the acquisition due to duplication of senior 
roles and £200,000 related bonuses. £1,760,000 related to remaining IPO related share issuance charges. In other operating expenses were 
£4,205,000 of non-recurring costs, made up of £2,210,000 in relation to a historic VAT settlement and £1,995,000 of non-recurring contract 
settlements, £1,645,000 of which was directly due to the Capquest acquisition, terminating a duplicate servicing contract.

Deferred tax
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £28,168,000 (2014: £25,728,000) of tax losses carried forward, due to 
uncertainties over the future utilisation of the losses including the future profitability of the relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be 
available for offset against future profits and have no expiry date.
The Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, which was substantively enacted in October 2015, included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax 
from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have generally been calculated using a rate of 18% in 
these accounts.
Non-recurring tax
We have identified non-recurring items in the year amounting to £4,309 ,000 (2014: £12,839 ,000), with a £657 ,000 (2014: £1,503,000) associated 
tax impact. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 93

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to three aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the single operating segment defined 
under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). In relation to goodwill, the three CGUs identified are the Capquest Group, comprising of all group 
companies within the acquired group, Portugal, comprising of all the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar and Gesphone acquisitions, 
and Arrow Global Receivables Management Limited (‘AGRML’). Both the Capquest Group and Portugal CGUs, represent the cash flows 
generated principally from collections on acquired purchased loan portfolios and management of third party debt, and the AGRML CGU 
represents the cash flows generated principally from collections on purchased loan portfolios.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows.

The movement in the Capquest Group goodwill of £47 ,000 from 2014 to 2015 was due to a provision for a VAT claim no longer being required, 
offset by an adjustment to remove a duplicated balance. 
An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2015 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The goodwill was assessed to be 
appropriately stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might  
be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate and forecast cash collections net of direct collection costs, and allowable 
forecast synergies. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 94

 Notes to the financial statements
13  Goodwill (continued)
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the CGUs. The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average 
cost of capital (‘WACC’), and adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate. The factors took into 
account the risks inherent in each of the CGUs, such as currency, regulatory, and economic risks. The different operations in the CGUs 
were also considered and a risk factor applied to the Portuguese CGU. As a result of applying the various risk factors noted above to the 
Group’s WACC, a market participant rate of 6.07% was determined for the AGRML and Capquest CGUs, and a rate of 7.62% was determined 
for the Portuguese CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years 
and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in collection activity which in turn drive the forecast 
collections and cost figures. As at 31 December 2015, the five-year forecast includes  assumed growth based on portfolio purchases per 
annum across the Group increasing to a run rate of £240 million in 2019. These assumptions are in keeping with the directors’ prudent 
expectations of future growth.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGUs carrying value. The CGUs would become impaired based 
on an unlevered post tax cash flow noted below, or based on an increase in the discount rate noted below.

In 2014, a European Court of Justice ruling indicated that, under the European Working Time Directive, ‘normal pay’ for the purposes of 
calculating statutory holiday pay includes contractual overtime and commission, rather than being limited to basic salary. On 4 November 
2014, a UK Employment Tribunal, considering the implications for UK employers, under the Working Time Regulations 1998, ruled that 
overtime pay should be included in calculating holiday pay and a UK Employment Appeal Tribunal decided that, from 1 July 2015, commission 
payments should be included in the calculation. As a result of these tribunals, there is a possibility that workers and employees may seek 
compensation for a shortfall in their holiday pay in prior years. This gives rise to a possible obligation for the Group. The directors do not 
consider any compensation required to be a material amount, particularly as any claims are capped at two years.
Deferred consideration is split between deferred consideration in relation to acquisitions of subsidiaries of £21,926,000 (2014: £nil) and 
deferred consideration in relation to loan portfolios of £51,742,000 (2014:£11,928,000).

Risk management
Treasury related risks
The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board delegates certain 
responsibilities to the treasury and tax committee. The treasury and tax committee, which is chaired by the chief financial officer, is 
empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority. Treasury activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to 
the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are 
designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and 
market risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the Group is properly funded, that financial counterparties 
are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits. Policies also set out the specific 
instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swap, currency swaps and forward currency contracts. 
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. 
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options. No 
written options were entered into during 2015 (2014: £nil).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled 
by cash or another financial asset.
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. 
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed 
debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress testing for the next 18 months on a rolling 
basis. Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates, diversification of debt funding 
sources and no over- reliance on a single or small group of lenders. At 31 December 2015, the Group’s senior secured notes and revolving 
credit facility had an average period to maturity of 5.0 years (2014: 5.3 years). Total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2015 were 
£90,000,000 (2014: £61,001,000).
The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review meetings. Management has 
well established models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this represents a key performance indicator of the business. 
The Group has a low fixed cost base, is highly cash generative with weekly cash receipts and portfolio purchases are discretionary, which 
helps to mitigate liquidity risk. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 102

This demonstrates the headroom on the Group’s committed funding facility repayments in comparison to the current purchased loan 
portfolio’s estimated collections over an 84-month period.
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk considered further below.
Interest rate risk
The Group does not charge interest on the purchased loan portfolios or on any other asset, and therefore is not exposed to interest rate 
risk on its assets. The Group does have an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on its borrowings, principally 
on the senior secured notes, and therefore seeks to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest rate costs, 
including fixed rate funding (predominantly longer-term bond funding), forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency 
funding, bank borrowing loan draw down periods and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest 
rate costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time. Most hedging is for up to three years.
If interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points this would have the following impact:

24  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)
This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
• the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instruments
•  where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there 
is no impact from a change in interest rates; and
• changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments
Currency risk
The Group is subject to three types of currency risk; cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income statement exposure.
Cash flow exposure
The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group  
is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where 
cash flow hedges have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Net asset exposure
A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk 
that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the net assets of the Group. The Group aims to minimise the value of 
net assets denominated in euro by funding portfolio assets with euro denominated borrowings where possible.
Income statement exposure
As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in euro but translated into sterling for reporting purposes. The result 
for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative 
to the euro will have an impact on the consolidated result for the period.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
If foreign exchange rates had been 10% weaker than sterling than those at the balance sheet date and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s net assets and net profit for each denomination of currency would increase/(decrease) as follows:

10% is considered to be a reasonable expectation of possible fluctuations in rates. The above also assumes that there is no impact on retained 
earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability).
The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. Most portfolios by  
their nature are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections that in turn inform the ERC’s on which the 
portfolio balance sheet value is calculated. The on going risk is managed through a portfolio valuation process including modelling 
current expectations of recoverability based on historical information on debt types, considering forecasts from debt servicers and also 
factoring in recoveries from collateral held on the secured portfolios. A pricing gateway process is in place which includes at least two 
members of the executive board as well as other key members from all areas of the business. The Group also monitors its exposure to 
geographic concentration of assets.
This process is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk through to the financial 
assumptions and maximum bid price.
All purchased loan portfolios are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. As part of the regular monitoring process, the future 
cash flows in the ERCs are updated, with ‘write ups’ or ‘write downs posted as a result changes to the estimated cash flows discounted at 
the EIR rate. An impairment is only recognised if the ‘write downs’ exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups.
As part of credit risk, the Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks and 
foreign currency and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk with debt sellers is managed through warranties.
The Group only deposits cash and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict 
limits in respect of amounts of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with board approval. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 106

The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management framework. The Group’s day-to-day 
working capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents. The key risks identified for the Group are discussed below.
Capital risk management
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group is currently 
not required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return 
on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity 
finance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity.
Management reviews the capital structure on an on going basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the 
risks associated with each class of capital. The Group’s position as at 31 December 2015 was:

Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price 
quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques.
For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of 
judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the 
specific instrument.
Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making  
the measurements.
• Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments
•  Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices 
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant 
inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data
•  Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on 
observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that 
are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to 
reflect differences between the instruments
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or 
paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, using prices from observable current market transactions 
and dealer quotes for similar instruments and unobservable inputs such as historic performance data and the Proprietary Collections 
Bureau output. The purchased loan portfolios fair value is calculated using our 84-month ERC through our own in-house models. Derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated 
using quoted prices. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows 
estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value.

Financial instruments not measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy
The following table analyses financial instruments not measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy 
into which the measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the balance sheet. All of the Group’s 
financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 3.

There have been no transfers in or out of Level 3. 
The balance sheet value of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios is derived from discounted cash flows generated by an 84-month ERC 
model. The inputs into the ERC model are historic portfolio collection performance data. This ERC is updated with the core collections 
experience to date on a monthly basis.
Estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR are based on the Group’s collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar 
attributes and characteristics such as date of purchase, original credit grantor, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer 
location, and the time since the original charge off.
Management considers that the valuing of the purchased loan portfolios at amortised cost is comparable to the fair value. The models that 
are used to determine the balance sheet valuation of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios, are the same as those used in pricing portfolio 
purchases. Management believes the purchase price is the best indicator of fair value at a point in time, and therefore considers the model 
driven value on the balance sheet to be fair value.
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of purchased loan portfolio values. This includes regular 
monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an 
individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a quarterly basis, reviews actual against forecast gross cash on cash money multiples, 
signs off the latest ERC forecast and assesses the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the opening to closing balances for the period of the purchased loan portfolios can be seen in note 16.
The company did not hold any other financial instruments not measured at fair value for which a fair value needs to be calculated (2014: none).
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected 
to occur during the period to November 2017. The effect on the statement of comprehensive income will also be within these periods. An 
amount of £729,000 has been charges to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2014: £859,000). All hedges are 
effectively hedged. No charge has been made to the Company’s equity. 
Interest rate swaps
The Group has interest rate swaps in place for a notional amount of £246,832,000 (2014: £176,070,000). In 2015, these interest rate swaps 
cover current borrowings relating to the floating rate euro notes.
Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair value 
thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve. A credit of £nil (2014: £443,000 credit) has been made to the statement 
of comprehensive income in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps.
The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the Group interest rate swaps were as follows:

Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and 
exposure to currency rate fluctuations.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2015 is £67,400,000 
(2014: £143,145,000). These comprise:
•  foreign currency contracts to sell sterling for a total notional of £67,400,000 (2014: £141,580,000). These contracts have maturity dates to 
April 2016. These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof 
has been deferred in equity and fair value will be recycled to the statement of comprehensive income in April 2016; and
•  foreign currency contracts to sell euro for a total notional of £nil (2014: £1,565,000). These contracts are not designated as effective cash 
flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been taken to the statement of comprehensive income 
As at 31 December 2015 the aggregate amount of net gain/loss under forward foreign exchange contracts that have been recognised in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to the exposure on these anticipated future transactions is £nil (2014: 
£64,000 gain).
During the year, £1,257,000 (2014: (£539,000)) was recycled from equity to the statement of comprehensive income as a result of maturity 
of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year.
The Company did not hold any foreign exchanges swaps at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: £nil).

The carrying value of the bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid within 
six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discounting is 
therefore negligible.
The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes, that are based on observable market inputs 
and therefore would be included as ‘Level 2’ in the fair value hierarchy table should the liability have been held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative 
transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation  
of fair value.
For the company, there is no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.
27  Share based payments – group and company
Share incentive plan scheme (SIP)
In April 2015 (and previously in April 2014), the Group offered to all UK employees the opportunity to participate in the above SIP, where 
the Company gives the participating employees one matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using 
the participating employees’ gross salaries. The shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees 
required to stay in employment to receive the shares. 
On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant date price per share of £2.29 
as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment to 
receive the shares.
Upon listing in October 2013, the Group provided eligible employees with a one off award of free shares worth up to £3,000, with a grant 
price per share of £2.425, as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The value of SIP shares awarded was dependent on a linear scale of length 
of service. The free shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment to receive the shares.
Initial share option plan (ISOP)
On 7 October 2013, and 21 October 2013, 3,566,000 ISOP options were granted to employees of the Group. These ISOP options were 
exercisable conditional upon, and with effect from IPO for those granted on 7 October 2013 and from the grant date for those granted on 
21 October 2013. 1,934,000 vested immediately with the remaining to vest in two years from the date they take effect, with employees 
required to stay in employment to receive the shares. The remaining ISOP options of 1,632,288 shares, vested on 11 October 2015, with 
restrictions attached to these shares ceasing to have effect from this date.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
On 15 June 2015, nil cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. The LTIP awards vest 
at the end of three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions. On the same date, tax qualifying options were granted as 
part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’). 
Each CSOP Option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If a CSOP Option is 
exercised at a gain, the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced 
at exercise by the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by 
the grant of the CSOP Option. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 111

The euro senior notes and sterling senior notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Group.
Revolving credit facility
On 31 March 2015, the Group amended its revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc acting as security agent for a syndicate 
of participating financial institutions. The commitments under the facility were increased from £100 million to £140 million. On 22 June

On the 9 February 2016, the revolving credit facility was increased from £165 million to £180 million.
The Group is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin per annum on the undrawn portion of each lender’s 
commitment. The revolving credit facility is secured by the same assets as the euro and sterling senior notes and ranks super senior to these. 
The assets that are secured are those of the Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited Group.

30  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking
Gesphone
On 1 April 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Gesphone Serviços De Tratamento E Acquisção De Dívidas S.A. 
and subsidiary Gesphone STC (‘Gesphone’), satisfied with cash of €6,300,000 and contingent consideration of €2,000,000 for a total 
consideration of €8,300,000. The contingent consideration has been calculated at fair value based on a discount rate of 5.3%, being the 
Group’s current external cost of finance, leading to an overall consideration at fair value of €8,085,000 (£5,797,000). The contingent 
consideration was based on Gesphone employees remaining party to a service agreement, which has been considered highly probable; 
therefore a 100% probability has been applied. Gesphone has a similar principal activity as the Group being the acquisition and management of 
underperforming portfolio of unsecured loans and servicing of debt in relation to third party contracts in Portugal.
Goodwill of €4,475,000 (£3,209,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which makes up the 
goodwill, were to create scale and servicing capability across multiple asset classes, and to strengthen the Group’s position as market leader 
in Portugal. A large element of Gesphone’s prior trade was with Arrow Global, and therefore the majority of the income earned by Gesphone 
is now intragroup income.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, Gesphone contributed revenue of £1,512,000 and operating profit of £674,000 to the 
consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2015, Group total revenue would have been 
an estimated £166,374,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £74,990,000. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 115

S.A. (‘Whitestar’)). Voting control and economic interest passed to the Group on payment of the initial consideration on 22 April 2015, and 
therefore the Group has recognised 100% of Whitestar in its results, as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Group will increase its holding to 
100% in two stages over two years and the total consideration will be satisfied with cash and deferred consideration for €47,833,333. The 
deferred consideration has been calculated at fair value based on a discount rate of 5.3%, being the Group’s current external cost of finance, 
leading to an overall consideration of €47 ,783,000 (£34,263,000). Whitestar has a similar principal activity as the Group being the servicing 
of debt in relation to third party contracts.
Goodwill of €38,709,000 (£27 ,756,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which makes up 
the goodwill, were to create scale and servicing capability across multiple asset classes, and to strengthen the Group’s position as market 
leader in Portugal.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, Whitestar contributed revenue of £9,379,000 and operating profit of £912,000 to the 
consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the 1 January 2015, Group total revenue would have been an 
estimated £169,320,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £74,814,000.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have 
been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 116

Effect of the acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:
             Total
             £000
Property, plant and equipment             778
Intangible assets             4,205
Other assets             1
Deferred tax asset             8
Trade and other receivables             1,907
Cash and cash equivalents             1,307
Trade and other payables             (601 )
Deferred tax liability             (1,098 )
             6,507
Goodwill on acquisition             27 ,756
             34,263
Consideration:
Cash             14,287
Deferred consideration             19 ,976
             34,263
The fair value adjustment on the intangible assets arises from the fair value of existing customer relationships. An associated deferred tax 
liability is created being 29.5% of the fair value adjustment, the rate of Portuguese tax.
Acquisition expenses
The Group incurred acquisition expenses of £1,491,000 in relation to the acquisitions of Gesphone and Whitestar, which has been charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income and included within other operating expenses and has been disclosed as a non-recurring cost.
Measurement period
Whilst the Group believes the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments to be complete, IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to 
one year after acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances that were not in existence at the acquisition 
date. If any additional material changes are required within this measurement period, these will be reflected in the 2016 half-year results of 
the Group.
Prior year acquisition
On 28 November 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Quest Topco Limited and settled secured loan notes at 
the point of acquisition for £104,574,000, satisfied with cash and a deferred payment, with the additional requirement to repay outstanding 
loans and other costs post acquisition of £55,000,000. The deferred payment has subsequently been paid in full. Quest Topco Limited and 
subsidiaries, ‘the Capquest Group’, have a similar principal activity as the Group being the acquisition and management of an underperforming 
portfolio of loans and servicing of debt in relation to third party contracts.
Goodwill of £45,608,000 was created as part of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which make up the goodwill, were to 
strengthen market position, reinforce the business model, diversify origination sources, enhance data capabilities, achieve strong 
synergies and the deal was considered financially attractive for shareholders. Synergies arise from overhead cost savings through removal 
of overlapping and duplicated activities, operating cost savings through better management of collection resources and greater customer 
insight from collections operations expected.
In the one month from acquisition to 31 December 2014, the Capquest Group contributed revenue of £2,514,000 and operating profit of 
£738,000 to the consolidated results for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2014, Group total revenue 
would have been an estimated £137 ,122,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £41,900,000. In determining these amounts, 
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition 
occurred on 1 January 2014.

Effect of the acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:
             Total
             £000
Purchased loan portfolios             104,038
Goodwill             –
Intangible assets             9 ,570
Property, plant and equipment             2,612
Cash and cash equivalents             7 ,286
Other receivables             1,433
Trade and other payables             (10,540 )
Loans and unsecured loan notes             (54,690 )
Deferred tax liability             (743 )
             58,966
Goodwill on acquisition             45,608
             104,574
Consideration:
Cash             102,974
Deferred consideration             1,600
             104,574
The fair value adjustment of £3,800,000 on the portfolio asset acquired arises from a difference between carrying value and management’s 
assessment of fair value. 
Goodwill of £24,732,000 previously recognised in the acquired Group is not an identifiable asset when applying acquisition accounting and 
therefore, has been written off through the fair value adjustments accordingly. 
The Capquest Group undertook a review of plant, property and equipment on 28 November 2014, and £131,000 of assets were written off 
post acquisition.
Other receivables in the acquired entities comprise gross contracted amounts of £1,670,000. There is doubt over the collectability of £237 ,000 
of this amount, being those in excess of 90 days outstanding.
In the one year measurement period, an adjustment to remove a duplicated balance and costs associated with a VAT claim amounted  
to £2,322,000. 
The fair value adjustments created a deferred tax liability of £743,000. The Company previously adjusted its numbers on 1 April 2012 from UK 
GAAP to EU IFRS and a deferred tax liability arising on the difference to the fair value of the portfolio assets at this point was not recorded, this 
amounted to £1,088,000 at acquisition and has been included in the fair value adjustments above. Also, a deferred tax asset of £558,000 in 
relation to losses not previously recognised has been included.
Acquisition expenses
The Group incurred acquisition expenses of £5,402,000 in relation to the acquisition, which has been charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income and included within other operating expenses and has been disclosed as a non-recurring cost.

commissions paid to third party outsourced providers, credit bureau data costs and legal costs associated with collections.
 ‘Core collections’ or ‘core cash collections’ mean collections on the Group’s existing portfolios including ordinary course portfolios  
and putbacks.
 ‘Cost-to-collect ratio’ is the ratio of collection activity costs to core collections.

 ‘Defaulted debt’ means a debt where a customer has breached the repayment terms governing that debt such that it is unlikely to be paid. 
Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 there are specific legal obligations which require a customer to be sent the relevant statutory default 
notice(s) after which the customer’s agreement may ultimately be terminated. Other types of debts may also be defined as defaulted in 
the event that they remain unpaid for a period of 90 days or more, if there is not an acceptable arrangement in place to bring the account 
back up to date, in which case the creditor or lender may reasonably believe that the relationship has broken down. Under the Data 
Protection Act 1990 it is a requirement that any organisation seeking to register a default with a credit reference agency must also send a 
notice of intention to file a default, this notice is very similar in nature to that required under the Consumer Credit Act both of which give 
the debtor 28 days to bring the account back up to date before action is taken.
 ‘DSBP’ means the Arrow Global deferred share bonus plan.
 ‘EBITDA’ means earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
 ‘EBT’ means employee benefit trust.
 ‘EIR’ means effective interest rate (which is based on the loan portfolio’s gross internal rate of return) calculated using the loan portfolio

 ‘EPS’ means earnings per share.
 ‘84-month ERC’ and ‘120-month ERC’ (together ‘gross ERC’), mean the Group’s estimated remaining collections on purchased loan portfolios 
over an 84-month or 120-month period, respectively, representing the expected future core collections on purchased loan portfolios over 
an 84-month or 120-month period (calculated at the end of each month, based on the Group’s proprietary ERC forecasting model, as 
amended from time to time).
 ‘ERC Rollover’ relates to additional cash flows from rolling the asset life on all portfolios to seven years from the date of ERC, including the 
impact of any foreign exchange movement and the impact of reforecast in the period.

at the relevant point in time.

 ‘Net debt’ means the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the senior secured notes, interest thereon, amounts outstanding under 
the revolving credit facility and deferred consideration payable in relation to the acquisition of loan portfolios, less cash and cash equivalents. 
Net debt is presented because it indicates the level of debt after taking out of the Group’s assets that can be used to pay down outstanding 
borrowings, and because it is a component of the maintenance covenants in the revolving credit facility. The breakdown of net debt for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 is as follows:

“ Given our large base 
of recurring revenue 
and forward visibility, 
we are confident 
of further good 
growth in this 
financial year, which 
has started well.”
Group n Bt continued to achieve solid revenue 
growth and good profit growth throughout the year 
to 30 June 2010, in market conditions which remained 
challenging. r evenue increased by 6% and underlying 
pre-tax profit increased by 21% thanks to good control 
of cost growth, even as we continued to enhance our 
It infrastructure, lifting underlying operating margin 
by 230 basis points to 18.5%. (t he effect of currency 
movements was insignificant.)
u nderlying diluted epS increased by 18% to 
23.71 pence. all these underlying figures exclude 
amortisation as well as minor restructuring costs 
last year at previous acquisitions. In view of our 
performance and our strong balance sheet, we are 
confident in increasing our final dividend by 40% 
to 2.8 pence, making 4.2 pence for the full year – 
also up 40% from the previous year.
progress was good in our chief business activity, 
managing and protecting portfolios of domain 
names, which represents just over half our revenue. 
In particular we achieved very strong growth in our 
anti-piracy services under the brand name envisional, 
the high-intellect business based in Cambridge 
which we acquired three years ago.
We seized the initiative in saving our domain 
name clients money – for example, by helping large 
clients rationalise their large worldwide portfolios 
of names, and by helping transfer some smaller 
companies to our lower-cost services. n et revenue 
in domain names and brand protection grew by just 
6% over the year, but we have reinforced customer 
loyalty, and are now excellently positioned to profit 
from the continuing structural shift to online commerce.
t he domain name market continues to be very 
attractive with growth set to continue. Changes, likely 
to be agreed later this year, will mean that many more 
domain name extensions will become available. 
t his will help to fuel growth in the coming years.
our other businesses also performed well. We achieved 
7% revenue growth in our managed hosting business 
providing web-hosting to corporate clients and 9% growth 
in our reseller business.
Given our large base of recurring revenue and 
forward visibility, we are confident of further good 
growth in this financial year, which has started well. 
I want to thank t im a shley, who left the Board this 
year, for his unfailing encouragement and his 
technological insight over a whole decade. I am 
delighted to welcome to the Board Martin Bellamy, 
whose formidable record in the private and public 
sectors includes success at some of the uK’s 
toughest It projects.
above all, I thank all our management and staff for 
a fine performance this year.
John parcell
Chairman
chairman’s statement 5 group NBT pLC annual report 2010
“ We are pleased 
with this strong 
result that once 
again demonstrates 
our robust business 
model. We have 
been affected by 
the economic 
downturn but we 
are confident that 
we are in a strong 
position to take 
advantage of better 
market conditions.”
Corporate brand services
Group n Bt provides a range of services to companies 
to manage and protect their online presence. t he 
core service is the management of domain names. 
Companies often register large numbers of domain 
names in order to protect their intellectual property 
and managing these can be time consuming and 
complex as domain names are registered in over 
250 jurisdictions worldwide. a dditionally Group 
n Bt helps its customers to protect against online 
fraud, digital piracy, counterfeiting and other online 
infringements of their brands through a range of 
products provided through the n etn ames and 
envisional brands.
revenue for Corporate Brand Services for the 
year under review was £22.0 million, up 6% on 
last year . Within these numbers, revenue for domain 
name management was £20.3 million and revenue 
for brand protection services was £1.7 million. 
n etn ames platinum Service revenue grew 7% during 
the year. t his was impacted by lower one-off revenue 
from project work however the recurring domain 
name management element grew by 9%. 
Growth for domain name management was slower 
than previous years as we continued to experience 
longer lead times to close new business and as we 
worked with our customers to help them optimise 
their portfolios of domain names. We believe this 
responsible practice will help us to maintain our 
customer base for the longer term. o ur Domain 
a cquisition service, where we act for our customers 
to buy names for them in the secondary market, 
grew 21% on the previous year but with the first half 
recording most of this revenue.
envisional’s brand protection services did particularly 
well with revenue for the year to 30 June 2010 
of £1.7 million, up 26% on the previous year. t his 
market remains in its infancy and we believe that 
over time companies will need to spend more on 
protecting their brands. t ypically new sales are to 
companies which do not have a budget for this 
activity and so this result is particularly pleasing 
in these more difficult markets.
Managed hosting
Managed hosting services are provided to 
companies in the u K and France. r evenue for the 
year under review was £6.4 million, up 7% on the 
previous year. We are attracting new customers at 
a good rate as our product range is continually 
updated to keep pace with new technologies. 
However growth has been affected, partly by a higher 
level of cancellations, as some small companies have 
been unable to continue with their services and also 
by projects requiring hosting being delayed. 
partner and reseller services
a scio is our partner and reseller brand offering other 
ISps the ability to register a wide range of domain 
names using our technology and systems. r evenue 
for the year was £8.5 million, up 9% on last year. 
revenue has grown well even though our partners 
have experienced lower growth. We are encouraged 
that we have been able to build our base of partners 
at a faster rate than previously which has helped 
during the year.
I am pleased to report that Group nBt continued to 
grow its business and improve margins in what was 
a challenging year. a lthough revenue growth was 
lower than in previous years, this was in part driven 
by our strategy of taking a longer term view and 
working with our customers to ensure they were 
able to achieve best value wherever possible. t he 
business environment across all our markets was 
difficult as our customers were generally feeling 
the effects of the global recession. However, the 
underlying markets in which we operate remained 
strong with new developments during the year. 
t his is especially so in the domain name market, 
providing good growth opportunities for the future. 
We are particularly pleased with our brand protection 
products which made excellent progress as companies 
become increasingly aware of the need to protect 
their brands in the online market. 
Strategy
We continue with our strategy to build recurring revenue 
by delivering excellent products and high levels of 
service to our customers. t he quality and the resilience 
of this high value revenue has proved itself over the last 
two years. It has helped to ensure that we have a stable 
revenue base in our core markets and provides a platform 
for growth. We have built on our market leading 
position in europe and we will continue to develop 
our market position geographically and through 
service improvement and product enhancement.
Market conditions
t he year under review was particularly difficult as 
customers and prospective customers were generally 
restrained by tighter cost controls. a s a result we 
acquired new customers at a slower rate than normal 
and some of our customers took this opportunity to 
rationalise their portfolios of domain names. More 
positively sales of additional products including 
netnames Brand p rotection products improved.
t owards the end of the last financial year changes 
within the market meant that we had a number of 
new domain name extensions to offer customers. 
t hese changes made little difference to revenue in 
the year under review but will provide opportunities 
for additional revenue in the current year and more 
importantly in subsequent years. 
Financial overview
revenue for the Group was £43.9 million for the 
year to 30 June 2010, up 6% on the previous year 
and up 5% on a constant currency basis. t his 
reduced rate of growth reflects market conditions 
and our strategy to maintain our customer base 
by helping our customers manage costs in these 
difficult markets.
profit before tax and amortisation was £8.1 million, 
up 21% on the previous year and up 20% on a 
constant currency basis.
Cash generation remained strong and at the end of 
the financial year the Group had £11.4 million net cash, 
up from £5.2 million at the end of the previous year .
chief executive’s review group NBT pLC annual report 2010 6
Taxation
a tax charge of £1.7 million (2009: £1.1 million) 
arose in the year representing an effective tax rate 
of 23.2% (2009: 21.1%). t he effective tax rate on 
profit excluding amortisation, restructuring costs 
and related tax credits was 23.5% (2009: 22.3%).
t he effective rate of tax is currently below the uK 
statutory rate of corporation tax of 28% as a result 
of utilisation and recognition of trading losses and 
other timing differences previously unrecognised 
given the uncertainty relating to their recoverability. 
Cash flow
Strong cash generation resulted in net cash balances 
of £11.4 million at year end, up from £5.2 million 
at 30 June 2009.
net cash inflow from operations for the year was 
£9.4 million compared to £7.2 million last year. 
Cash conversion was ahead of last year and the net 
cash position at year end reflects the results of our 
increased efforts to reduce receivables. 
During the year expenditure on tangible fixed assets 
decreased to £1.2 million from £1.5 million last year, 
£0.1 million (2009: £0.2 million) was paid in respect 
of the final tranche of deferred consideration 
relating to the acquisition of envisional and £0.3 million 
(2009: £0.1 million) was received from share 
option exercises. 
a t 30 June 2010, the Group had cash balances of 
£13.4 million (2009: £8.2 million) and debt of £2.0 million 
(2009: £3.0 million) before unamortised facility fees.
Dividend
an interim dividend of 1.4 pence was paid 
on 1 a pril 2010. a final dividend of 2.8 pence is 
proposed bringing the total for the year to 4.2 pence 
(2009: 3.0 pence). Subject to its approval at the 
a nnual General Meeting on 25 n ovember 2010, the 
final dividend will be payable on 14 January 2011 to 
shareholders on the register on 3 December 2010. 
geoff Wicks
Chief Executive officer
partner and reseller services continued
new customers take time to link their systems to 
ours so the sales made to new partners during the 
year under review will have greater impact during 
this current year. We are particularly pleased that we 
have acquired several larger ISps as partners during 
the year. europe continues to be our most important 
market for these services where we focus on higher 
margin business from ISps based more on country code 
domain names which are more complex to manage.
online services
Group n Bt ’s online services register and renew domain 
names and provide hosting and email services through 
the websites of several of our brands, primarily the 
easily brand in the u K and Speednames in europe. 
r evenue for these services for the year under 
review was £7.1 million, 1% down on last year. t his 
improvement on the previous year’s rate of decline 
is in part caused by the movement of some hitherto 
domain name management customers to our online 
business. Without this transfer of business, revenue 
would have reduced by 6%.
We expect this part of our business to continue to 
decline as customers for our legacy brands move, 
however the performance of the easily and Speednames 
brands was significantly better than the other brands. 
profit 
t he overall gross margin of 73.6% was slightly ahead 
of last year’s 73.2% with the revenue mix remaining 
largely unchanged.
u nderlying operating profit, excluding amortisation 
and in the previous year, restructuring costs, at 
£8.1 million, increased 20% year-on-year and 
19% on a constant currency basis with the margin 
increasing to 18.5% from 16.2% last year. t he 
year-on-year change arose from a combination 
of revenue growth with largely unchanged gross 
margins and a relatively modest increase in overheads. 
t his was achieved through careful cost management 
and continuing efficiency gains through process 
improvements. Domain acquisitions continued to 
contribute to operating profits with an increase over 
the previous year which itself was a record year. 
While we believe that the market for valuable domain 
names will continue to be increasingly active this 
revenue is one-off in nature and for larger 
transactions, driven by specific customer activity. 
underlying profit before tax, excluding amortisation 
and restructuring costs, at £8.1 million, increased 
21% year-on-year and 20% on a constant currency 
basis with the margin increasing to 18.6% from 
16.2% last year. 
o n a statutory basis: operating profit was £7.1 million, 
up 42% from £5.0 million last year; profit before tax 
was £7.2 million, up 43% from £5.0 million last year; 
basic epS was 21.48 pence, up 37% from 15.68 pence 
last year; and diluted epS was 20.99 pence, up 37% from 
15.30 pence last year.

report on corporate governance
t he Company is listed on aIM and is not required to comply with the provisions of the 2008 FrC Combined Code (the Code) and therefore this is not a statement 
of compliance as required by the Code. nevertheless the Board is committed to ensuring that proper standards of corporate governance operate throughout the 
Group and has followed the principles of the Code so far as is practicable and appropriate for the nature and size of the Group.
a statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 13. Below is a brief description of the role of the Board and its 
Committees, followed by a statement regarding the Group’s system of internal controls. t he Directors recognise the value of, and are committed to, high standards 
of corporate governance.
Board of Directors
t he Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, the Chief executive officer, a further executive and four non-executive Directors. t he Directors’ 
biographies, set out on page 8, demonstrate the broad range of experience and knowledge they bring to the Company enabling them to offer sound judgment 
on the proper management of the Group.
t he Board meets at least ten times per year and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for it for decision. It is responsible for approving the overall Group 
strategy, acquisitions, major capital expenditure projects, reviewing the trading performance, ensuring adequate funding and reporting to shareholders. t o enable 
the Board to discharge its duties, management provides appropriate and timely information in advance of each meeting. all Directors have access to advice from 
the Company Secretary and are able to take independent professional advice as required.
t he longest serving Directors, since their last appointment or reappointment, are Geoff Wicks and Claus anderson who offer themselves for re-election at the next 
annual General Meeting. Martin Bellamy, who was appointed on 1 august 2010, also offers himself for re-election.
t he Board of Directors considers all the non-executive Directors to be independent of management and, in making this decision, have had regard to guidance 
issued by several of the Group’s largest institutional investors. richard Madden is the Senior Independent Director.
t he following Committees deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
remuneration Committee
t he remuneration Committee is chaired by Keith Young. Its other members are John p arcell and richard Madden. t he Committee meets at least twice a year. 
t he Committee’s report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 9 to 10.
Audit Committee
t he audit Committee is chaired by richard Madden. Its other members are Keith Young and John p arcell. Meetings may also be attended, by invitation, by the 
Chief executive officer and the Finance Director. t he Committee meets at least twice a year and provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors.
relationship with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority. t he Chairman’s Statement and the Chief executive’s review on pages 4 to 6 include a detailed review of 
the business and future developments. t here is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders including presentations after the Group’s announcements of the 
interim and annual results. t he Company’s website carries reproductions of the Group’s financial reports and announcements. t he annual General Meeting 
provides a further forum for private and institutional shareholders to communicate with the Board and their active participation is welcomed. Details of resolutions 
to be proposed at the annual General Meeting are set out in the notice of annual General Meeting.
Internal control
t he Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such a system can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. t he Board believes that the Group has internal control systems in place appropriate to the size 
and nature of its business.
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been in place throughout the year. t hat process

directors’ remuneration report t he Company is listed on aIM. Below is a Directors’ remuneration report that is not required but is given voluntarily to provide enhanced disclosure on 
Directors’ remuneration and to satisfy the aIM requirements. 
remuneration Committee
t he Committee consists of three non-executive Directors: John p arcell and richard Madden, under the chairmanship of Keith Young. none of the Committee 
members have any personal financial interests (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement 
in running the business. t he Committee consults the Chief executive officer about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside 
the Company. t he Committee makes recommendations to the Board. no Director plays a part in any discussions about their own remuneration.
remuneration policy
executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Company’s position as a market 
leader . t he performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package 
are undertaken by the Committee. t he remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the articles of association.
t here are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management:
 basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
 annual bonus payments;
 long term incentive awards; and
 pension arrangements.
Basic salary
an executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility . 
In deciding appropriate levels the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research and independent surveys. executive Directors’ 
contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the annual General Meeting. t he executive Directors are entitled 
to accept appointments outside the Company providing the Chairman’s permission is sought in advance.
Annual bonus payments
t he Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid and these objectives target both revenue and profit 
growth. account is also taken of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which the executive Directors are responsible and the extent to 
which the strategic objectives set by the Board are being met.
Long term incentives
t he Board believes that long term incentive schemes are important in retaining and recruiting high-calibre individuals and ensuring that the performance 
of executives is focused on creating long term shareholder value. a wards of shares and options will be considered by the Committee on an ongoing basis. 
t he current long t erm Incentive plan has performance targets related to the growth in the Company’s earnings per share.
Directors’ pensions
up to 10% of salary is paid by the Company into Directors’ personal pension schemes, although they may also sacrifice basic annual salary to supplement pension contributions.
performance graph
t he following graph shows the Company’s share price performance, compared with the performance of the Ft Se aIM and the Ft Se Small Cap Indices. 
t he Ft Se aIM Index was selected as the Company is a constituent of that index. t he Ft Se Small Cap Index was selected, as this is believed to be the most 
appropriate and broad comparator of the Company’s performance.
Directors’ contracts
executive Directors currently have up to six-month rolling service contracts. t he Company may have a contractual obligation to pay compensation for the 
unexpired portion of a Director’s contract if it is terminated early together with related payments, if any, at the discretion of the Committee.
Non-executive Directors
all non-executive Directors have between six-month and twelve-month rolling contracts. remuneration is determined by the Board based within the limits set out in the articles of 
association and based upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. t he fee paid to each non-executive Director in the year was £20,000 
(2009: £20,000) with the exception of Claus anderson, who did not receive a fee. John p arcell received £27,500 (2009: £27,500) for his services as non-executive Chairman. group NBT pLC annual report 2010 10

t he Directors present their annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 June 2010.
principal activities
t he principal activities of the Group during the year were the provision of domain name, web hosting, brand protection and other internet related services.
Business review
a review of the business and future developments together with the key performance indicators of business performance is set out in the Chairman’s Statement 
and the Chief executive’s review on pages 4 to 6.
results and dividends
t he results of the Group for the year are shown in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 15.
an interim dividend of 1.4 pence (2009: 1.0 pence) per ordinary share was paid on 1 april 2010. t he Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of 2.8 pence per ordinary share making the total for the year of 4.2 pence per share (2009: 3.0 pence).
principal risks and future developments
t he Directors believe that the principal risks faced by the Group arise in the areas of its products and services sold to customers, its technology platforms and its staff.
t he Group’s services are primarily delivered over the Internet via a complex technical infrastructure. We operate in an environment where there may be rapid 
changes in the market, technology and operational methodologies. t he Group therefore has an ongoing programme of market and competitive review, product 
and services development and infrastructure enhancement.
t he Group operates in growing markets with varying degrees of competition in the different sectors it serves. In the domain name management market, where the 
Group has operations in both europe and the uS, it has a leading position in europe primarily through its high market share in the uK. While its position in the uS 
is steadily improving, this market is home to the Group’s major domain name management competitors. t he managed hosting market, where the Group operates 
largely in the uK, has fragmented competition and the Group has positioned itself as a mid-market specialist provider. t he online market is large with substantial 
competition and the Group differentiates its offering through cost effective solutions with after sales service.
t he Group’s products, services and infrastructure are supported by skilled staff; from account management and fulfilment through to technical support. t he Group 
is therefore reliant upon its ability to attract, train and retain the right mix of staff.
t he Directors monitor the risks facing the Group on a regular basis.

1 Accounting policies
general information
Group nBt plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) is a leading provider of domain names and internet-related services. operating in 
eight countries, it has 287 employees.
t he Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the u K. t he address of the registered office is 3rd f loor, prospero h ouse, 241 Borough h igh Street, 
london Se1 1Ga.
t he Company is listed on aIM.
a) Basis of preparation 
t he Consolidated f inancial Statements have been prepared in accordance with eu endorsed International f inancial reporting Standards (IfrS) and the IfrIC 
interpretations issued by the IaSB and the Companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IfrS. t he Consolidated f inancial Statements are prepared 
under the historic cost convention as modified by share-based payments measured at fair value through the income statement.
t he principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below:
b) Basis of consolidation
t he Consolidated f inancial Statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
at the balance sheet date. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. 
t he results of subsidiaries acquired (or disposed of) in the year are included (or excluded) in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Business combinations
t he acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. t he cost of acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of the underlying 
assets, liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
t he acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IfrS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised 
at fair value at acquisition date.
d) Revenue recognition
r evenue is derived from the Group’s principal activity of the provision of internet-related services covering domain name management, web hosting and brand protection 
services. r evenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable; and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course 
of business, net of discounts, Va t and other sales related taxes. Where services are invoiced in advance, revenue is deferred in the balance sheet until the services are provided. 
e) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets at the date of their acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as 
an asset and reviewed annually for impairment. any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. on disposal 
of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal. Goodwill is denominated in the functional 
currency in which the acquired entity operates.
f) Impairment of assets
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. t he recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. t he carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment only when events indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss. t he recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and the value-in-use to the Group. an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds 
the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating unit’s or asset’s value-in-use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset, that have not already been included in the 
estimate of future cash flows.
g) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as domain names, are capitalised at cost and amortised over their useful economic life. Intangible assets acquired 
through a business combination such as customer lists and intellectual property are initially measured at fair value and amortised over their useful economic life. 
amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset. Intangible assets 
are amortised from the date they are available for use.
t he estimated useful lives are as follows: 
  domain names  – 20 years
  technology-based assets – 5 to 7 years
  non-compete agreements  – 1 year
  customer lists – 5 years group NBT pLC annual report 2010 20

general information continued
h) Property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. t he cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price 
and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use. depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of all property, plant and equipment to their 
estimated residual value over their expected useful economic life as follows:
  computer equipment – 2 to 4 years
  fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 years
  leasehold improvements  – over the period of the lease
t he assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. t he gain or loss arising on 
the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement. 
i) Taxation
t he tax expense represents the aggregate of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. t he tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. t he Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. d eferred tax assets are generally 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. t he carrying amount 
of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
however, deferred tax is not provided for temporary differences that arise: from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss; and on the initial recognition of goodwill.
j) Financial instruments
f inancial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms 
of the financial instrument.
Financial assets – loans and receivables
  Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of less than three months.
  t rade and other receivables
  t rade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition, and then subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable.
Financial liabilities – held at amortised cost
  t rade payables
 t rade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition, and then subsequently at amortised cost.
  loans and borrowings
  Bank borrowings represent interest bearing loans which are recorded at fair value on initial recognition, being proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
f inance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowing using the effective interest 
rate method.
  Capital
  f inancial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the assets of the Group after the deduction of all 
liabilities. t he Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. f or the purposes of the disclosures given in note 20 the Group considers its capital 
to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated retained earnings.
k) Foreign currencies
t ransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency, Sterling, at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. exchange differences arising 
from the movement in rates between the date of transaction and the date of settlement are taken to the income statement as they arise. 
assets and liabilities (including goodwill and intangible assets which are allocated to overseas income generating units) of overseas subsidiaries are translated into 
Sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date. t he results of these subsidiaries are translated at an average rate of exchange for the year. 
exchange gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of an overseas subsidiary, together with exchange differences arising on the use 
of the average rate of exchange, are taken directly to shareholders’ equity and recognised in the cumulative translation reserve. o n disposal of a foreign subsidiary, 
the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 21 group NBT pLC annual report 2010

k) Foreign currencies continued
t he main foreign currency exchange rates used in the financial statements to consolidate the overseas subsidiaries are as follows:
   Closing rate  a verage rate
      2010 2009 2010 2009
uS dollar      1.51 1.65 1.58 1.61
euro      1.23 1.18 1.14 1.17
danish Krone      9.20 8.76 8.47 8.75
l) Leases
assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the 
period of the lease and the estimated useful economic life of the assets. t he finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital 
amount outstanding and are charged to the income statement. operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal amounts over the lease term.
m) Retirement benefit costs
t he Company makes contributions to a defined contribution plan for directors and employees. t he amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension 
costs is the contributions payable in the year.
n) Share-based payments
t he Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan together with a long t erm Incentive plan (ltIp). t he fair value of the services received is determined 
by the fair value of the options and shares granted which in turn is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity . t he fair value of options and 
shares are measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions of grant and the resulting fair value spread over 
the vesting period. n on-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, 
ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options and shares that eventually vest.
o) Dividends 
equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. f inal dividends are recognised when approved 
by the Company’s shareholders at the annual General Meeting.
p) Segment reporting
a business segment is a group of assets and operations whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Board, and for which discrete financial 
information is available. a geographical business segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
q) Provisions
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that 
obligation. provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted 
to present value where the effect is material.
r) Research and development
an internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development is recognised only if all the following conditions are met:
  an asset is created that can be identified;
  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. t he amortisation charge is within total net operating expenses 
on the face of the income statement.
Where no internally generated asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
s) Holiday pay accrual
employee benefit accruals are made in respect of holiday entitlements that have accrued to employees but have not been taken at the balance sheet date.
t) Adoption of new and revised IFRSs
During the year the Group has adopted the following new standards:
  IaS 1 p resentation of f inancial Statements (revised 2007). IaS 1, ‘p resentation of f inancial Statements (revised 2007)’ introduces the possibility of either a single 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (combining the Income Statement and a Statement of Comprehensive Income) or to retain the Income Statement 
with a supplementary Statement of Comprehensive Income. t he second option has been adopted by Group nBt plc. as this standard is concerned with 
presentation only it does not have any impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
  r evised Ifr S 3 Business Combinations (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 july 2009). t his revision was endorsed by the eu on 15 june 2009. 
t his revision requires prospective application and may result in acquisition costs being recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, intangible assets being recognised even when it cannot be reliably measured, and the option to gross up the balance sheet for goodwill 
attributable to minority interests. t his will be applicable in the future if the Group were to make any further acquisitions.
  amendment to IaS 27 Consolidated and Separate f inancial Statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 july 2009). t his amendment was endorsed 
by the eu on 15 j une 2009. t his amendment requires prospective application and could result in a change in differences where acquisitions or disposals of 
subsidiaries are made in stages. t his could be applicable if the Company made piecemeal acquisitions or disposals in the future, which is not currently anticipated.
none of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments, also effective for the first time from 1 july 2009, have had a material effect on the financial statements. group NBT pLC annual report 2010 22

t) Adoption of new and revised IFRSs continued
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning 
after 1 july 2010 and which the Group has decided not to adopt early.
  Improvements to IfrSs (2009) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2010). t his was endorsed by the eu on 23 March 2010. t he 
improvements in this amendment clarify the requirements of Ifr Ss and eliminate inconsistencies within and between Standards. t he a mendment changes Ia S 38 
to bring the guidance on the treatment of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination in line with the requirements of Ifr S 3(r ) and to clarify the 
description of valuation techniques used in the absence of an active market. t his will be applicable in the future if the Group were to make any further acquisitions, 
which is not currently anticipated. 
  Improvements to IfrSs (2010) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2011). t he improvements in this amendment clarify the 
requirements of IfrSs and eliminate inconsistencies within and between Standards. t he changes include amendments to IfrS 3 (revised 2008) Business 
combinations, which will be applicable in the future if the Group were to make any further acquisitions, which is not currently anticipated. 
  Classification of rights Issues (amendment to IaS 32) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 f ebruary 2010). t his amendment was endorsed 
by the eu on 27 december 2009. t his amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues (rights, options or warrants) that are denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the issuer. previously such rights issues were accounted for as derivative liabilities. however, the amendment requires 
that, provided the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments, 
such rights issues are classified as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. t his will be applicable in the future if the Group 
were to undertake a rights issue, which is not currently anticipated. 
  revised IaS 24 related p arty disclosures (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2011). t his revision was endorsed by the eu on 
19 july 2010. t he revision to IaS 24 is in response to concerns that the previous disclosure requirements and the definition of a related party were too complex 
and difficult to apply in practice, especially in environments where government control is pervasive. t his will be applicable in the future if the Company were to 
make any related party transactions, which is not currently anticipated. 
  IfrS 9 f inancial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2013). IfrS 9 will eventually replace IaS 39 in its entirety.
h owever, the process has been divided into three main components: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting. a s each phase is 
completed, it will delete the relevant portions of IaS 39 and create new chapters in IfrS 9. t his will be applicable in the future to the Group’s measurement and 
classification of financial instruments. 
none of the other changes are considered to have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the Consolidated f inancial Statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the Group’s accounting policies and make estimates 
about the future. t he critical judgements that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the Consolidated f inancial Statements and the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below:
Acquisitions
When acquiring a business, the directors have to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price and seek appropriate 
competent and professional advice before making any such allocations. 
Determination of fair values of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. t he amortisation 
expense is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are 
separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal rights. t he amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate 
valuation techniques.
Deferred tax on business combinations
t he recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of trading losses is based on the assessment of future profits around which there is always a degree of uncertainty.
Impairment reviews
t he Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated above. t he recoverable amounts of 
cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. t hese calculations require the use of estimates (note 11). t he use of this method 
requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. actual outcomes may vary.
Income taxes
t he Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes (note 8). 
t here are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. t he Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the 
amounts that were recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets are amortised and property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. useful lives are based on the management’s estimates 
of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant 
variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the income statement in specific periods.  23 group NBT pLC annual report 2010
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Share-based payments
t he Group has four equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. employee services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, are 
measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. t he fair value of 
shares and share options is estimated by using the valuation model, Black-Scholes, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. t hose assumptions are described 
in note 21 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected volatility, expected continued employment, expected life of the options and number of options 
expected to vest. More details including carrying values are disclosed in note 21. t he charge recognised in future periods in respect of these schemes will vary if 
changes are made in respect of the estimates for the rate of lapse of the options.
Deferred tax on share options
t he deferred tax asset on shares and share option charges is affected by the difference between the grant price of the shares and share options and the market price 
of the Company’s shares at the accounting year end. If the market value of the shares at the date of exercise were to be lower than the market value at the accounting 
year end, the amount of tax relief obtained would be less than anticipated in the deferred tax calculations.
3 Segmental analysis
at present the Group’s activities are operated largely through a common infrastructure and support functions and therefore in the opinion of the directors 
its activities constitute one operating segment through which it provides its services.
t he Group reviews the operating performance of the business by revenue from each of its following services: domain name services – management of corporate 
domain name portfolios; managed hosting services – dedicated hosting solutions for SMes; reseller services – white-labelled domain name registration services for 
ISps and other intermediaries; online services – domain names, email and shared hosting; and brand protection services – monitoring the Internet for brand abuse, 
fraud, piracy and counterfeiting.

10 earnings per share
t he basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 june 2010 are based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, of £5,521,000 
(2009: £3,964,000) and on the weighted average number of shares of 25,705,000 (2009: 25,279,000).
a n adjusted earnings per share has also been presented in addition to the earnings per share and is based on earnings adjusted to eliminate the effects of amortisation 
and restructuring costs. It has been calculated to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

goodwill impairment tests
during the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Goodwill was allocated to individual cash generating 
units based on the Group’s operations and the carrying value of each unit is set out below: 
        2010 2009 
        £’000  £’000

other european countries        18,770 19,709
        27,523 28,598
t he recoverable amounts of the cash generating units were determined from value-in-use calculations. t hese calculations were based on cash flow projections 
from approved budgets and forecasts, past performance and management’s expectations of future performance of the relevant cash generating units which cover 
a five-year period. other key assumptions used in these calculations were the discount rate applied to future cash flows, 10% (2009: 10%) and a future perpetuity 
rate of 3% (2009: 1% to 3%). as a result of these tests, no impairment provisions are considered necessary. group NBT pLC annual report 2010 28

jurisdiction as the deferred tax assets.
t he Group had potential deferred tax assets that were not recognised at 30 june 2010 as the timing of the relief could not be assessed with sufficient certainty 
and a proportion of the tax losses have yet to be agreed with the appropriate revenue authority. t he unrecognised amounts shown below are the gross temporary

Bank loan
on 16 january 2007, a five-year term bank loan of £5,000,000 was arranged and drawn down in connection with the acquisition of Group nBt a/S. t he loan bears 
interest based on l IBor which for the year was at an average rate of 1.60% (2009: 3.90%); and is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s assets 
and will be repaid by equal amounts over the loan term. t he maturity of the bank loan is shown in note 19(iii).
In the above table, loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £26,208 (2009: £43,208). t he Group has charged to the Consolidated Income Statement issue 
costs of £17,000 (2009: £17,000) in respect of these facilities. t hese costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate 
on the carrying amount.

19 Financial instruments
t his note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
t here have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks 
or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
t he Group’s financial instruments at 30 june 2010 comprised: trade and other receivables; cash and cash equivalents; loans and borrowings; trade and other payables.
Fair value of financial instruments
all the Group’s financial instruments are carried at amortised cost.
t he Group believes that there is no material difference between the book and fair value of its financial instruments, in the current or prior year, due to the 
instruments bearing interest at floating rates or being of short-term nature.
general objectives, policies and procedures
t he Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility 
for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies, to the 
executive directors and senior management.
t he overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility.
i) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the possibility that a financial loss will occur as a result of a customers’ inability to meet its financial obligations.
Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables. potential customers are subjected to credit verification procedures before credit terms 
are granted. t he quality of existing debt which has not been provided for is considered to be collectable and procedures are in place to monitor trade receivables 
on an ongoing basis to minimise exposure to bad debts. t rade receivables are only written-off once all methods of collection have been exhausted. 
t he maximum exposure to credit risk is the trade receivable balance at the year end. t he Group has no significant exposure to large or key customers.
loans and receivables are summarised as follows:

ii) Market risk
Market risk refers to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
a) Interest rate risk
t he Group analyses the interest rate exposure on a quarterly basis and analyses the sensitivity of the net result for the year to a reasonable possible change in interest rates 
of +1% and -1%. t he impact on the income and net assets of a 1% change would be £112,000 (2009: £7,000). t he gain or loss potential is then compared to the limits 
determined by management. group NBT pLC annual report 2010 32

b) Currency risk
t he Group has overseas subsidiaries, which operate in Continental europe and the u Sa . t heir activities and net assets are denominated in the functional currencies of the 
operating units. t he Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on translation of the overseas net assets and results into Sterling for accounting purposes. 
In addition the Group as a whole is exposed to transactions which give rise to foreign exchange risk. t he Group reviews its exposure on an on-going basis. 
t he foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are as follows:

t he Group’s currency exposures are in part minimised as natural hedging occurs through costs and revenues incurred in the same currency. t he exposures that 
arise give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and 
liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved. at 30 june 2010 and 30 june 2009, these 
exposures are immaterial to the Group.
If exchange rates had moved by +10% or -10% over and above the rates at the year end, the change in monetary assets and liabilities would be £430,000 (2009: £115,000).
iii) Liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due, and to replace funds when 
they are withdrawn.
t he Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably, by the use 
of medium-term and long-term facilities. a t the balance sheet date all borrowing facilities were held with the Bank of Scotland. t he Group believes that there is a low 
likelihood on there being an immediate call on its liabilities. 
t he table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities, at the balance sheet date, and financial assets which mitigate liquidity 
risk. t he amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
t hese f inancial Statements present financial information for Group nBt plc as a separate entity, and have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost 
convention, the Companies a ct 2006 and u nited Kingdom a ccounting Standards (u K Generally a ccepted a ccounting practice). t he Company’s consolidated 
financial statements, prepared in accordance with IfrSs as adopted by the european union, are separately presented. t he principal accounting policies adopted 
in these Company f inancial Statements are set out below and, unless otherwise indicated, have been consistently applied for all periods presented.
In accordance with frS 18 accounting p olicies, the directors have reviewed the accounting policies of the Company as set out below and consider them to be appropriate. 
t he principal accounting policies are:
Share-based payments
When shares and share options are granted to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account and a reserve created in capital and reserves to record the fair 
value of the awards at the date of grant in accordance with frS 20 Share-based payment. t his charge is spread over the vesting period. When shares and share 
options are granted to employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the awards is treated as a capital contribution, increasing the cost of the investment and spread 
over the period of performance relating to the grant. t he corresponding entry is made in reserves.
revenue
revenue is the total amount receivable by the Company for management and other services provided to other Group companies, excluding V at , and is recognised 
on performance of these services. 
Tangible fixed assets
depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets at the rates calculated to write-off the cost of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
  computer equipment – 2 to 4 years
  fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 years
  leasehold improvements  – over the period of the lease
Investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. Where applicable, the Company takes advantage of merger 
relief, recording the investment in the Company’s balance sheet at the fair value of the shares issued, with any premium included within the merger reserve.
Impairment of fixed assets
t he need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its net realisable value and 
value in use.
pension costs
Contributions to the Company personal pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable. t he Company does 
not operate any defined benefit pension plans.
Dividend income
dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
equity dividends
f inal dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity dividends 
are recognised in the period they are paid.
2 result for the financial year
t he Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies act 2006 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements. 
t he Company profit for the year ended 30 june 2010 under uK Gaap was £181,000 (2009: profit £3,883,000).

Annual Report 2008
Russia is the world’s tenth largest 
economy and has seen healthy GDP 
growth in recent years. It is widely 
viewed as an attractive emerging 
market for companies who are 
looking to grow their business.
Russia is a country with substantial long term 
growth potential and along with Brazil, India and 
China (the BRIC economies) is seen as an emerging 
economic power.
A signiﬁ cant driver behind Russia’s economy is its oil, 
gas and mineral wealth. This, along with a sustained 
period of political stability has underpinned the 
development of many other areas of the market. 
Russia’s car market has been one of the largest in 
Europe and other sectors such as food & drink, 
building & interiors and outbound travel and tourism 
have also seen signiﬁ cant growth in recent years.

Annual Report 2008
Since their independence from 
the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, 
the countries of Central Asia 
and the Caucasus have emerged 
as an increasingly attractive region 
for investment and economic 
development.
Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth largest country, 
covering a vast area and is rich in natural resources 
such as oil and metals. 
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also have signiﬁ cant 
natural resources. In Azerbaijan, revenues from the 
oil sector have fuelled some of the highest GDP 
growth rates in the world in recent years, helping 
to stimulate the expansion of many other industry 
sectors.

Annual Report 2008
ITE’s main interest in Eastern & 
Southern Europe is focused on 
the Turkish and Ukrainian markets. 
Both countries have delivered robust 
economic growth in recent years. 
Turkey and Ukraine are both keen to strengthen ties 
with the EU. Turkey opened accession negotiations 
in 2005 but have made slow progress. Ukraine is keen 
to build on its ‘association agreement’ with the EU 
but is hampered by internal politics and split loyalties 
between Russia and Europe.
Nevertheless, long term growth prospects remain good 
and there continues to be interest from companies 
looking to establish their business in the region.

Annual Report 2008
Overview
Chairman’s statement
Group performance
ITE Group plc has produced another strong set of ﬁ nancial 
results for the year ending 30 September 2008. In the 
lesser year of our biennial pattern, revenues increased 
by 11% to £110.1 million (2007: £99.1 million). Headline 
pre-tax proﬁ t increased by 5% to £37.1 million and 
reported Proﬁ t before tax has increased to £34.5 million 
(2007: £33.7 million). Fully diluted earnings per share 
have increased to 9.3p per share (2007: 9.0p per share). 
These results have been achieved alongside mixed trading 
conditions in some of our markets and are a good indication 
of the resilience of the Group’s business model. The Group 
generated cash ﬂ ow from operations of £52.9 million in 
the year, from which it applied £13.5 million to investment 
in new businesses, £12.1 million to dividends and 
£15.9 million to share buy backs. The Group’s cash balances 
at the year end were £29.1 million (2007: £26.7million).
Strategic progress
The Group’s primary strategy over the past few years 
has been to maximise the organic growth opportunities 
available through its strong market positions in Russia and 
Central Asia. The Group has an established management 
structure and a business model which is capable of 
replication both in our existing markets and in other 
emerging market countries. The Group continues with
its strategy of seeking opportunities for ITE to leverage 
its international sales network onto local products.
In Russia and in Central Asia, ITE has the unique assets 
of strong local infrastructure and an eﬀ ective international 
sales network. The Group has recently made good 
progress in expanding its international sales reach by 
opening oﬃ  ces in China, and more recently Spain, Dubai 
and Malaysia. Progress has also been made this year 
to expand the Group’s product range by acquiring the 
Interstroyexpo construction event in St Petersburg, the 
Sﬁ tex security event in St Petersburg and a complete 
portfolio of exhibitions in Novosibirsk, Siberia. The 
businesses are performing to plan and the beneﬁ t of 
these acquisitions will have their ﬁ rst impact on our 
proﬁ ts in 2009.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
We continue to maintain excellent relationships with 
our venue partners. In Kazakhstan we have agreed to 
support the Almaty venue in its plans to expand the total 
gross exhibition space by 20,000m
2
. In Baku, Azerbaijan, 
construction has started on a new 28,000m
2
 exhibition 
centre where ITE will become the anchor tenant in 
a country whose economy is still showing robust growth.
The recent change in the world economic climate  will 
present new and fresh challenges for the Group in the 
markets in which it operates. We are well positioned 
to beneﬁ t from the changed circumstances having 
£29.1 million of cash on the balance sheet, low operational 
gearing and continuing strong cash generation. We are 
able to take advantage of any opportunities that will 
help us to achieve our strategy as and when they arise.
Board and management
There have been a number of changes to the Board. 
Russell Taylor was appointed as Acting Chief Executive 
in addition to his existing duties as Finance Director, 
following the departure of Bill Dye in January. The 
Board were pleased to conﬁ rm Russell’s appointment 
as Chief Executive in May. Neil Jones joined the Board 
as Finance Director on 4 November 2008. Neil was 
previously the Finance Director at Tarsus Group plc, a UK 
listed international exhibition company. He brings to the 
Board experience of making acquisitions in new emerging 
market territories and extensive knowledge of the 
exhibition industry outside Russia and the CIS.
Sir Jeremy Hanley stepped down from the Board at the 
AGM in March after having served as a non-executive 
Director for nine years from the ﬂ otation of the Group 
as a listed company. The Board is deeply grateful for his 
wise counsel and commitment during the years of the 
development of ITE. Neil England was appointed 
a non-executive Director in March. Neil has ﬁ rst-hand 
experience of managing businesses in Russia and the 
CIS and brings valuable perspectives to bear on our 
current business. Michael Hartley has been appointed the 
Senior Independent Director and has replaced Sir Jeremy 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Malcolm Wall has 
become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Dividend
The Board is recommending to shareholders a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 3.7p per share (2007: 3.2p), making a total 
dividend for the year of 5.3p per share (2007: 4.5p). 
The dividend for the year represents an increase of 18% 
over last year’s dividend, reﬂ ecting both the strong cash 
position of the Group and the Board’s conﬁ dence in its 
positioning and future.
Outlook
ITE’s current bookings indicate that like-for-like volume 
sales will show little or no growth in 2009, but overall 
volumes will be improved by non-annual events and the 
acquisitions made in this year. Revenue growth is expected 
to be positive reﬂ ecting pricing policy, mix and the 
beneﬁ cial eﬀ ect of exchange rates on reported revenues. 
At 28 November 2008 like-for-like bookings are for 
volume sales slightly down on last year but for revenue 
growth in excess of 10% over last year. Advance bookings 
already made for this ﬁ nancial year are £75 million 
(2007: £61 million at the same date). 
The global economy is experiencing uncertain and 
diﬃ  cult times and we continue to monitor local market 
conditions closely. Currently the principal economies 
in which ITE operates in Russia and Central Asia are still 
expected to grow, albeit at lower levels than previously 
forecast. Our strong exhibition brands enjoy leading 
positions in their markets and access a broad customer 
base across international and local markets. Accordingly 
we expect our exhibitions will prove to be resilient in 
this testing environment. The Board remains conﬁ dent 
that ITE with its advance bookings, strong cash ﬂ ow, 
leading exhibition brands and experienced management 
team is well positioned for the future.

Business review
Chief Executive’s statement
Results for 2008 ﬁ nancial year
Revenue for the year was £110.1 million, an increase 
of 11% over last year (2007: £99.1 million) and an 
improvement in like-for-like revenues of 13%. Growth
in revenue was largely driven by yield improvement with 
more sales in higher priced products, a reduction in 
marginal business activity, price increases and favourable 
currency movements all contributing to the improvement. 
The gross margin has remained at 50% reﬂ ecting the 
Group’s biennial pattern of events. 
Headline pre-tax proﬁ t of £37.1 million was an absolute 
improvement on last year’s result of £35.3 million, and was 
underpinned by a 16% improvement in like-for-like ﬁ gures. 
This result was achieved after making a £3.3 million charge 
against derivative currency hedges which oﬀ set much 
of the beneﬁ cial eﬀ ect of exchange rate movement on the 
Group’s reported revenues for the year. The like-for-like 
increase in headline proﬁ ts of circa £5.0 million was largely 
driven by growth in higher margin products. 
The business activity has again provided strong cash ﬂ ow 
in the year . Headline proﬁ t before tax of £37.1 million 
has translated to an operational cash ﬂ ow ﬁ gure of 
£52.9 million. The Group applied £13.5 million of cash 
to the acquisition of businesses and £15.9 million to share 
buy backs (including ESOT purchases) over the course of 
the year . Net cash balances of £26.7 million at the beginning 
of the year rose to £29.1 million at 30 September 2008.
This strong set of ﬁ nancial results for the year was 
achieved despite the early impact of the global ﬁ nancial 
downturn aﬀ ecting some of our markets and serves to 
demonstrate the resilience of strong market positions 
in economies showing good domestic growth.
Trading and operating performance in 2008
ITE’s revenue growth has again been strong in its major 
sectors especially construction, oil and gas and travel. 
Across its principal sectors ITE experienced resilience in 
its major international brands and was active in thinning 
out low margin activity in its portfolio. 
There were ﬁ ve new launches in the construction sector 
and like-for-like revenue growth from this sector was 17% 
from a 4% volume growth. In the Oil and Gas sector there 
were two new launches in Turkmenistan and a highly 
successful sales performance on World Petroleum Congress 
2008. The cancellation of an event in Algeria improved 
proﬁ ts but dampened revenue and yield growth. Like-for-
like revenue growth in the oil and gas sector was 4% from 
a marginally smaller volume base. In the Travel and Leisure 
sector there was one new launch in Kazakhstan and an 
11% revenue growth earned from similar sales volumes.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
In the 2008 ﬁ nancial year the Group ran 159 exhibitions 
(2007: 148) including 15 new launches (2007: 17). 
The details of our exhibitions and conferences business 
(excluding publishing) are:

The Group’s like-for-like volume sales for the year were 
aﬀ ected by the cancellation of some unproﬁ table events 
(circa 7,000 m
2
) and were marginally less than last year. 
However, a combination of sales mix, price increases 
and favourable currency movements yielded a net 13% 
increase in like-for-like revenues. Approximately half 
of the improvement in revenues arose from beneﬁ cial 
currency movements.
Russia
Russia has enjoyed real growth in Gross Domestic Product 
of 7-8% for the last two years, and trading conditions in the 
year to 30 September 2008 were not signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ected 
by the world’s ﬁ nancial crisis or by the withdrawal of 
foreign investment from Russia. Like-for-like revenue 
growth from exhibitions and events in Russia was 12% 
from total space sold of 247,000m
2
 (2007: 250,000m
2
).
 
International quality venue space in Moscow is now 
circa 300,000m
2
, which is suﬃ  cient for the current size 
of the Moscow exhibition business though the ﬁ xture list 
remains congested at peak times. The biggest inﬂ uence 
on the Moscow result is always the size and pricing of 
the construction event, MosBuild. Although volume 
growth this year suﬀ ered from a date clash with another 
international event which reduced overall growth to 
3%, pricing, discount control and beneﬁ cial currency 
movement supported good revenue improvement. 
For other events, trading remained strong with good 
demand from the international customers of our major 
events being a recurring feature. In St Petersburg there 
has been no marked change in the trading environment 
and the exhibition industry still awaits a deﬁ nitive 
statement on future exhibition venues. ITE has this year 
established a third Russian oﬃ  ce through the acquisition 
of Siberian Fairs in Novosibirsk which since its acquisition 
has traded in line with management’s expectations. There 
is good interest from our international exhibitor base in 
the Novosibirsk exhibitions, but development of a new 
venue is key to the future growth of the business. There 
are presently two potential venue projects in varying 
stages of advancement, and planned for 2010.
Central Asia & Caucasus
Overall, revenues increased by 22% in Central Asia & 
Caucasus from a volume sales increase of 6%. The Group’s 
most notable impact from the current ﬁ nancial crisis was 
the downturn in the Kazakhstan property market, which in 
turn led to the reduction in size of the Autumn construction 
event, KazBuild. The Kazakhstan economy has a relatively 
high exposure to foreign debt and bank lending had 
supported a property and construction boom over recent 
years, which was an early victim of the international 
liquidity crisis. 
In Azerbaijan the economy is still enjoying growth in Gross 
Domestic Product of more than 13% and with a relatively 
low exposure to foreign debt there has been no marked 
change in market conditions since last year. ITE’s business 
performance was strong with revenues from the Baku 
oﬃ  ce increasing by over 20% year-on-year. Construction 
has now started on a new 28,000m
2
 venue in Baku and ITE 
are in advanced discussions to be an anchor tenant for the 
new venue. Our other Central Asian market is Uzbekistan 
where again exposure to foreign debt as a proportion of 
Gross Domestic Product has been relatively low and real 
economic growth remains forecast to be circa 7% for next 
year. The recently constructed new pavilion at the venue 
has supported good revenue growth this year to £2.8m, 
a 50% increase in like-for-like revenues. Key performance indicators:

ﬁ nancial year, are set out below:

Eastern & Southern Europe
In Eastern & Southern Europe like-for-like volume sales 
growth was 2% yielding revenue growth of 12%. Our two 
main markets are in Ukraine and Turkey. Both countries are 
exposed to high levels of foreign debt relative to the size of 
their economy and both have had political uncertainty in the 
year . Encouragingly in both Turkey and Ukraine our oﬃ  ces 
have enjoyed good demand for their exhibition products 
over the last twelve months. The new ﬁ nancial year has 
started well in both countries with good bookings to date 
but volatility in their domestic currencies is expected to 
make domestic sales more challenging in the future. 
 
UK & Western Europe
Moda’ s performance in the last ﬁ nancial year has been 
excellent, maintaining a good ﬁ nancial result in diﬃ  cult 
market conditions. In the UK our fashion business is aﬀ ected 
by the slowdown in the UK retail market, but the ability to 
oﬀ er a complete marketing solution across publishing and 
exhibitions brings added value to our customers. 
Strategy
ITE’s primary business objectives remain:
The creation of sustainable growth in headline earnings  >
per share; and
The creation and maintenance of sustainable market  >
leadership in its markets.
ITE’s strategy for achieving its objective is based on 
enhancing its existing business strengths and gaining 
incremental synergy through expansion. ITE aims to 
extend its existing business model in its current markets 
by diversifying its exhibition portfolio, but also to 
‘leverage’ its strengths both through expansion of its 
international sales network and of its product base to 
other similar markets.
The business strengths which ITE aims to build upon are:
International sales network
ITE has oﬃ  ces making sales in territories where historic 
and political trading relationships between exporters and 
the Russian and CIS economies have long existed. ITE’s 
oﬃ  ces in Turkey and Western Europe account for circa 
50% of its sales into its core Russian and CIS exhibition 
products. There are also strong trading links between the 
Russian and CIS states which ITE is able to access through 
its local oﬃ  ce infrastructure.
ITE’s revenues from existing (‘like-for-like’) products  >
has increased by 13% in the year.
The annually recurring base metres of our exhibition  >
business as at 1 October 2007 was 430,000m

Acquisitions and growth have increased this to

exhibition in St Petersburg, Interstroyexpo, 
a construction event in St Petersburg, Siberian Fairs

Siberia and Bubble, a childrenswear event in London.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
ITE has this year expanded its international sales network 
to reﬂ ect new trading relationships and to improve its 
performance in countries where in the past agents have 
been used to make its sales. ITE’s Beijing oﬃ  ce is a growing 
source of sales, accounting for 3% of sales into the core 
markets this year. Nascent sales oﬃ  ces have been opened 
recently in Spain, Malaysia and Dubai. These new sales 
oﬃ  ces will be more eﬀ ective than the existing agency 
structure in delivering sales across the complete range 
of ITE’s products and in focusing on the right quality of 
exhibitors and content for our events.
Market leading events
ITE already has market leading exhibitions and conferences 
in its portfolio of events. However, there are industry 
sectors where ITE does not yet have a strong enough 
product in the market place. ITE is well positioned to build 
or acquire strong events in new sectors by using its local 
sales force, its international sales network and its good 
venue relationships. This year ITE acquired Sﬁ tex, a 
3,000m
2
 security event in St Petersburg; with the support 
of ITE’s existing international sales teams it produced 
growth of over 50% in its ﬁ rst year of ownership. In April, 
ITE announced the acquisition of Interstroyexpo, the 
leading St Petersburg construction event. Again the Group 
is able to bring its international sales forces to focus on 
the new event, which will next take place in April 2009.
Local presence
ITE has well established oﬃ  ces in the markets where 
it holds its exhibitions. The knowledge, experience and 
contacts of the staﬀ  built up over the last 15 years enables 
ITE’s to sell to domestic exhibitors, to manage the 
professional staging of the event and to deliver reliably 
a targeted visitor audience to the exhibition.
In April ITE acquired a new exhibition portfolio in Novosibirsk, 
Eastern Russia. Siberian Fairs runs 30 exhibitions across 
all industry sectors and has market leading exhibitions in 
Novosibirsk. This extension of ITE’s oﬃ  ce infrastructure 
will provide a platform for future growth of the exhibition 
portfolio in Novosibirsk.
Venue relationships
ITE’s venue relationships are key to its business model, 
providing continuity, theme protection and growth for our 
key events.
ITE has continued to extend its working relationships 
with its principal venues in the year. In Kazakhstan ITE 
has reached agreement with Atakent to support the 
construction of a new pavilion that will double the 
currently available international quality exhibition space
to circa 40,000m
2
. Construction is expected to be 
completed by the end of 2010. ITE is also in discussions 
to support the development of a 28,000m
2
 venue 
in Baku, Azerbaijan which is due to complete by 2010. 
In Novosibirsk ITE is in discussion with potential developers 
of new exhibition space in the city.

By gross proﬁ t categorised by market and by sector
ITE is an organiser of exhibitions and conferences 
specialising in emerging and developing markets. ITE 
organises high-quality events of an international standard 
throughout the 15 countries in which it operates. The 
business is managed in ﬁ ve main geographic sectors: 
Russia, Central Asia & Caucasus, Eastern & Southern 
Europe, UK & Western Europe and Rest of World (see 
Divisional review on pages 22 to 25 and the Highlights 
section on pages 2 and 3). 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE hires venues at which it 
stages its events and markets the events to both exhibitors 
and visitors. Exhibitions and conferences provide an 
opportunity for participants from national and international 
companies to meet, network and transact business. 
The exhibition media is the best media for suppliers to 
display and demonstrate their products to potential buyers 
and this is particularly true in emerging and developing 
markets. 
ITE’s strength derives from its focus on organising B2B 
exhibitions and conferences, the development of strong 
brands in key industry sectors and the regional expertise 
in the markets in which it operates. ITE has been operating 
in these markets for over 15 years and its experience and 
local knowledge are unique.
ITE’s principal business of organising B2B trade exhibitions 
accounts for over 90% of the Group’s revenues. Consumer 
exhibitions account for 3% of ITE’s revenue, conferences 
circa 2% and other activities relating to the core exhibition 
business (mostly publishing) account for 2% of revenue. 
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. The brands have been 
established through a sustained record of presenting high 
quality events which meet customer expectations. ITE 
events serve key industries including construction & 
interiors, oil & gas, food & drink, travel & leisure, motor & 
transport, fashion, medical & healthcare and IT & telecoms. 
ITE has an extensive oﬃ  ce network, covering both the 
territories where our events are held and international
sales oﬃ  ces in other countries. ITE is able to operate at 
national level where local staﬀ  are close to local industry 
trends and at an international level where our sales teams 
are in regular communication with key industry suppliers 
in our sectors. The Group has 22 oﬃ  ces across the world, 
each of them employing local staﬀ . New international sales 
oﬃ  ces were opened in Spain, Malaysia and the UAE at the 
end of the year to help drive increased sales from these 
markets across our portfolio of shows. Further oﬃ  ces are 
planned during 2009.

The oﬃ  ces of the Group co-operate in a unique way. Each

oﬃ  ces. This holistic approach has been carefully cultivated 
through the years and enables ITE’s business to follow 
long-established trading patterns. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

 Business to 
business
B2B or ‘trade’ 
exhibitions and 
conferences are 
the mainstay of 
our business.
Our customers – exhibitors, visitors, 
delegates, sponsors and speakers – 
are looking for opportunities to meet 
face-to-face to discuss, promote and 
conduct business. ITE events unite buyers 
with suppliers in exhibition pavilions, 
conference halls, meeting rooms and 
informally at networking events. 
Our success continues because 
people want to do face-to-face business 
with people.
 Established 
brands
A key strength 
behind our 
business is the 
ability to produce 
successful events 
year after year.
Over many years, we have developed 
events that consistently deliver results 
for our customers. With careful 
management and eﬀ ective promotion, 
our brands have become trusted, respected 
and recognised as valuable marketplaces 
for business. The principles that shape 
our market leading events can often be 
replicated in several regions, allowing us 
to oﬀ er business opportunities in a range 
of emerging markets.
Our business is strengthened by the 
reputation of our established brands.
 Strong 
network
Our global 
network provides 
an unparalleled 
level of support 
for our events.
We believe that the best way to organise 
successful international events in a large 
number of countries is through locally 
based organisers that are supported by a 
network of sales oﬃ  ces and agents around 
the world. A collective spirit combined 
with communication and co-operation 
cements the links throughout the group 
and the network is the result of a long-
term commitment that cannot be easily 
replicated. 
Local knowledge and global expertise 
produces eﬀ ective international events. 22

Following the acquisition this year of Siberian Fairs in 
Novosibirsk, Siberia ITE now has over 400 staﬀ  based in 
the three largest cities in Russia. The sales and revenue 
ﬁ gures above include the activity for Siberian Fairs since 
its acquisition in April this year and the 180 employees 
of the business explain the increase in ITE’s staﬀ  numbers 
in Russia. Overall the Russian business has seen steady 
demand for its products during the year, although events 
taking place in the ﬁ nal quarter of the year showed little 
volume growth, probably reﬂ ecting the early eﬀ ects of 
tighter ﬁ nancial markets in Russia. Overall like-for-like 
volume sales in Russia were 2% less than last year, but 
like-for-like revenues improved by 12%.
The exhibition market in Moscow has expanded 
considerably over recent years alongside the expansion 
in venue facilities. This year the Group sold 208,000m
2
 
of net exhibition space in the year which was 1% less than 
last year on a like-for-like basis. ITE’s decision to cancel 
its participation in some marginal activity accounts for 
this small drop in volume sales. Most of the main events 
in Moscow take place in the spring season, and in March 
the Moscow International Travel and Tourism exhibition 
delivered a strong sales performance with an increase 
in space sold of 11% to 20,800m
2
. The most important 
event in ITE’s portfolio is the Moscow construction event, 
held in the ﬁ rst week of April across the two main 
Moscow venues. The Mosbuild sectors based in Expocentr 
are wallbound and volume sales this year were 40,600m
2
 
(2007: 39,740m
2
). MosBuild+ comprises the sectors based 
at the Crocus venue and this year achieved sales of 
46,500m
2
. This represents an increase of 4% over the 
prior year – achieved despite the impact of a competitive 
date clash. Two events re-located this year to the Expocentr 
venue and both were able to show substantial growth over 
previous versions. The Moscow International Protection 
and Security event achieved a 13% increase in space sales 
to 7,600m
2
, and TransRussia, the international transport 
and logistics event, achieved a growth of over 30% in space 
sales to 8,200m
2
. This latter event is now established as 
a market leader in the sector and in its new venue has the 
potential to develop further. Expo-Electronica, the electrical 
components event takes place in April and performed 
well in improving its sales from 8,900m
2
 to 9,200m
2
. 
The Moscow International Motor Show (17,100m
2
) and 
World Food Moscow (24,100m
2
) both take place in the 
ﬁ nal quarter of the year and both were similar in size to 
last year’s events. 
In St Petersburg the business enjoyed steady demand for 
its products and its volume sales ﬁ gures were slightly 
below last year’s ﬁ gures. It was however a progressive 
year in developing the portfolio of events starting with the 
acquisition of the local security event Sﬁ tex, announced in 
January. The ﬁ rst event under ITE’s ownership took place 
in October 2008, and grew from 3,000m
2
 to 5,000m

of 75% of Interstroyexpo, the largest construction event in 
St Petersburg. This event will next take place in April 2009 
and the combined strength of ITE’s construction oﬀ ering 
will help the Group to maximise growth opportunities for 
both events. ITE’s own construction event, BalticBuild, was 
held in September and produced a consistent sales 
performance delivering sales of 9,600m
2
.
ITE became the largest exhibition organiser in Novosibirsk 
following the acquisition of Siberian Fairs LLC in April this 
year. This business organises exhibitions in Construction, 
Furniture & Interiors, Motor, Food Products & Packaging 
and Agriculture. Since April it has staged 15 events which 
have performed in line with expectations. There are plans 
to develop a modern purpose built exhibition venue which 
will facilitate growth for Siberian Fairs’ largest events. 
In Central Asia & Caucasus this year ITE’s businesses sold 
92,300m
2
 representing growth of 6% over last year. 
Revenues of £22 million earned from the region represented 
a 22% like-for-like improvement over last year and again 
reﬂ ected changes in pricing and in exchange rates, 
each making a broadly equal contribution to the yield 
improvement.

Kazakhstan
ITE’s business in Kazakhstan sold 61,200m
2
 in the year, 
a 2% decrease from last year. This does not properly reﬂ ect 
the trading conditions over the year and is disproportionally 
inﬂ uenced by the KazBuild construction event held in 
September, which at 9,200m
2
 was 30% smaller than last 
year. Tightening credit conditions together with an inﬂ ated 
property market combined to create falling property values 
and an oversupply of residential property development. 
The change in market sentiment was quick as ITE had 
enjoyed good growth of 10%+ in the Spring version of the 
same event. The other construction events in Astana and 
Atyrau performed in line with the prior year and a new 
regional event, KaragandaBuild, was launched and held 
twice in the year.
The other main event in Kazakhstan is the Kazakhstan 
International Oil & Gas Exhibition which successfully grew 
its space sales by 16% to 11,200m
2
, and delivered a similar 
increase in the size of its conference. The Oil and Gas 
events in Aktau and Atyrau also contributed strong 
performances. Other events continued to perform well; 
the food exhibition grew by 15% to 4,200m
2
 and the travel 
event grew by 9% to 3,200m
2
.
ITE continues to work closely with Atakent, the principal 
venue in Almaty and is now supporting the construction 
of a new 30,000m
2
 pavilion which will double the 
international quality exhibition space available in Almaty 
to 40,000m
2
 (after de-commission some older pavilions). 
This new venue facility will support the further 
development of ITE’s exhibition business in Kazakhstan.
Azerbaijan
The exhibition industry has continued to show growth 
and the Group sold 18,500m
2
 of space in the year 
representing like-for-like volume growth of 20% over last 
year. The construction event, BakuBuild, held in October 
2007 achieved a growth in space sales of 5% and the 
Autoshow held in March delivered a 4% growth over last 
year. The Caspian Oil & Gas Exhibition and Conference 
took place in June and performed strongly across both the 
conference and the exhibition. The largest events in oil & 
gas and in construction are currently space constrained 
and will both beneﬁ t from the development of a new 
28,000m
2
 venue due for completion in 2010. ITE, with
its established exhibition brands is in a good position to 
participate in the future growth in the Azerbaijan exhibition 
industry that the new venue will help to promote.
Uzbekistan
ITE’s business in Uzbekistan enjoyed strong trading 
conditions and in selling 12,500m
2
 of exhibition space in 
the year realised an improvement of 31% in volume sales 
over last year. This year saw the return of the textile event, 
CAITME, and there were strong sales performances from 
World Food Uzbekistan, UzBuild, Tashkent International 
Healthcare exhibition and the Oil & Gas exhibition-
conference, OGU. 24

Public Health, ITE’s strongest healthcare event, delivered

yield. The main recurring events are in the optical and 
stationery sectors, and both performed in line with the

made a valuable contribution to the Group’s overall sales 
in Russia and the CIS.
The contribution from ITF , the Group’s 50% associate was 
£0.1 million lower than last year’s result of £0.2 million.

. This was a good sales result in a challenging 
environment and with careful cost management, the 
ﬁ nancial results of the business were impressive. The 
related publishing business suﬀ ered a decline in revenue 
which impacted on its net operating margin. However the 
fashion magazines are important enabling the Group to 
oﬀ er a complete marketing solution to the industry.
At the end of the year Moda announced the acquisition of 
‘Bubble’, a Childrenswear event held twice a year in London. 
This is a small event that has potential to grow and will 
beneﬁ t from the support of the Childrenswear Buyer 
magazine, part of ITE’s portfolio of fashion publications. 
The Group has been the sales agent and consultant on 
the 19th World Petroleum Congress for the last three years. 
The 2008 event was held in Madrid in June this year 
and was a huge success with 15,800m
2
 of space sold 
at the exhibition and over 4,100 delegates attending the 
conference. This event showcased ITE’s strengths as an 
organiser of large scale congresses and further developed 
its reputation in the oil and gas industry.
ITE has recently opened an outbound sales oﬃ  ce in 
Valencia to maximise its sales from the Spanish market.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Tax charge
The tax charge of £11.1 million represents 32% of proﬁ t 
before tax. This eﬀ ective rate is in line with the prior year, 
reﬂ ecting the withholding tax burden on repatriating cash 
from our Russian businesses in the year. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased to 9.4p (2007: 9.1p). 
Fully diluted earnings per share increased to 9.3p from 
9.0p in the prior year.
The Group achieved headline diluted earnings per share of 
10.1p per share (2007: 9.4p). Headline diluted earnings per 
share is based upon proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial year attributable 
to equity holders of the parent, before amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and any proﬁ ts or losses on 
disposal of Group undertakings.
Dividends
The Group has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend of 3.7p 
for 2008, to bring the total dividend for the year to 5.3p 
(2007: 4.5p).
Return to shareholders
ITE is committed to maximising shareholder return and is 
a leading performer in its sector. ITE’s progressive dividend 
policy has resulted in total dividends in 2008 of 5.3 pence 
per share, up 18% over 2007 (4.5p). Since 2004 the 
dividend has increased on a compound basis by 25% per 
year. Set out below is a graph showing total cash returned 
to shareholders (including the share buybacks in August 
2005 and in the years ended 30 September 2007 and 
2008) against the post tax proﬁ ts earned by ITE over the 
last ﬁ ve years.
Revenue and gross proﬁ t 
Turnover for the year was £110.1 million (2007: £99.1 
million). On a like-for-like basis this is a 13% improvement 
over last year’s comparable turnover. 
The Group achieved a gross margin of 50% (2007: 50%). 
The current year included the biennial Ankomak event 
in Turkey which has space sales of over 45,000m
2
 but is 
a low margin event, and together with the trading result 
from Siberian Fairs since its acquisition, has had the eﬀ ect 
of dampening margin growth this year.
Administrative expenses across the Group increased
to £18.8 million, up from £17.2 million in the previous 
year. Administrative expenses include an amortisation 
charge of £2.6 million (2007: £1.6 million) reﬂ ecting the 
acquisitions made in the year and a charge for share-
based payments of £0.9 million (2007: £1.6 million). 
Overall, Group administrative expense represented 17% 
of revenue (2007: 17%), resulting in net operating margins 
of 33% (2007: 33%) for the year. 
Operating proﬁ t was £36.5 million against a prior year 
proﬁ t of £33.1 million.
Headline pre-tax proﬁ t this year was £37.1 million 
(2007: £35.3 million); on a like-for-like basis this is a 16% 
increase over the previous year.
Other operating income
Other operating income represents rental income earned 
from subletting surplus oﬃ  ce space, principally at ITE’s 
London oﬃ  ces.
Finance income 
Finance income for the year was £1.9 million (2007: 
£1.8 million). Interest from bank deposits increased to 
£1.9 million in the year (2007: £1.8 million) as the Group 
held higher average cash balances throughout the year of 
£36.5 million (2007: £29.9 million). The average interest 
rate for the Group was marginally higher than the prior year .
Finance costs
Finance costs of £3.9 million (2007: £1.1 million) represent 
the interest cost of the Group’s borrowings in Euro and 
US Dollar, bank charges and the net foreign exchange costs 
of the Group’s derivative instruments of £3.3 million 
(2007: £0.4 million). The Group enters into currency 
borrowing arrangements as part of its currency hedging 
activity and at 30 September 2008 the Group had 
borrowings of 35.9 million, and US$3.3 million.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Net assets decreased by £1.3 million to £44.1 million. The 
main changes are in goodwill and intangibles (an increase 
of £18.4 million) and net cash (increase of £2.5 million), 
oﬀ set by a decrease in venue advances (£1.2 million), an 
increase in deferred tax (£2.0 million) and an increase in 
deferred income (£18.0 million). 
Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure on plant and equipment for 
the year was £1.1 million (2007: £0.8 million) and included 
exhibition equipment, computer equipment and associated 
software. 
Venue arrangements
The Group has long term arrangements with its principal 
venues in our main markets setting out ITE’s rights over 
future venue use and pricing.
Expocentr is ITE’s principal venue in Moscow and hosts 
some of its largest exhibitions including MosBuild, Moscow 
International Oil & Gas exhibition, Moscow International 
Travel & Tourism, World Food Moscow, TransRussia and 
Moscow International Protection & Security exhibition. 
ITE has an agreement with Expocentr which secures the 
Group’s rights to conduct its exhibitions until 2010.
Crocus Exhibition Centre is located on the outskirts of 
Moscow city centre and hosts MosBuild+, Expoelectronica, 
Moscow International Motor Show and the Moscow 
International Boat Show. ITE has an agreement with Crocus

until 2015.
Lenexpo is located in St Petersburg and hosts the newly 
acquired Interstroyexpo and Baltic Building Week events. 
ITE has an agreement with Lenexpo, providing rights to 
hold its exhibitions and agreed rates to 2011.

Kazakhstan and hosts the Kazakhstan International Oil & 
Gas events and KazBuild exhibitions. ITE’s agreement with 
Atakent conﬁ rms its rights to hold its exhibitions on agreed 
rates until 2017.
The Group funds the development of venues and facilities 
where improved facilities will enhance the prospects and 
proﬁ tability of its organising business. The funding can take 
the form of a prepayment of future venue fees (‘advance 
payment’), or a loan which can be repaid by cash or by 
oﬀ set against future venue fees (‘venue loan’). Generally 
the funding brings rights over future venue use and 
advantageous pricing arrangements through long term 
agreements. Venue loans and advance payments are 
included in the Balance Sheet under non-current and 
current assets.
Cash ﬂ ow
Cash generated from operations in the year was £52.9 
million (2007: £41.5 million). The principal applications 
of cash were £15.9 million on purchasing shares on the 
open market for the Employees Share Option Trust (“ESOT”) 
and treasury shares that were cancelled in the year (2007:

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Since the year end the Group has entered into forward 
contracts to sell Euros for Sterling between April 2009 and 
September 2009. The value of the contract is 326.8 million 
at an average rate of 31.274:£1. These instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments.
Over the year , the Group has entered into currency borrowing 
arrangements to minimise its exposure to foreign exchange 
risk on trade receivables. At 30 September 2008 the Group 
had borrowings of 35.9 million, and US$3.3 million. The cash 
balance of £29.1 million at 30 September 2008 is net of 
these borrowings.
The Group ﬁ nances its operations through cash holdings. 
The objective of the Group is to maximise investment 
income and minimise interest costs, bearing in mind its 
liquidity requirements. 
For short-term debt, such as overdraft facilities or debt 
with a term of less than six months, ﬁ xed or ﬂ oating rates 
of interest are used. For debt with a term of greater than 
six months, it is policy that at least 75% must have ﬁ xed 
rates of interest so as to minimise the Group’s exposure 
to interest rate movements. 
It is Group policy that its cash balances are not invested
in instruments that would put the capital value at risk. 
All invested funds have a determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity of funding for 
operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities 
as appropriate. The key requirement for the business is 
to maintain ﬂ exibility to allow the Group to take advantage 
of opportunities that could arise over the short term. 
The needs of the business are determined on a rolling cash 
ﬂ ow forecast basis, covering weekly, monthly and twelve 
monthly requirements. Short-term ﬂ exibility is maintained 
by holding cash in current accounts and high liquidity 
money market funds. The Group has overdraft facilities 
in place both to permit currency borrowing as part of its 
foreign exchange management and to allow ﬂ exibility in 
where it holds its cash balances.
Recent events in the world ﬁ nancial markets have 
highlighted the risks associated with holding deposits 
in foreign domiciled banks. The territories in which ITE 
operates do not all have internationally recognised banks 
and the Group has relationships with a number of domestic 
banks. The Group seeks to use the territory’s leading bank 
and to minimise the level of cash held in such banks.
Going concern
After considering the current ﬁ nancial projections for 
the Group, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company has adequate resources to continue 
its operations for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.

Capital
During the year, the Company has purchased 5,445,585 
shares which were held in Treasury and then cancelled. 
The Company has also issued 3,039,493 ordinary shares
of 1p in the year. Of the total new issues, 3,029,146 were 
pursuant to the exercise of options and yielded aggregate 
consideration of £1.8 million. The remaining shares were 
issued as part of Directors’ remuneration.
The ESOT held 6,967,783 (2.8%) of the Company’s issued 
share capital at the year-end (2007: 1,854,875; 0.7%).
Post balance sheet events
There have been no signiﬁ cant post balance sheet events. 
Treasury
During the year, the Group experienced net foreign 
exchange losses of £3.1 million (2007: £12,000 loss). 
The exchange rate for the Euro at 30 September 2008 was 
31.26:£1 (30 September 2007: 31.43:£1); the exchange 
rate for the US Dollar at 30 September 2008 was $1.82:£1 
(30 September 2007: $2.02:£1).
 
During the year, 71% of the Group’s sales were priced in 
Euros and 11% in US Dollars, the balance being in local 
currency. Overall 51% of the Group’s cash receipts for the 
period were collected in “hard” currency (Sterling, Dollars 
or Euros) and 49% was collected in various local currencies.
The Group uses derivative instruments and currency 
borrowings to protect itself against the eﬀ ect of currency 
ﬂ uctuations on a proportion of its sales and its balance 
sheet. The Group’s policy on derivative instruments is that:
it will hedge no more than 75% of the value of anticipated  >
hard currency sales; and
it will only enter into derivative transactions up to  >
36 months ahead.
At 30 September 2008, the Group had options to sell 
311.0 million spread over the six months to 31 March 
2009, against which it held a mark to market provision 
of £1.0 million.  Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Risks & uncertainties
The Group identiﬁ es and monitors the key risks and uncertainties aﬀ ecting the Group and runs the business in a way that 
minimises the impact of such risks where possible.
The Group’s business is principally carried 
out in Russia and the CIS. Changes in law 
or the regulatory environment could have 
an eﬀ ect on some or all of the exhibitions 
of the Group. 
Reduced demand for exhibition space 
would reduce the proﬁ ts of exhibitions. 
The Group has key commercial 
relationships with venues which secure 
the Group’s rights to run its exhibitions in 
the future.
Damage to or unavailability of a particular 
venue could impact the Group’s short-term 
trading position. 
Competition has existed in ITE’s markets 
for some years. ITE faces competitive 
pressures on a market-by-market basis. 
ITE’ s employees have long-standing 
relationships with customers and a unique 
knowledge of the exhibitions business. 
Loss of key staﬀ  could impact the short-
term prospects of a speciﬁ c event or sector .
The Group is exposed to movements in 
foreign exchange rates against Sterling 
for both trading transactions and for the 
translation of overseas operations. The 
principal exposure is to the Euro exchange 
rate, which form the basis of invoicing.

Potential impact Operational risks Mitigation
ITE has reduced its risk by establishing 
its business as independent Russian 
and CIS companies fully contributing to 
the local economy, and the diversity of 
businesses across sectors and geography 
provides protection for the longer-term 
prospects of the Group.
ITE operates across a wide range of 
sectors and countries to minimise the 
exposure to any single market, and 
is constantly looking at opportunities
to diversify further.
 
These key relationships are regularly 
reviewed and the Group seeks to maintain 
its exhibition rights for at least three years 
forward for signiﬁ cant exhibitions.
The Group carries business interruption 
insurance which protects proﬁ ts against 
such an event in the short term.
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has 
a strong position as an international 
organiser, achieved through eﬀ ective use 
of its international sales network and its 
established brands for major events. 
A single exhibition or sector in a market 
could have its prospects aﬀ ected by 
a strong competitor launch; however, the 
breadth of ITE’s portfolio of events, with 
its geographic and sector diversity, reduce 
the risk of a competitive threat to the 
overall business of the Group.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in its staﬀ  
by ensuring remuneration is competitive 
and through a wide distribution of the 
Group’s long-term incentive plans. ITE has 
a good record of retaining its key staﬀ .
The Group seeks to minimise exposure by:
Limiting balances in ‘soft’ currency  >
deposits.
Securing forward contracts against its  >

Corporate and social responsibility
Overview
ITE believes that corporate and social responsibility is 
an important part of the Group’s culture and, by adopting 
good practice in these areas, it will have a positive 
impact on proﬁ ts and increasing the long-term value 
for shareholders. The Board gives due consideration to 
risks arising from social, environmental and ethical issues 
as part of its ongoing risk review process.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware of both the beneﬁ ts 
to its business of engaging with its various constituencies 
in a socially-responsible manner and the risks of failing to 
do so. As an operator of internationally-focused businesses 
in emerging markets, the Company ensures that it is 
culturally sensitive in its dealings with the local community 
and that its employment and development policies are 
non-discriminatory and encourage the employment of 
local nationals at all levels in the Company. Employees are 
selected and promoted on the basis of merit and ability, 
regardless of age, gender , race, religion, sexual orientation 
or disability.
Employees are encouraged to participate in and support 
their respective communities. The Company has a policy 
of encouraging employees, especially those from the 
locations in emerging markets, to move around the oﬃ  ces 
of the Group, thus providing development opportunities 
for all staﬀ . In addition, employees are assisted in their 
career development through an annual appraisal scheme. 
All staﬀ  are eligible for issues of share options or awards 
under the Employee’s Performance Share Plan as the Board 
feels that it is important for them to take an active part in 
the success of the Company and to share in the value they 
help to create.
We recognise the need to provide a safe working 
environment for employees and exhibitors and visitors 
at our events. Each oﬃ  ce is responsible for ensuring that 
their business operates in compliance with Group policies 
and the relevant local health and safety legislation. 
Ethics
The Company actively promotes integrity in its dealings 
with its employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers 
and with the authorities of the countries in which it 
operates and recognises that a reputation is a valuable 
and fragile asset gained over a substantial period. The 
leadership position of its exhibitions and the continued 
growth of its core shows is evidence of the success 
of its practices.
The Company promotes high ethical standards in carrying 
out its business activities and has clear guidelines for 
dealing with gifts, hospitality, corruption, fraud and the 
use of inside information. All ITE staﬀ  must comply with 
the laws and regulations of the country in which they 
operate. It is the responsibility of all staﬀ  to ensure that 
they are fully aware of all relevant laws and regulations.
The Group is a member of UFI (worldwide) and the AEO 
(UK) and, through this, the attendance ﬁ gures at our key 
exhibitions are audited by independent services. This helps 
to provide assurance to our exhibitors and visitors as to 
the standard of our exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide a high-quality service for all 
its events in all its locations. The Group operates to a strict 
minimum quality level to ensure our events are provided 
to exhibitors and visitors at international standards, 
irrespective of where they are held.
The Group ensures that all advertising and public 
communications avoid untruths or overstatements. ITE 
builds a relationship with suppliers based on mutual trust 
and undertakes to pay suppliers on time and in accordance 
with agreed terms of business. All information regarding 
the relationship between the Group and a supplier must 
remain conﬁ dential. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Environment
As a media services company, the Group acknowledges 
that its business has an impact on the environment, albeit 
relatively minor , however it understands the importance 
of following good environmental practice. The Company 
is aware that this is an area of increasing concern to 
employees, shareholders and customers alike. The Company 
does not manufacture or sell any tangible products and has 
identiﬁ ed the principal areas of environmental impact as 
energy use, waste recycling, paper & printing and travel. By 
identifying environmental improvements, we expect to see 
increased eﬃ  ciencies and with that, reduced costs and the 
management of environmental issues is part of our business 
strategy to create long-term value for shareholders.
The Group encourages the recycling of waste paper  >
and oﬃ  ce waste and plans to increase the recycling rates 
and materials recycled throughout the Group.
Computers and IT equipment are recycled where possible  >
and redundant equipment is either sold to staﬀ  or given 
to charitable organisations. 
The Company has been reducing its printed materials  >
over the last few years, with a greater reliance on 
electronic media for its marketing materials. However, 
catalogues and delegate packs are still printed and the 
Group is implementing a set of operating standards to 
be followed by suppliers to look at paper sourcing and 
use of materials.
The Company encourages staﬀ  to use public transport  >
through oﬀ ering season ticket loans.
The Company is now taking advantage of recent 
e-communications legislation for communicating with 
shareholders and so will be able to reduce the volume of 
printed materials produced with the publication of our 
Annual Report and Interim Statement.
The Group’s activities in staging exhibitions and 
conferences do impact on the environment, through 
waste and natural resources usage from materials used 
in assembling exhibition stands and participating in the 
exhibition and travel to exhibitions and conferences for 
exhibitors, delegates and ITE staﬀ . Presently, practice in 
controlling waste at diﬀ erent exhibition centres varies 
widely through the diﬀ erent regions in which the Group 
operates, however the Group follows prevailing practice 
in each of its markets by observing industry and country 
legislation. 32

Right to purchase the Company’s shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 6 March 2008, the shareholders authorised the Company to make one or more market 
purchases of up to 25,131,599 of the Company’s ordinary shares at a price between 1p (exclusive of expenses) and 105%

Since that date, the Company purchased 5,445,585 of its own shares which were cancelled before 30 September 2008. 
The shares acquired in the year had a nominal value of £54,456, presenting 2.15% of the issued share capital and were 
purchased for consideration of £8.1 million. The reason for the purchase was to enhance earnings per share. The Company 
has a remaining authority to purchase a further 19,686,014 of its own shares which will expire at the next Annual General 
Meeting on 27 February 2009.
In total, the Company cancelled 5,445,585 of its ordinary shares in the year.
Donations
The Group made no charitable donations (2007: Nil) during the year. No political donations were made (2007: Nil).
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high-calibre employees focused on achieving 
excellent results. Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staﬀ  to support the business in meeting its objectives. 
This is reﬂ ected in the training initiatives in place for staﬀ , both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees 
informed on matters aﬀ ecting them and on matters aﬀ ecting the Group’s performance through regular newsletters and 
through meetings, both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged to move around the Group in order 
to experience the business environment in other oﬃ  ces. The Group actively encourages the participation of employees 
in activities of oﬃ  ces other than their own. The Group distributes long-term incentives widely to staﬀ  in all oﬃ  ces. 
At 30 September 2008 approximately 41% of staﬀ  held long-term incentives in some form. As a result, the Group’s 
employees identify strongly with ITE’s overall objectives. 
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind a number 
of factors including their suitability and ﬁ t for the role, irrespective of any disability. In the event of a member of staﬀ  
becoming disabled, every eﬀ ort would be made to ensure their continued employment and progression in the Group. 
It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion of disabled employees match that of other employees 
as far as possible. ITE Group plc

Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into 
each transaction to ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the terms of payment. 
The Company has no trade creditors. Trade creditors of the Group at 30 September 2008 were equivalent to 9 days 
(2007: 12 days) purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will see from the Notice of the Annual General Meeting, to be sent separately, that they are to consider and, 
if thought ﬁ t, to pass three resolutions that have become routine business at the Annual General Meeting of most public 
companies. The resolutions relate to:
renewal of the authority for the Directors to allot relevant securities; >
renewal of the powers of the Directors to allot equity securities as if pre-emption rights did not apply; and >
renewal of the authority for the Company to purchase certain of its own shares and to hold them as treasury shares. >
In addition, shareholders will also be asked to vote on resolutions covering:
renewal of share option schemes; >
updating the Articles of Association providing for new Directors conﬂ ict of interests provisions; and >
any necessary incidental changes to the Articles of Association. >
Auditors
The Directors will place a resolution before the Annual General Meeting to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors for the 
ensuing year and to approve their remuneration.
Each of the persons who is a Director of the Company at the date when this report was approved conﬁ rms:
so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as deﬁ ned in the Companies Act 1985)  >
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware  >
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁ rmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with s234ZA Companies Act 1985.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the Group ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Report on remuneration and the ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. The Directors are required 
by the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The Group ﬁ nancial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS ﬁ nancial statements present fairly for each ﬁ nancial year the 
Company’s ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. This requires the faithful representation of the 
eﬀ ects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁ nitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation 
and presentation of ﬁ nancial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance 
with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; >
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and  >
understandable information; and 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c requirements in IFRSs are insuﬃ  cient to enable users  >
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁ nancial position and 
ﬁ nancial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of aﬀ airs of the Company. In preparing 
these ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; >
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; >
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed  >
and explained in the ﬁ nancial statements; and
prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company  >
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent company ﬁ nancial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements 
may diﬀ er from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We conﬁ rm to the best of our knowledge:
1  the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2  the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Report on corporate governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance that was issued in 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council (“Combined Code”) for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
During the ﬁ nancial year, the Company complied with all of the provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code. 
Statement about applying the principles of good governance
The Company has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in the Combined Code. The explanation 
of how the principles have been applied is set out below and in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Report 
on remuneration. 
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets not less than seven times a year. The Board considers a range of matters for its approval, 
including setting Group strategy, acquisition policy, the budgets, major capital expenditure and material contracts. The 
Board monitors the performance of the businesses against appropriate forecasts and key performance indicators. The Board 
is supplied with ﬁ nancial and operational information on a timely basis to enable it to discharge its duties and carry out 
its responsibilities. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary and there is a procedure to enable them to take 
additional independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. Neil Netto was appointed Company Secretary 
on 19 September 2008 (in place of Russell Taylor). The Senior Independent non-executive Director is Michael Hartley.
In addition to the Chairman, the Board comprises three non-executive Directors and two or three executive Directors 
during the year. The Board currently has four non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) and three executive 
Directors which it considers to be an appropriate balance of executive and non-executive Directors. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are separate, and each has deﬁ ned roles and responsibilities approved by the Board.
The Nomination Committee considers all appointments made to the Board. Neil England was appointed as a non-executive 
Director on 18 March 2008. Russell Taylor was promoted to Chief Executive Oﬃ  cer on 19 May 2008. Neil Jones was 
appointed as Finance Director on 4 November 2008. The full terms and conditions of the three appointments are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered oﬃ  ce and will be available for review before the Annual General Meeting. 
Members of the Nomination Committee were actively involved in all three appointments and, taking such advice as 
appropriate, agreed the speciﬁ cations for the three positions. At separate times, external search companies were appointed 
to provide a shortlist of candidates. The candidates for the three positions were all interviewed by the Chairman and other 
Directors as appropriate. The shortlist of candidates for all three positions were interviewed by the members of the 
Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee collectively recommended all three appointments to the Board.
The Directors’ diversity of experience and knowledge of the markets in which ITE operates is key to the development of 
a robust strategy for the Group and to its execution. The non-executive Directors contribute an independent and objective 
view to the management of the Company and play a full and active part in the various Board committees. The names and 
biographies of the Directors are on page 33.
The Board considers Michael Hartley, Malcolm Wall and Neil England to be independent, and recognises that Iain Paterson 
was independent on the date of his appointment.
Any Directors appointed since the last Annual General Meeting are required to oﬀ er themselves for re-election at the ﬁ rst 
available annual general meeting. In accordance with the Articles of the Company, all Directors are required to stand for 
re-election at least every three years.  ITE Group plc

Report on corporate governance
continued
The non-executive Directors met formally without the executives present twice during the year. A formal evaluation of the 
Board and its Committees was carried out. The Chairman circulated a questionnaire to each Director that sought views on 
various factors concerning the workings of the Board and its eﬀ ectiveness. The results were collated and debated by the 
Board. As a result, improvements have been made particularly to the allocation of time spent at Board meetings discussing 
the key signiﬁ cant business and strategic issues. The Chairman’s performance was evaluated by the Senior Independent 
Director. A number of matters were discussed at these meetings which served to enhance further the satisfactory 
performance of the Board.
The following table sets out the number of meetings of the Board, and of the principal Committees of the Board during the 
ﬁ nancial year, together with details of attendance. During the year, the Directors attended all of the Board and Committee

Communication with shareholders
The Board considers communication with all shareholders to be extremely important. Shareholders are provided either in 
hard copy or online, with full-year and interim accounts to help them keep up to date with the performance of the Group 
and are given the opportunity to ask questions directly of the Board at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. The 
Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are generally available to discuss shareholders’ concerns as and when 
required. The Group’s website (www.ite-exhibitions.com) is regularly updated with copies of all Group press releases 
and presentations given to shareholders.
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders by making strategic presentations to institutional investors every six months following the publication 
of the half-year and annual results, by meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their feedback and 
by communicating regularly throughout the year.  ITE Group plc

Board Committees
The Board has established three Committees all of which have written terms of reference. The terms of reference for the 
Committees are available on the Company’s website at www.ite-exhibitions.com.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises only non-executive Directors. The Committee was chaired by Sir Jeremy Hanley up to the 
date of his resignation on 6 March 2008 and Michael Hartley thereafter, whom the Board considers has appropriate ﬁ nancial 
expertise to fulﬁ l this role. The other members are Malcolm Wall and Neil England. The meetings are also attended by the 
Chairman, the Finance Director, the deputy Finance Director and the auditors, together with any other member of staﬀ  
considered necessary by the Committee to complete its work. The Committee meets at least four times a year and ensures 
that at least twice a year it meets with the auditors without executives or other members of staﬀ  present to discuss matters 
relating to its remit and any issues arising.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing accounting procedures and the internal control environment. The Committee 
also reviews announcements of the Company’s results and monitors compliance with accounting standards and Company 
law. In addition, the Committee considers the appointment of the auditors, the scope of the audit and any issues arising, 
their fees and the nature, extent and costs of any non-audit services provided by them. The Committee has access to any 
employee and is able to obtain external advice on any matter as required. The auditors are able to request additional 
meetings at any time. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive Directors. The Committee was chaired by Michael Hartley 
up to 6 March 2008 and thereafter by Malcolm Wall. It meets at least three times a year . The other members are Iain Paterson, 
Michael Hartley and Neil England. The meetings are attended by the Chief Executive Oﬃ  cer and external advisers as appropriate. 
Further information about the Committee is set out in the Report on remuneration on page 43.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the non-executive Directors Iain Paterson, Malcolm Wall, Michael Hartley, Sir Jeremy 
Hanley up to the date of his resignation on 6 March 2008 and Neil England from 18 March 2008. The Committee, which 
is chaired by Iain Paterson, is responsible, if requested by the Board, for nominating candidates to the whole Board for 
approval, recommending the re-appointment or continuation in oﬃ  ce of any Director, and for considering and making 
recommendations to the Board on its composition and balance.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each of the above Committees.
Independence of external auditors
The Audit Committee has established clear guidelines concerning the levels of discretionary non-audit fees it considers 
are appropriate to safeguard the independence of the auditors. The Committee has implemented review and approval 
processes relating to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors, and undertakes an annual assessment of the 
auditors’ independence and eﬀ ectiveness. The Audit Committee is satisﬁ ed that there are suﬃ  cient safeguards in place 
to ensure auditor independence.
Whistle-blowing arrangements
The Company has a set policy to enable and encourage staﬀ  to report in conﬁ dence any possible improprieties in matters 
of ﬁ nancial reporting or otherwise. The procedure for reporting any such matter has been communicated to all staﬀ .  ITE Group plc

Internal audit function
The Audit Committee annually considers whether an internal audit function is appropriate and makes an appropriate 
recommendation to the Board. The central ﬁ nance function is responsible for checking, monitoring and reporting on the 
control environment in the Group’s accounting centres. During the year, the Company appointed an external ﬁ rm of 
accountants (other than its auditors) to perform independent audits on the eﬀ ectiveness of its internal controls for all the 
Company’s principal oﬃ  ces by the end of September 2009. The Committee considers that at present there is a high level 
of independence and objective reporting on the control environment in the Group. The Board has concluded that a formal 
internal audit function is not currently required. The Audit Committee will continue to monitor this matter and make 
appropriate recommendations to the Board.
Review of internal controls and of risk management process
The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of controls, 
including ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management to provide them with reasonable assurance 
regarding eﬀ ective and eﬃ  cient operations, internal control and compliance with laws and regulations.
A system of internal controls has been established to allow the Board, in conjunction with management, to identify, 
evaluate and manage the signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Company on an on-going and pro-active basis. The system also 
seeks to monitor the Company’s overall ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance positions and to help safeguard shareholders’ 
investments and to protect the Company’s assets. The Board is responsible for this process and for ensuring that it remains 
eﬀ ective and, in order to facilitate it, it has established a single organisational structure with clearly drawn lines of 
accountability, appropriate delegation of authority and open lines of communication. 
The Company has a comprehensive system of ﬁ nancial reporting. There is a thorough budgeting system for all lines 
of income and expenditure, with an annual budget approved by the Board. Historical ﬁ nancial performance and revised 
forecasts for the full year are reported against budget and considered by the Board at each meeting. The Board pays 
particular attention to those matters which, by their nature, expose the Company to signiﬁ cant risks and uncertainties, 
including exchange rates, which can be subject to considerable volatility and can have a material impact on the Company’s 
operating results.
The Company has established procedures to deal with authorisations for expenditure. The Board is committed to ensuring 
that the Company’s data and infrastructure, and its information technology systems, are as secure as is reasonably 
practicable. Security controls and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Company’s premises. 
Hardware and software controls have also been instigated to prevent unauthorised access to the Company’s computer 
system and network. Regular back-ups of electronic information are taken with copies being stored oﬀ site.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
This system of internal control has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
It is reviewed regularly by the Board and complies with the Turnbull guidance. The Board has performed a speciﬁ c 
assessment of internal controls for the purpose of this Annual Report. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its review responsibilities. ITE Group plc

Report on remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A Companies Act 1985. The report also links the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles 
relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the ﬁ nancial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report 
and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

During the year, the Committee consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street to advise on executive remuneration and the 
operation of the various ITE Group share schemes. Hewitt New Bridge Street has provided no other services to the 
Company.
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation oﬀ ered is appropriate to attract, retain 
and motivate executive Directors and staﬀ  with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’s strategy and grow the 
business, having regard to the challenging economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which 
the Company operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the remuneration packages oﬀ ered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company;
b) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based;
c) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
d) the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole; and
e) any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the associates of the Company.
 
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and beneﬁ ts, a performance-related bonus and 
longer-term share-based incentive arrangements. A signiﬁ cant proportion of executive Directors’ remuneration 
is performance related. 
The fees of the non-executive Directors are proposed by the Chief Executive and approved by the Board, taking account 
of practice adopted in other companies and the time commitment required. The fees of the Chairman are determined 
by the Committee taking account of the role and the time commitment required. The Chairman does not take part 
in those discussions. ITE Group plc

Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. Base salary levels are set by the Committee, taking into account 
each executive Director’s role, experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their duties. The base 
salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan are regularly reviewed 
and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators. Details of the executive Directors’ 
base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2008 are set out under ‘Directors’ service contracts’. 
Variable bonus
The executive Directors and certain senior management participate in performance-related annual bonus schemes 
(“Executive Bonus Plan”), which recognise Company objectives to deliver compound growth of headline proﬁ t before tax. 
For the ﬁ nancial year commencing 1 October 2008, Russell Taylor’s and Neil Jones’ maximum annual bonus opportunity 
provided under the Executive Bonus Plan will be 100% and 65% of base salary respectively. Edward Strachan’s annual 
bonus opportunity through the Company’s consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited (‘Kyzyl Tan’) is 
on a similar basis to the Executive Bonus Plan, and for the ﬁ nancial year commencing 1 October 2008 is capped at 100% 
of the Kyzyl Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director. 
The bonus caps for the year commencing 1 October 2008 is unchanged in respect of Russell Taylor, and increased from 
85% to 100% for Edward Strachan. In the ﬁ nancial year ending 30 September 2008, maximum bonuses were achieved 
by Russell Taylor and Edward Strachan (through Kyzyl Tan) under the Executive Bonus Plan, reﬂ ecting a year of excellent 
performance which saw headline proﬁ t before tax grow by 5%.
The Executive Bonus Plan applying to Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan (through Kyzyl Tan) for the 2008-09 
ﬁ nancial year is based upon achievement of a sliding scale of compound growth targets based upon headline proﬁ t before 
tax (as it was last year). No bonus is payable unless the minimum growth target is achieved. 
Long-term incentives 
In recent years the Company has operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes as its share based 
arrangements. At the time of preparing this report, the Committee was in the process of reviewing the Company’s share 
based long term incentive policy. Any fundamental change to the policy will be highlighted in the Company’s Notice 
of Annual General Meeting.
Performance Share Plans
The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key 
Contractors’ Performance Share Plan 2004. Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth 
up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees. 
It is the Committee’s intention that the aggregate earnings per share targets as set out on page 49 will be set for any 
awards made in the ﬁ nancial year commencing 1 October 2008.
This performance condition has been chosen by the Committee to take account of the Company’s biennial business cycle 
and to incentivise management to deliver sustained headline earnings per share performance over the relevant three year 
period. The targets are based upon a compound rate of growth in headline diluted earnings per share over the comparable 
ﬁ gure achieved in the year ended 30 September 2008. The targets are calculated for each of the three performance years, 
taking account of any material events which are not annually recurring and aggregated into an ‘Aggregated headline diluted 
earnings per share target’. The Committee will, for the purposes of third party veriﬁ cation, conﬁ rm with external advisers 
the extent to which these targets are met. 
Executive Directors will be required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting 
of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding equal to 1x salary. ITE Group plc

Share option plans
The Company has previously operated the following option schemes: the ITE Group 1998 Company Share Option Plan; 
the ITE Group 1998 Discretionary Share Option Scheme; the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme. These 
schemes expired on 12 March 2008 and are being replaced by proposed 2009 Discretionary and Key Contractor Schemes 
details of which are outlined in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee have consulted with 
Olswang solicitors to advise on the renewal of the Company’s share options schemes. The Company has also previously 
operated the ITE Group Employee Share Trust Unapproved Share Option Scheme. It is not intended that the executive 
Directors will participate in the share option schemes.
Pensions 
The Company oﬀ ers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under 
this scheme. 
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Oﬃ  cer, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylor’s 
base salary to his existing money purchase pension scheme. The Company made a contribution equal to 10% of Bill Dye’s 
base salary to his existing money purchase pension scheme for the time of his service with the Company.
Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Russell Taylor (Chief Executive) and Neil Jones (Finance Director) have UK contracts of employment which reﬂ ect market 
and best practice for senior management serving in the UK and have no ﬁ xed term. Notice periods and base salary details 
for all Directors are outlined in the tables set out below. Other than the contribution to Russell Taylor’s pension scheme 
described above, there are no contributions to pension schemes. The standard terms provide for medical insurance and 
life insurance but provide for no other fringe beneﬁ ts such as company cars. 
In the event of early termination of an executive Director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy that (subject to the 
provisions of each contract) the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the executive Director will be determined by 
reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time. The Committee’s objective will be to avoid rewarding poor 
performance. Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the executive Director’s duty to mitigate his loss.
Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2008 is £37,000. In addition, Edward Strachan is remunerated 
as a consultant through the Company’s agreement with Kyzyl Tan. The agreement with Kyzyl Tan was a three year contract 
to provide the services of Edward Strachan to the Company from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008, and is now 
continuing on the same terms, save for the higher maximum bonus percentage as detailed above, and on a six month 
rolling notice period. The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2008 is 
£328,000. Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon the same targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which 
is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tan’s base consultancy fee and Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director for the year ending 
30 September 2009 i.e. £365,000 in total. Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the 
markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a living away from home allowance 
of up to $90,000 for its employee for each year of the contract.
The Remuneration Committee considers that Edward Strachan’s unique knowledge and skills of managing the exhibition 
business in the regions for which he is responsible, together with the requirement for him to reside abroad, warrants the 
Company entering into a consultancy contract. The Committee ﬁ rmly believes that this contract is in the best interests 
of the Company. 
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the 
executive Directors with ﬁ xed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company 
to compensation payments in excess of one year’s total remuneration. ITE Group plc

(not including the Chairman) was increased by £1,600 per annum for base salary and £150 per annum for being a 
Committee Chairman, eﬀ ective from 1 October 2008. Accordingly the remuneration for the year commencing 1 October 2008

Notes to the consolidated accounts
General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered oﬃ  ce is given on the inside 
back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1. 
These ﬁ nancial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies 
set out below.
Change in accounting policies
Gains and losses on derivatives not in designated and eﬀ ective hedging relationships
During the 2007/2008 ﬁ nancial year, ITE Group plc has changed its accounting policy in relation to the income statement 
disclosure of fair value gains and losses on derivatives not in designated and eﬀ ective hedging relationships. Previously, 
ITE Group plc reported these fair value gains and losses in “Administrative expenses” in the income statement. As a result 
of the change in policy, these fair value gains and losses are now disclosed as part of “Finance income/costs”. Management 
judges that this policy provides a fairer presentation of administrative expenses and a clearer presentation of derivatives 
in the ﬁ nancial statements. The comparative ﬁ nancial statements for 2007 have been restated. The eﬀ ects of these 
changes on the comparative ﬁ gures are increase in “Finance costs” of £0.4 million and a resulting decrease in 
“Administrative expenses”.
Presentation of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments in the balance sheet
In light of the change of accounting policy above and the movement in the value of derivative instruments in the period, 
the Group has also amended the balance sheet presentation of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. Previously, the fair value 
of derivatives was shown in “Other debtors/other creditors”, but is now presented as a separate balance sheet caption 
on the face of the balance sheet. Management believes that this presentation provides a clearer picture of the derivative 
instruments used by the Group. This presentational change has resulted in a restatement of the comparative prior year 
end ﬁ nancial statements for 2007. The eﬀ ects of these changes on the comparative ﬁ gures are decrease in “Other 
creditors” of £0.7 million and a resulting increase in “Derivative ﬁ nance instruments”.
Impact of new accounting standards
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is eﬀ ective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The 
impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these ﬁ nancial 
statements regarding the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments. 
In addition the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ending 
30 September 2008, and these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2008 Group ﬁ nancial statements:
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment >
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions  >
The following new standards have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only eﬀ ective for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008. These are also not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group ﬁ nancial statements:
Amendment to IAS 23, Borrowing Costs (eﬀ ective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009). This standard  >
requires all borrowing costs which are directly attributable to an acquisition construction or production of a qualifying 
asset to form part of the cost of that asset. The Group does not expect a signiﬁ cant impact from this standard.
Amendment to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (eﬀ ective for periods commencing on or after  >
1 July 2009). The amendment introduces changes to the accounting for partial disposals of subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures. Adoption of these amendments is not expected to signiﬁ cantly impact the measurement, 
presentation or disclosure of future disposals. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
59
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Amendments to IAS 32, Puttable ﬁ nancial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation (eﬀ ective for periods  >
beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The amendments are relevant to entities that have issued ﬁ nancial instruments 
that are (i) puttable ﬁ nancial instruments or (ii) instruments, or components of instruments that impose on the entity 
an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rata share of the net assets on liquidation only. As a result of the 
amendments, some ﬁ nancial instruments that currently meet the deﬁ nition of a ﬁ nancial liability will be classiﬁ ed as 
equity because they represent the residual interest in the net assets of the entity. The amendments set out extensive 
detailed criteria to be met in order to be able to classify these instruments as equity. The impact of these amendments 
is restricted to speciﬁ c cases and no analogies can be made. The Group does not expect a signiﬁ cant impact from the 
adoption of this standard.
Amendments to IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement (eﬀ ective for periods commencing  >
on or after 1 July 2009). The amendments clarify treatment of inﬂ ation in a ﬁ nancial hedged item and one-sided risks 
in a hedged item. The Group does not expect a signiﬁ cant impact from the adoption of this standard.
Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (eﬀ ective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009). The  >
amendment clariﬁ es that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features 
of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also speciﬁ es that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by 
other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group does not expect a signiﬁ cant impact from the 
adoption of this standard.
Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations (eﬀ ective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009). The  >
amendment introduces changes that will require acquisition related costs (including professional fees previously 
capitalised) to be expensed and adjustments to contingent consideration to be recognised in income and will allow the 
full goodwill method to be used when accounting for non-controlling interests. This will result in a change to the Group’s 
accounting policy for purchases of stakes in controlled entities.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments (eﬀ ective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 sets out disclosure  >
requirements concerning an entity’s operating segments, products, services, geographical areas in which it operates 
and its major customers. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting. The Group does not expect a signiﬁ cant impact 
from the adoption of this standard.
2008 Annual Improvements (the majority of changes will eﬀ ect periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The  >
standard makes 41 amendments to 25 IFRSs as part of the ﬁ rst annual improvements project. The amendments include: 
restructuring IFRS 1, mainly to remove redundant transitional provisions; an amendment to bring property under 
construction or development for future use as an investment property within the scope of IAS 40. Such property 
currently falls within the scope of IAS 16; and an amendment to clarify the circumstances in which an entity can 
recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure. Recognition of an asset would be permitted 
up to the point at which the entity has access to the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of services. The 
standard is not expected to have a signiﬁ cant impact on the Group. In relation to the amendment to IAS 38 regarding 
prepayments for advertising or promotional expenditure, the Group will be required to reassess its accounting approach 
to reﬂ ect the requirements of the standard.
The following interpretations have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only eﬀ ective for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008. These are also not expected to have a material impact 
on the Group ﬁ nancial statements:
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements (eﬀ ective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). >
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes (eﬀ ective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008). >
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (eﬀ ective for periods  >
beginning on or after 1 January 2008).
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate (eﬀ ective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). >
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation (eﬀ ective for periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008). > 60

Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as ‘the Group’. 
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with International Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group ﬁ nancial statements comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulation.
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that aﬀ ect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time 
and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from 
other sources. Actual results may diﬀ er from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions 
are reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial statements in the period in which they are made. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of ﬁ nancial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company 
drawn up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁ able net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest 
of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. 
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the 
interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the eﬀ ective date of acquisition or up to the eﬀ ective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the 
business combination. The acquiree’s identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classiﬁ ed as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁ able assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately 
in the proﬁ t and loss account.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the minority’s proportion of the net fair value 
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.  Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identiﬁ able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
beneﬁ t from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁ rst to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t 
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written oﬀ  to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling 
denominated assets.
 
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost, trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured at fair 
value. Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a deﬁ nite useful life and are carried at cost or fair 
value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over 
their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are typically between three and seven years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
ﬂ ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indeﬁ nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset for which estimates of future cash ﬂ ows have 
not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried 
at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 62

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write oﬀ  the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line 
method, on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements  – term of lease
Fixture and ﬁ ttings  – 10 years
Plant and equipment  – 4 years
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, 
or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the diﬀ erence between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, but not control or joint 
control, through participation in the ﬁ nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence is the 
power to participate in the ﬁ nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these ﬁ nancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of 
an associate in excess of Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form 
part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identiﬁ able net assets of the associate 
at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any deﬁ ciency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s 
share of the fair value of the identiﬁ able net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) 
is credited in proﬁ t or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, proﬁ ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which 
case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either oﬀ -setting against future venue hire or 
by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts. The loan balance is 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the “eﬀ ective interest rate method”. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁ t or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are 
recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outﬂ ow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the eﬀ ect is material. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Annual Report 2008
Financial Instruments
Classes of ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group aggregates its ﬁ nancial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of 
ﬁ nancial instruments by class are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classiﬁ es its ﬁ nancial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables 
and derivative assets at fair value through proﬁ t or loss. The classiﬁ cation is determined by management upon initial 
recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the ﬁ nancial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its ﬁ nancial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised 
(in full or partly) when the Group’s rights to cash ﬂ ows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value. Cash 
and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash 
equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets with ﬁ xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. This category includes the following classes of ﬁ nancial assets: trade and other receivables and venue 
advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁ t or loss when there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on speciﬁ c credit circumstances and the Group’s historical 
bad receivables experience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short term nature 
or speciﬁ c arrangements in place, and hence the eﬀ ective interest rate method is not applied. 
Derivative assets
A derivative is a ﬁ nancial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classiﬁ ed as at fair value through proﬁ t or 
loss. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value 
at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are 
acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classiﬁ es its ﬁ nancial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held 
at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through proﬁ t or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  64

Notes to the consolidated accounts

Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the proﬁ t or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank overdrafts are deemed 
to be integral to the Group’s cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents 
in the cash ﬂ ow statement. Overdrafts that are considered to be ﬁ nancing in nature are presented as ﬁ nancing activities 
in the cash ﬂ ow statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade 
payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced 
by a new liability with substantially modiﬁ ed terms. Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest 
charged in connection with these, hence the eﬀ ective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a ﬁ nancial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no 
or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. 
Derivative liabilities are classiﬁ ed as at fair value through proﬁ t or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial 
recognition at fair value and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date with the resulting 
gains and losses recognised in the income statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the ﬁ nancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and eﬀ ective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in proﬁ t or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments as cash ﬂ ow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining 
maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. 
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is 
used in a hedging relationship is highly eﬀ ective in oﬀ setting changes in the fair values of cash ﬂ ows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The eﬀ ective portion of changes in the fair value 
of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂ ow hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to any 
ineﬀ ective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁ t or loss, and is included in “Finance income/cost” in the income 
statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in proﬁ t or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised 
in proﬁ t or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred 
in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in proﬁ t 
or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity 
is recognised immediately in proﬁ t or loss.
The Group’s use of ﬁ nancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s ﬁ nancial policies. Further details on these policies 
can be found in the Business review on page 28.  Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Annual Report 2008
Fair values
The fair value is deﬁ ned as the amount at which a ﬁ nancial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its ﬁ nancial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely 
accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash ﬂ ows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer 
quotes for similar instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of 
business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis at the time of an event taking place. Revenue is recognised evenly over the 
days over which an event is held and if an event straddles a period end, then the revenue is recognised in each period 
based on the number of days of the event in each period. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable 
costs relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event 
income and prepaid event costs respectively. Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the eﬀ ective interest rate 
applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, 
revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement. 
Operating proﬁ t
Operating proﬁ t is stated after the share of results of associates and proﬁ t or loss on disposal of Group undertakings 
and before investment income and ﬁ nance costs. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable proﬁ t for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable proﬁ t diﬀ ers from net proﬁ t as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on diﬀ erences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary diﬀ erences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ ts will 
be available against which deductible temporary diﬀ erences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary diﬀ erence arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not aﬀ ect the tax proﬁ t or the accounting proﬁ t.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary diﬀ erences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
diﬀ erence and it is probable that the temporary diﬀ erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 66
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Notes to the consolidated accounts
continued
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that suﬃ  cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oﬀ set when there is a legally enforceable right to set oﬀ  current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual 
rate where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate 
prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in proﬁ t or loss for the period. Exchange diﬀ erences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in proﬁ t or loss for the period except for diﬀ erences 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting polices for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and 
their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates ﬂ uctuate signiﬁ cantly during the period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transaction are used. Exchange diﬀ erences arising are classiﬁ ed as equity and transferred to the 
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation diﬀ erences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the eﬀ ects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation 
diﬀ erences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss 
on disposal will exclude translation diﬀ erences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The ﬁ nancial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written oﬀ  
to proﬁ t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding 
the eﬀ ect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the eﬀ ect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the eﬀ ects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. Beneﬁ ts received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by 
management and have the most signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements or have the most 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year:
 
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-
generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimation of future cash ﬂ ows expected from the cash-generating unit for a period of 10 years and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. The 10 year period used in the calculation is based on management’s average 
expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash generating units. The carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2008 is £41.0 million and £16.1million respectively.
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash 
ﬂ ows arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets. This involves 
estimating the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks aﬀ ect future cash ﬂ ows. 
 
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value 
at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s 
share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives. Management regularly performs 
a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number 
of leavers. 
 
Taxation 
Being a multinational Group with tax aﬀ airs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of 
the Group and is often dependent on the eﬃ  ciency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The 
Group however takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items 
means that the eventual resolution could diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the 
Group’s results and future cash ﬂ ows. 68

The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash ﬂ ows 
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂ ect the current market assessments 
of the time value of money and risks speciﬁ c to the cash-generating units. The growth rates are based on management 
forecasts. The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts based upon the most recent ﬁ nancial plans approved by the Board and 
extrapolates the planned cash ﬂ ows. Assumed growth rates of between 1% and 3% have been applied for the ﬁ rst three 
years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of between 1% and 2% is applied thereafter, these rates do not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets.
The discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 10% and 13%.
Additions in the year of £6.4 million are all for the acquisition of businesses. This includes £108,000 in relation to 
additional costs on ITE Moda Footwear Limited and deferred consideration for ITE Exhibitions BV . In 2007, the additional 
acquisition of businesses of £23,000 arose with the payment of deferred consideration in relation to ITE Exhibitions BV .

16 Bank overdraft
The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total borrowing, £4.7 million (2007: £11.3 million) is denominated 
in Euros and £1.8 million (2007: £2.0 million) is denominated in US Dollars. The borrowings are arranged at ﬂ oating 
interest rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. The Euro and US Dollar borrowings are taken out to act as 
a partial hedge against the UK monetary assets in those currencies.
The overdraft has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International 
Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited and ITE Moda Footwear 
Limited and a charge over the account of International Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. The average interest rate on the 
bank overdrafts approximates 4.9% per annum (2007: 4.3%) and is determined by reference to base rate plus 0.5%. The 
Directors estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates their fair value.
At 30 September 2008 the Group had £13.4 million (2007: £6.7 million) of gross undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

on the potential gain based on the diﬀ erence between the exercise price and share price for those share options where the 
share price exceeds the exercise price at 30 September 2008.

balances for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities     (3,617) (1,671)
Deferred tax assets     1,594 1,690
      (2,023) 19
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £1.5 million (2007: £1.3 million) available for oﬀ set against 
future proﬁ ts. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability 
of future proﬁ t streams. These losses may be carried forward indeﬁ nitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary diﬀ erences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £3.7 million (2007: £3.1 million). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these diﬀ erences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary diﬀ erences and it is probable that such diﬀ erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Maturity of ﬁ nancial instruments 
In 2008 all ﬁ nancial liabilities except the put option have a maturity of one year or less. The put option is an open option 
with no ﬁ xed maturity date.
In 2007 all ﬁ nancial liabilities, except derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, had a maturity of one year or less. Out of the total of 
£0.7 million of derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities £0.6 million had a maturity of one year or less and £0.1 million had a maturity 
of one to two years.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
ﬁ nancial statements approximate to their fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.

The Group seeks to minimise the eﬀ ects of foreign currency risks by using derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge the 
risk exposures. The use of ﬁ nancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance 
with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into ﬁ nancial 
instruments, including derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of ﬁ nancial risks: market risk (including foreign currency 
and interest rate), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Business review 
on pages 28 to 29. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Annual Report 2008
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will aﬀ ect the Group’s income or the value 
of its holdings of ﬁ nancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁ nancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk 
exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate 
ﬂ uctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or 
forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge signiﬁ cant highly probable forecast transactions and cash ﬂ ows. During 
the year the Group has been party to foreign currency forward-plus contracts in the management of its exchange rate 
exposures to highly probable forecast Euro currency receipts. The instruments purchased are denominated in Euros.
Under the forward-plus contract, the Group has a right but not an obligation, to sell Euros for Sterling at a speciﬁ ed strike 
rate at speciﬁ ed dates. However, if the spot rate is at or below the speciﬁ ed barrier rate on any business day during the 
barrier period the right to sell Euros becomes an obligation, at the speciﬁ ed strike rate.
As at 30 September 2008 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward-plus contracts that the Group has 
committed to amounted to v11 million. These arrangements are designed to address signiﬁ cant exchange exposures for 
the next six months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than 
six months or more than 18 months in the future.
At 30 September 2008, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately £1.0 million 
(2007: £0.6 million). These amounts are based on market valuations. The fair value of currency derivatives that are 
designated and eﬀ ective as cash ﬂ ow hedges amounting to £nil (2007: £50,000) has been deferred in equity. Changes 
in the fair value of currency derivatives of £3.3 million (2007: £0.6 million) arising where they are no longer designated 
as eﬀ ective hedges have been recorded in the income statement. 
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain 
currency trade receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management. 
All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income 
statement.
Since the year end the Group has taken out forward contracts to sell v26.8 million into Sterling between April 2009 
and September 2009 at an average forward rate of v1.27 to £1. These forward contracts will be designated as hedging 
instruments against highly probable forecast Euro sales and as such any changes in their fair value will be recorded 
in equity.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no signiﬁ cant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash ﬂ ows 
are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its 
borrowings at ﬂ oating interest rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of ﬂ oating 
interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are detailed 
in the liquidity risk section of this note.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. 
These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of ﬁ nancial loss from defaults. The Group’s 
objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk 
is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing proﬁ le of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables 
can be seen overleaf.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The 
territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level 
of cash held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored 
and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved ﬁ nancial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group 
raise invoices on events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed 
and chased. Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when the 
service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage 
outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by 
the Group’s management based on prior experience, speciﬁ c credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas and the Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers 
operate, has less of an inﬂ uence on credit risk. 
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and 
measured as the diﬀ erence between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash ﬂ ows, where material 
discounted at the eﬀ ective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance is a speciﬁ c 
loss component that relates to individually signiﬁ cant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not 
been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the speciﬁ c circumstances of each show and past 
experience.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from 
inadequate market depth or disruption or reﬁ nancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests 
with the Board of Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management 
of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and 
debt facilities as appropriate. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure 
of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft, which is disclosed in note 16 and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.

At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE 
Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees 
who exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares 
by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share Ownership Trust. 
The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the 
Company’s shares purchased by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 6,967,783 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2008 (2007: 1,854,875 shares). During the year 
1,484,000 share options were granted against ESOT held shares. The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT 
at 30 September 2008 was £8.4 million (2007: £3.2 million). Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Annual Report 2008
Notes
1 Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and accounting standards and have been applied consistently.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a deﬁ nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an 
accrual basis to proﬁ t or loss.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing diﬀ erences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing diﬀ erences are diﬀ erences between the Group’s taxable proﬁ ts and 
its results as stated in the ﬁ nancial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in 
periods diﬀ erent from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing diﬀ erences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when ﬁ xed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding 
agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when ﬁ xed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable 
gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing diﬀ erences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.  Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Annual Report 2008
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in proﬁ t or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The ﬁ nancial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held 
by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written oﬀ  to 
proﬁ t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value 
(excluding the eﬀ ect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the eﬀ ect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the eﬀ ects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
2 Proﬁ t for the year
The proﬁ t after tax for the year ended 30 September 2008 was £29.8 million (2007: £13.7 million). As permitted by 
section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate proﬁ t and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The audit fee for the Company was £42,000 (2007: £42,000).

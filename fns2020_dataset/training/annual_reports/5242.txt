Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
In September 2011, eg announced interim results reflecting 
strong trading for the first half of the year based on 
deployment of the Nuqleus 3D (“N3D”) solution (acquired with 
XTAQ in March 2010) in two new clients and continued 
expansion of existing eg work manager
®
 clients. The 
re-engineering of our software platform to integrate eg work 
manager
®
 and N3D, and to replace the third party 
component, caused delays to anticipated roll-outs of our 
solutions, as a result of both the development and the 
undertaking of pilot projects with the new products. As a 
consequence, after an encouraging financial performance for 
the first half of the year, revenue and profit for the second half 
of 2011/12 fell below market expectations.
By the end of the year to 31 January 2012 we had 
successfully completed the re-engineering of our enterprise 
software platform, significantly enhancing our leading market 
position and resulting in strong demand for our products and 
services. At the end of the year we won five significant new 
contracts, from both existing and new customers in the UK 
and overseas, including an investment bank and a business 
process outsourcer. All of these contracts have significant 
potential for further expansion. This was followed in March 
2012 by the most significant contract win in the Group history 
with a leading global financial services company.
Existing and potential customers have responded very positively 
both to our existing products and to those we are developing. 
Growth in demand for back office optimisation solutions is 
increasing as financial services and businesses in other sectors 
seek to improve their effectiveness in challenging global 
markets. eg is now in an excellent position to take full 
advantage of the development of this market. The value of 
our order book is growing, along with our customer and user 
base, and recent new contracts have already provided a high 
level of revenue visibility for the current year. 
Financial results
Total revenue for the year was £4.71 million (2010/11: £5.15 
million). Software licences, maintenance and software services 
contributed 82 per cent (2010/11: 68 per cent) of total 
revenue with the balance coming from implementation and 
training services. 
Overall gross margin for the year was maintained at 62.8 per 
cent (2010/11: 62.7 per cent), reflecting increased product 
sales and the re-organisation of the sales and delivery teams.
As a result of the delays in new contracts, caused by the 
failure of the third party software component, profit before tax 
and exceptional costs fell to £0.15 million (2010/11: £0.45 
million). 
Profit after tax was £0.13 million (2010/11: £0.48 million).
Our continuing focus on tight cost control contributed to 
positive operating cash flow of £0.74 million (2010/11: £0.74 
million) and, after investment in research and development of 
£0.86 million (2010/11: £0.65 million), cash at 31 January 
2012 was £0.06 million (2010/11: £0.49 million) and is now 
£0.7 million.
The Board has decided not to recommend the payment of a 
dividend. 
Following the decision of Andrew McRae not to seek re-
election at the last AGM because of his increasing international 
commitments, in May 2011 Phil Lee joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director with Board finance responsibility. We 
have been fortunate in being able to draw on Phil’s extensive 
experience and knowledge of the financial services industry 
and, having formerly been an eg client in three previous roles, 
his knowledge includes a detailed understanding of eg and 
our products.
Current trading and outlook
The development of the back office optimisation software 
market is gaining momentum and eg is now reaping the 
rewards of the significant investment made in its software, 
products and services. Trading so far this year has been 
excellent, underpinning our confidence in achieving market 
forecasts.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Elizabeth Gooch
Chief Executive Officer
Overview
Our two greatest achievements in the last year have been the 
five new customer wins in the UK and overseas and the 
successful re-engineering of our back office optimisation 
software suite. 
eg is the only company to have developed a purpose-built 
back office optimisation product capable of delivering desktop 
data capture, combined with real-time work management and 
standardised & bespoke reporting and analytics. Our 
functionality now includes forecasting, planning, intra-day and 
intra-process work allocation, tracking and management, 
together with real-time management information and 
dashboards. The development of our back office forecasting 
product this year, that can forecast at process and task level 
across multi-stage processes, has significantly boosted eg’s 
leading market position.
The re-engineering of our software suite involved replacing a 
third party component within the N3D data capture software 
and integrating this into eg work manager
®
. This re-
engineering was expected to have minimal impact on the 
outcome for the year ended 31 January 2012. Therefore, it 
was disappointing that, through the failure of the third party 
component and the need to undertake pilot projects with the 
new product suite in order to win new contracts and then 
finalise client commitment to their roll-out, revenue and profit 
for last year was lower than expected.
The new software platform has been very well received by 
both new and existing enterprise clients in the UK and 
overseas. We are now experiencing strong demand and our 
sales pipeline is growing rapidly.
We have also continued to maintain tight control over costs 
which reduced by £0.23 million on the prior year including 
£0.17 million as the result of a reorganisation of the sales and 
delivery teams. 
Business development and operations
Market development
The emerging back office optimisation software market 
continues to develop as financial institutions seek to improve 
operational control and minimise back office costs. This trend 
was confirmed in May 2011 by Donna Fluss, founder and 
President of DMG Consulting and recognised thought leader in 
the workforce optimisation market, at a showcase of the 
Company’s new eg operational intelligence
®
 software 
suite. DMG Consulting expects that the back office 
optimisation market will be 3 to 7 times the size of the contact 
centre workforce optimisation market and could have a value 
of at least $3 billion over the next few years. Other analysts 
are also forecasting that demand for new software which 
continuously monitors and analyses people and processes will 
grow significantly. 
This market opportunity is leading to the entry of new 
competition with most workforce optimisation vendors 
claiming to be able to address back office requirements in 
some way. At the same time, the back office is becoming 
increasingly complex with a greater variety of work sources 
including white mail, e-mail, image, SMS and calls as well as 
from core processing systems. The back office is under ever 
growing pressure to improve performance leading to an 
increasing need to understand, control and improve 
operational activity and reduce costs. 
Customer base growth
Following the successful re-engineering of our software 
platform, demand from new and existing customers has been 
encouraging. 
In the first half, work focussed on implementing major 
contracts won at the end of our last financial year in both the 
UK and South Africa.
In July 2011 a new contract, worth approximately £660,000, 
was won from an existing customer in South Africa (a leading 
investment administration company which provides 
outsourced healthcare services) to roll-out further users of the 
eg operational intelligence
®
 software suite. This 
implementation progressed according to plan and a further 
licence purchase was one of the five orders won at the year 
end. They continue with their enterprise roll-out. 
“Our two greatest achievements 
in the last year have been the 
five new customer wins in the 
UK and overseas and the 
successful re-engineering of  
our back office optimisation 
software suite.” eg solutions plc 10 Annual Report & Accounts 2012
21314-04    20/04/2012    Proof 5
“In March 2012, we won the most 
significant contract in eg’s history, 
from a leading global financial  
services company.”
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
In the closing days of the last financial year, we won five 
orders, including three from new UK and international 
customers in the financial services sector and two with 
existing UK and international customers, as follows: 
• a pilot project for the parent bank of an existing life and 
pensions client in Europe;
• a hosted software deployment and services implementation 
for a UK-based business process outsourcer;
• a pilot project for an investment bank;
• the further licence purchase for an existing South African 
client; and
• an extension of services for an existing UK client. 
In March 2012, we won the most significant contract in eg’s 
history, from a leading global financial services company, for 
eg operational intelligence
®
 and implementation services. 
Initially, the contract covers 3,250 users in Europe and India 
as part of the customer’s drive towards cost efficiencies within 
its Consumer and Corporate Banking divisions. Completion of 
the initial project is expected by August 2012 with revenue 
being recognised in the current financial year. The customer 
has also appointed eg as its preferred supplier of back office 
optimisation software and entered into a global master 
agreement for deployment, subject to successful completion 
of the initial contract, of a minimum of 30,000 software 
licences across the enterprise. 
The recently won contracts have significant potential for 
further roll-out as well as scope for recurring revenues.
Technology and product development
The objectives of the successful re-engineering of our product 
suite were fourfold:
• to integrate eg’s products with N3D and replace the third 
party component to provide real-time data capture 
functionality that can be deployed as a standard product;
• to develop strategic planning and forecasting functionality 
to enable us to meet the expectations and demands of our 
clients;
• to develop products capable of rapid, enterprise-wide 
deployment whilst also allowing for phased deployment to 
enable customers to achieve early workforce optimisation 
benefits before deploying full functionality; and
• to incorporate multi-channel transaction capture and 
enable rapid integration with in-house systems. This 
ensures complete data integrity by eliminating the manual 
keying often associated with back office workforce 
management solutions.
Following completion of this re-engineering programme, eg 
now offers the industry’s most complete, purpose-built back 
office optimisation solutions covering:
• Strategic planning and forecasting (eg forecasting™);
• Real-time work management (eg work manager
®
) 
incorporating multi-channel transaction capture using a 
variety of integration services, import and data capture 
solutions 
• Reporting and analytics (eg operational intelligence
®
)
These developments have strengthened eg’s leading 
competitive position and have resulted in major new orders 
and further pilot projects from new and existing customers.
People
Our success in meeting the challenges of the past year and 
positioning eg to optimise the emerging back office 
optimisation market has relied on the high quality, skill and 
hard work of our people and I would like to thank them for 
their contribution to the progress we have made and their 
continuing commitment. 
Prospects
Our objective is to capitalise on the investment we have made 
in our products, and seize the opportunities being created by 
the emerging back office optimisation market, to achieve 
strong, profitable growth.
eg’s market position and opportunity have never been better 
and we are both excited and confident about our future 
prospects.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Employees
eg’s intention is to listen to and involve staff — employee 
feedback is an important way of ensuring the continuous 
improvement of the business and can help improve staff 
satisfaction. Employees are fully supported by the Company 
should they choose to undertake further study and training.
Environment
Our offices are energy efficient offices and in utilising the 
latest technology we are endeavouring to minimise our impact 
on the environment. It is Company policy that all waste 
materials are recycled. Wherever possible eg uses FSC 
certified paper products and sustainable suppliers. We 
introduced ethical external Christmas cards in 2008 and a 
digital card for employees to reduce waste.
South Africa
The South African government has introduced a 
comprehensive system to help integrate black people into 
society, post-apartheid, and therefore encourage and assist 
the transition of economic empowerment. Companies 
operating in South Africa have to achieve Broad Based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) accredited status in support 
of these objectives. Businesses are classified by their size and 
measured in terms of how successfully they comply with a 
range of seven measures.
For the third year running eg have been accredited with level 
3 status (out of 10, 1 is the highest score).
Company charity
Since establishing a subsidiary in Johannesburg in 2007, eg 
has chosen the Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre as its 
Company charity. The centre provides safety and shelter for 
orphaned or fostered children aged 0 to 5 years old, some of 
whom are HIV positive. eg supports fundraising activities with 
staff and clients, as well as making its own financial 
contributions to the charity. The Company organises annual 
educational outings for the children and has provided items 
from a “wish list” of educational items using some of the 
funds raised to expand the facilities they have available and 
contribute towards the children’s education.
The aim of the Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre (DNCC) is 
to provide 160 underprivileged children, between the age of 0 
and 5 years, with safety, shelter, clothing, education love and 
medical aid from Monday to Friday.
In line with eg’s vision of enabling people to help themselves, 
eg chose DNCC to help underprivileged children to gain 
access to regular food and education as well as support those 
affected by the AIDS virus to build a brighter future for 
themselves.
Important Priorities: 
Child welfare – providing a safe environment for the 
children, that would otherwise be left alone and at risk
Hunger and Malnutrition – providing a safe haven and 
respite for parents, ensuring access to food and water to 
support their health
Education – engaging the children in educational activities 
such as learning the alphabet, numbers and the concept of 
colour and providing access to educational toys
In 2011 eg became the primary sponsor to ensure that the 
crèche gets the support they need to meet their everyday 
needs.
eg have donated a minimum of R60k (Rand) every year to aid 
the development of the crèche.
eg’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) policy has been produced in 
collaboration with employees and 
reflects the areas the Company feels 
are most closely aligned to its 
business operations. Our Accounts

Donation and fundraising activities have helped provide:
• E-pap
• Learning Materials
• Toys
• Clothes 
• Seasonal outings
• Practical items such as first aid kits and blankets
“We have come a long way in creating a proper structure and 
programme for the children. Our long-term goal is to build a 
new crèche with even better facilities. Through the support of 
eg the community and staff we have seen the children 
develop holistically and seen them go on to start formal 
education”

The Group produced below expectation revenues for the 
second half of the year with revenue of £2.05m, a 25% 
decrease on 2011 £2.74m. The lower revenue was caused by

(2011: £0.36m).

Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year the Group made charitable donations to UK 
registered charities of £40,000 (2011: £54,000), including the 
Elton John Aids Foundation. No political donations were made.
Research and Development
The Group invests in new product development and the 
continual modification and improvement of its existing 
products to meet technological advances, customer and new 
market requirements.
Employee Involvement and Disability
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees 
any matters likely to affect their interests. Information on 
matters of concern to employees is provided in order to 
achieve a common awareness of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance.
The Group’s policy is to recruit disabled workers for those 
vacancies that they are able to fill. All necessary assistance 
with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career 
plan is developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for 
each disabled person. Arrangements are made, wherever 
possible, for retraining employees who become disabled to 
enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their 
aptitudes.
Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results to differ materially from 
expected and historical results. Management seeks to identify 
material risks and put in place contingency plans to mitigate 
the Group’s potential exposure. 
Competitor Risk
The market for operations management improvement is 
becoming increasingly competitive. To mitigate this risk, 
management works to build strong customer relationships and 
develop the Group’s product offering. 
Commercial Relationships
Some of the products utilise interfaces with proprietary 
software licensed by independent, third party software 
developers. Any absence of key third party products could 
have a material impact on the business.
To mitigate this risk, all key commercial relationships and 
developments in technology in the marketplace are kept under 
review. The Group also works with a diversity of partners to 
mitigate the risk inherent in working with a single partner.
Operations
The Group’s facilities could be disrupted by events beyond its 
control such as fire or other issues.
The Group prepares recovery plans for most foreseeable 
situations so that our business operations would continue 
should these situations occur. 
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk 
of default to financial transactions by customers, availability of 
funds to meet the Group’s needs and fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates.
The Group manages these risks through an effective risk 
management programme. Exposures to financial risks are 
monitored by management and they are required to produce 
a quarterly risk report comprising all risks and an indication of 
the business impact of those risks.
The risk reports are provided to the Board of Directors in 
advance of the Board meetings and are discussed by the 
Board to ensure that the risk mitigation procedures are 
compliant with the Group policy and that any new risks are 
appropriately managed.
Credit Risk
The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default 
to financial transactions by customers. The Group has focused 
on selling to a “blue chip” customer base thereby minimising 
the risk of incurring bad debts. The Group’s positions with 
these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely 
monitored.
Liquidity
At the year end the Group had £0.06m in net cash balances. 
The objective is to ensure that operating profits are turned 
into cash balances during the year. The policy is to monitor 
the cash balance and keep a positive balance.
The Group finances its operations through retained profits and 
has an overdraft facility to provide additional liquidity if 
required.
A  Revenue, Cash and cash equivalents, Cash flow from operating activities and research and development staffing 
expenditure are as extracted from the financial statements.
B Revenue growth/reduction compares the change in revenue from one year to the next expressed in percentage terms.
C  Gross Margin is the gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit and revenue are taken from the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the financial statements.
D Profit from operations is the profit from operations as a percentage of revenue.
E Profit after tax is the profit after tax as a percentage of revenue.
F  Debtor days represent the length of time taken by customers to pay their bills and Creditor days represent the length 
of time taken by the Group to pay its suppliers. The number of days outstanding has been calculated by comparing the 
outstanding balance for trade debtors and trade creditors with the average value of sales or purchases for the previous 
12 months respectively, inclusive of VAT, and multiplying by the number of days in the year.  eg solutions plc 18 Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Directors’ Responsibilities in the Preparation of the  
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected 
under company law to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of 
the Group and the Company and the financial performance of 
the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to 
such financial statements that references in the relevant part 
of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view 
are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
c. state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the EU;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the eg solutions plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. eg solutions plc 20 Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of eg solutions plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (“the financial statements”) on pages 22 to 52. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as  
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As more fully explained in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 19, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/
scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and the parent’s affairs as at 31 
January 2012 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union
• the Parent’s financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2012
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
eg solutions plc is a public limited company incorporated in England, registered number 2211062, with its registered office 
at Barn 1, Dunston Business Village, Stafford Road, Dunston, Staffordshire, ST18 9AB.
The principal activities of the Group are the development and sale of software and consultancy in the back office 
optimisation market.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS”).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost and going concern basis as discussed in the Directors’ 
Report. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Company made a profit after tax of £0.13m (2011: £0.48m) for the financial year. The Directors have taken advantage 
of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented a Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income for the Company.
Going Concern
The Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through a combination of cash inflows from sales, tight 
management of expenses and when required an overdraft facility. The overdraft facility has recently been extended to 16 
March 2013.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, which take account of both positive and negative variations in trading performance, 
show that the Group has sufficient headroom to operate within the level of its current facility. Should the facility be required 
beyond 16 March 2013 the Directors currently have no reason to believe that it will not be extended or that the Group 
could not obtain other sources of funding.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation, based on both recent past performance and the current pipeline of possible 
future business, that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Relevant Accounting Standards Issued and Effective
During the year the following relevant accounting standards have been issued and are effective but have not had a material

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 January 2012
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of eg solutions plc and the enterprises controlled by 
the Group (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
and have been rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company and 
are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits 
arising from them, are eliminated.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated 
residual value over its expected useful life, as follows:
Computer Equipment — 50% straight line
Office Equipment — 15% reducing balance
Fixtures and Fittings — 15% reducing balance
Motor Vehicles — 25% reducing balance
Leasehold Improvements — 20% straight line
Impairment of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or that has not yet been brought into use is tested 
for impairment annually.
Intangible Assets 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s software development is recognised only when all of the 
following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
• the product or process is technically and commercially viable; and 
• sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred. 
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (6 years). The 
amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and 
amortised over the estimated life of the asset. These assets include intellectual property relating to the Nuqleus product set 
and customer relationships which eg would continue to benefit from. These are amortised over their useful economic lifes 
(5 years). Our Governance

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Retirement Benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of 
the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in respect of pension costs and other post retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments at the reporting date. 
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Group, are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on 
the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign exchange reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the monthly weighted average rate of exchange for 
the period. Rand denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the reporting 
date of £1 = R12.3081. (2011: £1 = R11.4301).
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred 
tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither 
the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of provision is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. eg solutions plc 32 Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group with 
maturities of less than three months.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Share-Based Payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and 
risks. The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are 
charged as they accrue.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group has no finance 
leases.
Convertible Debt Instruments
Instruments where the holder has the option to redeem for cash or convert into a pre-determined quantity of equity 
instruments are classified as compound instruments and presented partly as a liability and partly as equity.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a 
similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue and the fair value assigned to the liability 
component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar 
non-convertible debt to the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying 
value of the convertible loan note.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use 
of accounting estimates and judgements in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements and 
estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions. 
 
Impairment of intangible assets
When testing the intangible assets for impairment, the Group considers the future contracted cash inflows from repeatable 
revenues and deducts the costs involved in servicing the repeatable revenues to give a contribution to fixed costs. The 
Group then reviews the amount of contribution to fixed costs against the amount of intangible assets held on the statement 
of financial position to determine whether an impairment needs is required. 
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised when revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are 
probable. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, 
VAT and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Maintenance Contracts
Income in respect of maintenance contracts is invoiced on an annual basis and recognised as earned. Our Governance

Software Licences
For perpetual licences revenues are recognised once the software has been fully installed. For fixed term licences revenues 
are recognised on a straight line basis.

calculated pro-rata on the number of man days completed to the estimated total project man days.

3.  OPERATING SEGMENTS
eg solutions plc provides IT and software support services by operating two distinct companies in the United Kingdom 
(“EGUK”) and in South Africa (“EGSA”). Financial information is reported to the board for both companies individually with 
revenue and operating profits split by geographical location. Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers 
and excludes finance income. Segment profit reported to the board represents the profit before tax earned by each 
segment. 
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments, the 
board reviews the non-current assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available. All assets 
and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments. Information is reported to the Board of Directors on a Company basis 
as management believe that each Company exposes the Group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to local economic 
conditions. The segment profit or loss, segment assets and segment liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts 
recognised in the financial statements, as set out in the accounting policies.
Segment information about these companies is presented below.

29.  GROUP — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk of default to financial transactions by customers, availability of 
funds to meet the Group’s needs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below. 
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives and policies are set out in the Director’s 
Report on pages 16 to 18.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures. Any proposed changes will 
be considered by the Board prior to such changes being implemented.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Liquidity Risk
Cashflow is managed on a daily, short-term and longer term basis and management is therefore able to ensure that the 
Group has sufficient cash or facilities to meet all its commitments. The Group ensures that there is sufficient cash and 
working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group from the current business plan.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed weekly by management.
The Group has an agreed overdraft facility to the 16 March 2013.
Banking covenants are monitored on a weekly basis to ensure that there are no current or potential future breaches.  
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reporting period and no breaches are foreseen over the next  
twelve months.
Market risk
Market risk includes foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Financial instruments affected by market risk are cash and cash equivalents. The following analysis, required by IFRS 7 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables being UK interest 
rates and foreign exchange risk. Our Governance

29.  GROUP — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES continued
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk through transactions with overseas customers.
The Group is however exposed to exchange fluctuations that affect the company’s net investment in its overseas subsidiary.
The impact on the Group’s net assets from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity below. 
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net assets in foreign currencies are all constant.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to the Company’s net 
investment in its overseas operation held at the reporting date. It does not reflect any change in revenue or costs that may 
result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
• UK interest rates are forecast to increase by 1%
• South African Rand will convert at 14 rand to the British Pound.
Using the above assumptions the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and equity that would result from changes in UK interest rates and in exchange rates:

Assets:
1% increase in UK interest rates — — 4 —
South African Rand to GBP convert at 14  
(2011: 14) — (20) — (79)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and is not considered to be a significant risk for the Group. The 
only interest bearing assets relate to cash and cash equivalents exposed to a floating interest rate. All other assets and 
liabilities are non interest bearing. 
Price Risk
The Group’s products are tailored to realise benefits for customers and to meet individual requirements. Prices are 
negotiated with each customer on the basis of their specification of the product.
Credit Risk 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. With eg’s exposure to the Financial 
services sector detailed reporting is provided weekly on the debt position and if required the Group will resort to legal 
action to recover any monies due after a sufficient period of time.
Capital risk 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and 
operate within current available facilities. This is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages its share capital and reserves as its Group capital. eg solutions plc 50 Annual Report & Accounts 2012

The Group has not recognised impairment provisions against the trade receivables past due summarised on page 42 as 
they are considered to be recoverable based on our customer base being largely blue chip and the previous trading history. 
There is no objective evidence that the amounts will not be collected.
The Group has not provided any amount for bad debts. (2011: £14,000).
The directors believe the quality of outstanding receivables which are neither past due nor impaired to be fully collectible.
Fair value assumptions
The fair value of all financial instruments approximate to their carrying value.
Short-term deposits – the fair value of short-term deposits and overdrafts approximates to the carrying value because of 
the short maturity of these instruments. Our Governance

they are considered to be recoverable based on our customer base being largely blue chip and the previous trading history. 
There is no objective evidence that the amounts will not be collected.
The Company has not provided any amount for bad debts (2011: Nil). 
The Directors believe the quality of outstanding receivables which are neither past due nor impaired to be fully collectible. 
Fair value assumptions
The fair value of all financial instruments approximate to their carrying value.
Short-term deposits and borrowings – the fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the 
carrying value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
31.  POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Employees are offered membership of the eg solutions Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension arrangement. The cost 
of contributions to the scheme is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that they 
arise. The contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to £144,000 (2011: £155,000) representing 3%-10% of 
pensionable salaries. The amounts outstanding at the year end were £13,000 (2011: £13,000). eg solutions plc 52 Annual Report & Accounts 2012

33.  CONvERTIBLE LOAN NOTES 
Convertible loan notes
5% Convertible loan notes were issued at par on 5 October 2010 for £142,560. 
On the second anniversary of their issue the Loan Notes are repayable or convertible into New Ordinary Shares at a share 
price of 82.5p. The Company may require holders to convert if, for at least 20 consecutive business days, the average share 
price of an ordinary share in the Company shall be 82.5p. The Noteholder Majority shall have the right to serve a 
Conversion Notice on the Company (not less than 7 Business Days prior to the second anniversary of the creation and issue 
of the Notes) to convert all of the Notes outstanding into fully paid Ordinary Shares at a price of 82.5p per Share.
If the notes are not converted they will be redeemed on the redemption date at par.
These instruments have been treated as compound financial instruments with the net proceeds received from the issue 
being split between the liability and equity. The equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to 
convert the liability into equity of the Group.

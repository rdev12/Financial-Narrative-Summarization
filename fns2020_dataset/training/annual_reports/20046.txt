COVER IMAGE: MUSÉE DU LOUVRE, PARIS
Safely maintaining the world’s
most visited museum
Lavendon’s French business was called on to supply two powered access units to
facilitate some essential building maintenance on the historic Louvre museum
in Paris. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built as a fortress
in the late 12th century under Philip II. Remnants of the original fortress are
visible in the basement of the museum. The building has been extended many
times to form the present Louvre Palace.
Using powered access for the maintenance, avoided the need for unsightly
scaffolding masking the buildings splendour. The units supplied were capable
of reaching all floors of the exterior of the building. Each unit was highly
manoeuvrable, allowing the operator to place the basket precisely where
needed, close to, but not touching the building.

Financial highlights
2     Lavendon Group plc 2014 Chairman’s statement
The Group’s results for 2014 were at the
top end of the Board’s expectations.
The growth in our revenue has delivered
improved profitability which, alongside self-
funded investment, has driven the Group’s
return on capital employed (ROCE) ahead of
our weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
for the first time since the economic
downturn in 2008 – an important strategic
milestone for the Group.
John standen Non-Executive Chairman

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Our performance in the year, in particular,
reflects the actions taken to re-energise our
UK business towards the end of 2013 and
our strategic decision to continue to deploy
additional capital into our Middle East
operations. The strength of the improvement
in performance of these two key regions in
2014 has more than compensated for the
significant exchange rate headwinds on
our overseas earnings.
The dividend increase of 30% reflects these
strong results and the Board’s confidence
in the Group’s long term future.
As in recent years, we completed another
substantial fleet investment programme in
2014, adding capacity to our Middle East
operations to meet growing demand while
continuing to refresh our European rental
fleet. The ability of the Group to increase
the scale of its investment activity in order
to strengthen and develop our market
positions, without having to re-leverage our
balance sheet, is a reflection of our robust
financial position and our capability to
generate strong operational cash flows.
This was again demonstrated during the
year, as the operational cash flows fully
funded our investment programme and
also enabled a further modest reduction
to be made to the Group’s net debt level.
During the year we reviewed our debt
financing arrangements to ensure that
they properly reflected the strengthened
financial position of the Group. As a result,
we have extended the maturity and
reduced the cost of our bank facilities
while also increasing the overall size of the
facilities available. These facilities provide
the Group with a medium to long term
diversified financing package with
significant liquidity to support the growth
plans of the Group in the coming years.
Our strategic focus on developing our
strong market positions with a
differentiated service offering to drive
both revenue growth and better margins
is delivering the expected improvement
in the Group’s financial performance.
We have underpinned our ability to
maintain this momentum going forward by
ensuring that additional capital is readily
available to support both our immediate
growth plans and to respond to attractive
opportunities as they develop in the
marketplace. We have also strengthened
the breadth and depth of our
management teams, particularly in the
UK and the Middle East, and substantially
completed the roll out of the Group’s
standardised IT platform.
We are confident the continued delivery
of revenue growth, combined with our
improved operational efficiency established
in recent years, will generate substantial
shareholder value in the medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year was 11.9%,
a marked improvement over the 10.6%
reported for 2013.
The calculation of ROCE is based on the
Group’s operating profit before exceptional
items and the average of the opening and
closing capital employed for the year of
£313.7 million (2013: £300.8 million).
The ROCE of 11.9% is stated on a like
for like basis with the prior year, and
therefore ignores this year’s favourable
impact on the Group’s capital employed
arising from the impairment of the
carrying value of the goodwill in the Group’s
Belgian business. The impact of this
impairment reduces the Group’s capital
employed and increases the reported ROCE
for 2014 to 12.1% (2013: 10.6%).
Dividend
Given the Group’s strong financial
performance and cash flows in the year,
the Board is proposing a final dividend of
3.20 pence per share, making the total
dividend for the year 4.60 pence, an increase
of 30% over the previous year (2013: a total
dividend of 3.55 pence). The final dividend,
if approved, will be paid on 23 April 2015 to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 6 March 2015.
The proposed increase in the dividend not
only reflects the financial performance of
the Group in the year but also the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s future and the
continued recognition that dividends are
an important means of delivering
shareholder value.
Dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2014 and underlying
earnings per share, has reduced to 3.4
times (2013: 4.0 times) in line with our
stated intention to maintain dividend
distributions within a range that is covered
three to four times by earnings. The actual
dividend cover in any one year will be
balanced against the Group’s investment
needs and funding requirements as we
move through the business cycle.
Financial results
Group total revenues increased by 7% to
£253.1 million at constant currency rates
(2013: £237.5 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 6% to £238.3 million on the
same basis (2013: £225.3 million). At actual
exchange rates, total revenues and rental
revenues increased by 4% and 3% to £246.3
million and £231.9 million respectively.
Chairman’s statement
Continued
4     Lavendon Group plc 2014
The Group’s results for 2014 were at the
top end of the Board’s expectations.
The growth in our revenue has delivered
improved profitability which, alongside self-funded
investment, has driven the Group’s return on
capital employed (ROCE) ahead of our weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) for the first time
since the economic downturn in 2008 – an
important strategic milestone for the Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014     5
This revenue growth, combined with our
improved operational efficiency, increased
the Group’s underlying operating profits by
15% to £40.6 million (2013: £35.3 million)
at constant currencies, with margins
improving to 16% (2013: 15%). At actual
exchange rates, underlying operating
profits increased by 11% to £39.3 million,
with margins improving to 16%. This
improved performance has been
delivered despite the impact of year
on year foreign exchange rate
movements that have reduced the
Group’s underlying operating profits
by c.£1.3 million in 2014.
The improved trading performance and
a marginal reduction in the Group’s
net interest costs to £5.2 million (2013:
£5.3 million) enabled the Group’s
underlying profit before tax to increase
by 18% to £35.3 million (2013: £30.0
million) at constant currencies. At actual
exchange rates, the Group’s underlying
profit before tax increased by 14% to
£34.1 million.
Although the Group’s underlying effective
tax rate increased to 23% (2013: 20%),
underlying profit after tax increased by 13%
to £27.3 million (2013: £24.1 million) and
earnings per share increased by 12% to
16.21 pence per share (2013: 14.42 pence)
at constant currencies. At actual exchange
rates, the Group’s underlying profit after
tax and earnings per share increased to
£26.4 million and 15.65 pence per
share respectively.
Amortisation* charges for the year were
£2.0 million (2013: £3.3 million) and
exceptional items totalled £11.1 million
(2013: £3.3 million). The exceptional
items relate to an £8.8 million non-cash
impairment charge on the carrying
value of the goodwill associated with
the Group’s Belgian business, a non-cash
provision of £1.3 million to cover the
closure costs of the Group’s Indian
operation and fees of £1.0 million
associated with the Group’s refinancing
of its bank facilities in August 2014.
After amortisation* charges and
exceptional items, the Group’s operating
profits were £27.2 million (2013: £28.7
million), profit before tax was £21.0 million
(2013: £23.4 million) and profit after tax
was £13.9 million (2013: £19.1 million),
with earnings per share of 8.23 pence
per share (2013: 11.41 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 8% to £82.1 million (2013:
£76.2 million) at constant currencies with
margins at 32% (2013: 32%). At actual
exchange rates, EBITDA for the year
increased to £79.6 million.
The Group’s cash generated from
operations improved to £26.8 million (2013:
£25.5 million) despite the increased net
cash outflow relating to the purchase and
sale of rental fleet assets of £41.6 million
(2013: £39.9 million). Net cash generated
from operating activities, after payment of
interest and tax, increased to £13.6 million
(2013: £12.3 million).
Investment
In 2014, and as planned, the Group
increased the level of investment in its
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
to £64.7 million (2013: £55.1 million). As in
previous years, this was partly funded by
the disposal of surplus or retired assets
which generated £11.6 million in the year
(2013: £10.5 million). After reflecting
movements in amounts owing to
equipment suppliers at the beginning
and end of the year, this investment
programme resulted in a net cash outflow
for the year of £45.6 million (2013:
£44.9 million) which was again fully funded
from our operating cash flows. This ability
to self-fund our investment programme
demonstrates the extent of the Group’s
cash generation capabilities.
Due to the timing of fleet deliveries in the
second half of the year, amounts owing to
equipment suppliers at the end of 2014
showed a year on year increase of £7.5
million. This had a favourable impact on the
Group’s net debt level at the year end which
will unwind during the first quarter of 2015.
Our investment programme has principally
been directed towards replacing
approximately 7% of the Group’s rental fleet
and adding further capacity to our Middle
East operations to meet the continued
growth in demand that we see in the
region. Over the past three years, some
29% of the Group’s rental fleet has been
refreshed, ensuring that it remains well
invested and highly competitive to support
our strong market positions.
Refinancing
In August 2014 we refinanced the Group’s
existing bank facilities, originally scheduled
to be renewed in July 2016, and extended
them to July 2019 at a lower margin cost.
In addition, the Group also issued two new
loan notes on the US Private Placement
market with a total value of €35 million.
Following the refinancing, the Group’s debt
facilities total c.£175 million and comprise
revolving bank facilities of £50 million
and €60 million together with US Private
Placements with a combined value of
€95 million (being loan notes of €60 million,
€17.5 million and €17.5 million maturing in
July 2019, August 2021 and August 2024
respectively). These new debt facilities
provide additional liquidity headroom of
c.£28 million over the Group’s previous
funding structure.
Net debt
With our strong operating cash flows
being more than sufficient to fund the
capital expenditure programme
undertaken during the year, together with
a favourable foreign exchange movement
of £5.0 million on our Euro-denominated
debt, the Group’s net debt level at the
year end reduced by £7.1 million to
£90.6 million (2013: £97.7 million).
Adjusting for the unamortised costs of
£0.9 million relating to the Group’s US
Private Placements, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2014 was
£89.7 million (2013: £97.0 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
improved to 41% (2013: 46%) and our
net debt to pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio
reduced to 1.13 times (1.27 times). The
Group continues to operate comfortably
within our preferred leverage range of
between 1.00 -1.75 times EBITDA.

Board changes
As previously reported, Jan Åstrand, who
had been the Group’s Senior Independent
Director and Chairman of our Remuneration
Committee since 2010, resigned from the
Board with effect from 26 February 2014.
Andrew Wood became the Group’s Senior
Independent Director with effect from
the same date.
With effect from 1 March 2014, John
Coghlan and John Wyatt were appointed to
the Board as Non-Executive Directors, with
John Coghlan becoming Chairman of the
Group’s Remuneration Committee.
Summary and outlook
The Group has delivered a strong
underlying performance in 2014, at the
top end of the Board’s expectations, with
revenues, profits, margins and ROCE all
increasing year on year. This progress has
been delivered despite significant exchange
rate headwinds of c.£1.3 million on our
overseas earnings, clearly demonstrating
the strength of the Group’s overall financial
performance in the year.
During 2014 we have seen particularly
strong results from our key UK and Middle
East regions; the major factors in driving
the Group’s ROCE ahead of our WACC for
the first time since 2008. The achievement
of this important strategic milestone
demonstrates the clear progress that has
been delivered in recent years towards
our goal of maintaining the Group’s
average ROCE above its WACC over the
business cycle.
The Group’s investment programme in the
year was primarily directed towards the
continued refreshment of the Group’s
rental fleet and adding further revenue
generating capacity to our Middle East
operations to support the growth in
demand that we are continuing to see
in this region.
As we move into 2015, we are planning a
net capital expenditure programme of
c.£55 million, slightly ahead of that in 2014,
and again directed towards the continued
refreshment of our fleet and the further
expansion of our Middle East operations.
The Group’s capability to generate strong
operating cash flows, together with our
robust balance sheet and increased debt
facilities, provide the necessary flexibility for
us to accelerate the scale and pace of this
investment should attractive growth
opportunities emerge or the conditions in
our markets warrant the deployment of
additional capital as the year progresses.
The Group’s financial performance has
benefited from revenue growth which, given
our efficient cost base, has driven our
improved profitability. The efficiency created
within our cost structure in recent years is
reflected within our employee base, where
a 6% growth in employees since 2010 has
delivered a 17% growth in revenues and
driven a 63% growth in our operating
profits. Our focus is to build on this
momentum, add scale to the business, and
continue the disciplined management of our
processes to enable our inherent operating
leverage to deliver attractive incremental
margins and so underpin the performance
of the Group in the coming years.
Since the year end, further growth in the
Middle East is offsetting the impact of a
year on year revenue decline currently
being seen in the UK. Our overall margins
are continuing to improve such that the
Board expects the Group to perform
slightly ahead of its expectations for the
year as a whole.

Drivers of the use of powered access equipment
safety: Increased focus on safety in the workplace, supported 
by ever more stringent Health and Safety legislation, accelerating the
substitution of older traditional methods of access.
efficiency: Escalating costs and shortage of skilled labour in the
construction and refurbishment sectors, driving the need for tools 
to maximise productivity.
construction processes: Commercial pressure to reduce
project timescales, where speed, convenience, efficiency and safety are
prime concerns. The increasing modularisation of construction processes,
which tends to produce a greater demand for access equipment on
construction sites.
What is powered access?
A range of equipment
designed to enable people 
to work safely, productively
and efficiently at height.
Also known as aerial work
platforms (AWP’s) or mobile
elevating work platforms
(MEWP’s).
Attractive alternative to older
traditional access methods
such as ladders, mobile access
towers and scaffolding.
there are four broad
categories of powered 
access equipment:

• Diesel
• Outdoor
• Operator provided or self drive
• Example applications:
Television and media (e.g. outside broadcast)
Operating 
height to:
85m
Why is powered 
access equipment rented?
cost: The equipment has a relatively
high capital cost and there are also
stringent transport and maintenance
requirements.
r ange: A range of equipment
would be required to satisfy all
applications.
Utilisation: The need for the
equipment tends to be infrequent 
and inconsistent due to varying 
work schedules and applications.
in summary: The combination 
of the drivers of demand and the
efficiencies gained from the rental of the
equipment, should, we believe, continue
to enable the market to grow in the
coming years, subject to prevailing
economic conditions. The competitive
environments that we experience vary
from country to country. However, 
a consistent feature is that the markets
are highly competitive, serviced
operations ranging from divisions of
public companies, through private equity
backed ventures, to privately owned
family businesses, with the construction
sector an important market and
particularly sensitive to pricing levels.

priorities
The Group primarily operates in the
main European markets and high
growth territories in the Middle East.
We are present in the following
countries: Bahrain, Belgium, France,
Germany, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, UK and the UAE. 
The Group seeks to become a market
leading powered access provider in
each of its chosen markets.
Our customers are diverse, engaged
in sectors spanning Construction,
Facilities Management, Infrastructure
& Utilities, Industrial, Energy, Gas and
Oil, Film, Television and Media.
The use of powered access continues
to expand through increasing
penetration of our existing markets
and the development of new
applications to meet customer
requirements.
We deal with customers of all sizes
from global businesses, multinational
blue chip’s, national, regional, privately
owned companies and sole traders.
The period of hire of our machines
also varies between regions. Across
Europe the average period of hire is
approximately two weeks, while in the
Middle East region the average hire
period is around six months.
After safety, our customers
consistently rank the following as their
key priorities when hiring powered
access equipment: technical support,
equipment reliability, availability of
fleet, ease of ordering, price, on time
delivery and staff friendliness.
We have aligned our business
model, processes and practices to
ensure we meet customer
expectations in these areas.

We develop our depot network within
each market to ensure we are able to
offer a nationwide service to our
customer base. As an alternative to
providing nationwide coverage, we
may adapt our approach to achieving
a market leading position by
concentrating on specific sectors or
regions within a market.
We also undertake projects outside
of our main markets, if the project
scale, duration and financial returns
are attractive.
In recent years a new market for low
level access machines has developed.
Due to increasing safety requirements
even routine internal maintenance
is now conducted using small powered
access machines.
The commercial, industrial and
infrastructure construction sectors are
the largest markets we serve. These
markets are inherently cyclical and
therefore we seek to mitigate our
exposure by developing sectors which
offer more predictive demand cycles. 
In all cases customer enquiries are
routed through our teams of skilled
Hire Desk Controllers, who match
the appropriate fleet asset to the
customers needs.
Larger businesses are handled by our
national account teams, who have
specialist sector knowledge and skills
for more complex arrangements.
Safety is THE key concern of our
customers. As well as providing a
full range of industry leading training
on the use of the equipment, the
Group’s BlueSky Solutions Team have
developed a number of products
to enhance safety when using
powered access equipment.
These safety attachments are now
being increasingly demanded by
customers and leading manufacturers
of powered access equipment.

Operational
structure
The Group is organised into country
based business units supported by Group
service functions.
The business units (“BU’s”) are responsible
for serving customers, managing their
workforce, while delivering on their financial
operational plans and strategies. They are
supported by Group standards, platforms
and processes.
The BU’s operate in their respective territories
through a network of depots, which optimise
Our services
The Group’s engineering function
delivers ‘best in class’ fleet maintenance
across the business with a professional
culture reinforced by our Technical
Excellence (“Tech-X”) programme. 
Tech-X has been an integral part of the
Group’s engineering function since its
launch in 2008. As a result, the reliability
of the fleet has consistently improved
over the years. Every depot is audited to
ensure it has adhered to the Tech-X
standards. In 2014 we moved the bar
higher, as a new tougher gold standard
Our people
Our workforce is engaged and motivated to
deliver high levels of customer service and
professionalism that differentiates us from
the marketplace.
We have adopted a framework and
philosophy that governs our approach to
employee management and development
across the Group. It guides our managers in
employee selection and then provides a
modular programme to ensure the
necessary knowledge and skills are
developed quickly to enable the employee
to undertake their role with confidence.
Our fleet
Lavendon operates a large fleet of
almost 20,000 powered access units
across its operations in Europe and
the Middle East.
The fleet is held, serviced and despatched
from our network of depots. Each
machine is serviced, tested and
maintained by our own engineers to the
highest standards to ensure it is safe and
reliable when delivered to the customer.
Each machine undergoes a full
independent inspection by a qualified
third party at least annually. Typically the

Current products such as SkySiren help
safeguard against operator entrapment,
while our upgraded SkySentry product
restricts access to the machines by
unqualified operators and allows the
machine’s location and usage

Maintaining a clear strategic direction
In the previous Annual Report I set out the
vision for the future of Lavendon and a
roadmap to achieve our primary strategic
aim to deliver a ROCE greater than our
WACC over the business cycle.
I am pleased to report that the Group
achieved a ROCE of 11.9%

(2013: 10.6%) 
for the year, almost a full percentage point
ahead of our current WACC.

Update on strategic plan
In the 2013 Annual Report I set out the
road map for the future:
*Stated on a like for like basis with the prior year,
and therefore ignores the favourable impact of the
Group’s capital employed this year arising from the
impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill
in the Group’s Belgian business.
Up to 2013 we were focused on
improving standards and optimising the
Group’s operations, in a phase I termed
‘Fit for the Future’.
By the close of 2013 we had delivered on
our promises and secured significant
financial benefits for the Group.
As we moved into 2014, we commenced
the next phase of development, where
we strive for operational excellence, to
become ‘Best in Class’.
Progress during 2014
The Group has continued to take
significant steps in line with these plans
and I outline some of the key changes
in this report.
We have introduced customer experience
management software in all locations that
provides a continuous net promoter score,
by country, region and depot. This sets out
a framework for follow-up on customer
complaints and also highlights occasions
where the Group or its staff have exceeded
the customer expectation.
As a safety first business, all of the Group
business units regularly report on their
accident frequency rate (“AFR”). The AFR is
used to monitor our performance with
regard to “lost time” accidents where as a
result an employee or a contractor has to
take three or more days off work as a
result. I am pleased to report that we
beat our target of 0.64 accidents per
100,000 hours worked, achieving an
actual result of 0.52 (2013: 0.69).
Our BlueSky Solutions business has
continued to make progress. Hire days of
our market leading SkySiren product rose
by 18% in 2014. We also make this product
available for sale to the wider market
through an agreement with an equipment
manufacturer. The global availability of this
secondary guarding technology should aid
the working at height experience of many
end users worldwide.
With Tech-X, the Group’s technical
excellence programme, we have seen the
number of gold standard depots rise from
29 in 2013 to 44 by the close of 2014.
Disappointingly employee turnover has
increased from 19% from 18% in the prior
year, with ‘normalised’ employee turnover,
after removing the impact of restructuring,
increasing to 11% from 10% in 2014.
Investigation and action to address the
causes behind the increased voluntary
turnover is being taken to improve
retention in the coming year. Improving
employment market conditions in the UK,
in particular relating to engineering staff,
has no doubt influenced the level of
employee turnover in the year.
A stable, well trained and motivated
employee base remains a keystone in
improving the overall performance of
the Group.
Finally we have invested over £60m
(2013 £50m) in the rental fleet during
the year. Once again expanding the
fleets in our French and Middle East
businesses, while continuing the
refreshment of a significant part of
our European rental fleet.
Financial performance
Our financial performance in the year is
described in the ‘Financial Review’ on
page 26. However, in summary, the Group
increased revenues, profit and margins
over 2013, and I am pleased to report that
the Group achieved a ROCE of 11.9%*
(2013: 10.6%) for the full year, almost a
full percentage point ahead of our
current WACC.
Strategic priorities
Our long term vision is for Lavendon
Group to become a market leading
powered access rental business in our
selected geographies, placing safe access
solutions at the heart of what we do.
Having made good progress in 2014
toward this vision, our strategic priorities
for the coming years, look to build on
this momentum.
The achievement of ROCE greater than
WACC on average across the business cycle
remains our primary strategic objective,
reinforcing the disciplines of the last
three years.

Sign and lighting installation
case study
Bringing Christmas sparkle to Regent Street
The UK’s Specialist Vehicle division was recently utilised to
help transform London’s Regent Street by assisting with
the installation of the annual Christmas lighting display.
Working with an installation company, we provided two 38 metre operated truck
mounted platforms over three weeks of night time installations to help create this
world famous festive display.
The versatility of truck mounted platforms enabled our operators to drive the
machines in and out of location easily, as well as manoeuvring once in situ. This was
a key requirement for this job due to the limitations of working in one of London’s
busiest thoroughfares, which could not be closed for the installation.
The truck mounts have a working height of 38 meters and a significant horizontal
outreach of 27 meters which allowed the operators to span across the street from
one side to the other. In total 27 lines of lights were hung along a one mile stretch
of Regent Street. 20   Lavendon Group plc 2014

The Board uses a range 
of Key Performance
Indicators (“KPIs”) to assess
performance. 
These include strategic KPIs
which measure how we are
meeting our objectives and
are also used in determining
performance payments to 
the executive directors and
senior management team.
Financial KPIs measure the
overall performance of the
business and are aligned 
with those commonly used 
by shareholders. 
Non-financial KPIs also form 
a key part in monitoring our
strategic progress as well as
being of importance to our 
wider stakeholders.

Review of financial
performance by region
A summary of the revenues, underlying
operating profit and margins for each of
the Group’s regions is given above.
We have structured the Group so that
each country business unit is viewed as a
separate profit centre within the combined
geographic region, supported by central
Group service functions. Each business
unit or region has its own management
team responsible for delivering agreed
performance targets.
The performance of each region in the
year is described below with all financial
figures being underlying trading stated
before amortisation* charges and
exceptional items. Where revenues and
revenue growth percentages are given,
they relate to rental revenues only and
exclude revenues derived from the sale
of new and ex-rental fleet equipment.
For the Group’s overseas operations, figures
are quoted in local currencies, unless
otherwise stated, to remove the impact of
movements in foreign exchange rates and
ensure a like for like comparison with the
previous year (for the Middle East, the US
dollar has been used as a proxy for the
basket of Middle East currencies). The split of
revenues by country between rental
revenues and revenues from the sale of new
and ex-rental fleet equipment is given in
Note 2 ‘Segmental Analysis’ on page 82.
UK
(48% of Group rental revenues)
The UK performed strongly in the year
with rental revenues increasing by 7% to
£111.1 million (2013: £103.4 million). This
revenue growth, delivered from a more
efficient cost base, drove a 24% increase in
operating profits to £20.4 million (2013:
£16.5 million), with margins improving to
17.0% (2013: 15.0%).
The strength of the revenue growth in the
year reflects the combined effects of a
c.6% year on year pricing improvement and
a more favourable mix of fleet on hire that
more than absorbed the expected marginal
decline in volumes seen in the year. As
previously reported, the decline in volumes
over the prior year is a reflection of the shift
in the mix of fleet on hire, away from
smaller units with a lower average hire rate
towards larger construction orientated
machines that produce higher average
revenues per hire. The influence of the
change in fleet mix was most prevalent
during the second half of the year, although
it is expected to diminish as the business
moves through the first half of 2015.
The results for 2014 reflect actions towards
the end of 2013, to restructure the business
to better align our sales processes with our
customers and to place greater emphasis
on our differentiated service offering.
We strengthened the UK management
team as we moved into 2014 to re-energise
the business and support the delivery of
our revenue growth targets. During the
year, the operational leverage derived from
our strong revenue growth was enhanced
by securing further efficiencies through
better procurement processes. The process
of identifying opportunities to deliver a
more efficient service or cost structure
continues to be an area of managerial
focus, illustrated by our recent decision to
outsource the UK’s transport function to a
third party provider in order to improve our
service to customers. As in recent years,
the UK’s fleet replacement programme
continued with a further 9% of the rental
fleet being refreshed during the year,
thereby improving the fleet mix and our
capacity to generate increased revenues.
The combination of a well invested fleet
and a customer service offering that goes
beyond that of pure rental of equipment is
underpinning our strong market position,
ensuring the UK business is well placed to
make further progress in the coming year.
Middle East
(21% of Group rental revenues)
Our Middle East region performed very
strongly in the year, delivering a 15% growth
in rental revenues to $79.5 million (2013:
$69.1 million) and increasing operating
profits to $25.9 million (2013: $21.9 million)
with margins improving to 31.7% (2013:
30.7%). On conversion to Sterling, rental
revenues increased by 9% to £48.2 million
(2013: £44.1 million) and operating profits
were £15.7 million (2013: £14.0 million).
This strong performance has been mainly
volume driven although some further
modest pricing improvement was secured
across the year, particularly in our main
market of Saudi Arabia. We continued to
expand our rental fleet, adding c.400 units
during the year, in order to support our
revenue growth plans and further strengthen
our market leading position in the region.
Whilst the decline in the oil price over the
last 12 months may temper the pace of
investment in oil and gas related projects
in the region going forward, we are not
currently experiencing any direct impact on
our activity levels. The main sectors in the
region driving current demand for our
equipment are the infrastructure and non-
oil and gas related construction markets.
Several key long term projects in these
markets are already underway and will
progress through 2015, offering a degree of
resilience against any oil price pressures.

Strategic report
Financial review continued
Whilst we are planning to allocate additional
capital into the region in the coming year,
this will continue to be done in a controlled
manner to ensure we retain flexibility and
are able to respond accordingly to changes
in market conditions should they occur.
As a Group we have operated in the region
since 1996, developing the business
organically over the past 18 years, and we
firmly believe that the outlook for the Middle
East region remains very encouraging.
We have strengthened our management
team and infrastructure during the year to
underpin our short and medium term
growth plans, ensuring we are well placed
to benefit from the continuing opportunities
as they emerge across the region.
In order to concentrate our resources on
delivering the potential available in the Gulf
States, the Board has decided to close our
Indian operation. The closure costs are
estimated at £1.3 million and have been
provided as an exceptional charge in 2014.
Continental Europe
(31% of Group rental revenues)
Against generally difficult market conditions,
our overall rental revenues in the region
declined in the year by 2% to €90.0 million
(2013: €91.6 million), with the strong
revenue growth in France proving
insufficient to absorb the revenue declines
seen in Belgium and Germany. Operating
profits for the region were €11.3 million
(2013: €11.8m) with operating margins at
11.9% (2013: 12.3%). The decline in overall
profitability was due to the trading
performance in Belgium which more than
offset the improved profitability reported in
France and Germany. It is notable that the
profitability of our German business
improved despite the decline in revenues
and that reflects the establishment of a
more efficient cost base from which better
margins are now being generated.
On conversion to Sterling, Continental
Europe’s rental revenues declined by 7% to
£72.6 million (2013: £77.8 million) and
operating profits were £9.1 million (2013:
£10.1 million).
The individual performances of the
countries within our Continental Europe
region are discussed below:
Germany
German rental revenues for the year
declined by 3% overall to €48.5 million
(2013: €50.0 million) although revenues
returned to year on year growth in the final
quarter of 3%. Despite the revenue decline
in the year, by tightly controlling the cost
base, particularly reducing the reliance on
rehiring equipment from third parties, the
business improved its operating leverage
and delivered an operating profit of €4.8
million (2013: €4.5 million) with a margin of
9.4% (2013: 8.5%). On conversion to
Sterling, rental revenues declined by 8% to
£39.1million (2013: £42.5 million) and
operating profits were stable at £3.8 million
(2013: £3.8 million).
Market conditions remained competitive
throughout the year, leading to overall
volume and pricing declines of almost 2%
and 4% respectively mitigated in part by a
more favourable mix of fleet on hire. It is
encouraging that in the final quarter of the
year, both volumes and pricing returned
to year on year growth, albeit against
relatively weak comparators.
In the second half of the year, the business
was reorganised into local reporting units, so
that a more focused approach to customer
service and asset management could be
adopted. There are early signs that this
revised organisational structure is proving
more effective, supporting our drive to
increase market share and revenues in order
to leverage our more efficient cost base and
so deliver a better financial performance.
France
Our French business grew strongly across
the year with rental revenues increasing by
8% to €27.4 million (2013: €25.3 million).
The revenue performance was principally
driven by growth in volumes across the first
half and modest pricing improvements
secured in the second half of the year.
Our success in growing our revenue base
over recent years strengthens our belief
that we are continuing to build local share
in a market that is yet to show any signs of
a sustained recovery.
During the year, management successfully
implemented the Group’s standard IT
platform, and continued to invest in
additional resources to support the
business’ ability to secure and service
revenue growth. Whilst this increase in the
cost structure of the business has no doubt
constrained margins to a degree in the
short term, the strong revenue growth that
this investment supports has enabled
operating profits in the year to increase to
€4.3 million (2013: €3.8 million) with
margins improving to 15.1% (2013: 14.5%).
We intend to continue to provide additional
capital to our French business to ensure
that it is well positioned to achieve both
its growth ambitions in 2015 and ultimately
to benefit from any future recovery in
market conditions.
On conversion to Sterling, rental revenues
increased by 3% to £22.1million (2013:
£21.5 million) and operating profits were
£3.5 million (2013: £3.2 million).
Belgium
Belgian rental revenues declined by 13% in
the year to €14.1 million (2013: €16.2 million),
reflecting a year on year volume decline
following the completion of a major project in
the first quarter of the year, where activity on
that project was at its peak in 2013.
The difficult trading conditions seen in
recent years continued through 2014, with
pricing pressures influencing competitive
behaviour. Our business saw pricing reduce
by c.5% in the year albeit on an improving
trend as the year progressed. In response
to this market environment, we have
actively managed both the fleet size,
reducing it by c.15% across the year, and
the operational cost base.
Despite the actions taken by management
in the year to mitigate the impact of the
revenue decline, operating profits reduced
to €2.2 million (2013: €3.6 million) with
margins declining sharply to 14.3% (2013:
19.7%). On conversion to Sterling, rental
revenues declined by 17% to £11.4million
(2013: £13.8 million) and operating profits
were £1.8 million (2013: £3.0 million).
Given this weaker trading performance,
the Group’s carrying value of the goodwill
associated with the Belgium business has
been reviewed for impairment at the year
end and, as a consequence, an exceptional
impairment charge of €11.0 million has
been made in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014   29
Financial review of 2014
The review of the Group’s financial
performance is based principally on what
we term the ‘underlying’ business
performance. This measure excludes
amortisation* charges, exceptional items
and movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives. We believe that the use of
underlying results aids the comparison with
prior years and the understanding of the
Group’s financial performance.
A summary of the Group’s financial
performance for 2014, at actual exchange
rates, with a comparison against 2013,
is set out in the table opposite.
The impact of the year on year movement
in average exchange rates for the Group’s
main trading currencies (principally Sterling,
Euros and a number of Middle Eastern
currencies), was to reduce revenues, profits
and earnings in 2014 by up to 3.5%. The
results discussed in this ‘Financial review of
2014’ are based on actual exchange rates
for both 2014 and 2013.
Group revenues for the year increased by 4%
to £246.3 million (2013: £237.5 million). The
split of these revenues between the Group’s
regions is given in the charts opposite.
These revenues are principally derived from
the rental of our equipment fleet, but also
include revenues from the sale of new
equipment and from the disposal of ex-
rental fleet units. The split of revenues
between each of these channels, compared
to 2013, is shown in the table below.
Rental revenue is shown net of discounts
and value added tax but includes income

Dividends
The Group is proposing a final dividend of
3.20 pence per share making a total
dividend for the year of 4.60 pence, an
increase of 30% over the previous year
(2013: 3.55 pence). The final dividend, if
approved, will be paid on 23 April 2015 to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business of 6 March 2015. The Group’s
dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2014 and underlying
earnings per share, has been reduced to
3.4 times (2013: 4.0 times) in line with our
stated intention to maintain our dividend
cover within the range of three to four
times by earnings.
Cash flow, investment and acquisitions
A summary of the Group’s cash flows for
the year is shown in the chart opposite.
During the year, the Group generated
£68.4 million of cash from operations after
movements in working capital and the
payment of exceptional items but prior to
the purchase and sale of rental assets
(2013: £65.4 million).
A total of £64.7 million was invested in the
maintenance and expansion of the Group’s
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
(2013: £55.1 million). This investment
was partly funded by the sale of surplus
and retired assets which generated
£11.6 million in cash (2013: £10.5 million).
After movements in amounts owed to
equipment suppliers at the beginning and
end of the year of £7.5 million, the net
capital expenditure for the year was
£45.6 million as shown in the chart
opposite. The amount owed to equipment
suppliers at the end of the year increased
to £17.6 million (2013: £10.1 million), due
to the timing of fleet deliveries in the
second half of the year. This had a
favourable impact on the Group’s net debt
level at the year end which will unwind
during the first quarter of 2015.
Balance sheet and
movements in net debt
The Group’s balance sheet is summarised
on the opposite page.
The Group’s net assets increased by 4%
to £220.6 million (2013: £211.2 million)
with net assets per share increasing to
equipment, provision of fuel, charging of
damage waiver fees and the sale of spare
parts. The income derived from the rental
of machines is determined by the interplay
of several factors: size of rental fleet, mix of
machine types within the fleet, utilisation of
the fleet, hire period and rental rates
achieved. The importance, or weighting, of
each of these factors can change by week
or by month as the year progresses due to
normal seasonal patterns of demand or
changing customer workloads.
As shown in the table on the previous page,
rental revenues for the year increased by
3% to £231.9 million (2013: £225.3 million)
while revenues derived from the sale of
new equipment and ex-rental fleet units
increased by £0.8 million and £1.4 million
respectively. The revenues from the sale
of ex-rental fleet units increased to
£11.6 million, as the Group continued an
investment programme that released
c.2,000 machines for disposal during the
year and also sold the majority of its non-
powered access fleet into a re-hire
agreement with a third party. The increased
level of sales of new equipment reflects
the unpredictable nature of this revenue
stream whereby it can fluctuate significantly
in percentage terms from year to year.
The Group’s costs are largely fixed in
nature in the short to medium term, with
significant movements in the cost base,
outside of acquisitions, mainly being
determined by either depot openings and
closures, or fleet expansion or contraction.
This feature of our business amplifies the
effect of any small movements in revenue
on the profitability of the Group, as there is
little associated increase or decrease in our
cost base in the short term. This impact is
often referred to as “operational leverage”.
The two main cost areas of the business
are employee costs and depreciation.
During 2014, employee costs, excluding
redundancy costs, increased to £68.0
million (2013: £60.2 million) and, as a
percentage of rental revenues, these costs
increased to 29.3% (2013: 26.7%).
Depreciation reduced to £39.3 million in
the year (2013: £40.9 million) reflecting a
marginal reduction in the annual charge
and a £1.1 million year on year exchange
rate movement which, when combined
with increased rental revenues, reduced
depreciation as a percentage of rental
revenues to 16.9% (2013: 18.2%).
Underlying trading performance
The Group’s underlying EBITDA for the year
increased to £79.6 million (2013: £76.2
million) with margins stable at 32% (2013:
32%). Underlying operating profits
increased by 11% to £39.3 million (2013:
£35.3 million) with margins improving to
16% (2013: 15%). The improvement in both
underlying EBITDA and operating profits
reflect the strong performances from the
Group’s key regions of the UK and the
Middle East which were able to more than
compensate for the weaker trading
performance seen in the Group’s
Continental European region.
Underlying net interest charges for the year
reduced marginally to £5.2 million (2013:
£5.3 million) reflecting the reduction in net
debt levels of the Group across both 2013
and 2014, and the benefit of lower interest
rates being charged on those borrowings.
After interest charges, the Group’s
underlying profit before tax increased by
14% to £34.1 million (2013: £30.0 million).
With an effective tax rate of 23% (2013:
20%), the Group’s underlying profit after tax
was £26.4 million (2013: £24.1 million).
The Group’s underlying earnings per share
increased by 9% to 15.65 pence per share
(2013: 14.42 pence).
Statutory trading performance
Amortisation* charges were £2.0 million for
the year (2013: £3.3 million). The Group
incurred exceptional items of £11.1 million
(2013: £3.3 million) during the year, reflecting
an £8.8 million non-cash impairment charge
on the carrying value of the goodwill
associated with the Group’s Belgian business,
a non-cash provision of £1.3 million to cover
the closure costs of the Group’s Indian
operation and fees of £1.0 million associated
with the Group’s refinancing of its bank
facilities in August 2014.
After amortisation charges and exceptional
items, the Group produced an operating
profit of £27.2 million (2013: £28.7 million), a
profit before tax of £21.0 million (2013: £23.4
million) and a profit after tax of £13.9 million
(2013: £19.1 million) with earnings per share
of 8.23 pence (2013: 11.41 pence).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014   31

£1.31 (2013: £1.26). The main movements
in the balance sheet were:
• the impairment charge on the carrying
value of the goodwill associated with the
Group’s Belgian business
• the amortisation of intangible assets
partially offset by investments made in
computer systems
• investments in property, plant and
equipment, partly offset by depreciation
• an increase in current assets (principally
trade receivables) mainly due to the
revenue growth in the Middle East region
during the year, partly offset by a lower
cash balance at the end of the year
• an increase in current liabilities principally
due to higher amounts owing to
equipment suppliers (capital creditors)
than in the previous year
• a decrease in non-current liabilities
following the repayment of longer
term debt
Although, as planned, the level of capital
expenditure increased during the year, the
Group’s strong cash flows were more than
sufficient to fund this investment and,
together with a favourable foreign exchange
movement of £5.0 million, enabled net debt
to be reduced to £90.6 million (2013: £97.7
million). Adjusting for the unamortised costs
of £0.9 million relating to the Group’s US
Private Placements, the Group’s reported
net debt position at 31 December 2014
was £89.7 million (2013: £97.0 million). The
corresponding net debt to underlying
EBITDA ratio improved to 1.13 times (2013:
1.27 times) and the net debt to equity ratio
reduced to 41% (2013: 46%). This level of
debt is well supported by operational cash
flows and significant headroom is available
against all bank covenants.
In August 2014, we refinanced the Group’s
existing bank facilities, originally scheduled
to be renewed in July 2016, extending them
to July 2019 at a lower margin cost. At the
same time, the Group issued two additional
loan notes on the US Private Placement
market for a total value of €35 million. The
first loan note of €17.5 million will mature in
August 2021 and the second loan note, also
of €17.5 million, will mature in August 2024.
Following the refinancing, the Group’s debt 32   Lavendon Group plc 2014
Strategic report
Financial review continued
facilities total c.£175 million and comprise
revolving bank facilities of £50 million and
€60 million together with US Private
Placements with a combined value of
€95 million (being loan notes of €60 million,
€17.5 million and €17.5 million maturing in
July 2019, August 2021 and August 2024
respectively). The available headroom within
this new financing package at 31 December
2014 was c.£66 million, an increase of
c.£28 million over the Group’s previous
funding. The bank facility has an interest
rate margin, linked to the level of leverage of
the Group, of between 150 basis points and
230 basis points above LIBOR or EURIBOR
depending on the currency drawn. The US
Private Placements have fixed coupons of
4.89% for the €60 million note maturing in
July 2019; 2.54% for the €17.5 million note
maturing in August 2021; and 2.92% for the
€17.5 million note maturing in August 2024.
These facilities provide the Group with a
robust medium to long term diversified
financing package, with significant liquidity
and which will support the growth plans of
the Group in the coming years.
The Group has exposure to movements
in interest rates on its borrowings. This
exposure is managed by maintaining a
mix of fixed and floating interest rate
borrowings. This allows the Group to
mitigate the impact of interest rate
fluctuations, by allowing some benefit from
rate reductions, while offering some
protection against rate rises. At the year
end, the fixed rate element of borrowings
was 70%, a marked increase over the
previous year’s fixed rate element of 46%
and reflects the issue of the two new fixed
coupon loan notes with a total value of €35
million on the US Private Placement market
during the year. Based on the year end mix
and quantum of borrowings, a movement
in Euro interest base rates of 0.25% would
increase or decrease the Group’s annual
interest cost by approximately £56,000,
while a similar 0.25% movement in
Sterling base rates would also increase or
decrease annual costs by £69,000.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year was 11.9%,
a marked improvement over the 10.6%
reported for 2013. The calculation of ROCE
is based on the Group’s operating profit
before exceptional items and the average
of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £ 313.7 million
(2013: £300.8 million). The ROCE of 11.9% is
stated on a like for like basis with the prior
year, and therefore ignores the favourable
impact on the Group’s capital employed this
year arising from the impairment of the
carrying value of the goodwill in the
Group’s Belgian business. The impact of this
impairment reduces the Group’s capital
employed and increases the ROCE for 2014
to 12.1% (2013: 10.6%). The main focus of
the Group continues to be to ensure that
its average ROCE over the business cycle is
maintained at a level greater than its WACC;
consequently further progress will be
sought so as to improve this key metric in
the coming years.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have formed a judgement, at the
time of approving the financial statements,
that the Group can have a reasonable
expectation that adequate resources will be
available for it to continue its operations for
the foreseeable future, and consequently it
is appropriate to adopt the going concern
principle in the preparation of the financial
statements. In forming this judgement, the
directors have reviewed the Group’s budget
for 2015 and the forecast for 2016 (including
downside sensitivity scenarios), cash flow
forecasts, contingency planning, the
sufficiency of banking facilities and forecast
compliance with banking covenants.

r isk management
Managing risk in
our business
The Group, as with all businesses, faces
risks and uncertainties that could impact
the achievement of its chosen strategy.
The risks are recorded in our Corporate
Risk Register, which is regularly reviewed
and updated. These risks are accepted as
being a part of doing business, and our risk
management and internal control systems
are designed to manage, rather than
eliminate them. 
Responsibility
The Board carries overall responsibility for
the system of internal control, reviewing its
effectiveness and ensuring that there is a
process to identify, evaluate and mitigate
any significant risks that may affect the
achievement of the Group’s objectives.
Changes during 2014
During 2014 the Group has put in place 
a programme to build upon its risk
management capabilities.
Audit-R Limited was appointed as Internal
Auditor to the Group. Audit-R provides an
experienced individual to undertake the role
of Head of Internal Audit for the Group. 
Working with the Chairman of the Audit
Committee; the Group Finance Director, 
the Group Financial Controller and other
senior management members are
developing a robust risk management
capability reinforced by an internal
audit programme.
Additional internal resources have also been
identified and dedicated to risk management
and the internal audit function.
Process 
The risk management process is designed
to enable the business to identify risks
facing the Group, evaluate the likelihood
and potential impact of those risks, consider
current risk mitigation strategies and
identify any necessary steps required to
further reduce risks. The process includes
regular review and reporting of activities
and performance, including:
The Board considers the
effective management of
risks and opportunities 
to be essential to the
delivery of strategic and
operational goals. 
During 2014 we have put
in place a programme to
build upon our risk
management capabilities.
• a comprehensive system of monthly
reporting from each region, identifying
performance against budget and key
performance indicators, and 
analysing variances
• regular forecasting
• clear policies for control of activities,
including budget and performance
management, capital expenditure
controls and treasury operations
• reviews of key business risks and of
management’s controls and plans to
mitigate these risks
The Board recognises that the nature and
scope of key risks can change alongside the
systems and processes used to mitigate
them, and so regularly undertakes reviews
to ensure they are being appropriately
managed. The Group’s risk management
process works with senior management
across the business to identify risk, and to
evaluate the likelihood and impact of each
risk using a consistent framework.
Responsibility for each risk included in the
Corporate Risk Register is clearly identified.
In addition, where additional actions are
identified as necessary to bring risk to
an acceptable level for the Group,
responsibility is delegated to the relevant
member of the senior management team.
The Corporate Risk Register is monitored
and updated for changes in risk, new risks,
and risk mitigations on a regular basis.
Alan Merrell
Group Finance Director
26 February 2015 Prolonged
adverse weather
conditions
The Group’s rental fleet assets often operate
in circumstances that leave them exposed
to weather conditions. A prolonged period
of adverse weather will reduce the ability to
utilise equipment and therefore would have
an adverse impact on revenue.
This is an inherent risk in an industry that
has exposure to the construction sector.
The Group has partially mitigated the risk
by its geographic diversity and focus on
developing revenues from other less
weather dependent sectors.
Availability of
capital funding
The Group requires capital to fund the
replacement of existing rental fleet and to
expand the fleet to meet growing demand,
increasing the depot network and for the
completion of acquisitions.
If the cash flow that the Group generates,
together with the cash that it may borrow
under its credit facilities, is not sufficient to
meet these requirements, then additional
debt and/or equity financing will be
required. If such additional financing were
not available, then the Group’s revenue and
cash flow could be adversely impacted.
The Group aims to ensure that it has the
necessary equity base and sufficient
banking and other credit facilities available
to support its development plans. We
believe that the combination of the Group’s
equity base and the strong cash flows
generated by the business, together with
the credit lines available from banks and
other institutions, will provide adequate
funding for our foreseeable needs.
During the year, the Group’s debt facilities
were refinanced with a maturity profile
ranging from July 2019 through to
August 2024.
Currency
fluctuation
The Group reports its business performance
in £ Sterling, but generates revenues, profits
and cash flows in different currencies.
The Group also owns assets and borrows
money in different currencies.
Currency fluctuations can materially affect
the level of revenues, profits and cash that
the Group can generate in Sterling.
The Group has adopted a formal hedging
policy to mitigate against structural and
transactional foreign exchange exposures.
It seeks to match the assets and liabilities
denominated in a particular currency to
provide a natural hedge. 
Wherever possible, cash flows arising in
a given currency are utilised to service
borrowings and capital investment in
the same currency.
Increased
competition
Excessive competitor fleet expansion
that introduces surplus capacity into the
market, could place pressure on hire rates
and utilisation levels, and may erode
market share. 
With regard to the construction sector,
the transfer of the customer relationship to
more generalist plant hire providers, that
seek to offer customers a ‘one-stop’ shop
(acting as a broker for equipment they are
unable to directly supply), could erode
market share and margins.
We continue to build the differentiation
of the Lavendon brand through our
service quality initiatives, driving safety
enhancements through BlueSky Solutions,
and monitoring of customer service levels.
We also service a widespread of customers
from large multi- national companies
through to smaller sole-traders that service
multi commercial and industrial sectors.
This diversity of our customer base offers a
degree of resilience to competitive pressures.
Continuous monitoring of fleet utilisation
and management of the fleet replacement
programme avoid surplus capacity.

Set out below are the key risks and mitigating actions identified by management during 2014.
Ref A
Ref B
Ref C
Ref D Economic cycle
puts stress 
on business
performance
The market in rental equipment is largely
cyclical, being linked to the industrial,
commercial and infrastructure construction
sub-sectors. Significant changes in demand in
those markets will directly impact revenues.
Due to the high proportion of fixed costs this
has a greater impact on margins.
Similarly, if demand increases there is 
a potential for lost opportunities if 
Lavendon does not have available assets 
to meet demand.
The Group exercises prudent management
through the various phases of the
economic cycle. Plans to mitigate a
downturn are regularly reviewed and
updated and include fleet redeployment
and disposal, headcount flexibility and
capital expenditure controls.
The geographical diversity of the Group
also mitigates its exposure to the effects of
individual market fluctuations.
Customer failure,
exceptional 
bad debt 
Failure of a significant customer, or number
of customers, to pay for services received.
The Group closely monitors debtor
performance in each region. Clear credit
control procedures are in place, including
continuous monitoring of customer debt
balances against insured limits and the
maintenance of credit insurance.
Appropriate provisions are included within
the Group’s financial reports and forecasts.

Loss of strategic,
price sensitive or
personal data
Failure to ensure security of information,
covering loss or theft of strategic plans and
pricing data which could be of value to
customers / competitors; loss of personal
data under the Data Protection Act; 
or disclosure of price sensitive data in 
breach of listing rules.
There are robust IT security and controls
within the Group’s systems, which are
designed to mitigate the risk of loss of
data. There are clear policies and
procedures for staff, which govern their
use of data.
Failure to recruit
and retain
appropriately
skilled people
The Group’s business depends on the
abilities, skills and experience of its people. 
If appropriately skilled and capable people
cannot be recruited and retained, particularly
in key roles, then the Group’s delivery and
growth objectives may not be met.
The Group has a clear resource strategy in
place, and processes to identify those staff
and roles which are essential to the
continued success of the business. These
feed into development, reward, retention
and succession planning and resilience

per share was paid on 10 October 2014.
The directors recommend the payment of
a final dividend of 3.20p per share (2013:
2.40p), to be paid on 23 April 2015 making
a total dividend for the year of 4.60p
(2013: 3.55p) per share.
Employees
The Group pursues a policy of employee
communication through regular team
briefings and newsletters. Personal
employee development is encouraged
through the provision of relevant training
towards industry accredited certification
and licences. Employee involvement in the
financial performance of the Group is
encouraged through a comprehensive
range of well-established profit share
programmes. The Group consults with
employees on a regular basis so their views
can be taken into account in making
decisions that might affect their interests.
It is the policy of the Group that disabled
people, whether registered or not, should
receive full and fair consideration for all job
vacancies for which they are suitable
applicants. Employees who become
disabled during employment will be
retained wherever possible and retrained
if necessary. The Group is prepared to
modify procedures or equipment wherever
this is practicable, to allow full use to be
made of an individual’s abilities.
The Board has issued a statement of
business operations and culture detailing
the Group’s commitment to ensuring that
all employees comply with all applicable
laws and regulations, support a culture of
honesty and integrity, conduct operations
in an ethical and professional manner,
and act at all times to prevent impropriety,
discrimination, bribery and corruption.
The Board also operates an independent
whistle-blowing system across the
Group’s operations to allow employees
to raise matters that they feel should
be addressed by the Group.

Share capital
By resolutions passed at the Annual
General Meeting on 15 April 2014 the
directors were generally and
unconditionally authorised for the
purposes of Section 551 of the Companies
Act 2006 (the “Act”), to exercise all the
powers of the Company to allot shares
and grant rights to subscribe for, or
convert any security into, shares:
a) up to an aggregate nominal amount
(within the meaning of Section 551(3) and
(6) of the Act) of £560,165 (such amount to
be reduced by the nominal amount allotted
or granted under (b) below in excess of
such sum); and
b) comprising equity securities (as defined
in Section 560 of the Act) up to an aggregate
nominal amount (within the meaning of
Section 551(3) and (6) of the Act) of
£1,120,330 (such amount to be reduced
by any allotments or grants made under
(a) above) in connection with or pursuant to
an offer by way of a rights issue in favour of
holders of ordinary shares in proportion
(as nearly as practicable) to the respective
number of ordinary shares held by them on
the record date for such allotment (and
holders of any other class of equity
securities entitled to participate therein or
if the directors consider it necessary, as
permitted by the rights of those securities),
but subject to such exclusions or other
arrangements as the directors may consider
necessary or appropriate to deal with
fractional entitlements, treasury shares,
record dates or legal, regulatory or practical
difficulties which may arise under the laws
of, or the requirements of any regulatory
body or stock exchange in any territory or
any other matter whatsoever.
These authorisations expire at the
conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting of the Company to be held on
16 April 2015, and the directors are
proposing that renewal should be sought.
Details of movements in share capital
during the year are set out in note 24
to the Group’s financial statements.
In addition, the directors have been given
power pursuant to Sections 570(1) and 573
of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to:
a) allot equity securities (as defined in
Section 560 of the Act) of the Company
for cash pursuant to the authorisation
conferred by that resolution; and
b) sell ordinary shares (as defined in Section
560(1) of the Act) held by the Company as
treasury shares for cash, as if Section 561 of
the Act did not apply to any such allotment
or sale, provided that this power shall be
limited to the allotment of equity securities
for cash and the sale of treasury shares:
i. in connection with or pursuant to an
offer of or invitation to acquire equity
securities (but in the case of the
authorisation granted under (b) above,
by way of a rights issue only) in favour of
holders of ordinary shares in proportion
(as nearly as practicable) to the respective
number of ordinary shares held by them on
the record date for such allotment or sale
(and holders of any other class of equity
securities entitled to participate therein or

difficulties which may arise under the laws
of or the requirements of any regulatory
body or stock exchange in any territory or
any other matter whatsoever; and
ii. in the case of the authorisation granted
under (a) above (or in the case of any
transfer of treasury shares), and otherwise
than pursuant to paragraph (i), up to an
aggregate nominal amount of £82,548.
These authorities expire at the conclusion
of the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 16 April 2015, and the directors are
proposing that renewal should be sought.
Issue of share capital
During the year, the Company issued an
aggregate of 882,432 (2013: 2,966,733)
ordinary shares of one pence each:
• 742,403 shares were issued following the
exercise of options under the Lavendon
2006 Long Term Incentive Plan;
• 13,256 shares were issued under the
Share Incentive Plan and;
• 126,773 shares were issued following the
exercise of options under the Lavendon
1996 Approved Share Option Scheme.
Share Option Schemes
The Company established two share option
schemes on admission of its ordinary shares
to the Official List of the London Stock
Exchange on 10 October 1996, namely:
i. the Lavendon Group 1996 Company
Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Scheme’);
and
ii. the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme (the
‘Executive Scheme’).
Options were granted under the terms of
the schemes on the day following the
announcement of the Group’s interim and
annual financial results each year at an
option price equal to the mid-market
quoted share price derived from the
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List
at the close of trading on the preceding
day. The schemes were closed on reaching
their tenth anniversary on 10 October
2006, and no further share options have
been issued under these schemes.
The value of options granted to any
individual was subject to an individual limit
such that the aggregate exercise price of all
options granted during a year could not
exceed 200 per cent of base annual salary
in the case of a director, or 100 per cent
in the case of any other employee.
Options were granted subject to the
following performance targets:
The Employee Scheme
An option would be exercisable in full if
growth in pre-exceptional earnings per
share (“EPS”) exceeded growth in the
Retail Price Index (“RPI”) over the
performance period by an average of
at least 3 per cent per annum.
The Executive Scheme
The Executive Scheme is now closed and
their are no outstanding options under
the Scheme.
Details of all remaining share options granted
under the terms of the schemes that still
have options exercisable at 31 December
2014 are shown in the table below.
The Lavendon Group plc
2006 Long Term Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”)
The Plan was approved by shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting held on 28
April 2006. The Remuneration Committee
of the Company (the “Committee”)
supervise the operation of the Plan.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive
director) of the Company and any of its
subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in
the Plan at the discretion of the Committee.
Grant of awards
The Committee may grant an award under
the Plan either as a conditional allocation of
ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”)
or a nil cost option with a short exercise
window. The Committee may also decide to
grant cash-based awards of an equivalent
value to share-based awards or to satisfy
share-based awards in cash, should there
be a compelling reason to do so.
The Committee may grant awards within
six weeks of the approval of the Plan by
shareholders and then within six weeks
following the Company’s announcement of
its results for any period. The Committee
may also grant awards at any other time
when there are exceptional circumstances
which the Committee considers justifies
the granting of awards.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
An award may not be granted more than
10 years after the approval of the Plan by
shareholders.
The Committee will review the operation of
the Plan each year prior to making a grant.
Awards are not transferable, except on
death. Awards are not pensionable.
Individual limit
The maximum market value of Shares over
which awards may be granted to any
individual in any financial year in normal
circumstances will not exceed 150% of that
individual’s base salary.
Overall Plan limits
The Plan may use new issue Shares, treasury
Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period not more
than 10% of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company may be issued or
issuable under the Plan and any other
employee share plan adopted by the
Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purposes of these limits
unless institutional investor bodies
decide otherwise.
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally vest on or following
the third anniversary of grant once the
Committee has determined the extent to
which the applicable performance
conditions (see below) have been satisfied
and provided the participant is still
employed in the Company’s group.
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon
a participant ceasing to hold an office or
employment within the Company’s group.
However, if a participant ceases to hold an
office or employment in the group because
of death, ill health, disability, injury,
redundancy, the sale or transfer of his
employing company or business out of the
Company’s group or in other circumstances
at the discretion of the Committee, then an
award will vest when the participant ceases
to hold an office or employment with the
Company’s group. The extent to which an
award will vest will depend upon the extent
to which the performance conditions have,
in the opinion of the Committee, been
satisfied up to the date of leaving. The
award will then be pro-rated to reflect the
period of time between its grant and the
time of leaving employment, although the
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an
award if it regards it as inappropriate to do
so in the particular circumstances.
In the event that a participant retires, an
award will normally continue to the time
when vesting would have occurred if the
participant had remained an office holder
or employee with the Company’s group.
The award will vest to the extent that the
performance conditions have been satisfied
over the three year performance period,
and may then be pro-rated to reflect the
reduced period of time between its grant
and the cessation of employment.
Alternatively, the Committee may decide, in
exceptional circumstances, that the award
will vest on cessation of employment.
The award will then be pro-rated (as
described above).
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover, scheme of
arrangement or winding up of the Company
(not being an internal corporate
reorganisation) all awards will vest early to
the extent that the performance conditions
have, in the opinion of the Committee, been
satisfied up to the date of the relevant
event. The awards will then be pro-rated to
reflect the reduced period of time between
their grant and the time of vesting, although
the Committee can decide not to pro-rate
awards if it regards it as inappropriate to do
so in the particular circumstances.
In the event of an internal corporate
reorganisation, awards will be replaced by
equivalent new awards over shares in a new
holding company unless the Committee
decides that awards should vest on the basis
which would apply in the case of a takeover.
Performance conditions
All awards will be subject to performance
conditions set by the Committee.
Details of LTIP awards granted to executive
directors are disclosed separately in the
Annual Report on Remuneration on
pages 60 to 64.
Details of all other LTIP awards
granted under the terms of the Plan at
31 December 2014 are shown below.
Approval of the 2015
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company’s existing 2006 Long Term
Incentive Plan (the “2006 LTIP”) will reach
the end of its ten year life in April 2016.

Long Term Incentive Plan 40   Lavendon Group plc 2014
LTIP will be sought at the Group’s 2015
Annual General Meeting. The new
Lavendon 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan
will share many of the features of the 2006
LTIP but has been updated to reflect
current legislation, best practice and
corporate governance requirements.
The new 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan
will be used primarily to grant awards to
executive directors and selected employees
within the Lavendon Group. The
Remuneration Committee believes that the
implementation of the new plan will result in
a strategically-focussed equity-based long-
term incentive provision that will create a
genuinely strong alignment of interests
between management and shareholders.
Share incentive plan
During 2007 the Company established a
Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’).
The SIP is a UK HM Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) approved plan under which the
Company can provide share benefits in a tax
advantaged way to all its UK employees on
the same terms. Details of the shares issued
under the SIP are detailed in note 25.
The SIP allows the Company to either give
“free shares” to employees or provide a
facility for employees to purchase shares
from their pre-tax salary. Shares purchased
by employees may be supplemented by
the Company with additional free
“matching shares”.
Operation
The board of directors of the Company (the
“Board”) supervises the operation of the SIP .
The SIP comprises the following three
elements and the Board may decide which
element to offer to eligible employees:
a) “Free Shares” are ordinary shares in the
Company (“Shares”) which may be allocated
to an employee.
The market value of Free Shares allocated
to any employee in any tax year may not
exceed £3,000 or such other limit as may
be permitted by the relevant legislation.
Free Shares may be allocated to employees
equally, on the basis of salary, length of
service or hours worked, or on the basis of
performance, as permitted by legislation.
b) “Partnership Shares” are Shares an
employee may purchase out of their
pre-tax earnings.
The market value of Partnership Shares
which an employee can purchase in any tax
year may not exceed £1,500 (or 10% of the
employee’s salary, if lower), or such other
limit as may be permitted by the relevant
legislation. The funds used to purchase
Partnership Shares will be deducted from
the employee’s pre-tax salary.
c) “Matching Shares” are free Shares which
may be allocated to an employee who
purchases Partnership Shares.
The Board may allocate Matching Shares to
an employee who purchases Partnership
Shares up to a maximum of two Matching
Shares for every one Partnership Share
purchased (or such other maximum ratio as
may be permitted by the relevant legislation).
The same Matching Share ratio will apply to
all employees who purchase Partnership
Shares under the SIP on the same occasion.
Eligibility
Employees of the Company and any
designated participating subsidiary who
are UK resident taxpayers are eligible to
participate.
The Board may allow non-UK tax resident
taxpayers to participate. The Board may
require employees to have completed a
qualifying period of employment of up to
18 months in order to be eligible to
participate. All eligible employees must
be invited to participate.
Retention of shares
The trustee of the SIP trust will award Free
Shares and Matching Shares to employees
and hold those Shares on behalf of the
participants. Free Shares and Matching
Shares must usually be retained by the
trustee of the SIP trust for a period of
between three and five years after award.
The trustee will acquire Partnership Shares
on behalf of participants and hold those
Shares on behalf of the participants.
Employees can withdraw Partnership
Shares from the SIP trust at any time.
The Board may decide that awards of Free
Shares and/or Matching Shares will be
forfeited if participants cease to be employed
by a company in the Company’s Group within
three years from the grant of those awards
unless they leave by reason of death, injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement on or after
reaching age 50, or the business or company
for which they work ceases to be part of the
Company’s Group. In any of those cases, the
participants will be required to withdraw
their Shares from the SIP .
If an employee ceases to be employed by the
Company’s Group at any time after acquiring
Partnership Shares, he will be required to
withdraw the Shares from the SIP trust.
Corporate events
In the event of a general offer being made
to shareholders, participants will be able to
direct the trustees how to act in relation to
their Shares. In the event of a corporate
reorganisation any Shares held by
participants may be replaced by equivalent
shares in a new holding company.
Dividends on shares held by the
trustee of the SIP
Any dividends paid on Shares held by the
trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants
may be either used to acquire additional
Shares for employees (“Dividend Shares”)
or distributed to participants.
Rights attaching to shares
An employee will be treated as the
beneficial owner of Shares held on his
behalf by the trustee of the SIP .
Any Shares allotted under the SIP will rank
equally with Shares then in issue except for
rights attaching to such Shares by reference
to a record date prior to their allotment.
Overall SIP limits
The SIP may operate over new issue Shares,
treasury Shares or Shares purchased in
the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the
Company may not issue (or grant rights to
issue) more than 10 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company
under the SIP and any other employee
share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purpose of this limit unless
institutional investor bodies decide that
they need not count.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Variation of capital
In the case of a variation in the share capital
of the Company, Shares held in the SIP will
be treated in the same way as other shares.
Alterations to the SIP
The Board may, at any time, amend the SIP
in any respect, provided that the prior
approval of shareholders is obtained for
any amendments that are to the advantage
of participants in respect of the rules
governing eligibility, limits on participation,
the overall limits on the issue of Shares or
the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for
determining a participant’s entitlement to,
and the terms of, Shares to be acquired
and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain prior
shareholder approval will not, however,
apply to any minor alteration to benefit the
administration of the SIP , to take account of
a change in legislation or to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control,
or regulatory treatment for any participant
or any company in the Company’s Group.
General
Awards made under the SIP are not
transferable other than to the participant’s
personal representatives in the event of
their death. No benefits received under
the SIP will be pensionable.
Directors’ interests in
significant contracts
No directors were materially interested in
any contract of significance.
Insurance of directors
The company has put in place insurance to
cover its directors and officers against the
costs of defending themselves in civil legal
proceedings taken against them in that
capacity and in respect of damages
awarded in such proceedings.
Following shareholder approval, the Group
maintains insurance for Lavendon Group
plc’s directors in respect of their duties as
director, which is a qualifying third party
indemnity provision for the purposes of the
Companies Act 2006. This cover was in place
during the financial year and at the date of
approval of these financial statements.
Financial risk management
Details are included in note 22 to the
financial statements.
Independent auditors and
disclosure of information
to auditors
As far as each director is aware, there is
no relevant audit information of which the
company’s auditors are unaware.
Each director has taken steps that they
ought to have taken as directors in order
to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the
company’s auditors are aware of that
information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
have expressed their willingness to continue
in office as auditors to the Company and
Group. A resolution to reappoint them as
auditors to the Company and Group will
be proposed at the next AGM.
Takeover Directive
disclosure
Following the implementation of the EU
Takeover Directive by certain provisions of
the 2006 Act, we are required to make
additional disclosures. A number of these
disclosures can be found elsewhere in this
Report as set out below:
• structure of Lavendon Group’s share
capital (see page 98);
• employee share schemes (see pages
38 and 41);
• significant direct or indirect
shareholdings (see page 49);
• appointment and replacement of
directors (see page 46); and
• the powers of directors (see pages

The disclosures which are not covered
elsewhere in this Report include the
following:
Agreements which may result in
restrictions on share transfers
The Company is not aware of any
agreements between shareholders which
may result in restrictions on the transfer
of securities and/or on voting rights.
Change of control
There are no significant agreements to
which the Company is a party that may take
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of
control following a takeover bid, other than
that in relation to Company’s borrowings,
which could become repayable on a
takeover being completed.
Shares with special rights
There are no special rights or obligations
attaching to the ordinary shares and
there are no shares in the Company with
special rights with regard to control of
the Company.
Restrictions on transfer of
Lavendon Group shares
The Company’s Articles of Association
provide that the Company may refuse to
transfer shares in the following customary
circumstances:
• where the share is not a fully paid share;
• where the share transfer is in favour of
more than four joint transferees; and
• where the share is a certificated
share and is not accompanied by the
relevant share certificate(s) and such
other evidence as the board may
reasonably require to prove the title
of the transferor.
These restrictions are in addition to any
which are applicable to all UK listed
companies imposed by law or regulation.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may
be amended by special resolution of the
Company’s shareholders.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the
Company and its directors or employees
providing for compensation for loss of
office or employment (whether through
resignation, purported redundancy or
otherwise) that occurs because of a
takeover bid. Statement of directors’
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors
have prepared the Group financial
statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union, and the
Parent Company financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the
directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Group and the Company and
of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting
estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and
• state whether applicable IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are
sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the
Group and enable them to ensure that the
financial statements and the directors’
Remuneration Report comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the Group
web site, www.lavendongroup.com.
Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced
and understandable and provides the
information necessary for shareholders to
assess the Group’s performance, business
model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and
functions are listed in the Governance
section on pages 44 and 45 confirm that,

Directors’ report
o ther disclosures continued New products and attachments for the
Industrial Services sector
During 2014 we introduced a series of new products to the
fleet. This included the highly adaptable Titan Boom which
combines the large deck of a scissor lift, the telescopic
reach of a boom lift and the lifting capacity of a telehandler.
For a recent Industrial Services customer we recommended the use of two Titan
Boom models, which can lift 1.8 tonne and 1.3 tonne respectively. As well as
providing operators with access from a rotating deck, they provide an ideal solution
for scaffold installation and the removal of on-site structures. A platform pipe rack
attachment also allowed for safer handling of materials during the scaffold build.
The customer reported a saving of 30% on the total cost of the project due to the
increased productivity when using the Titan product which required just two
workers rather than five when compared to other methods of undertaking the work. 
As part of that service we provided internal presentations, talks and demonstrations
to more than 60 of the customer’s employees to share this best practice within
the organisation. These took place at a number of locations at both our depots,
as well as directly on the customer’s sites.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2014   43

Compliance with the 
UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The governance rules applicable to all UK
companies admitted to the Official List of the
UK Listing Authority are set out in the UK
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’),
published by the Financial Reporting Council. 
This report sets out our governance policies
and practices, including details of how we
applied and complied with the Code’s
principles during the year.
The Board
The Board is chaired by myself as 
Non-Executive Chairman, with the other
members being Don Kenny (Chief Executive
Officer), Alan Merrell (Group Finance
Director), Andrew Wood (Senior
Independent Director) and John Coghlan
and John Wyatt (Non-Executive Directors).
Appointments to the Board during the
year are detailed in the Nominations
Committee report on page 53.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer are separated, with Don Kenny
holding the position of Chief Executive
Officer and myself holding the office 
of Chairman.
The Board of directors provide the Company
with experience and knowledge from a
range of industry, financial and commercial
backgrounds. This combination of skills
and experience assists the Board in any
decision making process and in the
development of business strategy.
Biographical details of each director,
including current directorships held in
other companies, are detailed on page 44
of the financial statements.
Board balance, independence 
and commitment
The three Non-Executive Directors
constitute, excluding myself as Chairman,
60% of the Board. The Non-Executive
Directors provide a strong and independent
monitor on the performance of both the
Company and its executive management.
We believe as a Board that the Non-
Executive Directors are independent within
the guidance of the Code as they have not
been previously employed by the Company,
have not and do not currently have a
material business relationship with the
Company, are remunerated on a fixed fee
basis, do not have close family ties with the
Company's advisers, directors or senior
employees, do not hold cross directorships
with the other directors nor have other
significant links with other directors, do 
not represent significant shareholders and
have not served on the Board for more
than nine years. Their backgrounds in
industry and finance make them suitably
qualified to perform their duties as
members of the Board and as members 
of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees.
The executive directors, Don Kenny and
Alan Merrell, do not currently hold non-
executive directorships outside of the
Company. Neither the Non-Executive
Directors or myself as Chairman currently
hold other roles that are considered to
impair or conflict with our abilities to fulfil
our duties to the Company.
Effectiveness
Meetings
We hold regular Board meetings during the
year, with minutes being recorded and
agreed by all directors ensuring an accurate
record is made of all relevant matters. 
During 2014, the Board held eight formal
meetings. The attendance of each director at
these meetings is shown in the table below:

At each Board meeting the Chief Executive
Officer and Group Finance Director provide
a review of business performance and give
details of any strategic issues arising. 
46   Lavendon Group plc 2014
John Standen 
Non-Executive Chairman We also review each individual business
unit’s performance with local management
on at least one occasion during the year. 
As a Board we maintain a schedule of
matters reserved for decision by the Board,
including the release of a number of
financial, corporate and statutory
disclosures, approval of business strategy,
acquisitions and disposals, composition of
relevant committees and management
structures, and matters relating to ethical,
health and safety concerns. 
I hold separate meetings, at least annually,
with all members of the Board in order to
review their contribution during the year.
I also meet with the Non-Executive
Directors as a group, to review matters
relating to their role on the Board.
The Company reviews conduct and liability
issues as part of its annual risk review and
mitigates these exposures through
Directors and Officer’s insurance cover
where appropriate.
Board committees
We operate three Board committees,
namely the Audit Committee, the
Remuneration Committee and the
Nominations Committee, to which we
have delegated certain responsibilities.
The relationship and intra-action between
the Board, the Committees and the
executive management team is
illustrated in the diagram above.
The membership, responsibilities and
activities of the Committees are set out in
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committee Reports on pages 50 to 59. 
Information and professional
development
Board papers are circulated to all members
of the Board in advance of each meeting,
and the quantity and focus of such
information is reviewed on an ongoing
basis. Directors provide feedback to
management to enable the reporting
formats and content of Board papers to
be enhanced, and make individual
enquiries of management for clarification
on issues whenever necessary.
The Board allows directors to take
professional and independent advice as
may be necessary in carrying out their
duties. Directors also attend training
courses, when appropriate, to ensure
they remain up to date with the latest
developments and legal requirements that
impact their individual responsibilities.
The joint role of Finance Director and
Company Secretary, held by Alan Merrell,
ensures that the directors have ready
access to the Company Secretary in all
relevant matters and that compliance
with Board procedures is maintained.
Performance evaluation
An external review of the performance of
the Board and its Committees was
commissioned in December 2013 and
completed in January 2014. The review
was conducted by MWM Consulting,
an independent organisation with no
connection to the Company. The review
comprised detailed interviews with each
Board member and a review of Board and
Committee papers. The report from MWM
Consulting was presented to the Board, and
its overall conclusion was that the Board
operated in an efficient and effective manner,
it also recommended that its composition be
refreshed and expanded. Recommendations
were made to enhance the Board’s
performance going forward, and following
discussion action points were agreed. 
Towards the end of 2014, I carried out an
internal review of the performance of the
Board and its Committees, including
reviewing the implementation of the 
actions agreed following MWM Consulting’s
recommendations at the start of the year.
My review involved meeting with each
director on various aspects relating to 
the operation of the Board and its
Committees. My findings were discussed at
our December 2014 Board meeting, and
we concluded that the Board and its
Committees operated effectively during the
year and that the actions previously agreed
had been implemented. We also agreed
that there were certain areas that could be
further improved in 2015, and accordingly
various actions have been agreed.
It is the Board’s intention to have an external
review of its effectiveness performed at least
every three years, in line with best practice.
Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of
Association of the Company, all directors
are subject to election at the Company’s
first Annual General Meeting following their
appointment, and all are required to seek
re-election at intervals of no more than
three years. In line with best practice, all 
of the Company’s directors seek re-election

Financial and business reporting
The directors and auditors set out their
respective responsibilities for preparing 
and reviewing the financial statements in 
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
on page 42 and in the Independent 
Auditors’ Report on pages 72 to 76 of the 
Financial Statements. 
Our strategy for delivering sustained value
over the longer term is set out in the
“Strategic Report” on pages 7 to 33.
Risk management and internal control
The Board maintains a system of internal
controls within the Company to manage
risks and provide a reasonable, but not
absolute, degree of assurance on the
reliability of the financial and other
information used both within the business
and for external publication, as well as
safeguarding the assets of the Company
against unauthorised use or disposition.
The systems in place are designed to
identify to the Board, on a timely basis,
matters that require attention so that
they may be considered and dealt with
appropriately. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the systems of internal
control that were in operation during
the past financial year, and these are
summarised under the following headings:
Control environment
There is a clearly defined organisational
structure that allows the Company’s
objectives to be planned, communicated,
executed, controlled and monitored.
The Company employs suitably qualified
staff so that the appropriate level of
authority can be delegated to ensure the
efficient management of the business.
Delegated authority is embedded
throughout the organisation, covering the
preparation and review of financial and
operational information together with the
procedures for seeking and obtaining
approval for major transactions and
organisational changes. The level of
delegated authority is reviewed annually
by the Audit Committee.
Identification and evaluation of
business risks and control objectives
The identification and evaluation of both
financial and non financial business risks
facing the Company is reviewed annually 
by the Board. During this process the
effectiveness of its internal controls in
safeguarding against these risks is
considered, and where necessary additional
controls are introduced or existing controls
are enhanced.
Information systems
The management information systems
provide the Company with relevant and
timely reports from which both the Board
and senior management can monitor the
performance of the business. Budgets 
and prior year data provide the Board and
senior management with comparative
information with which to assess and
monitor the performance of the various
activities of the Company. Operational
performance statistics are reviewed against
a range of measures including competitive
benchmarks and historical trends. 
The Group has continued to invest in
developing and enhancing these information
systems during the year, to ensure that 
the information is provided in the most 
efficient manner.
Monitoring
The Executive Directors have significant
involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Company’s activities
and are, therefore, able to monitor the
control procedures at an operational and
financial level. A Group Executive
Committee, comprising the two executive
directors and direct reports from the
operating subsidiaries and business
functional units, meets regularly to discuss
key operational risks and issues, monitor
business unit performance and ensure
efficient communication. 
The Company maintains an internal audit
function, which is outsourced to a third
party. During the year we changed our
internal auditors and appointed Audit-R
Limited as internal auditors to the Group,
who will be supported by identified
internal resources and external specialists,
as required. The internal auditors
undertake a programme of audits across
the Group. During 2014, a series of risk
meetings and workshops were held to
identify and evaluate the key business risks,
from which a focused audit programme
was developed and agreed with the
executive and the Audit Committee. The
internal audit reports are addressed to, and
reviewed by, the Audit Committee, and
appropriate actions, if required, agreed.
Any reportable control weaknesses
identified by the Company’s external
auditors are discussed with the Audit
Committee, and reports circulated to the
relevant executive directors. 
Going concern
The Company closely monitors its future
anticipated cash flows and compliance with
its banking covenants. Based on these
forecasts and the sensitivities which have
been run on different scenarios the directors
have a reasonable expectation that the
Group and Company have adequate
resources to continue in existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Relations with 
shareholders
Dialogue with institutional 
shareholders
The Executive Directors hold a series of
meetings with institutional investors after
the publication of the Company’s annual
and interim financial results each year.
Meetings are also held during the year with
both existing and prospective shareholders,
to provide the opportunity to understand
the Company’s operations and strategy in
greater detail.
In addition I maintain a regular dialogue with
major shareholders in relation to strategy
and corporate governance issues, and Non-
Executive Directors are also available to
meet major shareholders as required. In
particular, the Senior Independent Director,
Andrew Wood, is available to meet major
shareholders in the Company, to allow any
concerns to be raised independently from
the Board. The Non-Executive Directors are
also available for questions from individual
shareholders at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting each year.
48   Lavendon Group plc 2014 As a Board we retain the services of a
Stockbroker to ensure a regular flow of
relevant information is made available to

It is our policy to ensure that resolutions
proposed at the AGM remain segregated on
matters which are substantially different.
In particular, the approval of the Company’s
Remuneration Committee Report is subject
of a separate resolution. Shareholders are
able to lodge their votes through the CREST

Group’s annual and interim financial
statements, the accompanying reports 
to shareholders, corporate governance
statements and any announcements
related to the Group’s financial
performance, including a review of the

procedures and practices to mitigate
these risks.

• The key accounting considerations and
judgements reflected in the Group’s
published financial statements.

during the year and in relation to the
2014 year end were:
Recoverability of Middle East debtors
During the course of 2014 and up until the
date of publication of this report, we have
regularly reviewed management information
regarding the trade receivable balances in
the Group’s Middle East business. 
Reports detailing: the amount and
stratification of overdue trade receivable
balances by territory and customer; cash
collection performance; post balance sheet
date receipts; litigation updates and details
of provisions made; were reviewed and
discussed with the external auditors.
The Committee were satisfied that the
carrying value of the Middle East trade
receivables was reasonable and sufficient
provisions had been made for amounts
considered uncollectable.
Carrying value of goodwill 
and intangibles
We reviewed the assumptions and basis of
calculation that management used in the
modelling of future discounted cash flows
that were prepared to support the
carrying value of the Group’s goodwill and
intangible assets. In particular, the carrying
value of goodwill relating to the Group’s
Belgium business unit was discussed
following the deterioration in trading
performance in 2014 and management’s
recommendation to make a goodwill
impairment charge of £8.8 million in the
2014 financial statements.
The Committee were satisfied that the
assumptions and basis used in calculating
the Belgian goodwill impairment charge
were reasonable and that it was appropriate
to reduce the carrying value of the Belgium
goodwill by making an impairment charge in
2014. We were also satisfied that the stated
balances of the remaining goodwill and
intangible assets, following the impairment
charge, were reasonable and supported by
appropriate calculations using acceptable
assumptions. We were also satisfied that
the disclosures made in note 12 relating
to the impairment review for Germany
were appropriate.
Quality of earnings
We considered the presentation of the
financial statements, and in particular, 
the classification of certain costs as
exceptional or underlying, an area which 
is inherently judgemental.
Exceptional items in the year relate to a
goodwill impairment charge, costs relating
to refinancing and closure costs.
The Committee were satisfied with
management’s presentation.
Tangible asset useful lives
and residual values
We reviewed the annual exercise
undertaken by management to reassess
the useful lives and residual values of
the Group’s rental fleet.
The Committee considered the previous
useful lives of similar assets and the actual
residual values achieved on disposal. The
Committee were satisfied that the Group’s
estimates of useful lives and residual
values and the depreciation policy as set
out in note 30 were appropriate.
External audit
The Group’s external auditors are
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . As an Audit
Committee we are responsible for reviewing
the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, and ensuring this is
safeguarded notwithstanding any provision
of any other services to the Group.
We recognise the importance of
safeguarding auditor objectivity and have
taken the following steps to ensure that
auditor independence is not compromised:
• Each year we carry out an evaluation 
of the external auditor as to its
independence from the Group and its
relevant officers in all material respects
and that it is adequately resourced and
technically capable to deliver an objective
audit to shareholders. Based on this
review the Committee recommends to 
the Board each year the continuation, 
or removal and replacement, of the
external auditor.
• We have formal policy relating to the
procurement of non-audit related work
from the Group’s external auditors. This
policy has been applied in the year and is
reviewed annually. The policy permits the
engagement of external auditors, without
the prior approval of the Committee, for
non-audit services where the fees will not
exceed 30% of the annual audit fee for
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2014   51

the Group, and where the services relate
to advice on the interpretation of
accounting regulations and other matters
that have relevance to the external audit
function. In the case of taxation services,
the external auditors can be engaged,
without the prior approval of the
Committee, where the associated fee for
each individual assignment does not
exceed 30% of the Group’s annual audit
fee and the associated fees in aggregate
in any year do not exceed the Group’s
annual audit fee. The policy specifically
prohibits engaging external auditors to
make management decisions or provide
management services, acting as an
advocate in litigation, investment banking
services, internal audit services of a
recurring nature, the design and
implementation of financial and risk
management systems and executive
search services.
• We review all fees paid for audit, together
with any consultancy fees, to assess 
the likelihood of any independence 
issues arising.
• The external auditors’ report to the Board
and the Audit Committee confirming their
independence in accordance with Auditing
Standards. In addition to the steps taken
by the Board to safeguard auditor
objectivity, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
operates a five-year rotation policy for
audit partners.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been
in place as auditors of the Group for a
number of years and the audit contract
has not been put out to tender in the last
10 years. Their performance is reviewed
annually by the Committee. As part of this
year’s review we considered the UK
Corporate Governance Code guidance in
relation to external audit contracts for
companies outside the FTSE 350 and noted
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will need
to rotate off the audit of the Group by 2023
at the latest, although this will be reviewed
each year in the intervening period.
Our assessment of the performance of the
external auditors for 2014 is that they
remain effective, and after reviewing the
level of fees relating to the provision of non-
audit services and the nature of that work
that they continue to be independent. 
Internal audit
The Group’s internal audit function
undertakes financial control and focused
operational audits throughout the year.
The annual audit programme is agreed by
the Committee, and reflects the required
core control reviews and considers the
operational risks identified within the
Group’s risk register. The function uses
both internal and external specialist
resources to complete the audit
programme as appropriate.
The Head of Internal Audit is accountable
to the Committee and attends all our
meetings, and also meets independently
with myself.
During 2014, the internal audit function
reported to the Committee on the 10 audits
completed in the year. As a Committee we
discussed the findings of each audit and
regularly monitor the implementation and
status of the audit recommendations.
The Committee annually reviews the
resources and performance of the internal
audit function.
Whistleblowing procedure
To enable employees to raise matters 
of impropriety or concern relating to
financial or other issues, we maintain an
independent reporting procedure that is
available to all employees, through which
these concerns can be raised. The service,
called “Speak Up”, is available to employees
in all territories. The procedure provides
feedback to the employee regarding the
matters raised and any subsequent 
actions taken. 
Andrew Wood 
Chairman of the 
Audit Committee
26 February 2015 The Nominations Committee is chaired by
myself, and includes all of the Board’s
Non-Executive Directors. The composition
of the Committee changed during the year
following Jan Åstrand’s resignation from the
Board on 26 February 2014. John Coghlan
and John Wyatt were both appointed
members of the Committee from 1 March
2014. Andrew Wood, the Group’s Senior
Independent Director, was a member of
the Committee throughout 2014.
As a Committee we have written terms of
reference, which are published on the
Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com).
All Committee members are considered to
be independent.
Key responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee
are to:
• Review the structure and constitution 
of the Board and its committees, taking
into consideration the diversity and
balance of skills, knowledge and
experience of the directors.
• Consider succession planning for
directors and other senior executives.
• Identify and nominate candidates for
appointment to the Board when required.
• Annually review the time commitment
required of Non-Executive Directors.
Main activities of the
Committee during the year
During 2014, we held three formal
meetings. The attendance of each of the
Committee members at these meeting is
shown in the table below:

The key matters considered at these
meetings were:
Board composition
• Reviewed the composition of the Board
including the range of skills, level of
experience and balance between
executive and non-executive directors.
Following this review, we recommended
that the Board be refreshed and expanded
to include a wider breath of skills and
experience. This recommendation was
accepted and the Committee subsequently
undertook an appropriate process to
identify suitable candidates. 
We prepared detailed candidate
specifications, taking into account the
existing skills of the Board, and then
managed a formal process, using external
search consultants, to conduct a thorough
and extensive search. Following the
conclusion of the process, the Board
appointed John Coghlan and John Wyatt 
as Non-Executive Directors of the Group
with effect from 1 March 2014. 
• Reviewed the membership of the various
Board committees. Following this review
both John Coghlan and John Wyatt were
appointed to the Board’s Audit, Nomination
and Remuneration Committees. John
Coghlan became the Group’s Chairman of
the Remuneration Committee following
Jan Åstrand’s resignation.
Senior independent director
Following Jan Åstrand’s resignation, and after
careful consideration of the roles of all
directors, as a Committee we recommended
to the Board, and the recommendation was
accepted, that Andrew Wood should take 
on the role of Senior Independent Director
of the Company.
Succession planning
Reviewed the succession planning 
process for both the executive and non-
executive directors, as well as the level 
of senior management immediately
below Board level.

Annual Statement by
the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee
Welcome to my first report as Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee (the
‘Committee’). Since my appointment in
March 2014, I have led the Committee in
undertaking a thorough review of the
executive remuneration arrangements. As a
result of this review, during the latter part of
2014, we consulted with the Group’s major
shareholders on some proposed changes
to the Group’s remuneration policy and as
a result a revised Directors’ Remuneration
Policy will be presented for shareholder
approval at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting (‘AGM’) on 16 April 2015.
The new policy has been designed to more
closely support the business strategy and
promote the long-term success of the Group.
We believe that this simplified policy will
increase the alignment between our
shareholders and executives and ensure that
the executives are fairly and appropriately
rewarded for their contribution to the long-
term success of the Group.
The key changes to the policy are:
• Removal of the matching element of
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. The
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will be
the sole vehicle for long-term incentives
going forward.
• Decrease the maximum bonus
opportunity (from 150% to 125% of
salary) and provide an equal weighting
between short and long-term incentives.
LTIP awards will now be made at 125% of
salary, higher than the previous year
(100% of salary) but within the existing
plan limit of 150% of salary.
• Simplify the bonus deferral arrangements.
30% of any bonus will now be deferred in
shares and the deferral period will be
extended to three years in line with
emerging market practice. The additional
performance test on deferral has been
removed but clawback provisions for
misstatement, misconduct or error will
continue to apply.
• Increase share ownership guidelines.
We currently have a guideline which
requires both of the executive directors
to hold 100% of base salary in shares, and
both meet this requirement. We plan to
raise this over the next two years to 200%
of base salary.
• Extend the post-vesting holding period.
The awards granted under the LTIP in
2014 were subject to an additional
6 month holding period (post-vesting).
This holding period will be increased to
two years for the 2015 awards, again in
line with emerging market practice.
In addition to these policy changes, as part
of our review of the executive remuneration
arrangements we also looked at how we
implement the existing policy and, in
particular, the base salary levels for the
executive directors. Lavendon’s stated policy
has been, and continues to be, to set salary
levels that are appropriate for the size of our
organisation and that reflect the experience
of the individual. When Don Kenny was
recruited as CEO in October 2011, he was
appointed on a base salary which was below
the benchmark level our policy would have
prescribed, with the mutual understanding
that this difference would be addressed
when the Group’s performance had
improved. Since Don Kenny’s appointment,
the Group’s financial performance has
improved significantly. Profit before Tax and
Amortisation* has grown from £21.9 million
in the year to 31 December 2011 to £34.1
million in the year to 31 December 2014 (a
compound annual growth of c.16%), driving
improvements in margins and the return on
capital employed (‘ROCE’), which in turn has
delivered significantly increased shareholder
value. We strongly believe that Don Kenny’s
salary should now be brought into line
with our policy, and consequently the
Committee, after consulting with major
shareholders on the matter, has agreed to
increase Don Kenny’s salary to £400,000
with effect from 1 January 2015.
Looking back to the Group’s performance
in 2014, revenues, profitability, margins
and ROCE have all improved over 2013.
In particular, the Group’s ROCE at 11.9% is
at its highest point for over 10 years. This
continued improvement in the financial
performance of the Group is reflected in
the annual bonus scheme award for 2014
of 54% of salary to the executive directors,
(36% of the maximum bonus available).

Remuneration Committee
* Stated before amortisation of intellectual property
and intangibles recognised on acquisitions. Directors’
Remuneration Policy
This report sets out the Company’s overall
policy on directors’ pay for the forthcoming
financial year. It will take effect from the
date it is approved by shareholders.
The remuneration of the Company’s
executive directors comprises a base
salary, an annual performance bonus,
participation in a long term incentive plan
with returns based on Group performance,
together with a defined contribution
towards pension arrangements and other
benefits, as detailed in this report.
In determining the remuneration
packages of the executive directors of
the Group, and advising, where
appropriate, on the remuneration
policies relating to the Group’s senior
management below Board level, the
Committee aims to ensure that:
• executives are appropriately rewarded for
their contributions to the Group, and
account is taken of their individual
responsibility and performance;
• rewards are linked to the Group’s
performance so that the interests of the
executives are aligned with those of the
Company’s shareholders;
• remuneration packages reflect current
market conditions in order to attract, retain
and motivate executives of a high quality;
• executive shareholding is encouraged to
ensure a longer term focus; and
• the Company complies with the UK
Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee believes that there should
be an appropriate balance in the executive
directors’ remuneration packages between
fixed and variable (performance related)
pay, that encourages the long-term success
of the Company. The chart below illustrates
the potential rewards available for the
executive directors in terms of fixed pay
only, for target performance (target
incentive payout) and out-performance
(maximum incentive payout):
Although the Group’s share price grew
strongly over 2012 and 2013, its progress in
2014 has been more muted, constraining
average returns to shareholders over this
three year period to 115%. The impact of
the weaker share price performance in
2014 has limited the vesting level of the
2012 LTIP award to 57%, with these awards
becoming exercisable in April 2015.
The annual bonus scheme for 2015 will
operate in a similar manner to the scheme
that was in place for 2014, with financial
targets linked to the Group’s profitability and
ROCE alongside personal objectives (albeit
with simplified deferral arrangements). The
performance conditions for the 2015 LTIP
award are still under consideration, but the
Committee will retain a combination of
measures linked to relative Total Shareholder
Return and financial performance, with the
grant level for the awards expected to be
125% of salary in line with our proposed
revised remuneration policy.
As part of my review of the remuneration
arrangements during the year, the need to
refresh the rules governing the operation of
the Group’s LTIP arrangements, which have
been in place since 2006, was also
considered. As a result, a revised set of LTIP
rules will be proposed at the forthcoming
AGM for approval by the shareholders.
We believe that our proposed new
remuneration policy will provide a fairer and
more motivational link between performance
and reward. The incentive arrangements are
closely aligned to our business strategy and
the interests of our shareholders, requiring
strong growth in earnings, efficient use of
capital and total shareholder return out-
performance. A significant proportion of the
total remuneration opportunity is provided in
shares further aligning the interests of
management with those of our shareholders.
Resolutions to approve the revised Director’s
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on
Remuneration, together with the revised
rules for the LTIP arrangements going
forward, will be proposed at the forthcoming
AGM of the Company on 16 April 2015.

Assumptions: Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those applying
on 1 January 2015. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed)
for the year ending 31 December 2014. Target performance assumes a bonus of 50% of salary and 25% vesting
under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Maximum performance assumes a bonus of 125% of salary
and 100% vesting of the LTIP awards. The LTIP grant level in both scenarios is 125% of salary each year.
No share price growth has been assumed.

Our policy is to pay salaries at market
rates for the role, taking into account the
skill level, experience of the individual and
the interests of shareholders. Salaries are
benchmarked against comparable roles
in companies of a similar size and in
companies within the industry sector.
In determining salary increases the
Committee takes into account individual
performance, market data, any changes
in role or responsibility and the policy
being adopted for pay reviews elsewhere
in the Company or Group.
The Committee also considers the
impact of any increase to salaries on the
total remuneration package. Salaries are
paid monthly and are normally reviewed
annually (with any changes usually
effective from 1 January each year).
Details of the current salaries of the
executive directors are set out in the
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Benefits currently comprise a company
car (or cash allowance in lieu), medical
insurance and disability cover. Additional
benefits may be provided, as appropriate.
There is no maximum prescribed value
but the Committee monitors the overall
cost of the benefit provision to ensure
that it remains appropriate.
Executive directors are also entitled to
membership of the all-employee
Lavendon Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
and participate on the same terms as
other eligible employees.

although this is only expected to be used
in exceptional circumstances.
Unless the Committee determines
otherwise, participants will ordinarily receive
dividend equivalents on vested shares
under the DSBP and LTIP . These may be
paid in cash or shares.
Matching awards under the DSBP will no
longer be granted.
The performance measures for the LTIP
awards will be set using a sliding scale of
targets and no more than 25% of the award
(under each measure) will vest for achieving
the threshold performance hurdle. The
performance targets will be set prior to the
grant of each award and different targets
and/or weightings between measures
(from those set out in the table above)
may be set for future award cycles.
Under the rules of the LTIP , the Committee
has the discretion to amend the targets
applying to existing awards in exceptional
circumstances providing the new targets
are no less challenging than originally
envisaged. The Committee also has the
power to adjust the number of shares
subject to an award in the event of a
variation in the capital of the Company.
The Committee has the discretion to
reclaim some, or all, of a vested DSBP
and/or LTIP in exceptional circumstances,
such as a misstatement of financial results,
an error in assessment of performance,
the use of misleading information and/or
gross misconduct on the part of the
individual. The authority to use this
discretion lasts for two years following
the vesting of any award.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee believes that executives
should be encouraged to build significant
long-term share holdings and the
remuneration policy has been designed
with this key principle in mind. The
executive directors are currently expected
to build a shareholding in the Company,
over time, equal to 100% of annual salary.
This guideline holding will increase to 200%
of salary by 2016. Furthermore, the
executive directors have agreed to retain
the shares received (net of tax) from future
LTIP grants for two years post vesting.
Legacy arrangements
The LTIP awards granted in 2012 were
subject to a relative total shareholder
return condition only. Shares vesting under
the 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards are not
subject to a post-vesting holding period.
Shares vesting under the 2014 LTIP awards
are subject to a six month post-vesting
holding period. These awards, made prior
to the commencement of the current
policy, will be allowed to vest on the terms
on which they were granted.
The annual bonus for 2014 was awarded
under the policy approved by shareholders
at the 2014 AGM and is subject to the
deferral arrangements contained therein.
The deferred shares vest after one year
subject to continued employment and a
malus provision (under which the shares
will lapse if there has been a deterioration
in the deferral period of any of the financial
metrics that were used to determine the
original bonus).
Under the rules of the DSBP and LTIP , the
Committee has the discretion to amend the
performance targets applying to existing
awards in exceptional circumstances
providing the new targets are no less
challenging than originally envisaged.
The Committee also has the power to
adjust the number of shares subject to an
award in the event of a variation in the
capital of the Company.
Full details of the outstanding awards are
set out in the Annual Report on
Remuneration on page 60.
Service contracts and policy
on termination payments
Under the executive directors’ service
contracts twelve months’ notice of
termination of employment is required by
either party. Should notice be served, the
executives can continue to receive their
base salary, benefits and pension for the
duration of their notice period. The
company applies a general principle of
mitigation in relation to termination
payments and supports the use of phased
payments. Outplacement services may be
provided where appropriate and any
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or
compromise claims in connection with a
termination would be paid as necessary.
In the event of a cessation of employment,
the executives may still be eligible for a
bonus, payable in cash, on a pro-rata basis,
but only for the period of time served
from the start of the financial year to the
date of termination and not for any period
in lieu of notice.
The rules of the DSBP and LTIP set out what
happens to outstanding share awards if a
participant leaves employment before the
end of the vesting period. Generally, any
outstanding share awards will lapse when
an executive leaves employment except in
certain circumstances. If the executive
leaves employment as a result of death,
ill-health, injury, disability, retirement,
redundancy, transfer of employment or
any other reason at the discretion of the
Committee, then they will be treated as
a ‘good leaver’ under the plan rules.
The share awards for a good leaver will
vest, subject to an assessment of any
performance conditions and, for the LTIP
awards only, a pro-rata reduction to reflect
the proportion of the vesting period
served. Under the terms of the LTIP , the
Committee may dis-apply the time pro-
rating requirement if it considers it
appropriate to do so. In determining whether an executive should be treated as
a good leaver and the extent to which their
award may vest, the Committee will take
into account the circumstances of an
individual’s departure.
The treatment of share awards on a change
of control is the same as that set out above
in relation to a good leaver (albeit with the
vesting period automatically ending on the
date of the change in control).
Chairman and non-
executive director’s fees
and letters of appointment
The fees for the Chairman are determined
by the Remuneration Committee taking into
account views of the Chief Executive (the
Chairman excludes himself from such
discussions). Non-executive director fees
are reviewed annually by the Chairman and
Chief Executive. Fee levels are set to reflect
the responsibilities and time commitment
of the role, the experience of the individual
and their effectiveness in the role.
Benchmark research is also undertaken
against fees paid in companies of
comparable size and complexity. The fee
structure for the non-executive directors
comprises a basic Board fee, combined
with additional fees for where a Committee
Chairman or Senior Independent Director
role is also performed. The Chairman and
non-executive directors may also be
reimbursed for the grossed up cost of any
taxable expenses incurred during the
performance of their duties. In exceptional
circumstances, additional fees may be
payable to reflect a substantial unplanned
increase in time commitment during a year.
The fees are paid monthly through the
Company’s payroll.
The Chairman and non-executive directors
have letters of appointment, which are for
a period of three years. The letters of
appointment may be terminated on giving
three months notice by either party.
Recruitment policy
Base salary levels will be set in accordance
with Lavendon’s remuneration policy, taking
into account the executive’s expertise,
experience and their existing remuneration
package. Where it is appropriate to offer a
lower salary initially, a series of increases to
the desired salary positioning may be given
over subsequent years subject to individual
performance. Benefits will generally be
provided in accordance with the approved
policy, with relocation expenses/an
expatriate allowance paid if required.
The structure of the variable pay element
will be in accordance with Lavendon’s
approved policy detailed above. The
maximum possible variable pay opportunity
is 275% of base salary; being a maximum
bonus of 125% of base salary and a
maximum long-term incentive award of
150% of base salary. The structure of
variable pay would be granted on a
consistent basis to the other executive
directors. However, in the case of the
annual bonus, different performance
measures may be set taking into account
the responsibilities of the individual,
and the point in the financial year at
which they joined.
If it is necessary to buy-out incentive awards
granted by a previous employer (which
would be forfeited on leaving the previous
employer), the value of the buy-out will take
into account the form of the previous award
(cash or shares), the timing of the award
and its expected value. Replacement share
awards, if used, may be granted using
Lavendon’s existing share plans to the
extent possible, although awards may also
be granted outside of these schemes if
necessary and as permitted under the
Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal promotion, any
outstanding variable pay awarded in
relation to the previous role will be allowed
to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive
director will be set in line with the
approved policy.
External non executive
director positions
Subject to Board approval, executive
directors are permitted to take on non
executive positions with other companies.
Executive directors are permitted to retain
their fees in respect of such positions.
Details of outside directorships held by
the executive directors and any fees that
they receive are provided in the Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Differences in remuneration
policy for executive
directors compared to
other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive
directors is designed with regard to the
policy for employees across the Group as
a whole. There are differences in the
structure of the remuneration policy for the
executive directors, for example, a higher
emphasis on performance related pay and
increased use of shares, reflecting the
responsibilities of the position. The
Committee has not consulted directly with
employees on the executive remuneration
policy but takes into account the pay and
employment conditions of the general
workforce when considering any changes
to the quantum or structure of the
executive remuneration packages.
How the views of
shareholders are taken
into account
As part of the Committee’s annual review
of remuneration matters, consideration is
given to any feedback received from the
Company’s shareholders. The Committee
engages pro-actively with its shareholders,
particularly when any changes are made
to the remuneration policy whereby the
Committee Chairman will inform major
shareholders of these in advance. The
Committee has consulted with major
shareholders on the proposed changes to
the current policy. Details of votes cast for
and against the resolution to approve last
year’s remuneration report are provided in
the Annual Report on Remuneration.

i) The 2014 figure relates to the bonus award for the year ending 31 December 2014. Of the total bonus award, 30% will be paid in deferred shares.
ii) The figure in the 2014 column relates to the LTIP awards granted in 2012 (which were based on relative TSR performance over the three years to 31 December 2014). Actual
performance was between threshold and stretch targets and 57.2% of the awards will vest in April 2015. Since, the awards have not yet vested, in accordance with the regulations,
the value of the shares shown in the table above is based on the average share price over the period 1 October to 31 December 2014 of 182p.
The figure in the 2013 column, relates to the vesting of the 2011 LTIP . The award to Don Kenny vested on 3 October 2014 and the award to Alan Merrell vested on 12 April 2014.
The values have been updated to reflect the actual share prices on vesting dates of 187p and 230p respectively.
iii) The 2012 bonus was party paid in the form of deferred shares. The deferred shares were subject to a malus clause which meant that the shares lapsed if there was deterioration
in EBITA and/or ROCE during the year to 31 December 2013. The minimum financial performance was not achieved and the deferred share awards lapsed.

i) The 2011 and 2012 awards are subject to a performance condition requiring the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance to out-perform that of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Trusts (the “Index”). The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period must be at least equal to the performance of the Index for 15% of the awards to
vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if TSR performance is 60% or more above the performance of the index. Performance is measured over
three financial years, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
ii) Lavendon’s TSR performance for the 2011 awards was 61.5% above the index. These awards vested in full on 12 April 2014 and were exercised on 1 May 2014. In accordance
with the rules of the Plan, additional awards (a further 5,267 shares) representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period
between the date of grant and the date of vesting of the awards were also made. The total number of shares vesting to Alan Merrell was therefore 155,267. The share price on
the date of vesting was 230p.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The awards granted, vesting and exercised under this Plan relating to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2014   61
Pension contributions
in 2014
In 2014, total of pension contributions of
£81,112 were made to Don Kenny (2013:
£81,112) and £59,250 to Alan Merrell (2013:
£59,250). For both Don Kenny and Alan
Merrell, £12,500 was paid into individual
pension funds and a taxable ‘cash in lieu’
payment was made for the balance of the
total pension contribution.
Annual bonus payments
in 2014
The annual bonus scheme for 2014 was
based on a combination of financial
performance (up to 125% of salary) and
personal performance metrics (up to 25%
of salary). The Group had to deliver both an
underlying operating profit before
amortisation* and exceptional items (EBITA)
of £36.1 million and a return on capital
employed of 10.7% before any bonus
payments (either financial or personal
performance related) would start to accrue.
The range of performance metrics for
2014 are shown in the table below.
The Group delivered an underlying EBITA of
£39.3 million in 2014, marginally below the
‘on-target’ of £40.1 million but well ahead of
the EBITA performance in 2013 of £35.3
million and the minimum threshold for the
2014 annual bonus scheme of £36.1 million.
The Group’s ROCE for 2014 was 11.9%, well
ahead of the ROCE in 2013 of 10.6% but also
ahead of the ‘on-target’ threshold of 11.5%.
This combined financial performance,
together with the delivery of personal
objectives, has resulted in an overall bonus
of 54% of base salary being payable under
the 2014 annual bonus scheme.
Under the annual bonus scheme policy
applying for 2014, 30% of the annual bonus
will be deferred into shares for one year
under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus
Plan. The deferred shares will be subject to a
malus condition such that the shares will be
forfeited if there is deterioration in EBITA or
ROCE in 2015 over the performance
achieved in 2014. The deferred shares
relating to the 2014 annual bonus scheme
will be awarded in April 2015.

EBITA and/or ROCE in 2013 compared to 2012. This minimum level of financial performance was not achieved and consequently the awards were forfeited on 11 April 2014.
i) Resigned from the Board on 26 February 2014.
ii) Appointed to the Board on 1 March 2014.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The awards granted, vesting and exercised under this Plan relating to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:
Under the annual bonus scheme policy
applying for 2014, 30% of any bonus,
providing the overall bonus is above £30,000,
is to be deferred into shares for one year
under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus
Plan. The deferred shares will be subject to a
malus condition such that the shares will be
forfeited if there is deterioration in EBITA or
ROCE in 2015 over the performance
achieved in 2014. The deferred shares
relating to the 2014 annual bonus scheme
will be awarded in April 2015.
Directors’ interests
The interests of the directors in the
ordinary share capital of the Company are
shown below.
It was the Company’s policy in 2014 that
executive directors should build a
shareholding in the Company, over time,
equal to 100% of annual salary to facilitate
the alignment of interests with those of the
Company’s shareholders. This guideline is
being increased to 200% of salary over the
next two years. Shares counting towards
this guideline include beneficially owned
shares. As at 31 December 2014, Don
Kenny and Alan Merrell held shares with a
value equivalent to 110% and 138% of their
base salaries respectively.
All directors’ interests are beneficially held.
There has been no change in the directors’
interests in the ordinary share capital of the
Company between 31 December 2014
and 26 February 2015.
Long Term Incentive Plan continued
iii) Lavendon’s TSR performance for the 2011 awards was 61.5% above the index. These awards vested in full on 3 October 2014 and were exercised on 9 October 2014. In accordance
with the rules of the Plan, additional awards (a further 7,372 shares) representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between
the date of grant and the date of vesting of the awards were also made. The total number of shares vesting to Don Kenny was therefore 169,743. The share price on the date of
vesting was 187p.
iv) Lavendon’s TSR performance for the 2012 awards was 29.9% above the index. Accordingly 57.2% of the awards will vest on 11 April 2015. In accordance with the rules of the Plan,
additional awards representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between the date of grant and the date of vesting of the
awards will also be made.
v) The 2013 awards were granted on 10 April 2013 and are subject to a TSR and ROCE performance condition (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR is measured relative to the
constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies over three years from the date of grant (with 25% vesting at median
increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above). For the ROCE condition, average ROCE over the three year performance period must be at least 11.25% for
25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for average ROCE of 13.25% or above.
vi) The 2014 awards were granted on 10 April 2014 and are subject to a TSR and ROCE performance condition (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR is measured relative to
the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies over three years from the date of grant (with 25% vesting at median
increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above). For the ROCE condition, average ROCE over the three year performance period must be at least 11.25% for 25%
vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for average ROCE of 12.63% or above. The share price on the date of grant was 235p and the face values of the awards
were £324,000 for Don Kenny and £237,000 for Alan Merrell; equivalent to 100% of base salary.
vii) The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2014 was 172.5p; the range of market prices during the year was between 165.5p and 246.0p. Historic CEO pay

Company performance
The chart opposite shows the Company’s
performance, measured by ‘Total
Shareholder Return’ (TSR), compared to the
FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment
Trusts (the ‘Index’) for the six years ended
31 December 2014. The Committee
considers the Index to be the most
meaningful comparison of historic share
price performance in assessing the
Company against an index of similarly
sized businesses.
Historic CEO pay
The table opposite shows the total
remuneration for the persons holding the
role of Chief Executive over the same six
year period.
Percentage change in
remuneration of director
undertaking the role of
chief executive officer
The table opposite shows the movement in
the salary, benefits and annual bonus for
the Chief Executive between the current
and previous financial year compared to
that for the average UK employee. The
Committee feels that this provides a more
appropriate comparator than movements
in the wage bill for the total workforce,
which is distorted by movements in the
number of employees and variations in
wage practices in our overseas markets.
i) Kevin Appleton left employment with effect from 30 June 2011, and under the terms of his contact, he was entitled to
receive a termination payment, after mitigation, of £312,000. In addition to Kevin Appleton’s termination payment of
£312,000, the Committee determined that awards of over 136,500 shares in the Company, previously granted under
the Company’s 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2010, would vest on the date of cessation of his employment.
These awards were exercised on 9 August 2011 and had a value, on exercise, of £136,500. Both the termination
payment of £312,000 and the value of the LTIP award of £136,500 are included in the Total Remuneration figure
of £623,000 shown in the above table.
ii) Don Kenny was appointed to the position of Chief Executive on 1 October 2011.

A comparison of total employee pay
against the Group’s profit after tax and

Neither Don Kenny nor Alan Merrell
currently hold any external non-executive
director positions.
Application of the
remuneration policy for 2015
Base salaries
As set out in my Annual Statement on
page 54, the base salaries for the executive
directors were reviewed as part of the
Committee’s overall review of the
remuneration policy. Following consultation
with major shareholders, the Committee
agreed that the salaries for the 2015 will be
as follows: £400,000 for Don Kenny (up
from £324,000) and £250,000 for Alan
Merrell (up from £237,000). The salary
increase for Don Kenny reflects the
Committee’s desire to position his salary in
line with the market rate for the role and his
experience and contribution to the role
since his appointment in 2011. The salary
increase for Alan Merrell reflects his
performance during the year and covers a
two year period following his last review in
January 2013.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for executive
directors in 2015 will again be based on
a combination of financial targets and
corporate/personal objectives. The forward
looking targets are deemed to be
commercially sensitive but retrospective
disclosure will be given in 2015’s Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Long-term incentives
The proposed performance conditions
for the 2015 LTIP award are still being
considered, but the Committee will retain a
combination of measures linked to relative
total shareholder return and financial
performance. The actual performance
conditions selected will be disclosed at
the time of granting the 2015 awards.
The intended grant level is 125% of salary.
The executive directors have agreed to
retain any shares (net-of-tax) received
under the 2015 LTIP award for a two year
period post vesting.
Chairman and Non-Executive
Director fees
The 2015 fees for the Chairman and
Non-Executive Directors have been agreed
at £125,000 for the Chairman (up from
£104,000) and a base fee of £40,000 for the
Non-Executive Directors (up from £38,775)
with the fee of £6,000 for chairing a
board committee and a fee of £3,000 for
undertaking the role of the Senior
Independent Director.

During 2014, we widened the involvement of our
employees in the Group’s Corporate Responsibility (“CR”)
agenda to include charity fund raising, greenhouse gas
emissions reduction, safety in the workplace initiatives
and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.

The five areas of excellence have
been defined as:
– o ur environment
– o ur communities
– o ur People 
– o ur customers 
– o ur suppliers 
By reviewing and redefining our strategic
KPI’s we have set the business challenging
objectives to strive towards, providing a
framework for continual improvement
across the CR spectrum.
In this respect the CR strategy will be
known as the Groups Sustainability
Strategy going forward. The four pillars
of the CR have been developed and
enhanced to become five areas of
excellence. In each of these areas we
have defined and set Key Performance
targets for 2015 through to 2017 which
will be used to firstly benchmark our
business in new areas that we have not
previously measured and then set
ourselves challenging targets for
improvement. Progress will be measured
by the Group Executive Team on a
quarterly basis.
The Group’s
Sustainability Strategy
The Group has had a
successful year in terms of
meeting its Corporate
Responsibility (“CR”) objectives.
The CR agenda is set and
monitored by the Board
(with the Group’s CEO,
Don Kenny, taking direct
responsibility), and to aid
its delivery we have taken
the decision to review
our polices and strategy
with a view to providing the
foundation for continued
success over the next
three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014   67

Our Environment
We maintain detailed records of the level of
emissions that our operations produce.
This data is available for each business unit
on a national, regional or local basis and
enables each management team to
critically review performance and identify
areas for improvement and other energy
emissions reduction. The Group reviews
the energy usage of all business units on
a quarterly basis to highlight areas of
concern and monitor actions taken to
improve performance.
As part of the implementation of our
sustainability strategy each business unit
had been tasked with developing initiatives
to reduce their carbon footprint during the
second half of 2014. These initiatives
included, commissioning and moving the
Group’s business in Belgium to new energy
efficient headquarters, the increased use
of video conferences to reduce travel
between locations and the integration of
telematics across the UK haulage fleet to
reduce fuel usage.
The UK’s vehicle telematics initiative saw
the introduction of a fully integrated
vehicle monitoring system which
monitored all 118 delivery fleet vehicles.
The areas monitored included driver
behaviours such as harsh acceleration or
cornering, vehicle idle times, miles per
gallon achieved and CO
2
emissions. The
system went live in March 2014 and was
accompanied by driver training explaining
the benefits of the system. All drivers also
attended specific training on economical
driving techniques. The data produced
was fed into depot, regional and national
league tables so that each driver could
compare themselves with their peers,
encouraging competition. The system has
been in place for less than a year but we
are already seeing the benefits. There has
been an average increase in MPG per
vehicle of 6% which has resulted in a
CO
2
saving of 361 tCO
2
e across the
UK truck fleet.
GHG Emissions Report
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission
sources required under the Companies Act
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’
Reports) Regulations 2013.
The method we have used to calculate GHG
emissions is the GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised
edition), together with the latest emission
factors from recognised public sources
including, but not limited to, Defra, the
International Energy Agency, the US Energy
Information Administration, the US
Environmental Protection Agency and the
Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change.
Limitations to data collection
Waste disposal and waste recycling at
Middle East sites have been excluded as
data was not available.
Scopes
The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard (revised edition)
dictates to report the GHG emissions by
Scopes 1, 2 and 3.
Scope 1
Includes direct GHG emissions from
sources that are owned or controlled by the
company such as natural gas combustion
and company owned vehicles.
Scope 2
Accounts for GHG emissions from the off-
site generation of purchased electricity,
heat and steam.
Scope 3
Includes all other indirect emissions.
Included in this assessment are waste
disposal, business travel and third-party
deliveries. Not included are staff commuting,
third party maintenance and vehicles.
Reporting of scope 3 activities is optional.
However, these activities can contribute a
significant portion of overall emissions and
it is therefore decided to report these
where applicable. Corporate responsibility report

Our Community
During 2014 the Group established a
charitable events team to drive forward the
Group’s charitable giving programme.
Throughout the year the team organised a
number of successful events, resulting in
over £10,000 being raised for charity.
In March the Group’s UK subsidiary
Nationwide Platforms, sponsored by one of
the Group’s key suppliers, completed a
Sport’s Relief cycle challenge in which
employees cycled over 1,200 miles and
raised £3,700 for charity.
Following the success of Nationwide
Platforms pedometer challenge in 2013 the
events team co-ordinated a Group wide
pedometer challenge in support of the
British Heart Foundation. During this month
long event 292 employees clocked up a
staggering 63,393,605 steps. As well as
raising money for the foundation, friendly
rivalry encouraged our employees to

The Group also got involved with

2014 and “Christmas Jumper Day”
in December 2014 for Save the
Children charity.
As a result of the efforts of our employees
and the Group’s own contributions over
£37,000 has been donated to good
causes throughout 2014 and plans to
continue this during 2015 are in place.
The Group itself made donations of
£30,000 (2013: £18,000).
Nationwide Platforms, the Group’s UK
business also ran a volunteering scheme
allowing employees to take up to two days
a year to support a good cause or charity
of their choosing. This scheme is
continuing in 2015.
Marketplace
As the market leader in the provision of
powered access the Group recognises its
responsibilities to support our customers
and to continue to innovate and share best
practice. In 2014 this has seen our business
units continue to deliver customer focused
initiatives across the Group which has
included hosting over 100 complimentary
powered access workshops for customers
to share best practice.
The UK business ran their 6th consecutive
Work at Height Best Practice Forum in
September 2014. This year’s event focused
on topical issues surrounding powered
access usage and was supported by over
70 industry health and safety professionals
including UK Regulators. The event
provided a thought provoking insight into
the measures that powered access
machine manufacturers take into account
during their design process, as well as
presentations on new industry guidance
for ground conditions and practical
workshops around delivery truck safety.
The Group also continues to support the
International Powered Access Federation
(IPAF) with Group employees holding
seats on the International Council and
the UK Council. Lavendon also continues
to represent the business on all the
IPAF UK committees and aims to play
an influential and supporting role to
our industry.
We are focussed on delivering excellence
to out customers, through innovation and
service. Our Group Tech-X programme
has continued to assist in the
development of locations across our
operations. In 2014 we saw 44 locations
achieve the Tech-X Gold – our highest
standard, which is an 52% improvement
on the number of locations that achieved
the gold standard in 2013. The Tech-X
scheme will be revised in 2015 in
recognition of its success in developing
engineering and safety standards across
the Group. It will be extended to include
other operational areas such as training,
transport, facilities and business
performance to become a truly all
encompassing operational standard.
The accreditation will be known as
Tech-X 2020 and will extend the current
accreditation levels from the current
Bronze, Silver & Gold to include Platinum
and Diamond. This will not only provide
the opportunity for further development
but will also enable locations greater scope
to differentiate themselves from locations,
encouraging competition and raising
standards across the Group.
The significant levels of investment by the
Group in new fleet also provided a great
opportunity for safety innovation. The
Group ran workshops where powered
access machine manufacturers were
invited to show machines that the Group
may consider for future purchase. These
workshops were attended by the technical
leads of each business unit together with
health and safety and procurement
representatives. The Group critically
assessed each machine with a view to
ensuring that required technical
improvements were included into our
tenders, thus ensuring new machines
coming onto fleet meet the highest
standards in engineering. Improvements
introduced include longer leads on scissor
lifts, to guard against operator trapping
incidents when operating the lift from the
ground and fall protection devices,
introduced across the Specialist Vehicle
fleet, to prevent falls from the elevated
bed of the vehicles.

Bronto 70m Ariel lifts

the UK who achieved their 6th consecutive
ROSPA Gold award.
The UK maintained the Freight Operator
Recognition Scheme (FORS) Bronze
standard and invested in additional
technology to comply with the new standard
for Construction Logistics – Managing Work
Related Road Risk, a standard which was
introduced to reduce the number of
accidents involving construction plant
and cyclists or pedestrians.
During 2014 Germany maintained its
OHSAS 18001 accreditation for Health and
Safety Management Systems whilst the UK
were successful in their re-certification for
ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems),
ISO 14001 (Environmental Management
Systems) & OHSAS 18001. Belgium also
retained their VCA*, Q-for accreditation.
Through the Group’s Tech-X scheme we
have seen facilities continue to improve
across the Group. This has helped provide
industry leading facilities and improve
quality and reliability of our machines
through more efficient maintenance.
Our engineering apprenticeship scheme is
now in its 16th year and continues to
develop younger people whilst providing
the business with excellent engineers who
hold nationally recognised qualifications.
2014 saw the successful graduation of 14
apprentices in the UK including the first
ever graduates from the new apprentice
scheme for Hire Desk Controllers. All
apprentices have accepted full time roles
within the business.
Health, Safety and Sustainability week ran
across all Group operations in the autumn.
This was the third year that the event was
held aiming to build on the success seen
during the previous two events. In addition
to increasing awareness of health and
safety within our organisation we also
designed events to provide a platform for
customer interaction. Across the Group we
saw over 80 initiatives held ranging from
open seminars & workshops to Health &
Safety Quiz’s, healthy living campaigns and
driving safety workshops.
People
The Group seeks to provide an
environment in which employees feel
respected and are given the opportunity to
contribute to the success of the business.
It is intended that all employees work in
discrimination and harassment free
surroundings; the Group actively promotes
all aspects of equal opportunities and
believes employees, prospective
employees, customers and suppliers
should be treated fairly.
The Group operates an independent
whistle-blowing system across all operations
allowing employees to raise any issues they
feel the Group should be addressing.
Our people are instrumental to our
success; we respect and value the
individuality and diversity that every
employee brings to the business. We seek
to create a positive and open working
environment wherever we operate. As at
31 December 2014 our group workforce of
1,667 comprised of 320 females and 1,347
males. Of these 45 were senior managers,
8 being female and 37 male, these
employees include members of our group
and business unit executive teams and
statutory directors of corporate entities
whose financial information is included in
the Group’s 2014 consolidated financial
statements in this annual report.
Workplace
Our employees sit at the heart of our CR
agenda. During 2014 we have continued to
invest in our facilities to ensure that our
employees have workshops and facilities with
the highest Health and Safety standards.
In 2014 the Group achieved its key
performance indicators (KPI’s) for accident
reduction in both its defined categories.
We ended the year with an Accident
Frequency Rate (AFR) 1 day of 0.79 against
our target of 0.9 and an over 3 day rate of
0.52 against a target rate of 0.63. These
figures not only bettered our targets, they
are also a considerable improvement on
our 2013 rates and can be attributed to
the Health and Safety programmes
running in each of our businesses since
the introduction of the Your Safety our
Priority campaigns in 2013.
Behavioural safety strategies were launched
in the UK and Germany. The UK strategy has
seen 88 operational managers undergo a 2
day safety leadership workshop to explore
how and why accidents occur and how they
can avoided. This workshop was followed by
training 16 of these leaders to roll out a half
day behavioural safety workshop to all
employees. These workshops have
contributed to the reduction in accidents
and incidents throughout the year. The
workshops will continue until all UK & Group
employees have completed the programme.
Behavioural Safety programmes are planned
for the remainder of the Group in 2015.
2014 was another very successful year in
terms of receiving industry recognition in
terms of awards for health & safety
excellence and innovation. We saw the
Group achieve several awards including                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014   71

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Lavendon Group Plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Lavendon Group Plc’s financial statements comprise:
• the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• the Group income statement the Group statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Group cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £1.9 million which represents 5% of underlying operating profit, being
operating profit before amortisation of intellectual property and intangibles recognised on
acquisitions and exceptional items.
• We performed a full scope audit on six separate reporting units.
• The reporting units audited included the three largest trading entities in the Group.
• The audits were conducted by the Group engagement team in the UK and by local PwC network
firms operating under our instruction in Germany and the Middle East.
• The audited units provide a significant level of coverage over the consolidated accounts (including
76% of consolidated revenues and 77% of consolidated underlying operating profit.
• Recoverability of accounts receivable.
• Goodwill impairment assessment.
• Exceptional items.
• Accounting for the refinance.
• Tangible asset useful lives and residual values.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular,
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Recoverability of accounts receivable
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 106
(Key assumptions and estimates) and page 96 (notes).
The Group has significant operations in the Middle
East and its accounts receivable balance includes a
significant amount of overdue debt in the Middle
East operating segment.
In recent years the Middle Eastern business has
experienced difficulty in recovering significantly
aged debt and there is a material provision in
place against overdue amounts.
Management apply a board approved policy to the
whole of the Middle East segment in order to
provide for accounts receivable. They assess the
policy annually, undertaking a process by which
they assess the recoverability of individual debt
and determine the appropriate provision amount.
This includes a review of the movement during
2014 of balances that were outstanding at
31 December 2013. No amendment to the policy
was made during 2014. 
We developed an understanding of the controls in place surrounding credit
control and debtor recoverability, both in the Middle East and at Head Office
finding no issues that would cause us to amend our detailed testing plan.
We tested the integrity of reports detailing the level of debt by age bracket,
territory and customer by testing a sample to invoices and identified no
exceptions. We then used those reports to identify our sample test the
recoverability of balances, focusing on large, old balances, which we did by
agreeing them to post-year end cash collection where possible or by reading
correspondence with the customers concerned: our assessment of the
recoverability of individual balances did not indicate that the directors’
provision was materially misstated.
As Group auditors we sent PwC Middle East detailed instructions at the
beginning of the audit, clarifying that the recoverability of debtors was an area
of focus. The Group engagement team reviewed the work performed by
PwC Middle East and attended the audit clearance meeting in Dubai.
We assessed the board approved provisioning policy specific for Middle East
receivables by considering the historical collection from those customers and
understood the movements of aged debtors from the prior year. We used
this to challenge the assumptions therein and found them to be appropriate
to the circumstances.
Goodwill impairment assessment
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 106
(Key assumptions and estimates) and page 89 (notes).
We focused on this area because the determination
of whether or not an impairment charge for
goodwill and other intangible assets was necessary
involved significant judgements about the future
results of the businesses and the wider economies
in which they operate, particularly the long term
growth rates, profit margins and the discount rate.
In particular, we focused on Belgium and Germany
as the level of headroom identified by the directors
during their impairment assessments for these
businesses was low in the prior year. This is
following profit decline in recent years due to
challenging conditions within the construction
industries in those two territories in particular.
The directors recognised an impairment charge of
£8.8m for Belgium in the current year. The
remaining goodwill balance related to Belgium is
£5.9m. No impairment was recognised with respect
to Germany, for which there is a goodwill carrying
value at the year end of £16.3m.
For all segments with goodwill we evaluated the directors’ future cash flow
forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up, including comparing
them to the latest Board approved budgets, which contained the level of detail
that we needed, and testing the integrity of the underlying calculations,
identifying no exceptions.
We used our valuation expertise to create our own independent expectation of
and challenge the key assumptions, by:
• comparing the directors’ assumptions for long term growth rates and profit
margins in the forecast to historical results and economic and industry
forecasts; and
• comparing the discount rate with the cost of capital for the company and
comparable organisations.
We found the assumptions used by the directors to be consistent with our
expectations.
We also performed an independent sensitivity analysis on these key financial
assumptions. Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that
either individually or collectively would be required for the goodwill/intangible
asset to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in those
key assumptions arising.
We read and considered the disclosures made by the directors in relation to the
sensitivities of the assumptions impacting the carrying value of goodwill held in
Germany and found them to be consistent with our testing and compliant with
the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment’.
In respect of Belgium we found the assumptions for long term growth (1%) and
discount rate (12.3%) to be acceptable. We performed sensitivity analysis on
these on the basis that any significant change in these assumptions would have a
direct impact on the impairment charge. Based on our testing we consider the
impairment not be materiality misstated.
In respect of Germany we found the assumptions for long term growth (2%) and
discount rate (10.0%) to be acceptable. We performed sensitivity analysis on
these on the basis that any significant change in these assumptions would have
a direct impact on the level of headroom. 74   Lavendon Group plc 2014

Exceptional items 
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 106
(Key assumptions and estimates) and page 83 (notes).
The exceptional costs disclosed in the Group income
statement relate to the goodwill impairment (£8.8m),
closure of the Indian business (£1.3m) and the issue
costs incurred in the refinancing (£1.0m). We focused
on this area because the decision to classify items of
income and expenditure as exceptional is inherently
judgemental and is considered significant in the context
of the Group’s financial statements due to the
presentation of underlying and non-underlying results
on the face of the income statement. 
We considered the inherent nature of the costs classified by the directors as
exceptional and challenged the directors’ judgements around the classification.
We did this by confirming that they met the exceptional costs accounting policy,
as set out in Note 30 to the financial statements.
We tested exceptional costs in order to check that they were incurred in
connection with the closure of the Indian business or the refinancing by tracing
them to the invoice or other supporting documentation to check that they were
correctly classified and we did not identify any material items that were not.
Testing around the impairment charge in Belgium is noted within the
‘Goodwill impairment assessment’ area of business noted above. We concurred
with the directors’ recognition of this as exceptional in accordance with the
Group’s accounting policy.
We considered the disclosure included in the notes to the financial statements,
specifically the exceptional items accounting policy and note 3 on exceptional
items, and found that they were consistent with the findings from our work
and the nature of the costs.
Accounting for the refinancing
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 106
(Key assumptions and estimates) and page 92 (notes).
In August 2014, the Group entered into a refinancing,
incurring of issue costs of £1.4 million, of which £1.0 million
has been recognised as an exceptional expense and the
remainder were capitalised against the loan liability.
Under IFRS, fees associated with a refinancing are either
capitalised or expensed, depending on whether the
process in connection with which they were incurred was
to modify, substantially modify or extinguish existing debt
arrangements. The determination about whether the
existing debt is modified or substantially modified
requires the directors to exercise judgement around the
nature and substance of the changes, which is why we
focussed on this area. 
We challenged the directors’ determination of whether each element of the
refinancing was a modification, substantial modification or an extinguishment by
reading a formal, board-approved, paper setting out their considerations when
making their judgments and considering its sufficiency in the context of the
requirements of and compliance with accounting standards.
We also read the relevant parts of the financing agreements and other
correspondence with the lenders to check that the terms of the refinancing
were accurately reflected in the board-approved paper.
Further, we agreed fees incurred to the invoices to confirm the accuracy
and validity of the transactions.
Tangible asset useful lives and residual values
Refer to page 51 (Audit Committee Report), page 106 (Key
assumptions and estimates) and pages 89 and 90 (notes).
We focused on this area because the Group owns a
significant level of fleet assets (net book value £230.7m)
and the estimates of their useful lives and residual values
have a significant impact on the financial statements both
in terms of the annual depreciation charge and the profits
recognised on the disposal of fixed assets.
The directors are required to reassess useful lives and
residual values annually in accordance with IFRS to ensure
they remain appropriate, and have done so, concluding
that they are consistent with the accounting policies
noted within page 104.
We challenged the directors’ assessment by:
• comparing the estimated useful economic lives and residual values of fleet
assets to the actual useful economic life and proceeds from the sale of similar
assets that were disposed of during the previous 6 years;
• considering the impact on useful economic lives of the directors’ plans and
expectations for the business; and
• considering whether the judgements underpinning the estimates useful
economic lives were consistent with the judgements made by the directors
elsewhere in the financial statements.
We did not identify any exceptions in our testing of management’s assessment.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole,
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group is structured with 6 operating segments, as shown in note 2 in the notes to the financial statements, being the geographical
trading locations of the UK, Germany, Belgium, France, the Middle East and a non-operating Corporate cost centre. The Group financial
statements are a consolidation of a number of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions,
which make up the operating segments, and a number of other non-trading Group entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014   75
Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Accordingly, of the Group’s reporting units, we identified 6 (being Head Office and 5 trading entities, being the UK, Germany and the three
financially largest reporting units within the Middle East) that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either
due to their size or their risk characteristics. These entities provide a significant level of coverage over the consolidated accounts (including
76% of consolidated revenues and 77% of consolidated underlying operating profit). The audits of these 6 reporting units were performed
by either the Group engagement team or by other PwC network firms operating under the instruction of the Group engagement team.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, including analytical procedures and certain tests of detail over
specific balances and transactions, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These,
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £1.9 million (2013: £1.8 million).
How we determined it 5% of underlying operating profit, being operating profit before amortisation of intellectual property
and intangibles recognised on acquisition and exceptional items. This is consistent with the prior year.
Rationale for benchmark applied We considered this to be the key financial benchmark used by the key stakeholders to evaluate
performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1 million (2013:
£0.1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 48, in relation to going concern. We have
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that
the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 42, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Lavendon Group plc 2014   81
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2014
1.   BASIS OF PREPARATION
General information
Lavendon Group plc (‘the Company’ or with its subsidiaries ‘the Group’) is the European and Middle Eastern market leader in the rental of
powered access equipment operating a fleet of approximately 20,000 machines through a network of 75 active depots located in Belgium,
France, Germany, the UK and a number of countries in the Middle East.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 15 Midland Court, Central Park, Lutterworth, Leicestershire LE17 4PN.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS’s”)
and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group
financial statements have been prepared, on a going concern basis, on a consistent basis, under the historical cost convention as modified
by financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss. A summary of the more significant
Group accounting policies is set out in note 30.
The Parent Company has not adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. Its results, reported under UK GAAP , are detailed on
pages 109 to 115.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount,
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. All material
intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been
adopted across the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities which are controlled by the Group. Specifically the Group has control over the investee,
exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its control over the investee to affect
the amount of  the returns from the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Details of the principal subsidiaries of the Group are given in note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements on page 112.

2.   SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The internal reporting arrangements for Lavendon Group plc comprises of five operating segments based on the geographical locations of
the UK, the Middle East, Germany, France and Belgium and one non operating Corporate cost centre. The Corporate cost centre comprises
the Group directorate, statutory compliance and Group functions and holds the Group’s bank borrowing facilities.
The Group’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Group Board. The Group Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order
to monitor and assess performance of the operating segments for the purpose of making decisions about allocation of resources.
Performance is evaluated based on actual results compared to agreed targets and performance in prior periods.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. Accordingly, the standard rate of corporation
tax applied to the Group’s UK profits for the accounting period is 21.50%.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK will be further reduced to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This change was substantively
enacted on 2 July 2013 and is therefore reflected in the deferred tax balances in the financial statements for the current and previous years.

Underlying earnings per share
Basic 24,078 167.0 14.42p
Diluted 24,078 168.2 14.32p
Earnings per share are calculated on the 168,556,682 weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended
31 December 2014 (year ended 31 December 2013: 167,014,501).
Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares which arise from share incentive scheme
awards granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary share capital
during the year. The effect of this dilution is to increase the weighted average number of ordinary shares to 169,729,849 (year ended
31 December 2013: 168,158,046).
Underlying earnings per share is presented to exclude the impact of amortisation charges and exceptional items in the year and their
associated tax effect. The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provides additional relevant information about underlying
business performance.

The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of 3.20 pence per ordinary share
which will distribute an estimated £5,406,000 of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 23 April 2015 to those shareholders who are on the
register at 6 March 2015 subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated, at date of acquisition, to the cash generating unit that benefited from that
business combination. The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Where there is a change in the way the Group manages and operates the goodwill allocation to individual cash generating units is
reviewed and reallocated where appropriate.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. For the purpose of
determining potential goodwill impairment, recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections
based on financial plans covering a three year period. The growth rate assumptions used in the plans are based on past performance and
management’s expectations of market developments. The growth rate assumptions used to determine the cash flows beyond the three
year period are 2% for UK and Germany and 1% for Belgium (2013: 2% for UK, Germany and Belgium). The pre-tax rate used to discount
the projected cash flows for the UK is 10.0% (2013: 11%), for Germany it is 10.0% (2013: 10%) and for Belgium it is 12.3% (2013: 11%).
The impairment review identified that an exceptional impairment charge of £8,868,000 (2013: £Nil) was required against the goodwill
arising on the acquisition of dk Rental N.V in Belgium. No other impairment charges were identified.
The impairment review for Germany identified headroom of £12,905,000 (2013: £8,497,000) against the carrying value of the assets.
No additional impairment would be required for Germany if any of the following were to occur: if the pre-tax rate used to discount the
projection cash flows increased by 1.7% to 11.7%, or if the long term growth assumption reduced by 2.0% to nil or if projected earnings
before interest, taxation and amortisation in the periods beyond the initial three year period is reduced by 20%.

In addition, the Group issued two new loan notes on the US Private Placement market, each with a value of €17.5 million, finally maturing in August 2021 and August
2024 respectively. Costs of £366,000 associated with the two new US Private Placements are being amortised over the term of each loan note, split equally for each note.
Following the refinancing, the Group’s debt facilities total c.£175 million and comprise revolving bank facilities of £50 million and €60 million together with US Private

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the overall cost of capital.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital risk management during the year.
Consistent with other companies in the rental industry, the Group monitors capital by measuring the return on capital employed and the
ratio of net debt to equity:
2014 2013
£’000 £’000
Total borrowings (note 19) 108,238 117,836
Less: unamortised debt issue costs (note 19) (904) (687)
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 16) (17,660) (20,123)
Net debt after unamortised debt issue costs 89,674 97,026
Total equity 220,620 211,165
Debt to equity ratio 41% 46%
Return on capital employed 12.1% 10.6%
The ratio of net debt to equity decreased during the year, due to the reduction in the level of net debt and the increase in total equity
that was principally derived from profits generated during the year. During the year the Group has complied with its banking covenants,
and expects to remain compliant for the foreseeable future.

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The Group has exposure to the following principal risks:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management policy aims to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial markets on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally by the Group except for customer credit risk which is the responsibility of each operational entity.
1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s income, or its financial instruments, will be affected by changes in market prices, for example interest
rates or foreign exchange rates. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. The risk is currently managed by
maintaining a proportion of borrowings at fixed interest rates, principally the loan placements undertaken in 2012 and 2014.
The Group also has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. This risk is minimised through the use of foreign currency
borrowings and net investment hedging. The effect on the Group’s 2014 results due to movements in foreign exchange rates is presented
in the Strategic Report on pages 27 to 32.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Such risk arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash and bank balances.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is shown in the table below:
2014 2013
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents (note 16) 17,660 20,123
Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments (note 15) 60,355 54,402
78,015 74,525
Cash and cash equivalents
Surplus cash is held in current and deposit accounts with established financial institutions. No material amounts are held in financial
institutions with a Moody’s credit rating below Baa.
Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure to customers is the responsibility of each operation who have formal credit policies in place to
mitigate this risk. The credit policies require that the credit worthiness of a customer is assessed prior to trading and that the level of
exposure to that customer remains within agreed credit limits. To support these policies, the Group maintains credit insurance for
certain operating subsidiaries.
The Group’s only exposure to concentrations of credit risk is to geographic and industry sector risk. As set out in the Strategic Report on
pages 7 to 32 the construction sector is an important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. This exposure is actively managed
with efforts being focused on widening the Group’s customer base to other sectors.
No individual customer makes up more than 3% of revenue (2013: 3%). 22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

The Group defines impaired receivables to include those subject to legal action for recovery or that are considered unrecoverable due to
financial difficulties.
The carrying amount of the Group’s trade and other receivables excluding prepayments are denominated in the following currencies:
2014 2013
£’000 £’000

Euros 13,200 15,384
Middle East currencies 24,442 18,347
60,355 54,402
3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a balance
between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective borrowing structure. The Group has committed bank facilities of £50 million and
€60 million which finally mature in July 2019. In addition the Group has made three loan placements with values of €60 million and two with
a value of €17.5 million each, that finally mature in July 2019, August 2021 and August 2024 respectively. This is supplemented by hire
purchase and finance lease facilities. The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit lines available to supplement cash
flows generated from trading to meet known obligations in the next twelve months. An analysis of liquidity risk, being the maturity of
financial liabilities and the undrawn committed borrowing facilities is presented in note 21.
The Group’s financial liabilities are analysed in note 20.

The movements during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as
permitted by IAS 12) are shown in the table below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable
right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
During the year, a deferred tax asset has been recognised relating to brought forward tax losses with a value of £18,905,000
(2013: £22,093,000). Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that there is convincing evidence to
support the realisation of the related tax benefit through future profits.
There are unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to trading losses in overseas operations. The losses which have not been recognised
amount to £18,812,000 (2013: £22,190,000). The tax values associated with these losses are £5,116,000 (2013: £6,129,000).

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has operated five equity settled compensation plans:
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Company Share Option Plan (the “Employee Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group Share Matching Plan 2005 (the “Plan”);
• the Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”); and
• the Lavendon Group Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”).
The total charge for the year relating to the five equity settled compensation plans was £501,000 (2013: £646,000), all of which related to
equity settled share based payment transactions. After deferred tax (debited)/credited to the income statement, the total charge was
£480,000 (2013: £761,000).
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on 10 October 1996. The Company has made periodic grants of options under both
schemes, details of which are given in the Directors’ report on pages 37 to 42. Both the Employee Scheme and the Executive Scheme
closed in October 2006. Consequently no further awards have been made since that date.
The fair value of the share options is based on historic volatility of the share price over the last five years. The expected life is the average
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.
A reconciliation of the option movements over the year to 31 December 2014 is shown below:

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Long term incentive plan
The Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) was approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2006.
2011 and 2012 awards:
The performance condition is based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the performance of the FTSE
Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts over the performance period. The number of shares which vest is dependent upon relative
achievement against agreed criteria.
2013 and 2014 awards:
There are two performance conditions applying to the 2013 and 2014 awards. 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition
comparing the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE Small Cap Index
(excluding investment trusts and financial services companies) over three years commencing on the date of grant of the award.
The remaining 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition based on the average Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of
the Group over three financial years ending on 31 December. A general performance underpin also applies. The number of shares
which vest under both performance conditions is dependent upon relative achievement of each condition against agreed criteria.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards made in 2014 are detailed below:
TSR ROCE
Share price at grant date (pence) 230 230
No. of employees 36 36
Rights granted 464,458 464,458

Share Incentive Plan (“The SIP”)
In November 2007 the Group introduced the Lavendon Group plc Share Incentive Plan.
13,256 SIP shares (2013: 126,969) were issued during the year of which 5,302 shares were SIP matching shares (2013: 47,544).
The fair values are calculated by applying the following models:
Share Incentive Plan – Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Nil pence per share
Expected share price volatility 30.0% – 34.8%
Expected share price volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised daily volatility of the share price over the preceding three years.
Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield
Risk-free interest 4.5%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. 26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impact of new accounting standards continued
As of the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards were in issue but not yet endorsed by the EU. These
standards were available for early adoption but the Group has not applied these standards in the preparation of the financial statements.
Adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the Group:
• Amendment to IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’ on defined benefit plans
• Annual improvements 2012
• Annual improvements 2013
New or revised accounting standards and interpretations issued by 31 December 2014 but not yet effective are listed below:
• IFRS9 ‘Financial instruments’ − classification and measurement
• Amendment to IFRS9 ‘Financial instruments’ regarding general hedge accounting
• Amendment to IAS16 ‘Property plant and equipment’ and IAS38 ‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation
• IFRS15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue from rental fleet hire is recognised on a daily basis over the period of hire when the Group can reliably measure the likely flow
of economic benefits. Other revenue, including the sale of new and ex-rental fleet equipment, is recognised as at the point at which the
goods or services are delivered to and accepted by the customer.
The Group rents equipment under short term arrangements that are cancellable by the customer on demand. These are treated as
operating lease arrangements.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, that is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,
has been identified as the Group Board.
The operating segments are the main geographic areas in which the Group operates together with one non operating corporate cost
centre. The Group’s main geographic areas are the UK, the Middle East, Germany, France and Belgium.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are
subject to effective cash flow or net investment hedges which are recorded in equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items are
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where effective, are taken to equity. Tax charges and credits attributable
to those exchange differences are also taken directly to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.

Notes to the financial statements

30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position at
each reporting date.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial instruments held for trading and those assets designated
at fair value through profit or loss. A financial instrument is classified in this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling or
repurchasing in the short term or if it is a financial instrument so designated by management on initial recognition. Derivative financial
instruments are included as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Items in this category are classified as current assets
or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised costs are non-derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are initially measured at fair value. Other liabilities at amortised cost are initially
recognised at fair value. They are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance
sheet date, which are classified as non-current liabilities.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are included in the
income statement in the period in which they arise. Loans and receivables and other liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. Impairments of such financial assets are recorded in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for equipment rental or other products or services performed in the ordinary course
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility,
that are not separately identifiable are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as:
• cash flow hedges – hedges of floating interest rate transactions; or
• net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Movements on the hedging reserves in equity are

Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss
(for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included
in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is
recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and
losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in
the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of
business on the balance sheet date. Financial assets held by the Group are valued on a mark to market basis by financial institutions.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value
for the remaining financial instruments.
Fair value measurements are undertaken using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements,
according to the following levels:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in financial liabilities – borrowings.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and
• it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are recorded
separately in the financial statements where material.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
Where the Group expects amounts to be received in relation to a provision, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when
its receipt is considered certain.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments in value. Cost includes
the initial purchase price of the asset and any directly attributable costs of bringing it into its intended use. Additional transportation costs
incurred to move existing fleet between operating segments are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided
on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful
lives. Estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows:
Useful lives Residual values
Short leasehold properties the lease period nil
Rental fleet 7 to 13 years 5-20%
Office fixtures and equipment 3 to 4 years nil
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years nil
Residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable
net assets of a subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the
accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill
exceeds its fair value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary
on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Other intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured
reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria
are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition are detailed in note 12. They are estimated to have asset lives in the range of 1 to 6 years and
are amortised on a straight-line basis accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014 105
30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Other intangible assets continued
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will
generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property comprises trademarks and patents which are initially recognised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over
a period of up to 5 years.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). In
assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the cash generating units are discounted to their present value using a
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and associated risks.
The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in
the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Following the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in 2006, the Group now has an obligation to a single ex-employee of the
Gardemann group under a defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is unfunded, but a full provision of £159,000 (2013: £171,000),
based on an actuarial valuation, is included in the Group’s balance sheet under accruals. Given the immateriality of this single obligation to
the Group as a whole, management do not consider the full disclosure required by IAS19 (revised) – “Retirement Benefits” to be
appropriate in this instance.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Inventories
Inventories, comprising ex-rental fleet equipment available for sale, third party equipment purchased for resale, machine spare parts and
consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost basis used within the Group is a ‘First In First Out’ or FIFO
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Ex-rental fleet disposals are transferred to inventory prior to external sale or scrappage.
Taxation including deferred tax
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred
taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
amounts can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received under
such plans is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model
for share option schemes and in the case of share matching plans and the long-term incentive plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of
any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share
incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are
expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertaking, with a corresponding credit to equity. This does not have an impact
on the Group’s financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group
Balance Sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding
bank overdrafts.
Key assumptions and estimates
Significant estimates have been used in respect of the calculation of the residual values of property, plant and equipment, the calculation
of any impairment to the carrying value of goodwill, the valuation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, and the trade
receivables provision.
The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are estimated based on management’s historic experience of
disposals of such used equipment and their judgement of the current market conditions.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using estimating long-term growth rates and
appropriate discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of future prospects. Other intangible assets are
tested for impairment if there are indications they might be impaired. Full details of the assumptions used are given in note 12.
The fair value of intangibles recognised on acquisition is derived from a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation
with independent valuers.
The trade receivables provision is based on management’s best estimate of the recoverability of specific customer balances, after taking
into account the recent payment experience, underlying economic climate and discussions with key customers.
Equity settled share based payment schemes require management to estimate the fair value of each award at the grant date and estimate
the number of options expected to vest by adjusting for expected leavers. In making these assumptions management apply option pricing
models using externally obtainable actual and historic inputs where possible. The expected number of leavers is based on historic trends
and is adjusted based upon management’s judgement where considered appropriate.
Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items to be those that, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the
financial statements in order to better understand the underlying performance of the Group. These include, but are not limited to, costs
of reorganisation and restructuring, impairment of non-current assets, significant one-off financing costs and significant one-off claims.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 42, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Notes to the Company’s financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2014
1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable
Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques have been applied
consistently and are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences
are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are included at cost stated at the historical Sterling value at the time of investment other than where overseas investments
are hedged by foreign currency borrowings in which case the investment is included at cost, restated at the year end Sterling value at the
balance sheet date and any exchange movement is taken to reserves. Where appropriate, the carrying values of fixed asset investments
are measured by reference to their discounted future operational cash flows, or their imputed resale value, and provision is made for any
diminution in value where necessary.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans on behalf of the Group. The amounts in the
Company are immaterial and are therefore not disclosed.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Fair value is
determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Share Incentive Plan, and in the case of
Share Matching Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the vesting
period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non- market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of
the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the
remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company
and the Group.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the
dividends are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility,
that are not separately identifiable, are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014 111
1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit can differ from net profit/loss as reported in the profit and
loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
2.   RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these
financial statements. The Parent Company’s loss after tax for the financial year was £6,153,000 (2013: loss of £3,681,000).
3.   EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
The Company has no employees. Non-Executive directors of the Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details of
Executive and Non-Executive remuneration is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration report on pages 60 to 64.

COVER IMAGE: MUSÉE DU LOUVRE, PARIS
Safely maintaining the world’s
most visited museum
Lavendon’s French business was called on to supply two powered access units to
facilitate some essential building maintenance on the historic Louvre museum
in Paris. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built as a fortress
in the late 12th century under Philip II. Remnants of the original fortress are
visible in the basement of the museum. The building has been extended many
times to form the present Louvre Palace.
Using powered access for the maintenance, avoided the need for unsightly
scaffolding masking the buildings splendour. The units supplied were capable
of reaching all floors of the exterior of the building. Each unit was highly
manoeuvrable, allowing the operator to place the basket precisely where
needed, close to, but not touching the building.

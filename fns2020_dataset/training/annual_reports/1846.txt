GROUP OVERVIEW

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
T
his has been a year 
of rapid progress and 
we have again delivered 
on our key objectives 
of increasing profitability and 
reducing overall indebtedness. 
Profit before tax and exceptional 
items increased by 159.3% to 
£110.7m and net debt reduced 
by nearly 50% to £167 .7m. This 
has been achieved against 
a challenging backdrop of 
economic and consumer 
uncertainty, coupled with 
continuing restrictions on the 
availability of adequate mortgage 
finance, particularly with higher 
loan to value (‘LTV’) products.
The market
The UK housing market has 
remained broadly stable, although 
there were regional variations in 
demand and pricing. Whilst the 
country’s housing needs continue 
to grow, the number of new 
homes being built will only see a 
sustainable increase with a step 
change in mortgage lending.
Some progress was made 
during the year in terms of the 
availability of finance for our 
customers, with higher LTV in the 
new build sector seeing a gradual 
improvement. The launch in July 
2011 of the Government-backed 
FirstBuy shared equity scheme 
has helped to stimulate improved 
demand from first-time buyers. 
The launch, in March 2012, of the 
Government-backed NewBuy 
mortgage indemnity scheme 
should ensure that this progress 
continues by effectively increasing 
to 95% the LTV available to buyers 
of new homes.
Our performance
During the year we made 
significant financial and operational 
improvements across every 
aspect of our business. We have 
further increased our capability 
and our efficiency. We are 
financially stronger and the quality 
of our land bank has improved. 
The objectives of rebuilding 
profitability and reducing overall 
indebtedness, independent 
This has been a year of significantly 
improved financial performance for the 
Group, and we continue to lead the industry 
in levels of quality and customer service.
ANOTHER YEAR  
OF SUBSTANTIAL 
PROGRESS BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 07
of further market improvement, 
are progressing well.
Ensuring that we achieve 
the best price for the homes that 
we build remains a priority and is 
dependent on getting the location, 
product mix, design, branding, 
quality, marketing of our homes 
and customer service absolutely 
right. We have continued to invest 
in all of these areas and our 
industry leadership in the way 
our sites are managed and the 
customer ratings we achieve have 
been externally acknowledged. 
For the third consecutive year 
the Group has been awarded 
Home Builder Federation (‘HBF’) 
5-Star status. This is the highest 
achievable level in terms of 
customer satisfaction and 
recommendation. In addition, 
under the National House-Building 
Council (‘NHBC’) ‘Pride in the Job’ 
scheme our site managers have 
won more quality awards than any 
other housebuilder for the eighth 
consecutive year.
Our new house types are 
even more in tune with customer 
preference and our sales teams 
are supported by an enhanced 
online sales and marketing 
capability. We remain committed 
to the principles of getting it right 
first time, enhancing the customer 
experience and reducing the cost 
of doing business.
Investing in land 
for higher returns
The primary driver of the Group’s 
profit growth was the increased 
proportion of completions from 
newer, higher margin land. During 
the period 4,381 completions 
(35%) were on newer, higher 
margin land and in 2012/13 we 
expect this to increase to just over 
50% of completions. The land we 
have bought since re-entering the 
land market in 2009 currently 
meets or exceeds the minimum 
hurdle rates set on acquisition – 
namely, a 20% gross margin and 
a 25% return on capital based on 
operating profit.
Dividend policy
No dividend will be paid in respect 
of the 2011/12 financial year. 
However, the Board recognises 
the importance of both capital 
growth and dividend income 
to our existing and potential 
shareholders and is committed 
to re-introducing the payment of 
dividends. Assuming a continuing 
stable housing market, the Board 
expects to recommence dividend 
payments, with a conservative 
dividend cover, by proposing 
a final dividend in respect of the 
financial year to 30 June 2013, 
payable in the final quarter of 
2013. The Board intends to 
adopt a progressive dividend 
policy as profitability grows, with 
the aim, over time, of achieving a 
target dividend cover of around 
three times.
In addition, we remain 
committed to operating with 
an appropriate land bank and 
continuing to reduce overall 
indebtedness.
The Board
In April 2012, Richard Akers joined 
us as a Non-Executive Director. 
He has broad business experience 
and a deep knowledge of the 
property market from a 
commercial and retail perspective, 
complementing the existing 
skills of the Board. 
In July 2012, Clive Fenton 
resigned as a Director of the 
Company and we appointed 
Steven Boyes to a new role 
of Chief Operating Officer 
responsible for housebuilding 
operations. Steven, who joined 
the Board in 2001, is one of the 
most experienced housebuilding 
executives in the UK.
In July 2012, we also announced 
that Bob Davies, after eight years 
of service, will step down as a 
Non-Executive Director at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
in November this year. Subject 
to their election and re-election at 
the AGM, Mark Rolfe will take over 
as Senior Independent Director 
and Richard Akers will take over 
as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. I would like to thank 
Bob for the outstanding 
contribution that he has made 
to the Group during a period 
of immense change.
Our employees
The rapid progress we have made 
this year, in a market that remains 
challenging, is a great credit  
to the management of the 
Group and its employees. There 
is a wealth of experience within 
the leadership team, ably 
supported by our employees 
across the country. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank 
them for their commitment and 
outstanding contribution to the 
Group’s performance. 
The future
Inevitably there is ongoing 
economic uncertainty in the UK 
market and as such we do not 
expect to see significant growth 
in customer demand over the 
next year. However, the strategy 
we are pursuing is capable of 
delivering significantly enhanced 
returns without an improvement 
in market conditions. 
We operate throughout 
Great Britain and across a broad 
spectrum of the market. We are 
able to deliver a wide range of 
housing projects from traditional 
housing to complex high-rise 
apartment buildings, such as those 
we build in London. We believe 
that this capability, coupled with 
our focus on improving the 
efficiency of everything we do and 
having the best people to deal with 
an increasingly complex regulatory 
and planning environment, offer us 
a significant competitive advantage.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
W
ith a rapidly improving 
performance across 
the Group we have 
made substantial 
progress in achieving our 
objectives of rebuilding profitability 
and reducing overall indebtedness.
In the year, we have achieved 
a 14. 1% increase in revenues, 
a 1.6% increase in operating 
margins before operating 
exceptional costs, a 159.3% 
increase in pre-exceptional pre-tax 
profits and we have almost halved 
our net debt. Despite continued 
uncertainty surrounding the wider 
UK market and constrained levels 
of mortgage finance, we expect 
to make further good progress 
in 2012/13 with more than half 
our completions forecast to be 
delivered from recently acquired 
higher margin land.
Performance
Group revenues for the year 
were up 14.1% to £2,323.4m 
Our objectives of rebuilding profitability 
and reducing overall indebtedness  
have delivered a rapidly improving 
performance across the Group.

OF OBJECTIVES AND

(2011: £2,035.4m), with 
completions (excluding joint 
ventures) up 14.1% to 
12,637 units. We have enjoyed 
more stable trading conditions 
throughout the year and were 
able to deliver a strong start to 
our second half following a small 
improvement in mortgage lending.
We have seen higher sales rates 
as an increasing proportion of 
completions are being delivered 
from our more recently acquired 
sites. As at 30 June 2012, we had a 
substantially strengthened forward 
sales position, with private forward 
sales (excluding joint ventures) up 
35.5% to £366.9m (201 1: £270.8m).
Profit from operations before 
operating exceptional items 
increased by 41.6% from £135.0m 
to £191.1m, with a significant 
improvement in operating margin 
before operating exceptional items 
to 8.2% (2011: 6.6%) for the 
full year and to 9.5% (2011: 7 .9%) 
in the second half. Profit  
before tax and exceptional  
items increased by 159.3%  
to £110.7m (2011: £42.7m).
In the year we reported 
exceptional items of £10.7m, 
relating to the acquisition  
of a partner’s 50% interest 
in a residential development, 
consequently profit before tax 
after exceptional items was 
£100.0m (2011: loss £11.5m).
Our improved operational 
efficiency, continued tight control 
over the timing of land expenditure 
and working capital commitments, 
and receipts from land sales 
enabled us to reduce net debt 
to £167 .7m as at 30 June 2012 
(2011: £322.6m).
Our objectives
Our strategic objectives remain 
clear – to rebuild profitability and 
reduce overall indebtedness – 
and we have made considerable 
progress in both of these areas 
during the year.
We have set out three priorities 
to enable us to rebuild profitability:
•	 optimise selling prices;
•	improve operational efficiency; and
•	 deliver targeted land buying.
Optimise selling prices
We have embedded disciplines 
within the organisation to ensure 
we continue to focus on securing 
the best price for every sale – 
thereby maximising value rather 
than just driving volumes.
Average selling prices 
increased to £180,500 (2011: 
£178,300), with private average 
selling prices increasing by 1.5% 
to £201,800 (2011: £198,900), 
driven by a small positive change 
in mix. Overall, underlying prices 
have remained broadly stable, 
with continued variations by 
region. There is, in particular, 
a greater robustness in pricing 
in London and the South East.
During the year we had higher 
sales rates across the Group with 
average net private reservations 
per active site per week increasing 
to 0.52 (2011: 0.44). Sales rates 
have been more consistent during 
 Our strategic 
objectives remain clear 
– to rebuild profitability 
and reduce overall 
indebtedness – and 
we have made 
considerable progress 
in both of these areas 
during the year.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF  
EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
the year reflecting a greater stability 
in market conditions than we have 
seen for some time. We saw 
a particularly strong start to the 
2012 spring selling season and 
took advantage of this to deliver 
additional completions from  
our older, lower margin land.
Our sales strategy is focused 
on offering our customers the 
highest quality products and 
service. For the third year running 
we have achieved the HBF’s 
5-Star status, meaning that more 
than 90% of our customers were 
satisfied with the service they 
received. Our site managers 
have won more NHBC ‘Pride in 
the Job’ awards than any other 
housebuilder for the eighth 
year running.
Both the Barratt and David 
Wilson house ranges have been 
re-designed and updated following 
customer research to be even 
more attractive to potential buyers. 
We now have the new house types 
on 125 of our developments.
We continue to focus on 
our predominantly web-based 
marketing strategy with our Barratt 
Homes and David Wilson Homes 
websites receiving on average 
around 160,000 visits per week. 
Our online presence has been 
substantially enhanced through 
the launch of our new look 
websites, which give consumers 
significantly more information 
about individual properties and 
the locality, as well as additional 
services such as mortgage 
calculators and school finders.
Improve operational 
efficiency
Driving operational efficiency 
has remained a significant focus 
for the Group. We continue to 
retain a firm control on costs, 
in particular capitalising on our 
scale and technical resources 
to maximise efficiency.
Our supply contracts for

CASE STUDY 
Delivering new land
At the edge of Coxhoe, a former mining village south of Durham,  
you will find our development ‘The Limes’, comprising 80 attractive 
houses with a mix of 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes of traditional and 
contemporary design.
Today’s bright future for the site, with both new housing and 
commercial use, disguises its chequered past. The site had remained 
derelict since 1980 after the closure of the Steetley Lime Works, which 
opened prior to the First World War. Before this, the site had also been 
used for mining and as a railway siding.
To develop the site was a challenge. Detailed investigations confirmed 
that the ground contained demolition debris and spoil heaps, underlain 
by glacial clays and coal seams, which had previously been worked at 
shallow depth.
Working in partnership with another local developer, we obtained 
planning permission for a mixed use development, and a comprehensive 
remediation programme was completed. This included the removal 
of contaminated debris, earthworks, the treatment of contaminated soil 
on site and the removal of Japanese Knotweed. A clay capping layer and 
top soil for the public open space and garden areas were also provided.
Today, ‘The Limes’ is set to become a thriving community. 
Coxhoe Village has a range of local amenities, including a school, 
shops and a medical centre, and it is also close to the A1(M) motorway 
for easy access to the major 
business centres of the North 
East and further afield. The 
good location and the quality 
of the development mean that, 
as at 30 June 2012, 36 of the 
houses have been sold and 
just over a third of the homes 
already occupied. 1

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
We continue to review our 
supply chain to create efficiencies 
by introducing new suppliers and 
altering build specifications where 
appropriate. Standard house-type 
costs are benchmarked across 
the Group continuously to ensure 
the lowest cost is achieved 
whilst maintaining the quality 
of our homes.
Going forward, it is likely that 
some pressure will continue to be 
felt as raw material prices rise due 
to underlying commodity price 
increases. However, we will seek 
to mitigate this by continuing to 
drive further efficiency savings 
and reductions in operating costs 
across the business. 
The Group promotes and 
shares best practice in the build 
process across all divisions and, 
to date, significant cost savings 
have been identified through 
this work. Cost savings have 
also been identified by agreeing 
changes to processes and 
introducing new technologies 
which improve our efficiency. 
The benefits of these savings 
will continue to be realised in 
the next few years.
Targeted land buying
Our aim is to optimise the value 
and cash generation from our 
existing land holdings, whilst 
bringing more recently acquired 
higher margin land into production 
as quickly as possible.
We have a disciplined and 
targeted land buying strategy that 
has clearly defined risk-related 
hurdle rates. During the year, we 
agreed terms on £578.1m of land 
purchases, totalling 12,085 plots. 
We have maintained our discipline 
of not chasing prices up and have 
continued to adopt an acquisition 
strategy that is not unduly 
concentrated on any specific 
geographic area. We have 
continued to see prices for land 
firming in the South East as other 
housebuilders target this area.
Total cash expenditure on 
land in the year was £397 .4m 
(2011: £261.0m).
We favour deferred terms, 
with the objective of matching 
our revenue and costs as closely 
as possible to maximise returns. 
Land creditors as at 30 June 2012 
were £726.1m (2011: £700.7m). 
Land creditors due within the 
next 12 months total £368.1m 
(2011: £349.1m), with £358.0m 
(2011: £351.6m) due thereafter, 
and in overall terms these equate

to 35% of our owned land bank. 
In the period to 30 June 2013, 
we expect land creditors to remain 
fairly constant as a proportion of 
the land bank, dependent upon 
the satisfaction of contractual 
conditions, for example, the  
grant of planning permission.
We are making good progress 
in moving our land bank from 
older to newer land, with impaired 
plots falling to 6,666 as at 30 June 
2012 (2011: 10,292), representing 
12% (2011: 17%) of the total 
owned and conditional land bank 
by plots. We expect impaired 
plots to reduce to around 4,500 
by 30 June 2013. During the year 
we sold parcels of impaired land, 
where it made economic sense  
to do so, incurring an operating 
loss. We will continue to review 
potential land sales on a limited 
number of sites where we 
consider that a sale would realise 
a greater net present value  
than development of the site.
In the year, more than a third 
of completions were from more 
recently acquired land and we 
continue to expect this proportion 
to increase to just above 50% 
in 2012/13 and around two-thirds 
in 2013/14. This newer land 
continues to perform in line with, 
or above, the minimum hurdle 
rates set on acquisition, namely 
a 20% gross margin and a 25% 
return on capital based on 
operating profit.
We have detailed planning 
consents for 96% of expected 
completions for 2012/13, and 
outline consent on a further 2%.
We have targeted a shorter 
land bank to improve capital 
efficiency and, as at 30 June 
2012, the Group’s owned land 
bank totalled 43,897 plots (2011: 
47 ,917) with an additional 10,312 
plots (2011: 12,166 plots) under 
conditional contracts, giving 
a total of 54,209 plots (2011: 
60,083 plots). This equates to 
approximately 4.3 years (2011: 
4.8 years) of owned and controlled 
land based on 2011/12 completion 
volumes. Over the next couple 
of years, we expect to maintain 
our owned and unconditional 
land bank, when seen relative 
to prior year completion volumes, 
at around three-and-a-half years’ 
supply, and the conditional land 
bank at around one year’s supply. 
The land bank owned by Group 
joint ventures is 1,120 plots (2011: 
1,625 plots).
In addition, we have c. 10,500 
(2011: c. 11,400) acres of strategic 
land which are regularly 
reassessed until the necessary 
planning consents are obtained. 
This land is carried at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value, 
minimising our exposure to risk. 
In the year 701 plots were 
transferred from strategic land to 
our operational land bank. Strategic 
land is expected to produce 
an increasing proportion of our 
operational land in future years.
Reducing overall 
indebtedness
Our second key objective is 
reducing overall indebtedness.
At 30 June 2012 net debt 
had fallen to £167 .7m, down from 
£322.6m at the same point in the 
previous year. The better than 
expected performance on 
reducing net debt was the result 
of a number of factors, including 
strong control of working capital, 
higher completion numbers, timing 
of land acquisitions, a lower 
investment per site and realising 
cash from other assets. 
We were able to take 
advantage of stronger market 
conditions during the second half 
of the year to increase sales on 
impaired sites which generated 
additional cash. We also sold 
three sites acquired before 2008, 
which had subsequently been 
impaired, for total cash proceeds 
of £15.2m and a net operating 
loss charged to normal trading of 
£4.6m. We will continue to target 
additional sales to generate cash 
from impaired sites where we 
consider such a sale will realise  
a greater net present value than 
the development of it.
One of the key factors driving 
down debt has been the focus on 
smaller sites of, on average, 110 
plots predominantly for houses 
rather than flats. The new sites 
have greater potential for 
standardised product and lower 
infrastructure expenditure, which 
result in a significantly lower 
average investment per site.
Sizing our business and 
target funding structure
We have reviewed the size and 
structure of our business taking 
account of current market 
conditions, including mortgage 
availability. We are confident that 
our current operational structure 
is ‘fit for purpose’ and that it is 
realistic, over time, to move to 
around 450 active sites (2012: 
average of 387 sites), which 
would result in around 15,000 
completions including those 
from our joint ventures (‘ JVs’) 
(2012: 12,857).
In light of these plans for the 
business and our ongoing focus 
to reduce overall indebtedness, 
it is our intention that by 2015 
we will achieve a target funding 
structure with no net debt at 
the financial year end date. 
Accordingly, our shareholders 
and land vendors (in the form of 
land creditors) will fund our land 
bank and long-term work in 
progress whereas our lending 
syndicate will fund our annual 
working capital requirements.
Government policy
The Government sees the 
acceleration of housebuilding as 
an important economic objective. 
The Government’s housing 
strategy, published in autumn 
2011, contained a number 
of initiatives, including proposals 
to improve the availability of 
mortgage finance via a mortgage 
indemnity scheme, to reform the 
planning regime and to release 
further public sector land. 
The NewBuy mortgage 
indemnity scheme was 
subsequently introduced in 
March 2012 and has the potential 
to significantly improve the loan 
to value offered in the new build

Emerson housetype – a 5 bedroom detached

continue to expect this 
proportion to increase 
to just above 50% in 
2012/13...  1

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Although planning reform 
was introduced via the National 
Planning Policy Framework, it is 
unlikely that this will have a material 
short-term effect on the Group. 
We continue to move to a more 
‘localist’ approach in the way in 
which we seek to secure planning, 
with new procedures for earlier 
and fuller consultation with local 
residents. In the year, our scheme 
at Pickering Park in Yorkshire was 
the winner of the National 
Housebuilder Best Community 
Initiative Award.
The release of public land 
remains an important part of the 
Government’s strategy to increase 
housing supply. This land is 
particularly attractive where it is 
brought to the market with the 
potential for ‘build now pay later’ 
terms. Since 2009 we have 
secured more than 9,000 plots 
across 33 sites with a gross 
development value (‘GDV’) of £1.7 
billion either using the Developer 
Panel approach or via the OJEU.
In September 2012 the 
Government announced 
further measures to stimulate 
housebuilding, including additional 
FirstBuy funding, initiatives 
targeting the private rental market, 
reforms to planning and a 
reduction in the public funding 
requirement on mothballed 
developments.
The mortgage market
The availability and affordability 
of mortgages is a key catalyst for 
underlying housing demand. The 
level of mortgage approvals has 
reduced dramatically from the 
peak seen in 2007 , however 
we have seen a stabilisation 
of mortgage lending over the 
past couple of years. 
The mortgage market for new 
build housing continues to be 
dominated by a limited number 
of lenders. There have been some 
changes in their respective market 
shares during the year, primarily 
driven by the return of building 
societies and the changes in 
lending criteria from certain 
mortgage providers. Some 
lenders still provide a lower 
LTV on new build houses when 
compared with second-hand 
properties – there was typically 
a LTV of 90% on second-hand 
houses and 85% on new build 
houses. However, the majority 
of mortgage providers are now 
moving to a position of equality 
between the second-hand and 
new build markets. For example, 
Lloyds/Halifax increased their 
LTV to 90% on certain new build 
houses in early 2012 and such 
moves should continue to have 
a positive impact on mortgage 
availability for our customers.
The Government continues 
to stimulate the lending market 
sector. However, whilst initial 
customer interest has been 
promising, we will not be able to 
assess the scheme’s full potential 
until the autumn selling season. 
The mortgage interest rates 
associated with the product 
will also be an important factor 
in determining its impact.
During the year, FirstBuy, the 
Government-backed shared equity 
scheme, was an important tool and 
we completed 1,573 sales under 
the scheme. Our success in utilising 
the product meant that our initial 
allocation of £24.9m was increased 
by £13.8m during the year.
Shared equity remained 
an important selling tool given 
the continuing constraints on 
mortgage finance availability. 
During the year, 20.5% (2011: 
22.0%) of total completions were 
supported by shared equity and, 
of this, around two-thirds used 
Government-backed schemes.  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 15
and has launched the indemnity 
scheme NewBuy, which has 
underpinned the return of 95% 
mortgages in the new build 
sector. This is likely to be an 
important support for the 
mortgage market at higher levels 
of LTV, and provides the sector 
with an important advantage 
against the much larger, 
second-hand market.
Partnership and joint 
venture opportunities
During the year we have made 
progress in securing land through 
partnerships and JVs.
Barratt Partnerships, our 
specialist partnership team, working 
with our divisions, secured 1,676 
units on five sites during the year 
through public sector partnerships 
with a GDV of c. £425m. 
We have continued to bid for 
sites through the three area-based 
Development Partner Panels 
(‘DPPs’) that were established 
in 2010 by the Homes and 
Communities Agency. In the year 
we have been successful on three 
bids, and we are actively involved 
in six ongoing bids. 
We believe the Government’s 
intention to increase the release 
of public land to build up to 
100,000 new homes is a positive 
step. We have a proven track 
record of working with public 
sector partners and we are 
well positioned to capitalise 
on this initiative. 
We continue to explore JV 
opportunities which allow us either 
to access projects that may not 
otherwise be available, or to reduce 
the investment required and 
improve the return on capital 
employed through construction 
management or marketing fees.
In prior years, we established 
a portfolio of JVs in London and 
the South East. Our JV partners 
include London & Quadrant 
(‘L&Q’), one of the country’s 
largest Housing Associations, 
and the Wates Group, one 
of the UK’s largest building 
and construction companies.
We have added to this 
portfolio with two more JVs:
•	In March 2012, we signed a 
conditional contract to purchase 
a two-acre edge of the City site 
at Aldgate Place, London. The 
purchase of the site, which is 
being acquired in a 50:50 JV 
between the Group and British 
Land, is conditional on securing 
a revised planning consent for  
a residential-led mixed-use 
development.
•	In July 2012, in partnership 
with L&Q, we acquired an 
8.5 acre site at Fulham Wharf, 
London. The site, which is on 
the north bank of the Thames, 
has a GDV of £420m with 
planning permission for 
463 riverside apartments 
and a new supermarket.
In the year, our JVs delivered 
220 (2011: 93) completions and 
we anticipate that completions 
will increase further as our new 
JVs commence.
Commercial developments
Commercial development revenue 
was £36.6m (2011: £49.2m). 
This included revenue from the 
design and build of a foodstore 
in Warrington. The project was 
completed in April 2012. 
Operating profit from the 
commercial development 
business during the year 
was £1.5m (2011: £0.8m).
We were also successful 
during the year in completing an 
agreement for the redevelopment 
of part of Wokingham town 
centre. The redevelopment will 
be delivered in partnership with 
our housebuilding operations 
and is one of a number of 
schemes where our commercial 
and housebuild businesses are 
working together to deliver 
enhanced returns for the Group.
Quality, service and design 
In 2010 and 201 1 we updated 
both the Barratt and David Wilson 
Homes house ranges with internal 
layouts designed around modern 
living. The new designs continue 
to be well received by consumers 
and we continue to roll out both 
new ranges. Our commitment 
to delivering the highest quality 
product and excellent customer 
service has been confirmed by our 
customers both through our internal 
survey where 98% (201 1: 98%) of 
customers would ‘Recommend 
us to a Friend’ and our achievement 
of HBF 5-Star status for a third 
successive year. Our high quality 
housing products have assisted 
our ongoing drive to improve 
profitability, through achieving 
optimum selling prices and 
improving operational efficiency.
Health, safety and the 
environment
The safety of our employees, 
contractors, customers and the 
wider community is fundamental 
to the way in which we operate. 
During the period, our Injury 
Incidence Rate (‘IIR’) was 511 
(2011: 539) per 100,000 persons 
employed, which is a 5% 
decrease year-on-year. We remain 
committed to enhancing health 
and safety and have an Executive 
Health and Safety Committee, 
which reports to the Board, 
to drive further improvement.
We aim to secure a position 
as the lowest cost provider 
complying with the Code for 
Sustainable Homes (the ‘Code’). 
During the year we built 3,820 
homes to Code Level 3 or above, 
of which 868 complied with Code 
Level 4. We are establishing 
improved and lower cost methods 
which allow us to continue to 
reduce the cost of compliance. 
We are also progressing our 
development at Hanham Hall, 
the UK’s first large-scale zero 
carbon housing development. 
We have completed the external 
renovation of the original listed 
Hanham Hall building and we 
are now well advanced with 
the full development of the site.
Outlook
The Group has made significant 
progress in both rebuilding 
profitability and reducing 
indebtedness during the year 
just ended. Despite continued 
uncertainty surrounding the 
outlook for the wider UK market 
and constrained levels of mortgage 
finance, the industry has enjoyed 
a period of relative stability.
Since 1 July 2012, our sales 
performance has been in-line 
with normal seasonal trends. In 
the last nine weeks, net private 
reservations per active site per 
week have averaged 0.50 (201 1: 
0.50) and our private forward order 
book (excluding JVs) currently 
stands at £609.6m (201 1: £528.7m).
Our strategy is capable of 
delivering significantly enhanced 
returns without any improvement 
in market conditions, and in the 
current financial year we expect to 
make further good progress, with 
over half of completions forecast to 
be delivered from our more recently 
acquired higher margin land.

OUR PROGRESS
PROGRESS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR
DELIVERING OUR 
OBJECTIVES
The overriding objectives that we have set for the 
business are to rebuild profitability and reduce overall 
indebtedness. We will do this through focusing on our 
key priorities of optimising prices, driving operational 
efficiencies, targeted land buying, reducing our average 
investment per site and unlocking cash on older land. 
Our progress in these areas is set out below.
REBUILDING PROFITABILITY:
REDUCING OVERALL INDEBTEDNESS:
Optimising prices
We are focused upon margin 
improvement through optimising 
selling prices not pursuing volumes.
Operational efficiency
We continue to focus upon 
ensuring operational efficiency, 
including controlling costs 
throughout the business.
Year end debt
We are focused upon reducing our net 
debt through returning cash on old land 
and reducing our average investment 
per site.
Net cash interest charge
A year round focus on net debt will 
reduce average borrowing levels and 
deliver reduced interest costs.
Targeted land buying
We are investing in land which 
we expect to deliver attractive 
returns in the future.
The average private selling price of our 
homes was £201,800 (2011: £198,900), 
an increase of 1.5% due to mix changes. 
Profit from operations before operating 
exceptional items was £191.1m 
(2011: £135.0m), an increase of 41.6%. 
Operating margin on the same basis 
was 8.2% (2011: 6.6%).
Net debt at 30 June 2012 was £167 .7m, 
£154.9m lower than prior year.
The Group’s net cash interest charge 
for the year was £57 .6m (2011: £70.4m).
During the year we have agreed terms 
on £578.1m of land purchases (2011: 
£454.1m), which equates to 12,085 
(2011: 8,861) plots. Land additions during 
the year were £475m (2011: £395m).

OUR SUSTAINABILITY 
PHILOSOPHIES
We continue to focus on our sustainability 
philosophies: People, Partners, Planet and 
Customers, and our commitment to Health 
and Safety. Our progress in these areas is 
set out below.
People
We recognise that one of our key 
strengths is our people and have 
therefore continued to invest in  
them and their expertise.
Partners
We serve all sectors of the market, creating 
homes for sale and shared ownership and 
work with many partners on a range of 
urban regeneration schemes.
Customers
We are committed to building quality 
homes and our teams seek to ensure 
that our customers are satisfied with  
their new home.
Health and Safety
We seek to manage Health and Safety 
risks throughout our business.
Planet
We seek to manage environmental 
risks throughout our business.
During the year many of our employees 
have benefited from our sales and 
marketing, construction, apprentice, 
graduate and leadership development 
programmes.
Our wide product range varies from 
homes for first-time buyers, family homes 
and flats to social housing. Completions 
for the year were 12,637 (2011: 11,078). 
Social housing accounted for 22.2% 
(2011: 23.8%) of completions. 
We continue to lead the industry in levels 
of customer service and 98% (2011: 98%) 
of our customers independently surveyed 
would ‘Recommend us to a Friend’. We 
have achieved the maximum 5-Star rating 
for customer satisfaction awarded by the 
HBF for a third consecutive year.
Health and Safety is of paramount 
importance for our employees, customers 
and the public. During the year we further 
reduced our Injury Incidence Rate to 511 
(2011: 539) per 100,000 employees.
We continue to make progress in 
developing lower cost solutions to 
meet increasing environmental standards. 
During the year we built 3,820 (2011: 3,071) 
homes that meet Code Level 3 or above, 
and 65% (2011: 67%) of our completions 
were built on brownfield land.

OUR PERFORMANCE

T
his has been a year of 
significant improvement 
for the Group, both 
in terms of increasing 
profitability and reducing net debt, 
despite the continued constraints 
on the availability of mortgage 
finance for our customers. Whilst 
there were variations by region, 
underlying house prices remained 
broadly stable over the year, and 
our improved performance was 
founded on our ability to bring new, 
higher margin land into production. 
Our businesses in London and the 
South East continue to perform 
especially well. 
We delivered a profit from 
operations before operating 
exceptional items of £191.1m 
(2011: £135.0m) at a margin of 
8.2% (2011: 6.6%). After operating 
exceptional items of £nil (2011: 
£7 .7m), our profit from operations 
was £191.1m (2011: £127 .3m).
The increase in operating 
margin before operating 
exceptional items is principally due 
to an increasing proportion of sales 
from more recently acquired higher 
margin land. This, coupled with 
other items, resulted in a gross 
margin of 12.7%, a 1.5% increase 
on the prior year. Administrative 
costs before exceptional 
restructuring costs increased 
year-on-year from £92.8m to 
£105. 1m. Overall, we achieved a 
41.6% improvement in operating 
profit before operating exceptional 
items in the year.
Housebuilding 
During the year, we operated from 
an average of 387 (2011: 364) 
active sites. 
Completions totalled 12,637 
(2011: 11,078), an increase of 
14.1% reflecting the higher 
reservation rate during the year, 
especially in the second half. 
Housebuilding revenue totalled 
£2,286.8m (2011: £1,986.2m). 
Of the housebuilding completions, 
private were 9,832 (2011: 8,444), 
and social were 2,805 (2011: 
2,634). Social housing completions 
represented 22.2% of completions 
in the year, versus 23.8% in the 
This was another year of excellent 
progress in a challenging market, in 
which mortgage availability remains 
at historically low levels.

BUSINESS REVIEW • OUR PERFORMANCE
prior year. In addition, our JVs 
completed 220 (201 1: 93) homes.
Average net private 
reservations per active site per 
week in the second half were 
0.57 (H2 201 1: 0.48), a significant 
improvement on the first half 
performance (H1 2012: 0.48). 
For the full year, average net private 
reservations per active site per 
week were 0.52 (201 1: 0.44). The 
cancellation rate for the full year 
was 18.5% (201 1: 20.6%).
Our average selling price 
increased by 1.2% to £180,500 
(2011: £178,300), mainly as a result 
of a small positive change in mix. 
Overall, underlying sales prices 
were broadly flat in the financial 
year. However, we have seen 
variation by region, with relative 
strength in the South East and, 
in particular, London.
Private average selling prices 
increased by 1.5% to £201,800 
(2011: £198,900) primarily due 
to a number of mix changes, 
including an increased proportion 
of houses compared to flats. 
Seeking to derive the optimum 
sales price on every plot that 
we sell has remained a key focus 
for the business during the year. 
On private completions, we 
achieved a 1.5% increase in  
the average revenue per square 
foot to £203 (2011: £200). 
Our social average selling price 
decreased by 5.9% to £105,700 
(201 1: £1 12,300) due to changes 
in mix and a decrease in the 
average square footage of our 
social completions of 2. 1% to 793 
square foot (201 1: 810 square foot).
Whilst the availability of 
mortgage finance at higher 
LTV ratios remains constrained, 
shared equity products continue 
to be an important sales tool for 
the Group. During the year 20.5% 
(2011: 22.0%) of our completions 
used shared equity products. 
Of these completions, 1,694 
(2011: 609) used one of the 
Government-backed initiatives 
and the remainder used our own 
shared equity schemes.
During the year FirstBuy, 
the Government-backed shared 
equity scheme, was an important 
sales incentive. We completed 
1,573 sales under the scheme. 
Our success in utilising the 
product meant that our initial 
allocation of £24.9m was 
increased by £13.8m during 
the year.
Part-exchange has remained 
an effective selling tool, supporting 
15.1% (2011: 14.6%) of our 
completions in the year. We 
continue to manage carefully 
our commitment and exposure 
to part-exchange properties 
which stood at £80.2m (2011: 
£78.9m) at 30 June 2012.
During the year we have 
continued to drive operational 
efficiencies from strong build 
controls, the use of standard 
house types, waste reduction, 
central procurement, value 
engineering and re-planning of 
sites. We will continue to work 
in partnership with our suppliers 
to find ways to mitigate increases 
in material costs, driving for lower 
total cost solutions whilst 
continuing to maintain our very 
high build standards. We will also 
continue to target further cost 
reductions and efficiency savings 
by further standardisation of 
our specifications, without 
compromising brand differentiators 
or the high quality and safety 
standards that we operate to.
The benefits of our strategies 
of seeking to optimise the sales 
price of every plot, controlling our 
costs and targeted land buying 
can be seen in the year, with a 
significant improvement in our 
housebuilding operating margin 
before operating exceptional items 
to 8.3% (2011: 6.8%) for the full 
year and 9.6% (2011: 8.0%) for the 
second half of the financial year. 
Our housebuilding profit from 
operations before operating 
exceptional items for the year 
was £189.6m (2011: £134.2m). 
After operating exceptional 
items of £nil (2011: £7 .7m), 
the housebuilding profit from 
operations was £189.6m 
(2011: £126.5m). 21 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012
CASE STUDY
Commercial developments 
Conditions in the commercial 
property market outside London 
remain challenging, with a high 
number of available second-hand 
properties impacting design and 
build activity. Weak economic 
growth and a constrained lending 
environment also continue to 
place further restrictions on 
commercial demand. However, 
despite these factors, the 
operating performance from 
our commercial development 
segment improved.
Revenue from the commercial 
developments business totalled 
£36.6m (2011: £49.2m) with a 
profit from operations of £1.5m 
(2011: £0.8m). 
During the year, in addition 
to delivering 49,900 square feet 
of stock property disposals, 
we completed construction of 
a 40,000 square foot foodstore 
in Warrington for a major food 
retailer and the sale of a 41 acre 
site at Kingsway Business Park 
in Rochdale. We exchanged 
contracts to provide a 30,000 
square foot office extension 
at a site in Nottingham, which 
completed in August 2012, and 
we have also recently secured 
an outline consent for an 80 acre 
mixed-use scheme on the 
outskirts of Leicester, which 
we expect to deliver returns 
for both our commercial and 
housebuild operations.
On the retail front, we continue 
to progress our town centre 
redevelopment schemes, 
and during the year, in addition 
to the Wokingham town centre 
scheme, we were also appointed 
development partner on the 
Northern Gateway scheme in 
Chesterfield. This project will 
see the redevelopment of part 
of Chesterfield city centre, 
providing 267 ,000 square feet 
of commercial space.
In June 2012, we re-launched the websites for Barratt, David Wilson and 
Ward Homes to improve both their content and search options, enabling 
customers to identify more easily the properties of interest to them.
At the same time, we improved the online experience for our 
customers whilst ensuring that we delivered more high quality sales 
leads to the business.
Our aim is to take advantage of the fact that more people now 
start their search for a new home online. This year, over eight million 
potential customers have visited our websites, and we have continued 
to invest significantly in our online presence to ensure that our websites 
lead the industry.
During the development stage of our new websites, we undertook 
extensive customer research on the design and content of the sites. 
The feedback suggested users wanted greater ability to search our 
various developments, either by geographic location or property price, 
and users also wanted clearer differentiation between our brands.
We have also improved levels of information for potential buy-to-let 
purchasers, and made significant enhancements to our library of 
images. Our images now better demonstrate not only the quality and 
design of the homes we build, but also give an impression of the overall 
development as a place to live.

CASE STUDY
Formerly the site of the local brick-making industry, our 
Renaissance development on Loampit Vale is now at the 
heart of the regeneration of Lewisham’s town centre. It 
will bring a mix of private and social housing, landscaped 
public space and a state-of-the-art fitness centre for the 
local community.
Located in Zone 2, the development is situated opposite 
the Lewisham Docklands Light Railway and rail station with 
excellent transport links into and around central London.
In June 2007 , Lewisham Council began consulting on 
options for the location of the town’s new leisure complex. 
Loampit Vale was chosen and we were invited to work 
in partnership with the Council on redeveloping the site.
We consulted widely with the local community at 
public exhibitions, meetings with community organisations 
and discussions with various public agencies, such as the 
Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment 
and the Greater London Authority.
Following the consultation process, planning was 
granted and in 2008 construction began on the 
development designed by award-winning architects 
Assael Architecture. The scheme comprises 788 high 
quality homes, of which 35% are affordable, set amongst 
private landscaped gardens.
The scheme also includes a new, state-of-the-art 
public leisure centre designed by specialists LA Architects. 
This will include a 25 metre swimming pool, a 20 metre 
teaching pool, an indoor climbing wall, a fitness suite 
and crèche.
The development also includes gardens and squares 
with dedicated indoor and outdoor space for art and 
cultural installations.
Local artist Phil Coy has worked closely with the 
architects to design and install a vibrant, illuminated 
exterior façade. The façade, made up of many coloured 
glass squares, gives the Renaissance development 
landmark status and helps establish Lewisham as 
an exciting new focus for art, culture and leisure.

LAND AND PLANNING
1
Our land bank 
Our land bank consists of both 
owned and controlled plots. At 
30 June 2012, we had 54,209 
(2011: 60,083) owned and 
controlled plots consisting of 
43,897 (2011: 47 ,917) owned and 
unconditional plots and 10,312 
(2011: 12,166) plots under 
conditional contracts. Based 
on 2011/12 completion volumes, 
the owned and controlled land 
bank provides a 4.3 year (2011: 
4.8 year) supply. In addition, we 
have c. 10,500 (2011: c. 11,400) 
acres of strategic land, which are 
regularly reassessed until the 
necessary planning consents are 
obtained. Our strategic portfolio 
is carried at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value, minimising 
our exposure to risk from these 
land holdings. Strategic land 
is expected to produce an 
increasing proportion of our 
operational land in future years.
At 30 June 2012, our land 
bank had a carrying value of 
£2,077 .3m (2011: £2,189.7m) 
with an average housebuilding 
cost per plot of £45,000 (2011: 
£43,600). The average selling 
price of the plots within our land 
bank is currently expected to be 
c. £185,000 giving an average plot 
cost to average selling price ratio 
of 24% (2011: 24%).
Our land bank carrying value 
has been reviewed for impairment 
at 30 June 2012 and no additional 
net exceptional impairment charge 
was required. The impairment 
review includes a net inflation 
allowance for low single-digit 
house price and build cost 
inflation. During the year  
ended 30 June 2012, we have 
experienced regional variations 
in house price movements. 
Should the actual house price 
movements for the 2012/13 
financial year differ from that 
expected in the impairment 
review, then there may be a 
requirement for further 
impairments or reversals in 
impairments in the carrying 
value of our land bank.
Land acquisition 
Each division has a dedicated 
land buying team with local 
knowledge and experience. These 
teams identify land suitable for 
development and secure planning 
permissions to enable new homes 
to be built. This capability, 
combined with our strategic land 
portfolio, is designed to ensure 
that we have sufficient land to 
BUILDING FOR 
THE FUTURE
Our recently acquired land continues 
to perform in line with, or above, 
our required hurdle rates applied 
on acquisition, which include a gross 
margin of at least 20% and a return

meet customer demand. Our 
future growth and profitability 
is influenced by the quality of 
the land that we purchase and 
develop. During the year we 
continued to invest in land which 
met our clearly defined hurdle 
rates in terms of profitability and 
return on capital, providing 
attractive returns at current selling 
prices. For the full year we agreed 
terms on £578.1m of land 
purchases, the majority of which 
we will acquire on the basis of 
deferred payment. This equates 
to 12,085 plots of which 86% are 
for houses. The forecast average 
selling price on this land is  
c. £211,000 based on current 
prices. During the financial year, 
land additions were £475m  
(2011: £395m) and £397 .4m  
(2011: £261.0m) was spent on 
land resulting in land creditors  
at 30 June 2012 of £726.1m  
(2011: £700.7m) of which £368.1m 
(2011: £349.1m) fall due within  
one year. We expect our cash 
expenditure for land to increase 
during our 2013 financial year 
reflecting the payments, as they 
fall due, of deferred amounts  
upon the land purchases acquired 
since re-entering the land market 
in mid-2009. 
Planning 
In the year to 30 June 2009 
we started the re-planning of 
a number of our sites to replace 
flats with houses, a process 
which has continued in the current 
financial year. The proportion 
of our completions which were 
houses in the financial year 
was 68% (2011: 66%). Outside 
London, houses were 75% 
(2011: 74%) of completions. At 
30 June 2012, detailed planning 
consents were in place on 96% 
(2011: 96%) of land required to 
meet our forecast activity for the 
2013 financial year. In addition, 
we had outline planning consents 
on a further 2% (2011: 3%) of our 
forecast completion volumes.
 Our future growth  
and profitability is 
influenced by the  
quality of the land  
that we purchase  
and develop.

W
e have identified and 
assessed the key 
sustainability risks 
facing the business, 
which include Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’) 
risks, and have grouped these into 
four key philosophies so that 
we can manage them effectively. 
The four philosophies: People, 
Partners, Planet and Customers 
are underpinned by our 
commitment to financial 
performance and Health and 
Safety. Each is led by a member 
of the Executive Committee 
who is responsible for developing 
and implementing sustainability 
related objectives and targets to 
achieve the overall sustainability 
strategy set by the Board. 
This ensures that sustainability 
issues are embedded in the 
normal course of business 
and decisions affecting 
sustainability issues can be 
implemented swiftly at an 
operational level. This process 
ensures that adequate information 
in relation to ESG matters is 
available to the Board. Significant 
ESG risks that could impact on 
the future of the business are 
included in the principal risks 
and uncertainties section.
We publish a Sustainability 
Report each year that explains our 
approach and our management of 
sustainability, governance and risk, 
and includes the actions we have 
taken during the year to improve 
sustainability performance. 
Sustainability disclosures in this 
report and the Sustainability 
Report, including disclosures 
on ESG matters, are based on 
information collected annually 
and from regular management 
information. This information is 
subject to independent review 
and internal audit.
People 
One of our key strengths is our 
people. Despite a challenging 
economic backdrop, it is vital 
that we continue to develop their 
expertise. Accordingly, we have 
maintained our investment in 
vocational and leadership training 
programmes, as well as in 
schemes promoting employee 
development, engagement 
and recognition.
The Barratt Academy 
continues to provide structured, 
bespoke training to support 
individual development across 
three separate disciplines;

and technical/commercial roles. 
Combining professional training 
(on-site and in the classroom) with 
industry-recognised qualifications, 
our courses aim to deliver us craft 
and trade specialists, highly 
competent site managers and 
employees with in-depth technical 
and commercial expertise.
The apprenticeship scheme 
comprises both trade and 
technical apprenticeships. 
Apprenticeships last for two  
years and since 2007 over 330 
apprentices have completed 
their training with the Group. 
We are delighted that one of our 
apprentices, who has now been 
put forward for the Group’s 2013 
Assistant Site Manager 
programme, was awarded first 
place in this year’s external Skill 
Build for the Northern Region.
We have a graduate 
development programme which 
aims to recruit high potential talent 
into the business. The programme 
lasts for two years and graduates 
are given the opportunity to spend 
time in each of our operational 
departments, whilst attending 
business and personal 
development courses. Alongside 
the formal training programme, 
graduates are also encouraged 
to undertake voluntary projects 
in their local community as part 
of their project management 
module. We are delighted that 
one of our technical graduates 
won the Rising Star award at 
this year’s National Graduate 
Recruitment Awards.
In addition, we offer specialist 
skills training in core areas, such 
as health and safety, construction 
and design and deliver a suite of 
internally designed and delivered 
management and leadership 
training courses. These are 
designed to assist employees 
develop the skills required 
to progress from middle 
management through to senior 
management and other high 
performance leadership roles. 
We remain focused on 
employee engagement and 
during the year our fifth annual 
engagement survey was 
undertaken. These bespoke 
voluntary surveys allow us to 
develop engagement plans 
throughout the business aimed 
at further improving the Group’s 
relationship with its direct 
employees. We continue to 
recognise outstanding individual 
and team performance across 
the Group through quarterly and 
annual divisional awards and 
annual national awards. In 
addition, we operate an instant 
recognition scheme, which during 
2011/12 has awarded 1,100 prizes.
The expertise of our 
construction teams has again 
been recognised externally, with 
76 (2011: 80) of our Site Managers 
winning ‘Pride in the Job’ quality 
awards from the NHBC. This is 
more than any other housebuilder 
for an unprecedented eighth 
consecutive year.
Our target is to have a 
fully certified Construction 
Skills Certification Scheme 
(‘CSCS’) operational workforce, 
including subcontractors. At 31 
March 2012, 98% (2011: 97%) of 
the Group’s workforce, including 
subcontractors, was fully 
CSCS certified. 
Partners
We recognise that, whether acting 
as sole developer, joint venture 
partner, client or contractor, 
partnerships are vital to our 
success. We operate in many 
areas of the market, from complex 
regeneration to advanced 
environmental housing projects. In 
doing so, we create a legacy that 
goes well beyond the homes and 
commercial properties we build.
We continue to work with 
Government agencies and private 
landowners to identify and bring 
forward land for development, 
often improving its environmental 
condition in the process. We work 
with our suppliers to help them 
introduce the new technologies 
that we need to meet increasingly 
challenging building standards, and 
with our subcontractors to help 
them improve their environmental 
and safety performance.
We engage in dialogue with 
local people and local authorities 
in order to seek to address any 
impact that our developments 
may have on the local 
environment, and we respond to 
community aspirations by creating 
new jobs, training young people 
and supporting local initiatives. 
By holding public exhibitions, 
 …we have maintained 
our investment in 
vocational and 
leadership training 
programmes, as well as 
in schemes promoting 
employee development, 
engagement and 
recognition.

we invite stakeholders to talk 
to our specialist planners and 
architects about their concerns 
and aspirations for our 
developments. We believe 
that a genuinely collaborative 
approach will deliver more land 
and housing with the backing 
of local communities.
We have always been 
concerned with housing 
affordability issues and have 
worked closely with financial 
institutions and Government for 
a number of years to improve 
access to mortgage funding for 
customers. As a result we are 
currently working with a number 
of partners to help people gain 
access to appropriate housing.
We are currently active on 
a number of public and private 
sector partnership sites. Park 
Prewett in Basingstoke and Cane 
Hill in Coulsdon are two schemes 
where we are working closely 
with the Homes and Communities 
Agency. At Scotswood in 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, we are 
partnering with Newcastle City 
Council on a 15-year mixed-use 
project, and in Castlewell in 
Aberdeenshire we are working 
closely with both the local 
community and the Prince’s 
Foundation to develop a master 
plan incorporating 247 homes.
Joint venture and partnership 
opportunities
We continue to explore JV and 
partnership opportunities which 
either allow us to access projects 
that may otherwise not be 
available, or reduce substantially 
the investment required.
Work on site at our major 
partnership developments with 
London & Quadrant (‘L&Q’) 
continue to progress well. The 
27-storey residential tower at  
Alie Street on the edge of the  
City of London was 40% sold  
at 30 June 2012 and work has 
commenced on the Ashburton 
Grove regeneration project 
adjacent to the Emirates Stadium 
in North London, which will create 
375 new homes. In July 2012,  
we announced our third major 
partnership development with 
L&Q at Fulham Wharf. This 
scheme, on the north bank of  
the River Thames, comprises 463 
apartments, a new foodstore and 
a range of food and leisure outlets.

We are committed to our 
sustainability policy and we 
continue to work hard to improve 
the design of both our homes and 
our developments to deliver high 
quality sustainable places to live, 
and also to create accessible 
developments that integrate 
with existing communities.
Through our strict design 
requirements, we have ensured 
that our developments meet a 
benchmark standard, creating 
exemplary schemes which include 
open spaces and communal 
areas. During 2011/12, 145 acres 
of open space were created within 
our developments, and we are 
delighted that our scheme at 
Pickering Community Park 
was the winner of the Best 
Community Initiative at this year’s 
National Housebuilder Awards. 
This scheme incorporated 
community event areas, 
allotments and conservation 
and picnic areas.

post-construction, by undertaking 
significant brownfield 
development, by delivering high 
quality regeneration projects and 
by monitoring our waste and 
energy usage.
In the year to June 2012, 
we built 65% (201 1: 67%) of 
our homes on brownfield land. 
At this year’s National Housebuilder 
Awards, our Bluebell development 
in Nuneaton was the winner of 
the Best Regeneration Project 
Award. In each of our divisional 
offices, Green Teams have been 
established in the last 12 months 
to devise and implement schemes 
to reduce energy usage at a 
local level. In addition, we are 
delighted that three of our 
employees were recognised 
in Building Magazine’s Top 50 
Rising Stars in Sustainability.
We monitor the proportion 
of construction waste segregated 
for recycling on-site, which this 
year improved to 96% (2011: 
95%). In addition, all divisions 
within the Group continue to 
operate an environmental 
management system certified 
to ISO14001 which is subject 
to regular monitoring and audit.
Customers 
Customers are at the heart of 
our business. We understand 
that our customers want support 
when making their purchase, and 
we are committed to offering the 
highest standards of quality and 
customer service, as well as good 
value, well-designed homes.
Our Customer Care Charter
Our Customer Care Charter, 
which is available on our website, 
ensures we remain focused on 
our customers throughout their 
journey with us. We are committed 
to continuing to improve the 
customer experience, both on-site 
and online, and we regularly obtain 
feedback from all our customers 
at key points in the sale process.
New product range
We have carefully considered 
customer preferences in the 
development of the Barratt and 
David Wilson product ranges. 
Both brands have been updated 
in the last year with internal layouts 
designed with modern living in 
mind, providing free flowing living 
areas and natural light. The new 
designs were well received by 
consumers and we continue 
to roll out both new ranges. 
Customer feedback indicates 
that Barratt homes remain value 
for money and offer customers 
high quality practical living space. 
The room proportions have been 
designed to ensure that they are 
large enough to accommodate 
our typical customer’s furniture 
requirements, whilst ensuring our 
external designs are aesthetically 
pleasing. Due to smart, ergonomic 
design a Barratt customer can 
expect a wide range of features, 
creating great value for money.
Following customer feedback, 
our David Wilson family homes 
have been provided with more 
generous circulation space that 
delivers an overall sense of 
grandeur. They include features 
such as more ‘indulgent’ kitchens, 
en-suite bathrooms with larger 
baths and the use of multiple roof 
lights in bedrooms.

Communicating with 
our customers
Our sales and marketing team 
has continued to promote our 
brands throughout the year using 
focused marketing campaigns. 
This included use of the internet, 
radio and direct mail, targeted 
incentives and discounts for 
customers, as well as tools such 
as shared equity products and 
part-exchange.
We recognise that the online 
market continues to change 
at a rapid pace. During the last 
12 months we have enhanced 
the design and content of our 
websites to ensure a customer’s 
first enquiry delivers all the 
information they require. We will 
continue to enhance our online 
user experience and quality of 
content through greater use of 
e-brochures, video, 360 degree 
tours, imagery of planned 
developments and house types, 
in addition to comprehensive 
information about the local area.
We continue to invest in the 
technological capabilities of our 
on-site sales centres, ensuring 
our sales advisers have the  
most up-to-date information 
immediately available to deliver 
a customer experience that is 
informative and hassle-free.
Assisting with 
mortgage products
We recognise the importance 
of helping our customers find 
suitable financial products to 
purchase their new homes. The 
Group’s Head of Mortgage Lender 
Relations works closely with the 
banks that provide mortgages 
to our customers to ensure that 
there is an appropriate range 
of products available. We also 
participate as fully as we can 
in the Government-backed 
schemes, such as FirstBuy 
and NewBuy.
All our divisions and brokers 
have implemented our Group-
wide processes for dealing with 
lenders and surveyors. These 
ensure that we provide them 
with transparency in relation 
to our products and the financial 
arrangements between the Group 
and our customers. These 
standards exceed the industry 
requirements as specified by 
the Council of Mortgage Lenders 
and the processes are subject 
to regular internal audit. 
In addition to existing lenders, 
we actively pursue relationships 
with prospective new lenders to 
the UK new build market in order 
to support the development of 
new financial products. Most 
recently this has taken the form 
of affordable ‘top-up loans’ on 
a secured and unsecured basis 
which give customers access to 
alternative means of bridging the 
deposit gap.
Customer satisfaction
Our high quality homes have 
been recognised independently by 
the achievement for the third year 
running of 5-Star builder status 
in the HBF annual customer 
satisfaction survey. This shows 
that over 90% of our customers 
questioned were satisfied with 
the quality of their new home and 
would ‘Recommend us to a Friend’ .
We monitor customer 
satisfaction with all of our 
customers being independently 
contacted nine weeks after legal 
completion and asked to 
complete a survey. Over the last 
five years these surveys have 
shown increases in customer 
satisfaction and we are pleased 
that in the year ended 30 June 
2012 98% (2011: 98%) of our 
customers would ‘Recommend 
us to a Friend’. We monitor the 
results of the survey on a monthly 
basis throughout our business.
Five year warranty
We are the only volume 
housebuilder to offer a five year 
warranty which covers fixtures 
and fittings that is additional to 
the ten-year NHBC warranty 
on the fabric of the building. 
 We monitor customer satisfaction 
with all customers being 
independently contacted nine 
weeks after legal completion… 
and we are pleased that 98%  
of our customers would 
‘Recommend us to a Friend’. 09

Health and safety
The health and safety of our 
employees, our customers and 
the public remains a top priority 
for the Group. The Group’s Safety, 
Health and Environmental 
management system (‘SHE’) 
is subject to continuous review 
and improvement and conforms 
to the health and safety standards 
OHSAS18001 and ISO14001. 
All our trading divisions adhere 
to the SHE guidelines and 
ongoing compliance is verified 
by a programme of internal and 
external audits. During the year 
we carried out over 5,000 
monitoring visits and achieved 
an average compliance rate 
of 96% (2011: 96%).
We also measure health and 
safety performance by monitoring 
the Group’s reportable Injury 
Incidence Rate (‘IIR’). During the 
financial year ended 30 June 
2012, our IIR reduced by 5% 
to 511 (2011: 539) per 100,000 
persons employed. We are 
committed to seeking to reduce 
the IIR year-on-year and we are 
working with our suppliers, 
partners and local communities 
to minimise the risk of injury.
At the NHBC Health and 
Safety Awards 2012, the Group 
was awarded 30% of the total 
awards in the Large and 
Multi-storey builder categories 
and 13 of our site managers were 
recognised for excellence in health 
and safety. The Group received 
five commended and eight highly 
commended awards, within which 
our Renaissance scheme in 
East London was judged the 
overall national winner in the

An analysis of the operational 
performance of these segments 
is provided within the Business 
Review.
Exceptional items
The Group incurred exceptional 
items before tax in the year 
of £10.7m (2011: £54.2m). 
This comprised operating 
exceptional items of £nil 
(2011: £7 .7m), exceptional costs 
arising from the acquisition of 
our partner’s share in a former 
joint venture of £10.7m (2011: £nil) 
and exceptional finance costs 
of £nil (2011: £46.5m).
Operating exceptional items
i) Restructuring costs
In the prior year, the Group 
adjusted its operations to suit 
the prevailing trading conditions, 
resulting in £7 .7m of reorganisation 
and restructuring costs.
ii) Impairment of land 
and work in progress
The Group has completed a 
site-by-site impairment review 
using valuations incorporating 
forecast sales rates and average 
selling prices that reflect both 
current and anticipated trading 
conditions. The impairment 
reviews include low single-digit 
house price and build cost inflation 
assumptions in future periods.
Since the overall gross margin 
achieved across the Group’s 
developments were primarily in 
line with those incorporated into 
prior period impairment reviews 
no further exceptional impairment 
was required at 30 June 2012, 
although there were gross 
impairment reversals and charges 
of £31.5m (2011: £65.0m) due 
to variations in market conditions 
across housebuilding sites. 
Changes arising from normal 
trading, such as planning status, 
resulted in a net inventory 
impairment charge of £6.6m 
(2011: £5.4m) included within 
profit from operations.
During the year ended 30 June 
2012, we have experienced 
variation in house price movements 
by region and should the actual 
house price movements for the 
current financial year differ from 
that expected in the impairment 
review then further impairments 
or reversals in impairments of the 
carrying value of our land bank 
may be required.
We recognise that the Group 
is not immune to future pricing 
trends in the wider housing 
market and we will continue to 
review the trading environment 
and our impairment assumptions 
during the year to 30 June 2013.
Financing exceptional item
In May 2011, the Company 
announced the agreement of 
a complete debt refinancing 
package. As a result of this, 
and the cancellation of £288m 
of interest rate swaps, due to the 
reduction in term debt and revision 
of interest rate hedging policy, 
the Company incurred £46.5m 
of exceptional refinancing costs 
in the prior year. 
The taxation benefit of  
the operating and financing 
exceptional items was £nil 
(2011: £14.9m).
Joint venture exceptional item
In 2006, we entered into a joint 
venture agreement to develop 
several sites in Greater 
Manchester, including a 720  
unit scheme in Hattersley. In 
March 2012, our partner went 
into liquidation and was unable 
to settle its liabilities with the joint 
venture. On 9 May 2012 we took 
the decision to acquire their  
stake for a nominal amount and, 
accordingly, we have consolidated 
the entity within the Group 
during the year, recognising 
an exceptional non-cash  
charge of £10.7m (2011: £nil).
Finance cost
The net finance charge before 
exceptional costs for the year 
was £80.8m (2011: £92.4m). 
This included a non-cash finance 
charge of £23.2m (2011: £22.0m).  34 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
BUSINESS REVIEW • FINANCE REVIEW
After financing exceptional costs 
of £nil (2011: £46.5m), the net 
finance charge for the year was 
£80.8m (2011: £138.9m).
For the financial year ending 
30 June 2013 we currently expect 
that, with our reducing levels of net 
debt, the blended rate of interest will 
be around 8.5% and our cash and 
non-cash interest will be c. £55.0m 
and c. £20.0m respectively. 
Tax
The Group’s tax charge for the 
year was £32.6m (2011: £2.3m). 
This differed from the effective rate 
for the year of 25.5% mainly due 
to the impact of the reduction 
in the statutory corporation tax 
rate from 26% to 24% and its 
impact upon the Group’s deferred 
tax asset and adjustments relating 
to prior periods.
During the year, the Group 
received tax repayments totalling 
£3.9m (2011: £4.5m).
For the financial year ending 
30 June 2013 we expect the total 
taxation charge to be around the 
effective rate of corporation tax 
of 23.75%. This excludes the 
impact of the charge arising from 
the reduction in the value of the 
Group’s deferred tax asset due 
to the reduction in the standard 
rate of corporation tax to 23%.
Dividend 
No dividend will be paid in respect 
of the 201 1/12 financial year. 
However, the Board recognises 
the importance of both capital 
growth and dividend income to our 
existing and potential shareholders, 
and is committed to re-introducing 
the payment of dividends. 
Assuming a continuing stable 
housing market, the Board expects 
to recommence dividend 
payments, with a conservative 
dividend cover, by proposing a final 
dividend in respect of the financial 
year to 30 June 2013, payable in 
the final quarter of 2013. The Board 
intends to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy as profitability 
grows, with the aim over time of 
achieving a target dividend cover 
of around three times.
In addition, we remain 
committed to operating with 
an appropriate landbank and 
continuing to reduce overall 
indebtedness.
Expense/income recognised 
in equity
During the year an expense of 
£33.9m (2011: income of £41.5m) 
has been recognised in equity 
predominantly relating to actuarial 
losses on the defined benefit 
pension scheme and movements 
on interest rate swaps.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the Group 
increased by £43.7m to 
£2,973.8m primarily reflecting 
the profit after tax for the year 
of £67 .4m, offset by actuarial 
losses on the defined benefit 
pension scheme and amounts 
deferred in respect of effective 
cash flow hedges.
Net tangible asset value 
increased by 2.1% to £2,081.6m 
(2011: £2,037 .9m) and net tangible 
asset value per share at 30 June 
2012 was £2.13 (2011: £2.11 
per share).
Significant movements in  
the balance sheet included:
•	The Group’s book value  
of land was £2,077 .3m 
(2011: £2,189.7m), a decrease 
of £112.4m. This decrease 
included land additions of 
£475m offset by land usage 
and disposals. 
•	Group work in progress at 
30 June 2012 was £1,065.5m 
(2011: £1,023.2m). The increase 
of £42.3m reflects the increase 
in the number of plots under 
construction at the year end, 
including the commencement 
of four towers in our London 
business. Stock and work 
in progress has been closely 
controlled throughout the year. 
Unreserved stock units as at 
30 June 2012 were 2.6 units 
(2011: 2.2 units) per active site. 
•	Group net debt decreased 
by £154.9m over the year 
to £167 .7m (2011: £322.6m).
•	Goodwill and intangible assets 
remained at £892.2m as the 
annual impairment review of the 
entire housebuilding business 
and brand indicated that no 
impairment was required at 
the year end.
•	The Group had a corporation 
tax asset of £0.4m (2011: £3.2m) 
and a deferred tax asset of 
£118.6m (2011: £143.2m). During 
the year the Group received 
£3.9m (2011: £4.5m) of tax 
repayments. The Group’s 
deferred tax asset decreased 
by £24.6m mainly due to the 
reduction in the statutory 
corporation tax rate to 24% 
and the utilisation of tax losses 
offset by the decrease in the 
defined benefit pension liability 
and movements upon derivative 
financial instruments. The 
changes to corporation tax rates 
announced in the 2012 Budget 
will further reduce the future 
value of the Group’s deferred tax 
asset, however as the changes 
were not substantively enacted 
at 30 June 2012 they are not 
reflected in the Group’s deferred 
tax asset. The reduction 
in corporation tax rate from 
24% to 23%, which has been 
enacted since the balance sheet 
date, would further reduce the 
Group’s deferred tax asset 
by £4.9m if all of the deferred tax 
was to reverse after July 2013.
•	The pension fund deficit on the 
Barratt Developments defined 
benefit pension scheme 
increased by £9.6m in the 
year to £21.4m mainly due 
to actuarial losses recognised 
in the year, offset by employer 
contributions.
•	Trade and other payables were 
£1,361.3m (2011: £1,379.7m) 
including an increase of £25.4m 
in land payables from £700.7m 
to £726.1m reflecting more land 
acquisitions on deferred 
payment terms during the year.
Net debt
Group net debt at the year end 
was £167 .7m (201 1: £322.6m). As

Treasury
The Group has around £1 billion 
of committed facilities and private 
placement notes, with some of the 
Group’s arrangements extending 
as far as 2021. The covenant 
package is appropriate and the 
facilities provide appropriate 
headroom above our current 
forecast debt requirements.
On 26 April 2012 our new 
committed revolving credit 
facilities (‘RCFs’) for £780m 
became available under credit 
agreements dated 10 May 2011. 
At the same time the previous 
committed RCFs of £1,190.5m 
were terminated.
In September 2012, we 
voluntarily cancelled the £90m 
RCF which was scheduled to 
expire in October 2013. We have 
reviewed our future requirements 
and decided that we will no longer 
require this facility. This reduces 
our total RCF to £690m, which 
terminates in May 2015.
We maintain a regular dialogue 
with our lending group, holding at 
least four meetings per annum, 
where we provide the group with 
an update on the housing market, 
our current trading performance 
and expected performance for 
the financial year. 
The Group has a conservative 
treasury risk management 
strategy which includes a current 
target that 30-60% of the Group’s 
median gross borrowings 
calculated by reference to the 
latest three-year plan should be  
at fixed rates of interest. Group 
interest rates are fixed using both 
swaps and fixed rate debt 
instruments.
In July 2012 we entered into a 
seed investment agreement with 
Hearthstone Investments, the 
specialist residential property fund 
manager, of up to £22.5m spread 
over three tranches and linked to 
the growth of the fund. The first 
tranche was for an amount of 
£5.4m. The arrangements will see 
the Group contributing a portfolio 
of showhomes, which will then be 
licensed back. This assists us in 
unlocking working capital that 
would otherwise remain on our 
balance sheet until we no longer 
needed the showhome and it 
could then be sold.
In conclusion
During the year, the Group 
has made significant progress 
in both rebuilding profitability 
and reducing net debt. 
Looking forward, as we 
continue to increase the number 
of higher margin outlets, focus on 
obtaining the best possible price 
for our product, and continue our 
success in controlling costs, the 
Group is well placed to make 
further strong progress in 2013.

BUSINESS REVIEW
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RELEVANCE TO STRATEGY/KPIs RISK AND DESCRIPTION MITIGATION (INCLUDING RESPONSIBILITY)
KEEPING CONTROL 
OF OUR BUSINESS
The Group’s financial and operational performance 
and reputation is subject to a number of risks. The 
Board seeks to ensure that appropriate processes are 
put in place to manage, monitor and mitigate these risks 
of which the principal risks are identified in the table 
below. The Group recognises that the management of 
risk is fundamental to the achievement of Group targets. 
As such, management throughout the Group are 
involved in this process. 
Economic environment, including 
housing demand and mortgage 
availability
Changes in the UK and European 
macroeconomic environments, including 
unemployment, austerity measures, flat 
economic growth, buyer confidence, 
availability of mortgage finance, the ability 
of purchasers to repay shared equity loans, 
interest rates, competitor pricing, falls in 
house prices or land values or a failure of 
the housing market to recover, may lead to 
a fall in the demand for houses which in turn 
could result in impairments of the Group’s 
inventories, goodwill and intangible assets.
Cost reduction measures may adversely 
affect the Group’s business or its ability 
to respond to future improvements in 
market conditions.
Liquidity 
Unavailability of sufficient borrowing facilities 
to enable the servicing of liabilities (including 
pension funding) and the inability to refinance 
facilities as they fall due, obtain surety bonds, 
or comply with borrowing covenants. 
Furthermore, there are risks to management 
of working capital such as conditional 
contracts, build costs, joint ventures and 
the cash flows related to them.
As described on pages 18 to 35 of the 
Business Review, the majority of homes built 
by the Group are purchased by individuals 
who rely on the availability of mortgages. The 
confidence of buyers and their ability to obtain 
mortgages or other forms of financing are 
impacted by the macroeconomic environment. 
Accordingly, customer demand is sensitive to 
changes in economic conditions.
The Group’s ability to grow its business  
partly depends on securing land or options 
over sites and having adequate resources  
to build sufficient homes to meet demand. 
The Group’s ability to do this can be impacted 
by cash and profit constraints which, in turn, 
would have an adverse effect upon net 
operating assets and net debt (see also  
the liquidity, land and construction risks 
sections below).
The Finance Review (pages 32 to 35) 
summarises the committed facilities 
of different duration that are designed to 
ensure that the Group has sufficient available 
funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are cyclical during the financial year and peak 
around April/May and October/November 
each year as, due to seasonal trends in 
income, these are the calendar points  
when the Group has the highest working 
capital requirements.
The Group maintains sufficient facility 
committed debt headroom and in addition 
has a number of trade finance and surety 
facilities that are designed to ensure that the 
Led by the Group Chief Executive, the 
Executive undertakes a weekly review of key 
trading indicators, including reservations, 
sales rates, Group shared equity balances, 
part-exchange, visitor levels, incentives, 
publically available competitor activity and 
cash flow projections and, where possible, 
appropriate management action is taken. 
The Group’s internal systems clearly identify 
the impact of sales price changes on the 
margins achievable and as a minimum the 
Group performs asset impairment reviews 
twice a year.
The Group works with key mortgage lenders 
to ensure that products are appropriate 
wherever possible for its customers.
The Group has Driving Profitable Sales and 
Commercial Action initiatives in place to seek 
to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency  
of our sales processes and keep the Group’s 
cost base tightly controlled. Cost reduction 
measures are also managed via the 
stewardship of the Executive Committee.
Under the stewardship of the Group Finance 
Director the Group has agreed its debt 
refinancing which provides around £1bn 
of committed facilities and private placement 
notes with maturity dates ranging from 2013  
to 2021.
The Group has in place a comprehensive 
regular forecasting process encompassing 
profitability, working capital and cash flow that  
is fully embedded in the business. The Group 
Finance Director ensures these forecasts are 
regularly stress tested to ensure that adequate 
headroom within facilities and banking 
covenants is maintained. On a normal operating 
basis the Group has a policy of maintaining  37 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012

calibre employees
Inability to recruit and/or retain employees 
with appropriate skill sets or sufficient 
numbers of such employees.
Group has sufficient funds available. The 
absence of appropriate headroom would  
limit the Group’s land buying and operational 
capability adversely impacting upon 
profitability and the Group’s ability to  
deliver shareholder value.
Using the approaches described on pages 
26 to 27 of the Business Review the Group 
aims to attract, retain and develop a 
sufficiently skilled and experienced workforce 
in order to maintain high standards of quality 
and customer service. 
Not having employees with appropriate skills 
sets can lead to build delays, quality issues, 
reduced sales, poor customer care and 
reduced profitability.
facility headroom of up to £150m. The Group 
has a comprehensive regular forecasting 
process for surety bond requirements.
The Group is in compliance with its borrowing 
covenants and at the date of approval of the 
2012 Annual Report and Accounts, the Group’s 
internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in 
compliance with these covenants for the 
foreseeable future being at least 12 months 
from the date of signing of the 2012 Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The Group Human Resources Director 
oversees a comprehensive Human Resources 
programme which includes apprenticeship 
schemes, a graduate development 
programme, succession planning and training 
schemes tailored to each discipline. These 
processes are embedded operationally.  
The Group continues to target a fully 
Construction Skills Certification Scheme 
carded and qualified operational workforce.
We monitor employee turnover levels on a 
monthly basis and conduct exit interviews, 
as appropriate, to identify any areas for 
improvement. We benchmark our 
remuneration against industry competitors.
Availability of raw materials, 
subcontractors and suppliers
Shortages or increased costs of materials 
and skilled labour, the failure of a key 
supplier or the inability to secure supplies 
upon appropriate credit terms could 
increase costs and delay construction.
The Group relies upon affordable supplies 
of building materials from multiple sources 
and subcontractors to perform the majority 
of work on sites. This retains flexibility to 
commence work on new sites and enhances 
the Group’s build cost efficiency. Adverse 
management of these suppliers and/or 
subcontractors could lead to build delays, 
cost increases and reduced profitability.
Managed by the Group Procurement Director, 
the Group adopts a professional approach 
to site management and seeks to partner 
with its supply chain. The Group has a policy 
of having multiple suppliers for both labour 
contracts and material supplies and 
contingency plans should any key supplier fail. 38 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
BUSINESS REVIEW • PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RELEVANCE TO STRATEGY/KPIs RISK AND DESCRIPTION MITIGATION (INCLUDING RESPONSIBILITY)
Government regulation 
and planning policy
Inability to adhere to the increasingly 
stringent and complex regulatory 
environment, including planning and 
technical requirements affecting the 
housing market and regulatory 
requirements more generally.
Construction and new technologies 
Failure to identify and achieve key 
construction milestones due to factors 
including the impact of adverse weather 
conditions, the failure to identify cost 
overruns promptly, design and construction 
defects, and exposure to environmental 
liabilities which could delay construction, 
increase costs, reduce selling prices and 
result in litigation and uninsured losses. 
Also there are risks associated with climate 
change and the use of new technology in 
the build process e.g. materials related to 
carbon reduction.
The Group’s land portfolio consists of land 
for the short and medium term as well as 
strategic land. Inability to obtain suitable 
consents, or unforeseen delays, could impact 
on the number or type of homes that we are 
able to build. We could also be required to 
fund higher than anticipated levels of planning 
obligations, or incur additional costs to meet 
increased regulatory requirements. All of 
these would have a detrimental impact  
on the contribution per plot.
As described on pages 24 to 25 of the 
Business Review the Group seeks to meet 
regulatory and planning requirements to 
obtain the planning permission required  
to develop homes and communities.
The Group builds homes and communities 
in Great Britain ranging from houses to 
large-scale flatted developments. In the  
event we did not do so efficiently, or new 
technologies result in quality issues, the 
Group’s profitability and ability to grow the 
business could be impacted negatively.
Led by the Group Chief Executive, and 
supported by the Director of Corporate Affairs 
and Group Head of Planning, the Group 
consults with the Government both directly 
and through industry bodies to highlight 
potential issues and has considerable 
in-house technical and planning expertise 
devoted to complying with regulations and 
achieving implementable planning consents.
The Group has appropriate policies and 
technical guidance manuals in place to assist 
employees to achieve regulatory compliance 
and the standards of business conduct 
expected of them.
The Group’s Executive oversees weekly 
reporting which identifies the number of 
properties at key stages of construction. 
Projected construction rates are evaluated 
as part of the monthly forecasting cycle. 
Progress with development projects 
(including joint ventures and consortia), 
including returns and cash flows, are 
monitored regularly by divisional management 
teams and the Group obtains legal and other 
professional advice when required. Any 
alternative forms of construction and building 
technologies and the quality of the materials 
used by the Group are subject to evaluation 
by external and internal technical experts 
including the NHBC, to ensure compliance 
with all building and other regulations. 
The Group regularly monitors a number 
of environmental impact indicators, the 
results of which are disclosed in the  
Group’s Sustainability Report.
Land purchasing
Inability to secure sufficient consented land 
at appropriate cost and quality to provide 
profitable growth.
The Group needs to purchase sufficient 
quantities of good quality, consented land at 
attractive prices in order to be in a position 
to commence construction and enhance 
the Group’s ability to deliver profit growth. 
Our progress during the year is set out 
on pages 24 to 25 of the Business Review.
Acquiring poor quality or mis-priced land 
would impact adversely upon profitability 
and revenue.
Under the stewardship of the Group Finance 
Director, potential land acquisitions are 
subject to formal appraisal, with those 
approved required to achieve an overall 
Group defined hurdle rate of return and to 
meet the Group’s strategic criteria for growth. 
Each division produces a detailed site-by-site 
monthly analysis of the amount of land 
currently owned, committed and identified. 
These are consolidated for regular review  
at senior management and Board level.  
In addition, each operating division holds 
regular land meetings.  39 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012
RELEVANCE TO STRATEGY/KPIs RISK AND DESCRIPTION MITIGATION (INCLUDING RESPONSIBILITY)
Joint ventures and consortiums
Large development projects, some of 
which involve joint ventures or consortium 
arrangements and/or commercial 
developments, are complex and capital 
intensive and changes may negatively 
impact upon cash flows or returns.
Health and Safety 
Health and safety breaches can result 
in injuries to employees, subcontractors 
and site visitors, delays in construction/
increased costs, reputational damage, 
criminal prosecution and civil litigation.
Information Technology (‘IT’)
Failure of the Group’s IT systems,  
in particular those relating to surveying  
and valuation, could adversely impact  
the performance of the Group.
Construction and new technologies 
(continued)
Due to their scale some projects may require 
joint venture or consortium arrangements. 
Failure of a joint venture or consortium partner 
to perform its financial and/or operational 
obligations can place additional capital or 
operational burdens upon the Group.
Health and safety is a key issue in the 
housebuilding sector. Given the inherent risks, 
it is of paramount importance to the Group. 
Senior management and the Board review 
health and safety matters on a regular basis 
and seek to reduce injury incidence rates by 
implementing policies and procedures aimed 
at keeping staff and visitors free from injury. 
Our performance this year against our injury 
incident rate KPI is set out on pages 31 of the 
Business Review.
 
In addition to the possibly tragic impact of an 
accident on-site, there is potential for legal 
proceedings, financial penalties, reputational 
damage and delay to the site’s progress.
The ability to optimise prices and ensure 
operational efficiency is essential to the 
Group’s performance. The Group’s integrated 
management systems enable the Group  
to maintain tight control, especially with 
regard to surveying and valuation.
Adverse IT performance could cause delays 
in build, and have an adverse impact on 
operational efficiency and profit.
Appropriate insurance cover is maintained 
for the Group’s main risks.
Led by the Group Finance Director, potential 
joint venture arrangements are subject to 
formal appraisal and appropriate external 
advice is obtained before such arrangements 
are approved. Once operational, the 
performance of joint ventures are subject 
to regular operational and financial review.
Reporting to the General Counsel, the Group 
Head of Safety, Health and Environment 
manages a dedicated health and safety 
department, which is independent of the 
management of the operating divisions. 
Health and safety audits are undertaken on 
a regular basis and processes are modified 
as required with a view to seeking continuous 
improvement. Performance is reviewed by the 
Health and Safety Committee that meets 
quarterly. Each month, health and safety 
reports are cascaded by each division, for 
review by the Executive Committee and 
Board, which also receives a direct report 
every six months from the Group Head of 
Safety, Health and Environment.
Led by the Group IT Director a dedicated 
in-house IT team regularly monitors and 
maintains Group IT systems to ensure 
continued functionality. A fully tested disaster 
recovery programme is in place.
Details of the Group’s management of liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk in relation to financial instruments are provided in note 25 on pages  
109 to 114 of this report.

GOVERNANCE
42 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Introduction from the Chairman
The Board believes that, in terms of the overall direction and control 
of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Company’), effective corporate 
governance comes principally from the establishment and maintenance 
of values, standards and disciplines the Company seeks to apply  
in dealings with shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, 
contractors and other stakeholders. The Board’s stewardship of these 
matters and its role in providing appropriate leadership is pivotal to  
this ethos. Many of the Company’s core values and standards are set 
out in a range of procedures and practice guidelines communicated 
throughout the Barratt group of companies (the ‘Group’). External 
governance codes also set the framework for the Group’s internal 
standards and it therefore seeks to comply with established best 
practice in all areas of corporate governance.
My focus 
A key part of my role as Chairman is to ensure that the Board retains 
an appropriate level of independence to allow Non-Executive Directors 
to challenge the Executive constructively whilst also supporting them 
to implement the Board’s strategy. For the 2012/13 financial year the 
focus will be, amongst other matters, on increasing the profitability of, 
and reducing the overall indebtedness of, the Group (see pages 6 to 7 
of this Annual Report and Accounts) and running the business effectively. 
A key element of this is ensuring that the Board composition is made  
up of the correct balance of skills, sector specific and general knowledge 
to drive the strategy forward. During the year, Board membership has 
been refreshed and the Executive reporting structure simplified.
Diversity
The Board has considered the recommendations set out in Lord 
Davies’ Report: ‘Women on Boards’, and, following consideration 
and recommendations from the Nomination Committee, has adopted 
a policy on Board appointments (a copy of which is available on our 
website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk). The Nomination Committee, 
has also revised its terms of reference, to include express reference 
to the consideration of diversity when reviewing and implementing 
Board level succession plans. 
Risk management and internal controls
A key focus of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) is risk 
management and the responsibility of boards to determine the nature and 
extent of the risks they are willing to take in achieving strategic corporate 
objectives, as well as including an explicit obligation for boards to review 
the effectiveness of risk management systems and internal control.  
For the Group, risk appears in many forms and can fall into any one of 
several categories such as: market; liquidity; people; subcontractors and 
suppliers; land purchasing; Government regulation; construction; joint 
ventures and consortia; safety, health and environment; and information 
technology. As there is no single solution for managing such a diverse 
range of risks, the Board dedicates considerable time to discussing  
and assessing the risks affecting the Group and the mitigation strategies 
to address them. We have included further commentary on risk and 
enhanced the review of the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group 
during our annual review so that their relevance to the Group’s business 
and management accountabilities for each mitigation strategy is clear  
(see pages 36 to 39). Our Audit Committee continues to play a key part  
in supporting the Board’s approach to the management of risk throughout 
the business.
Shareholder engagement 
The Board recognises and fully embraces the importance of maintaining 
an ongoing relationship with the Company’s shareholders and achieves 
this through regular dialogue on issues such as the potential impact 
upon our business of the UK and European macroeconomics, the 
availability of mortgage lending to customers, strategy, performance 
and governance.
The Board
In January 2012 the Board met for its annual strategic review to discuss the 
Group’s growth plans and a number of strategic issues including mortgage 
availability, customer demand, planning regulations and Government 
programmes. The review is increasingly focusing on the long-term 
prospects for the provision of homes in a changing UK economy.
Statement of compliance with Code provisions 
The Company recognises the importance of seeking to maintain the 
highest standards of corporate governance in all areas of its business. 
I am pleased to say that throughout the 2011/12 financial year the 
Company fully complied with the main and supporting principles of 
the Code, details of which can be found on the following pages of this 
report. The Code is publicly available from the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk. 
The challenges facing the housing market continue but I believe that 
the Group’s senior management and employees remain totally 
committed to delivering improved performance and shareholder value.
Bob Lawson
CHAIRMAN BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 43
The Board 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board which has overall 
responsibility for the conduct of the business of the Group and ensuring 
that the obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and 
met. The Board is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the 
Group and ensuring that it has adequate resources and appropriate 
controls, values and standards in place to deliver its strategy within 
a framework which enables risk to be identified and managed. Each 
Board Director is aware of his/her responsibilities, individually and 
collectively, to promote the long-term success of the Group. 
The names, responsibilities and other details of the Directors are set  
out on pages 40 and 41. The Board met on eleven occasions during the 
financial year to review and approve a variety of matters including those 
specifically reserved to them. These included: approval of the strategy 
and management of the Group; ensuring adequate financial resources 
are available for the business; review and approval of half-yearly and annual 
results; interim management statements and trading updates; review and 
approval of dividend and treasury policies; review and updating of internal 
control and risk management systems and processes; approval of material 
investments/transactions; and approval of core policies relating to, amongst 
other matters, safety, health and environment and employee conduct.
Board committees 
The Board has established three principal committees to which it has 
delegated specific responsibilities: the Audit (pages 49 and 52); the 
Remuneration (pages 53 to 66); and the Nomination (pages 46 and 48) 
Committees (each a ‘Committee’). Each Committee is provided with 
sufficient resources to undertake the duties delegated to them and is able 
to seek advice from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and external advisers, as appropriate. Membership and attendance at 
meetings of the Board and of each of its Committees during the 2011/12 
financial year are shown in Table 1. Each of these Committees (and the 
Board) completed annual effectiveness reviews (see page 45).

Board balance and independence
At the end of the financial year the Board comprised ten members, 
including the Chairman, five Non-Executive Directors and four Executive 
Directors, although executive representation was reduced to three on 
5 July 2012 following Clive Fenton’s resignation from the Board. The 
Board believes that it has the appropriate balance of Executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors having regard to the size and 
nature of the business and continuing need to keep its cost base under 
tight control. In addition, the combination of the make-up and calibre 
of the Non-Executive Directors collectively, having regard to their diverse 
backgrounds and experience and their varying lengths of service, 
further enhances this balance. 
During the year, given the length of Bob Davies’ tenure as a Non-
Executive Director and the likelihood of such tenure coming to an end 
in the reasonably near term, the Nomination Committee, having due 
regard to maintaining the balance between the independent Non-
Executive Directors and Executive Directors, recommended the 
appointment of Richard Akers as a Non-Executive Director to the Board. 
Richard Akers joined the Board on 2 April 2012. As announced on 
25 July 2012, Bob Davies subsequently notified the Board of his intention 
to step down from his positions of Non-Executive Director, Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
at the Company’s 2012 Annual General Meeting (the ‘2012 AGM’). The 
Nomination Committee, having assessed the skills of each of the current 
Non-Executive Directors on the Board identified and recommended 
to the Board the appointment of Richard Akers as successor to 
Bob Davies as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Richard will, 
subject to election by shareholders, commence his role as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 
2012 AGM. In addition, the Nomination Committee recommended that 
Mark Rolfe take over as Senior Independent Director from the same  
date and the Board unanimously endorsed this recommendation.
The Company recognises the importance of its Non-Executive Directors 
remaining independent throughout their appointment as this enables them 
to provide objective advice and guidance to the Executive Directors through 
the use of their wide business experience and diverse backgrounds, as well 
as being able to challenge constructively and scrutinise the performance 
of the Executive Directors and satisfy themselves with the integrity of the 
financial information to be provided to the Board and the Company’s 
shareholders. In addition, their independence is of utmost importance 
when considering the appointment or removal of Executive Directors and 
in the determination of succession planning for the Board and other key 
individuals within the Group. The Board has, during the year, reviewed, 
and remains satisfied, that all of its Non-Executive Directors, including 
Richard Akers (see page 67), are independent in that they have no business 
or other relationship with the Group that might influence their independence 
or judgement. Details of their interests as shareholders are contained in 
Table 6 on page 64 of the Remuneration Report. 
Bob Lawson was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Company 
with effect from 1 July 2008 and was considered to be independent 
on his appointment. Bob Lawson’s other significant commitments, 
his Non-Executive Chairmanship of Genus plc and his directorship 
of The Federation of Groundwork Trusts, do not impinge upon his 
availability to fulfil his duties to the Company and were considered 
during the annual review of the effectiveness of the Chairman led 
by the Senior Independent Director.  44 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
and conditions which it deems necessary to impose on any authorisation 
given. This process was carried out satisfactorily during the year.
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary maintains a 
register of Directors’ conflicts of interest which is reviewed annually. 
Following this review the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary will make recommendations to the Board in respect of any 
changes to the authorisations, or terms and conditions applied, that 
may be required. Each Director is responsible for notifying, and is aware 
of their responsibility to notify, the Chairman and/or the Board of any 
new conflicts or possible conflicts and of any change in circumstances 
relating to authorisations already given. The Board, when authorising 
any conflict or possible conflict of interest, does not count in the quorum 
the Director whose conflict or possible conflict is being discussed and 
reserves the right to exclude a Director from a meeting whilst a conflict 
or possible conflict is being considered. The Board may revoke or vary 
any authorisation at any time.
Appointment and Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed, subject to re-election 
by shareholders and statutory provisions relating to the removal 
of directors, by the Board for an initial three-year term and normally 
serve a second three-year term. Beyond this a third term of up to three 
years may be served subject to particularly rigorous review and taking 
into account the need for progressive refreshment of the Board. 
The Articles, in accordance with the Code, require any Non-Executive 
Director who has served nine years or more on the Board continuously 
to be subject to annual re-appointment thereafter, but in any event all 
current Directors (other than Bob Davies), both Executive and Non-
Executive, will stand for re-election by shareholders at this year’s AGM, 
as they did at the 2011 AGM, in accordance with the Code provisions 
applicable to all FTSE 350 companies. 
On 2 April 2012 Richard Akers joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director for a three-year term and will, in accordance with the Code, 
be subject to election by shareholders at the 2012 AGM and to annual 
re-election by shareholders thereafter. Richard was also appointed 
as a member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees on 
the same date and will, as announced on 25 July 2012, take over as 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee from Bob Davies with 
effect from the conclusion of the 2012 AGM. He was also appointed 
to the Audit Committee with effect from 1 July 2012. Richard brings 
with him a broad business experience and a wealth of property  
market knowledge from a retail and commercial perspective. 
During the year the Board also considered and approved the re-
appointment of Tessa Bamford as she has completed three years’ 
service on the Board. Following a formal evaluation process, it was 
unanimously agreed that Tessa continues to be effective in (and that 
she demonstrates satisfactory commitment to) her role as a Director. 
Accordingly, the Board re-appointed Tessa, subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders, for a further three-year term. During this period 
Tessa will continue with the roles that she currently holds upon 
the Committees of the Board including her position as a member 
of the Audit Committee which she joined on 1 July 2012. 
The letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office during 
normal office hours and will also be available at the 2012 AGM 
Roles of Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director
The division of responsibility between the Chairman of the Board and 
the Group Chief Executive is clearly defined in writing and has been 
approved by the Board.
The Chairman, Bob Lawson, leads the Board in the determination of 
strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. He is responsible for: 
organising the business of the Board; setting its agenda and ensuring 
that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, in 
particular strategic issues; facilitating the effective contribution of the 
Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors; ensuring that the Board receives timely 
and accurate information so as to properly conduct its business; 
ensuring new directors participate in a full and formal induction process; 
that the continued development needs of the directors are identified 
and addressed; and ensuring effective communication with shareholders. 
The Chairman is supported by Tom Keevil, the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, in carrying out these duties.
Mark Clare, the Group Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the operational activities of the Group in accordance 
with overall strategy and policy as determined by the Board. He carries 
out duties delegated to him by the Board through an Executive Committee 
comprising of the Executive Board members, the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, the Marketing Director, Jeremy Hipkiss, the 
Group Director of Corporate Affairs, Patrick Law, the Group Human 
Resources Director, Jayne Mee (until 30 June 2012) and thereafter 
Robert Tansey (from 1 August 2012), and the Managing Director of 
Wilson Bowden Developments, Nick Richardson. The Executive 
Committee generally meets on a weekly basis to review operational 
matters and also undertakes more in-depth monthly reviews.
The current Senior Independent Director, Bob Davies, has specific 
responsibility for evaluating the performance of the Chairman, at least 
annually, with the other Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
having consulted the Executive Directors beforehand and has completed 
such a review for the 201 1/12 financial year, which gave rise to no issues 
and unanimous support for the Chairman. He is also responsible for 
ensuring that, where required, he is available to shareholders to (i) address 
any material issues or concerns which the Chairman and/or Group Chief 
Executive have failed to resolve, and (ii) listen to their views in order for the 
Company to gain a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
On 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) codified the 
duty to avoid conflicts of interest, by which Directors have a duty to avoid 
a situation in which they have, or may have, a direct or indirect conflict 
of interest or possible conflict of interest with the Company. This duty 
applies to the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity 
regardless of whether the Company could have taken advantage of it. 
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) were amended 
at the annual general meeting held on 18 November 2008 to include 
a general power for the Board to authorise such conflicts.
The Board has, in accordance with the Articles and best practice 
guidance, authorised the Nomination Committee to oversee the process 
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board concerning 
any actual and/or potential conflicts of interest which arise or may arise 
in relation to each member of the Board, including details of any terms  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 45
an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive operating and financial 
management reports for the period under review, generally a week 
before any Board meeting. The Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary attends all Board and Committee meetings and all Directors 
have access to his advice and, if necessary, to independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense to assist with the discharge of their 
responsibilities as Directors. 
All Directors are provided with a rolling three-year schedule of proposed 
meeting dates. Any Director who is unable to attend a meeting is invited 
to provide their views to the Chairman ahead of that meeting, having 
reviewed the agenda, briefing papers and management information. 
Reasons for non-attendance are recorded by the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and either he or the Chairman will, 
thereafter, meet with any absent Director to go through any action points 
which are of relevance to that Director. Formal minutes of each Board 
meeting are prepared, circulated and submitted for approval at the 
next meeting. 
Performance evaluation 
The Board is responsible for undertaking a formal and rigorous annual 
evaluation of its own performance, that of its Committees and of 
individual Directors. Given that an external consultant undertook 
the performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees for the 
2009/10 financial year, the Board agreed that it would, for the 2011/12 
financial year, carry out the performance evaluation internally using the 
same performance evaluation process as it did for the 2010/11 financial 
year. Accordingly, each Director was asked to complete a separate 
confidential questionnaire on the effectiveness of the Board and each 
of the Committees of which he/she is a member. The Directors scored 
the performance of the Board and its Committees on various topics, 
including: contribution to strategy; risk management; financial and 
operating reporting; matters reserved for the Board; inter-relationships 
between the Board and its Committees; relations with advisers and 
regulators; and Board procedures. Responses were collated by the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and a non-attributable 
report on the findings was formally presented to the Board in July 2012 
for discussion. Thereafter the Chairman conducted one-to-one meetings 
with individual Directors in order to appraise the performance of each 
of them as Board members and explore the performance evaluation 
findings. Key outputs included a desire for more in-depth analysis of risk 
and crisis management plans, enhanced training and development and 
increased emphasis in all meetings on strategy development. An action 
plan to address these matters has been put in place. As a result of the 
performance evaluation the Board and each of its Committees reviewed 
and updated their terms of reference as appropriate.
During the year the Board and its Committees addressed all the issues 
raised as part of the 2010/11 performance evaluation process, including, 
development of succession plans for all levels of senior management 
(including the Executive Directors) and review of the annual Board 
strategy day agenda to encourage more focus on longer-term strategy 
as well as the short to medium-term strategies. 
In accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Chairman 
met with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, met without the Chairman being present, to assess the 
performance of the Chairman and provided feedback from the process.
for 15 minutes before and throughout the meeting. The letters of 
appointment clearly set out the time commitment expected from each 
Non-Executive Director to ensure they satisfactorily perform their duties 
and each Non-Executive Director confirms that he/she is able to allocate 
the time commitment required at the time of appointment and during 
his/her annual effectiveness review.
Retirement and re-election of Directors
The Articles currently require Directors to submit themselves for 
re-election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting (‘AGM’)
following their initial appointment to the Board and thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. All Board members will, however, in 
accordance with the Code, stand for re-election by the shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM (with the exception of Bob Davies (see page 43) and 
Clive Fenton who resigned from the Board on 5 July 2012), irrespective 
of their date of appointment and length of service on the Board. Each 
of the Directors has been subject to a formal performance evaluation 
process and it is believed that they all continue to be effective in, and 
demonstrate commitment to, their respective roles. 
Biographical details of each of the Directors and supporting statements 
for the election or re-election of the Directors are set out on pages 40 
and 41 of this report and in the Notice of the 2012 AGM. Details of the 
Executive Directors’ service contracts can be found in the Remuneration 
Report on page 62.
The Board recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions to 
be put forward at the 2012 AGM relating to the election and re-election 
of Directors.
Induction 
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in a full and 
formal induction process which includes site visits, meetings with all 
Board members and senior and operational management teams across 
the business. Each Director is also provided with an induction pack 
containing general and specific information relating to their role such 
as a schedule of meetings, copies of Board minutes and various policies 
and procedures, details of their duties as a director of a listed plc and 
other obligations under the various regulations governing the Company. 
Development
In January of each year the Board meets for a full day to review and 
develop the overall business strategy of the Group which includes 
presentations from senior management within the Group as well as 
external professionals. 
The Directors continue to update their skills, knowledge and familiarity 
with the Company by attending appropriate external and internal seminars 
and training courses, meeting with senior management and visiting 
regional and divisional operating offices and sites. Additionally, during the 
year, amongst other matters, updates and guidance on current live topics 
such as corporate narrative reporting, shareholder stewardship, diversity 
and fixed and variable elements of executive remuneration were provided 
to the Board. The Chairman regularly reviews and annually agrees training 
and development needs with individual Directors. 
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information. Each Director is issued with  REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
and all five Non-Executive Directors (Richard Akers joined the Nomination 
Committee on 2 April 2012). The Chairman chairs the meetings of the 
Nomination Committee, except when the business of the meeting relates 
to the appointment of his own successor. In accordance with Code 
provision B.2.1. the majority of members (the Non-Executive Directors) 
are considered independent by the Company.
Activities undertaken in respect of the 2011/12 financial year
The Nomination Committee operates within its terms of reference which 
can be found on the Company’s website: www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. 
The Nomination Committee met on four occasions during the year 
to consider, amongst other things:
•	the structure, size and composition of the Board, having regard to the 
Board’s balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge; 
•	the development of succession plans for Directors and senior executives;
•	the refreshment of the membership of the Board and its Committees, 
namely the appointment of Richard Akers as a Non-Executive Director 
and the appointment of all independent Non-Executive Directors 
to each of the Committees with effect from 1 July 2012; 
•	the leadership needs of the Group to ensure continued ability 
of the Group to compete effectively in the market;
•	the implementation of a diversity policy relating to Board appointments;

of conflicts of interest of new and existing Directors.
Bob Lawson
CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments to 
the Board and makes recommendations to the Board when suitable 
candidates have been identified. When a vacancy arises the Nomination 
Committee evaluates the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge on the Board and on that basis prepares a description 
of the roles and capabilities required for that appointment. The search 
for Board candidates is carried out, and appointments are made, based 
on merit having regard to the need to maintain a balance of skills and 
experience on the Board, diversity and, where appropriate, refreshment 
of Board memberships. External recruitment consultants are used 
where appropriate.
In light of Bob Davies’ length of tenure as a Non-Executive Director and 
the likelihood of it coming to an end in the near term, the Nomination 
Committee assessed the balance of skills of the current Non-Executive 
Directors and identified the skills required by a potential candidate 
in order to fulfil the roles of an additional Non-Executive Director 
and possibly that of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The 
Nomination Committee also gave consideration as to the appropriate 
candidate to recommend to the Board to assume the role of Senior 
Independent Director. The Zygos Partnership, an independent external 
recruitment firm, was appointed to assist the Nomination Committee 
throughout the recruitment process. Details of a number of potential 
candidates from varying backgrounds, with different skills and of both 
genders, were provided to the Nomination Committee. A short list of 
four candidates was identified and each shortlisted individual was invited 
for an interview with the members of the Nomination Committee and 
subsequently all Directors. The merits of each candidate by reference 
to their relative experience, potential contribution to the business of the 
Board, their potential ability to promote the success of the Company 
and how their skills would complement those of the existing Board, 
were assessed. It was unanimously agreed by the members of the 
Nomination Committee that Richard Akers was the most suitable 
candidate. A recommendation to appoint Richard Akers as a Non-
Executive Director was made to, and subsequently unanimously 
approved by, the Board. Richard joined the Board on 2 April 2012.
Prior to the appointment of Richard Akers as a Non-Executive Director, 
the Nomination Committee considered the fact that Richard is, and 
will continue to be, a director of Land Securities PLC (‘Land Securities’), 
the listed parent company of the UK’s largest commercial property group. 
Land Securities has in the past, and may in the future, consider possible 
joint venture arrangements with the Group or may competitively bid for 
land against the Group. Having considered the nature and extent of the 
relationship between Land Securities and the Group; the fact that Richard 
would not be directly involved in the negotiation or agreement of the 
contractual terms of any prospective joint venture arrangement between 
the parties; nor receive any documentation relating to such arrangements 
or competitive bids, the Nomination Committee confirmed to the Board 
that it is, and remains satisfied, that Richard Akers is not conflicted and 
is independent, a conclusion that the Board endorsed. 
Following Lord Davies’ report, ‘Women on Boards’ (the ‘Davies Report’), 
the Nomination Committee has reviewed the recommendations on 
gender diversity, as part of its annual effectiveness exercise. The 
Committee’s primary goal is to identify the most appropriate candidates 
to join the Board and other senior positions within the Group. However, 
in accordance with its terms of reference it seeks to ensure that in 
considering succession planning it has due regard to the benefits  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 47
of diversity for the Board (and for the Group as a whole), including 
gender. Reflecting endorsement of the key aims of the Davies Report, 
the Nomination Committee recommended and the Board has adopted, 
a policy on diversity relating to Board appointments, a copy of which 
is available on the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. 
Although the Board has not imposed a quota regarding gender balance, 
the Nomination Committee and the Board will remain fully cognisant of 
the need to ensure that the business reflects a diverse workforce, at all 
levels of seniority, when considering Board appointments and internal 
promotions, whilst always seeking to ensure that each post is offered 
strictly on merit to the best available candidate. As at 30 June 2012 the 
aggregate representation of women on the Board was 10% (one out of 
ten directors). Across the Group the Company employs approximately 
1,459 women representing 32% of the total workforce of which 16%  
are in management positions.
Internal control and approach to risk management 
The Board confirms in accordance with principle C.2 of the Code that 
it has maintained sound risk management and internal control systems, 
seeking to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets. 
The Board is responsible for seeking to determine the nature and extent 
of the significant risks that it is appropriate for the Group to take to achieve 
its strategic objectives and it is the responsibility of the Executive 
Directors and senior management to implement and maintain the 
Group’s internal control and risk management systems within the 
governance and policy framework approved by the Board. The 
risk management and internal control systems have been in place 
throughout the year ended 30 June 2012 and up to the date of this 
report, and their effectiveness is regularly reviewed by the Board. The 
risk management and internal control systems and their effectiveness 
accord with the Turnbull guidance. The Group’s system of internal 
controls is designed to manage risks that may impede the achievement 
of the Group’s business objectives rather than to eliminate those 
risks entirely. The system of internal controls therefore provides only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. The system of internal controls does, however, provide reasonable 
assurance that potential issues can be identified promptly and 
appropriate remedial action taken.
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s financial 
statements are reconciled to the underlying financial ledgers. A review 
of the consolidated accounts and financial statements is completed 
by management to ensure that the financial position and results of the 
Group are appropriately reflected.
The Risk Committee, subject to the general supervision of the Audit 
Committee, is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control policies and procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risks and to assess individual key risks 
on a rolling basis. The Risk Committee consists of standing members 
comprising the Group Finance Director, Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, a Regional Managing Director and/or Regional 
Finance Director and the Chief Internal Auditor. Other members of the 
Executive, heads of function and senior managers attend meetings 
by invitation having regard to the business areas to be explored. 
The key aspects of the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management framework are as follows:
i) a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority 
and responsibility for each operating division;
ii) financial and management reporting systems under which financial 
and operating performance is consistently reviewed against budget 
and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group level on a monthly basis;
iii) identification and review of principal operational risk areas to ensure they 
are embedded in the Group’s monthly management reporting system, 
so that risk identification and the control of risk are a routine aspect of 
management responsibility. Details of the principal risks and uncertainties 
and their relevance to the operation, and financial performance, of the 
Company are set out on pages 36 to 39 of the Business Review. Amongst 
other matters, the risks reviewed by management and the Board include:
•	the land and housing markets, including changes in the 
macroeconomic environment, sales and quality of product;
•	liquidity, including the availability of sufficient borrowing facilities;
•	attracting and retaining a high calibre of employees, including 
the development of a skilled and experienced workforce;
•	the availability of raw materials, subcontractors and suppliers;
•	land purchasing;
•	Government regulation and planning policy;
•	construction and new technologies, including achieving key milestones 
and the impact on the environment and social surroundings;
•	joint ventures and consortia; 
•	safety, health and environment; and
•	failure of the Group’s information technology systems; and
iv) compliance with internal control and risk management systems 
is supported by the Group’s internal audit team which is responsible 
for undertaking an annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and reporting 
to the Audit Committee, and, if necessary, the Board, on the operation 
and effectiveness of those systems and any material failings with them. 
The planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations 
is approved by the Audit Committee and includes full divisional audits 
and targeted audits of key risk areas such as the land viability process, 
land acquisition control and monitoring, work in progress and 
subcontractor payment controls. Where the internal audit team does 
not have the expertise or resources required to conduct complex  
audits they deploy external expertise. 
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to 
a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt, 
market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most 
significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there 
is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash 
flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks 
are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken. These 
forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to 
ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants 
is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management 
programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks 
on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, 
including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency 
rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. The Board approves treasury policies and has 
delegated certain day-to-day treasury activities to a centralised Treasury 
Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. 
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established 
by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee. 48 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • NOMINATION COMMITTEE
In accordance with principle C.2.1. of the Code the Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, 
covering all material controls including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems. A risk framework 
has been developed for all business processes by the internal audit 
function and approved by the Audit Committee. This framework forms 
the basis of the internal control audit plan for the year ahead, which  
tests if controls are being applied effectively in each operating division. 
Material issues identified during internal audits and follow-up action 
plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and by the Board on  
a quarterly basis, and necessary actions are immediately taken to 
remedy any failings in the internal control system.
During the course of its review of systems of internal control, the Board 
has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which 
it has determined to be significant. Therefore, a confirmation of necessary 
actions has not been considered appropriate.
In addition, the management teams of all operating divisions identify 
key risks in their monthly management reports to the Executive and 
complete a control self-assessment twice a year in which they confirm 
that they have applied appropriate levels of control. The Audit Committee, 
as a standing agenda item every six months, reviews the risk framework 
to determine if the system of internal control remains effective and report 
on their findings to the Board. During the year under review, the Executive 
prioritised the risk framework by identifying the risks considered most 
significant to the Group. For each of the risks so identified, an assessment 
has been made of the probability and potential impact on the business 
and these risks are reported on internally and reviewed during internal 
audits and control self-assessments. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 49
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Introduction from the Chairman
All members of the Audit Committee, as identified in Table 1 on  
page 43, are independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance  
with Code provision C.3.1. The Board is satisfied that I have recent  
and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the financial year  
and attendance at each of these meetings is set out in Table 1 on page 
43. The Audit Committee’s annual work programme requires it to meet 
a minimum of four times during a financial year. In respect of the 201 1/12 
financial year, the fourth meeting took place on 2 July 2012. All outstanding 
matters from the Audit Committee’s 201 1/12 annual work programme 
were dealt with at that meeting, ensuring that the Audit Committee 
completed its annual work programme in full. In addition to the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, representatives from the 
auditor, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’), together with the Chief Internal Auditor, 
attended each of the Audit Committee meetings and met with the 
Committee independently of management and the Chairman. The 
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and other members 
of senior management are also invited to attend meetings (or parts 
thereof) as required.
To enhance the effectiveness of the Audit Committee, it was agreed 
that all Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) should be 
members of the Audit Committee. Consequently, Richard Akers and 
Tessa Bamford joined the Audit Committee with effect from 1 July 2012.
The following section details the work undertaken by the Audit 
Committee in respect of the 2011/12 financial year.
Mark Rolfe
CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Activities undertaken in respect of the 2011/12 financial year
The Audit Committee follows an annual work programme which 
covers the principal responsibilities as set under its terms of reference 
(available from the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk). 
The Audit Committee undertook, amongst other matters, the following 
activities in respect of the 2011/12 financial year:
•	monitored the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and reviewed 
all formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance;
•	monitored the Group’s financial management and reporting systems 
and assessed the integrity and effectiveness of its accounting 
procedures, systems of internal control and the process for identifying 
and monitoring the material risks facing the Group;
•	reviewed and challenged where necessary the consistency of, 
and any proposed changes to the Group’s accounting policies;
•	monitored the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor, the ratio and quantum of audit and non-audit fees, 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and proposals for 
partner rotation;
•	made recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and remuneration of the external auditor including 
the appointment of a new lead audit partner; 
•	reviewed and monitored the effectiveness of the internal audit function, 
the annual internal audit plan and all reports produced by the internal 
auditor and management’s responsiveness to the findings and 
recommendations of the internal auditor; 
•	reviewed its own composition as part of its annual effectiveness 
review and implemented the decision of the Board to appoint all 
Non-Executive Directors to each Board Committee resulting in the 
appointment of Tessa Bamford and Richard Akers as members with 
effect from 1 July 2012; and
•	reviewed whistleblowing procedures and ensured that arrangements 
were in place for proportionate and independent investigation and 
follow-up action in respect of any matter raised pursuant to that process.
As well as carrying out the work associated with the annual financial 
reporting cycle under its annual work programme, the Audit Committee 
undertakes other responsibilities during the year including: reviewing 
the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, non-audit fees policy, the 
whistleblowing policy, key accounting policies, the external audit plan 
and associated reports and undertaking its annual effectiveness review.
Re-appointment of Auditor
The Audit Committee considered the re-appointment of Deloitte as the 
auditor to the Company in September 2012. Deloitte was appointed as 
the auditor of the Company through an external tender process in 2007 . 
In accordance with UK ethical and professional guidance on the rotation 
of audit partners, a new lead audit partner was appointed to the 
Company, after consideration of and interview of the short listed 
candidates in July 2012. Taking into account this appointment; Deloitte’s 
objectivity and independence; the ratio of audit to non-audit fees; 
Deloitte’s performance against the audit plan for the 201 1/12 financial 
year; and the quality of advice and assistance received throughout the 
year, the Committee concluded that Deloitte’s performance as auditor 
to the Company continues to be satisfactory and recommended to the 
Board that a resolution re-appointing Deloitte as the auditor to the 
Company be proposed at the 2012 AGM. That recommendation 
was subsequently endorsed by the Board. There are no contractual 
obligations which restrict the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor. 50 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Activities undertaken in respect of the 2011/12 financial year
The Remuneration Committee undertook the following activities 
in respect of the 2011/12 financial year:
•	determined and reviewed the overall remuneration policy of the Group 
with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating directors and senior 
managers of the experience and calibre required by the Group having 
regard to remuneration paid to employees across the Group and an 
external comparable group of companies;
•	determined, reviewed and made recommendations to the Board 
on the remuneration package and service contract of the Chairman;
•	agreed targets and benefits in respect of performance related pay 
schemes, including long-term performance plans, for all participating 
employees which are: sufficiently challenging; fair and highly motivating; 
commensurate with sector practice; and consistent with maximising 
shareholder value and the interests and expectations of shareholders;
•	determined the total remuneration package of the Group Chief 
Executive and after consultation with him, the total individual 
remuneration package of each Executive Director and senior 
management including bonuses, incentive payments and share 
options/awards and pension arrangements; and
•	undertook consultations with institutional investors on remuneration 
policy and other aspects of senior remuneration, as appropriate. 
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for agreeing 
severance arrangements or other compensation for loss of office 
or early retirement for the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior 
management and appointing consultants to advise on executive 
remuneration. Details of the consultants utilised during the 2011/12 
financial year can be found on page 55 of the Remuneration Report. 
Employment policy and involvement
The Group is committed to seeking to develop the talents of its employees 
so that they can maximise their career potential and attempts to provide 
rewarding careers in an atmosphere that engenders equal opportunities 
for all. Selection for employment and promotion is based on merit, 
following an objective assessment of ability and experience of candidates 
after giving full and fair consideration to all applications (including 
individuals with disabilities). The Group is also committed to ensuring that 
its workplaces are free from unlawful discrimination of any sort. The Group 
strives to ensure that its policies and practices provide equal opportunities 
in respect of issues such as training, career development and promotion 
for all existing or potential staff irrespective of gender, race, ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. 
Every effort is made to retain and support employees who become 
disabled whilst working within the Group.
The Board recognises that appropriate employee engagement is a 
key factor in the long-term success of the Group. It has, accordingly, 
implemented a comprehensive employee engagement programme with 
the aim of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are invited 
to take part in an engagement survey each year and the results of this 
survey are fed back to each operating division, who use the results 
to formulate plans for maintaining or improving engagement in the 
following year. 
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. The 
Company seeks to ensure that all significant events, economic factors 
and financial updates and the impact of these on the performance of 
the Group are communicated to employees through email alerts, core 
Auditor objectivity and independence
The Audit Committee reviewed the policy which the Company 
has implemented on Auditor Independence and non-audit Fees 
(the ‘Policy’) during the year. The Policy sets out the duties of the 
Audit Committee and the limited range of services which the auditor 
may provide without requiring prior approval of the Audit Committee. 
Any services outside this scope must be approved by the Audit 
Committee in order to maintain auditor independence and monitor 
non-audit fees incurred by the Group. The Policy also sets out a number 
of services which the external auditor is excluded from providing to the 
Group. These include: 
•	bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records 
or financial statements;
•	financial information systems design and implementation relating 
to the financial statements or accounting records;
•	appraisal or valuation services or fairness opinions;
•	actuarial services;
•	internal audit outsourcing services; and
•	management functions, legal services or executive recruiting.
Under the Policy the Company is required to, and does, obtain written 
confirmation from the auditor that they remain independent on an 
annual basis. 
During the 2011/12 financial year Deloitte continued in their role as 
the Group’s tax advisers, having been appointed to the position on 
1 December 2010 following a competitive tender process in which four 
of the leading audit firms took part. The Audit Committee, having consulted 
with the Group Finance Director, concluded that the audit to non-audit 
fees ratio remained proportionate and in line with best practice guidelines 
and, given that the tax advisory services are managed by a partner 
who has no involvement with the audit of the Group, it remains satisfied 
that the appointment of Deloitte as tax advisers does not undermine their 
independence as the auditor to the Group and this has been confirmed 
by Deloitte. The Audit Committee also considered a discrete exercise 
that management proposed, and which was undertaken using the 
property expertise of Drivers Jonas Deloitte, which, again, the Audit 
Committee was satisfied did not impact Deloitte’s independence.
The Audit Committee confirms that the guidelines described above 
were followed throughout the year; that there are no independence 
issues in respect of the auditor; and that the Policy has been 
appropriately complied with throughout the year under review. 
Details of the audit related and non-audit fees incurred by the 
Group can be found on page 89. 
Remuneration Committee 
All members of the Remuneration Committee, as set out in Table 1 
on page 43, are considered by the Company to be independent in 
accordance with Code provision D.2.1. Richard Akers joined the 
Committee on 2 April 2012 and Mark Rolfe joined the Committee 
with effect from 1 July 2012. The Remuneration Committee met on 
five occasions during the financial year. Attendance at each of these 
meetings is set out in Table 1 on page 43. The full terms of reference  
for the Remuneration Committee are available from the Company’s 
website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. The report of the 
Remuneration Committee is set out on pages 53 to 66. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 51
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of having an ongoing relationship 
with its shareholders and other stakeholders. It fully supports the principles 
of the Code and the UK Stewardship Code which encourage open 
dialogue between companies and their shareholders. The Group has 
arrangements in place which enable it to communicate effectively with 
shareholders in respect of issues such as business strategy, governance, 
remuneration and any senior management or Board changes. 
Information about the Group, its Board and its business, including the 
annual and interim reports, interim management statements and trading 
updates, company announcements and details on services available 
to shareholders can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. Information of a price sensitive 
nature is communicated as required via a Regulatory Information Service 
and the Group strives to ensure that all key information is effectively 
and clearly communicated.
The Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director meet 
regularly with investors and analysts in order to convey an understanding 
of the Group’s operations, the market and its management objectives. 
These meetings take place during the year but particularly after the 
annual and interim results announcements. The Chairman and other 
Non-Executive Directors also have the opportunity to attend meetings 
with major shareholders at the request of either party and the Senior 
Independent Director is available to meet with major shareholders, as and 
when required, to gain an understanding of any issues and concerns. 
The notice of each AGM and related papers are circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. All Directors, 
including the Chairmen of the Committees, attend every AGM and are 
available to answer shareholder questions before, during and after the 
meeting. The Group Chief Executive also gives a presentation on the 
progress and performance of the Group prior to the formal business 
of the meeting.
In order to ensure that all Directors are aware of, and have a clear 
understanding of, the views of major shareholders, the Group Finance 
Director presents regular reports to the Board on the Company’s 
investor relations activities.
Going concern 
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group 
can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors 
consider are likely to affect its future development, financial performance 
and financial position are set out in the Group Chief Executive’s Review 
on pages 8 to 15 and the Business Review on pages 18 to 35. The 
material financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may impact 
the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 36 to 
39 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and 
capital risk are outlined in note 25 to the financial statements.
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider 
economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained 
in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 36 to 39, factors that 
particularly impact upon the performance of the Group include changes 
briefings and regular newsletters. Additionally the Group Chief Executive 
regularly briefs senior and middle management via conference calls 
which gives them the opportunity to ask questions and enter into 
dialogue. Individually and collectively, the Board and the Executive 
Committee members visit operating divisions and sites frequently 
in order to assess operational performance, engage with employees 
on a one-to-one basis and gain first-hand experience of employees’ 
aspirations and concerns.
The Group runs a graduate Recruitment and Development Programme 
consisting of a two-year multi-disciplinary programme of both on-job 
and off-job modules. 24 graduates completed their two year graduate 
programme in August 2012 and the Group has recruited 24 new 
graduates who commenced the first year of the Group’s graduate 
programme in September 2012. 
The Group is committed to appropriate employee training and 
development at all levels of the organisation. It has introduced a suite 
of leadership and management development programmes aimed at 
all levels within the organisation from graduates to middle management 
and through to senior management. The programme is designed and 
delivered internally and is tailored to the needs of the business. The 
Group also offers the Barratt Academy, a staged programme to enable 
employee development from Apprentice to Site Manager and also in the 
Technical and Commercial disciplines. Succession planning is in place 
across the Group and the leadership programmes assist with the 
development of individuals as part of the succession plan.
In February 2012 the Company invited all eligible employees of the 
Group to participate in the fourth grant under the Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
2008 AGM (the ‘SRSOS’). This gave those individuals who had 
participated in previous grants under the SRSOS, but not used up all 
of their entitlement, the opportunity to increase their savings and gave 
other employees the chance to participate in the SRSOS and become 
more involved in the Group’s performance. As at 30 June 2012, 
approximately 41% of employees now participate in the SRSOS.
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is supported by a robust 
whistleblowing procedure whereby individuals who become aware 
of possible improper, unethical or even illegal behaviour can either 
raise the matter with their manager or alternatively refer the matter 
to a confidential and independent whistleblowing reporting line (the 
‘Whistleblowing Number’) which is available to all employees 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week. Any issues reported to the Whistleblowing 
Number are immediately brought to the attention of the Chief Internal 
Auditor. The Chief Internal Auditor reviews and investigates the issue, 
seeking guidance from appropriate individuals within the Group, such 
as the Group Chief Executive and/or Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, as and when he deems necessary. Whistleblowing 
is a standing agenda item for every Audit Committee meeting. The 
Chief Internal Auditor therefore updates the Committee regularly on any 
new whistleblowing incidents, ongoing investigations and the outcome  
of any completed investigations. The Audit Committee also assesses 
the adequacy of the Group’s whistleblowing policy in accordance with 
the requirements of the Code as part of this process. 52 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
in the macroeconomic environment, such as buyer confidence, availability 
of mortgage finance for the Group’s customers and interest rates. 
As announced in May 2011, in accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
refinancing, on 26 April 2012, the Group’s committed revolving credit 
facilities (‘RCFs’) totalling £1,190.5m terminated and the forward start 
RCFs totalling £780m became available for drawing. At 30 June 2012, 
the Group’s total committed facilities and private placement notes were 
£1,091m. The maturity dates of these facilities range from April 2013 
to July 2021, with £690m of the RCFs maturing in May 2015.
The covenant package remains unchanged to that announced in 
May 2011.
On 6 September 2012, the Group gave voluntary notice to cancel the 
£90m RCF with effect from 12 September 2012, which reduces the 
Group’s total committed facilities and private placement notes to £1,001m. 
The committed facilities and private placement notes now in place provide 
appropriate headroom above our current forecast debt requirements.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the Directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being 
at least 12 months from the date of these financial statements. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
Post balance sheet events
As noted above, on 6 September 2012 the Group gave voluntary notice 
to cancel the £90m RCF with effect from 12 September 2012, which 
reduces the Group’s total committed facilities and private placement 
notes to £1,001m.

REMUNERATION REPORT
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2012 (the ‘Remuneration Report’) on behalf of the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’). The Remuneration Report is 
prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 
2008/410) (the ‘Regulations’) and will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
2012 AGM. Following implementation of the proposed new remuneration 
reporting regulations, the Company intends to align its future reporting 
with those regulations as soon as practicable after they come into effect.
The Board recognises that the Group’s remuneration policy should 
reflect the Group’s strategy to increase profitability and reduce overall 
indebtedness in a challenging market whilst seeking to attract, retain 
and motivate directors and senior managers of the quality required 
to enable successful future growth of the Group. At the same time 
executive remuneration must remain aligned with the long-term 
performance of the Group and the interests of shareholders. In 
determining the levels of remuneration for Executive Directors and 
members of senior management directly below the Executive Director 
level (the ‘Senior Management’), consideration is given to the overall 
performance of the Group, the fixed and variable incentives offered 
by comparable companies in the sector and a general group of 
40 pan-sector FTSE 350 members and the pay and employment 
conditions being offered to employees throughout the Group. Targets 
to drive increased profitability and reduced overall indebtedness are 
features of the short and long-term incentive schemes to ensure that 
Executive Directors’ and Senior Management performance is 
appropriately aligned with our corporate strategy.
Details of the Group’s remuneration policy and the remuneration 
packages of Executive Directors and the Senior Management can be 
found on the following pages of this Remuneration Report. However, 
key points to be aware of this year are:
1.  The base salaries of Steven Boyes and David Thomas have been 
adjusted to reflect an increase in responsibilities (following the 
resignation of Clive Fenton from the Board on 5 July 2012). Mark Clare 
has been awarded a salary increase of approximately 3% for the 
2012/13 financial year, which is in line with the increases awarded 
to employees across the Group. To provide some context, this is the 
second year in the last five years where any increase has been made 
to Executive Directors’ salaries.
2.  Given the significantly improved financial performance of the Group, 
the bonus payments for the 2011/12 financial year are at 148.75% 
of base salary after taking account of adjustments for the value of 
land sales. The Committee, on reviewing performance against the 
targets, concluded that, after taking into account the Group’s 
significant improvement in profit before tax and exceptional items 
(which represents 80% of the total award for the year) to £110.7m 
against the minimum threshold established for the bonus of £85m, 
a target level of £95m and a maximum threshold of £115m; reduction 
in overall indebtedness; and individual contributions of all senior 
managers to achieving these results, this level of bonus is justified. 
3.  For the 2012/13 financial year, Executive Directors and the 
Senior Management will be granted awards under the Long-Term 
Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’). Consistent with the approach taken 
in previous years, the Committee has decided to revert to making 
awards of 200% of base salary for the three Executive Directors but all 
other participants’ awards will be maintained at 150% of base salary. All 
awards under the LTPP will be subject to two performance conditions: 
half will be based on relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and the 
other half on Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) targets to be measured over 
a three year performance period commencing 1 July 2012.
4.  In May 2012, the Board reviewed the roles of the Non-Executive 
Directors and decided that they will sit on each principal Committee 
of the Board with effect from 1 July 2012. Consequently, Non-Executive 
Directors’ base annual fees have been increased to £48,000 from 
£40,000 to reflect the additional time commitment expected from 
them, with effect from the same date. This is the first increase for 
Non-Executive Directors since 2008. The Chairman’s fee will 
however remain unchanged.
5.  The Board will be asking shareholders at our forthcoming AGM 
to approve the renewal of the LTPP for a further ten years. The only 
substantial amendment to the LTPP relates to the specific inclusion 
of clawback provisions for any awards made under the LTPP going 
forward. Since 2010, clawback provisions have been agreed with, 
and accepted by, the Executive Directors and the Senior Management 
each time an award under the LTPP has been made. 
6.  In order to seek to mitigate the impact of key employees below Senior 
Management level taking up new job opportunities with competitors, 
particularly in London and the South East, we have introduced 
a limited Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’) for approximately 
30 of these employees. Awards under the LTIP are dependent 
on the Company achieving EPS targets as per the existing LTPP .  54 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REMUNERATION REPORT
During the year the Committee complied with those aspects of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) relevant to its business and 
took into account remuneration guidelines and guidance issued by the 
Association of British Insurers (the ‘ABI’), NAPF and PIRC when setting 
its remuneration policy. The Committee continues to seek to demonstrate 
its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through 
this report and through dialogue with institutional investors. As in previous 
years, the Committee did engage in dialogue with key institutional 
investors and shareholder representative bodies in respect of the 
Group’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors and Senior 
Management for the forthcoming year. The Committee took into account 
the feedback it received from this process, when setting the Group’s 
remuneration policy. 
The Committee will consider both the shareholders’ vote on the report 
and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report at the 
2012 AGM in determining future remuneration policy for all employees. 
It will also undertake a review, with the assistance of its legal and 
financial advisers, of the Group’s current remuneration policy in line with 
the Government’s announcement in June 2012, once the applicable 
regulations have been finalised. I hope that you will be able to support 
the Committee’s policy at this year’s AGM.
After eight years on the Board of the Company, six years as the 
Chairman of the Committee and three years as Senior Independent 
Director, I have decided to step down from each of these positions 
at the 2012 AGM. I am delighted to report that the Board has agreed 
to appoint Richard Akers as the new Chairman of the Committee 
(subject of course to the annual shareholders’ vote on re-election of 
directors). In order to enhance the effectiveness of the Committee further, 
Mark Rolfe joined the Committee as a member on 1 July 2012.
Robert Davies
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance 
policies approved by the Board (the ‘Terms of Reference’). The full 
Terms of Reference are available from the Company’s website at  
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Principal responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the Committee are:
•	 determining and reviewing the overall remuneration policy of the Group 
with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating directors and senior 
managers of the experience and calibre required by the Group having 
regard to remuneration paid to employees across the Group and an 
external comparable group of companies;
•	 determining, reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on 
the remuneration package and terms of appointment of the Chairman; 
•	 agreeing targets and benefits in respect of performance related pay 
schemes, including long-term performance plans, for all participating 
employees which are sufficiently challenging, fair and highly motivating, 
commensurate with sector practice, and consistent with maximising 
shareholder value and the interests and expectations of shareholders;
•	 agreeing severance arrangements or other compensation for loss 
of office or early retirement for the Chairman, Executive Directors 
and the Senior Management;
•	 determining the total remuneration package of the Group Chief 
Executive and, after consultation with him, the total individual 
remuneration package of each Executive Director and the Senior 
Management including bonuses, incentive payments and share 
options/awards and pension arrangements; and
•	 undertaking consultations with institutional investors on remuneration 
policy and/or other aspects of senior remuneration, as appropriate. 
The Committee is also responsible for appointing consultants to advise 
on executive remuneration. Details of the consultants utilised during the 
financial year ended 30 June 2012 are set out below.
Membership and proceedings of the Committee
The members of the Committee throughout the financial year were 
Bob Davies (Chairman), Bob Lawson, Rod MacEachrane and Tessa 
Bamford. Richard Akers also joined the Committee on 2 April 2012. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Tom Keevil, acts 
as Secretary to the Committee. The Committee met on five occasions 
during the financial year and attendance at each of these meetings is 
described in Table 1 on page 43 of the Corporate Governance Report. 
All Committee members are considered to be independent with no financial 
interest in the Committee’s decisions, other than as shareholders and the 
fees paid to them as Non-Executive Directors. The only material issue that 
arose from the annual effectiveness exercise was whether the Committee 
needed more strength in depth given the envisaged legislative changes 
in this area. Accordingly, Mark Rolfe joined the Committee with effect  
from 1 July 2012. The Committee also updated its Terms of Reference  
as part of the annual effectiveness process. Details of Directors’ 
shareholdings can be found on page 64 of this Remuneration Report.
As announced on 25 July 2012, Bob Davies will step down from his 
position as a Director of the Board at the 2012 AGM and taking into 
consideration the skills, knowledge and experience of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors, the Board identified Richard Akers as the 
most suitable Non-Executive Director to replace Bob Davies as the 
Chairman of the Committee. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 55
Advice/Advisers
During the year the Committee has taken advice from independent 
advisers, New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a division of Aon Hewitt Limited, 
which is a subsidiary of Aon plc. NBS was appointed by the Committee 
as its remuneration consultant in 2008 and is a founder signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct. In addition to 
advising the Committee, NBS also provided the Company with advice 
on implementing decisions made by the Committee and remuneration 
benchmarking. NBS’s fees for providing such advice amounted to 
£26,053 (201 1: £27 ,000) for the year ended 30 June 2012. Aon Hewitt 
Limited also provided broking services to the Company in respect of 
private medical insurance, Death in Service benefits and Group Income 
Protection. In line with best practice, the Committee assesses, from time 
to time, whether the appointment remains appropriate or if it should 
be put out to tender as part of its effectiveness review. Given a change in 
personnel at NBS, the Committee undertook such an assessment during 
the year and remains satisfied with NBS’s appointment, and the new lead 
adviser, as remuneration advisers to the Committee. Mercer Limited has 
advised the Company in relation to various pension issues and has been 
appointed actuary to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance 
Scheme since 2004. Slaughter and May, the Company’s corporate 
legal advisers, have also provided advice as and when necessary.
In addition to advice from external consultants, the Committee received 
input into its decision-making from the Group Chief Executive and the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, neither of whom was 
present at any time when his own remuneration was being considered.
Remuneration policy 
The Group’s remuneration policy aims to attract, retain, motivate and 
reward Executive Directors and the Senior Management who are fully 
focused and incentivised by short and long-term measures to sustain 
the growth and profitability of the business and reduce overall 
indebtedness, which remain the Group’s key strategic objectives. Each 
year the Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the 
context of the business environment, regulation and best practice, and 
market trends for the current and subsequent financial years. 
The Committee believes that executive remuneration should:
•	 be fully aligned with the performance and strategic objectives 
of the Group (such as increasing profitability and reducing 
overall indebtedness);
•	 be aligned with the interests and expectations of shareholders;
•	 take account of pay and employment conditions of employees 
across the Group; 
•	 reward the sustained growth and profitability of the business and 
the reduction of overall indebtedness; and 
•	 conform to market-leading best practice and regulations. 
The Committee has therefore based the executive remuneration 
package for the forthcoming year on the following principles:
•	 performance-related remuneration should be linked to the  
achievement of demanding performance targets;
•	performance-related remuneration should reflect the reallocation 
of responsibilities upon the appointment of Steven Boyes as Chief 
Operating Officer and changes to the role performed by David Thomas; 
currently approximately 72.2% of the Group Chief Executive’s and 
approximately 72.3% of the other Executive Directors’ remuneration 
potential is performance based (see Charts 1 and 2);
•	 performance-related remuneration should align the interests 
of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance 
targets based on measures of shareholder return and accordingly 
the Committee’s policy is to use a combination of TSR and EPS 
performance conditions to achieve this alignment; 
•	 total remuneration for outstanding performance should be 
competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector; and
•	total remuneration should take into account levels of pay and 
employment conditions throughout the Group.

The Committee has the discretion to, and does, consider the effect of 
corporate performance on environmental, social and governance risks 
and issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and the Senior Management to ensure that remuneration structures 
do not inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour. As a result, 
10% of any bonus earned will be forfeited if the Group does not achieve 
its safety, health and environmental compliance targets (see page 31 
of the Business Review). During the year the Committee considered 
the structure of Executive Directors’ and the Senior Management’s 
remuneration packages from a general risk perspective and is satisfied 
that they do not encourage inappropriate risk taking. Risk is also taken 
into account when setting the targets and when determining entitlements 
under variable reward schemes. The Committee ensures that targets, 
whilst stretching, are: realistic and attainable; for the long-term benefit of 
the Group; and not achievable by taking inappropriate business risks. 
In undertaking its review of the Group’s remuneration policy, the 
Committee considered a proposal by the Board to seek to mitigate 
the impact of key employees below Senior Management level taking 
up new job opportunities with competitors operating nationally, but most 
notably in London and the South East. Recognising the risks associated 
with losses from this talent pool, the Committee approved the introduction 
of the LTIP for approximately 30 employees operating immediately below 
Senior Management level. The Executive Directors’ and Senior  56 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012

and Mark Clare. David Thomas joined the Company in July 2009. 
On 30 June 2012, Mark Clare, Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton each 
met the requirements under these shareholding guidelines.
There are no formal shareholding guidelines for the Chairman, the 
Non-Executive Directors and the Senior Management, however they 
are encouraged to hold shares in the Company in order to align their 
interests with those of shareholders.
The remuneration package for Executive Directors and the 
Senior Management
The remuneration package for Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management comprises:
•	 b a s e s a l a r y;
•	 annual performance related bonus;
•	 long-term share incentives; and
•	 pension and other benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related 
element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive 
Directors and the Senior Management and are set out in the following 
sections of this Remuneration Report. Details on how the expected 
values for share based payments are calculated can be found in  
note 28 to the financial statements on pages 118 to 123.
Base salary
Base salaries for Executive Directors and the Senior Management are 
a fixed annual sum payable in monthly instalments in cash. Base salaries 
are reviewed annually, with assistance from NBS, having regard to: 
individual responsibilities, skills and experience; salary levels for similar 
positions in other major house builders and other comparable companies 
comprising the FTSE 250 and a general group of 40 pan-sector FTSE 350 
members with a market capitalisation and turnover of between 50% and 
200% of that of the Company; the level of pay increases awarded across 
the Group; economic and market conditions; and the performance of the 
Group. Any changes to base salary take effect from 1 July annually. 
On 5 July 2012, Clive Fenton resigned as a Director of the Company and 
all relevant Group companies. He remains an employee of the Company 
until 31 December 2012, during which time he will receive a base salary 
of £25,000 per month and a benefits package comprising the provision 
of a motor vehicle and private medical insurance. He is also required 
to comply with certain non-compete covenants during this period 
of employment and a further six months thereafter. His executive 
responsibilities were primarily subsumed within the revised remit of 
Steven Boyes who was appointed as Chief Operating Officer (‘COO’) 
for the Group, and to a lesser extent by David Thomas.
In recognition of the additional responsibilities assumed by him, Steven 
Boyes has been awarded an increase in his base salary of approximately 
10.5% to £430,000 per annum. David Thomas’ base salary has also been 
increased by approximately 5.4% to £430,000 partially also to reflect an 
increase in his responsibilities. In addition, David’s pension contribution 
rate has been increased to 30% so that it corresponds with the rate 
for the other Executive Directors. The Committee has agreed to award 
Mark Clare a salary increase of 3.3% for the 2012/13 financial year, in 
line with the salary increases awarded to the Senior Management and 
all employees across the Group. Executive Directors’ salaries, with effect 
from 1 July 2012, will therefore be as shown in Table 2.
Management will not be granted any awards under the LTIP . On an 
annual basis, subject to prior approval from the Committee the equivalent 
of 20% of each participant’s salary will be deferred into the LTIP . The LTIP 
will be subject to an EPS performance condition on the same basis as 
any LTPP award which may be granted during the 2012/13 financial year 
(thereby aligning the objectives) and subsequent LTPP awards and a 
continued employment condition. In the event that the participant is still 
an employee of the Group at the end of the three year performance 
period and the Group achieves the specified EPS targets, the participant 
will receive an equivalent number of shares to the amount of bonus 
deferred. By using the same stretching EPS targets as the LTPP , the 
Committee is ensuring that the LTIP is aligned with our strategic 
objectives of increasing profitability and reducing overall indebtedness.
Clawback
The Company has a power of clawback in respect of any annual bonus 
paid and to any share awards granted under the LTPP or the Executive 
Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’) in respect of the financial year ended 
30 June 2010 and later years, subject in the case of HMRC approved 
options, to such approval. These provisions have, since 2010, been agreed 
with, and accepted by, Executive Directors and Senior Management at the 
time of granting any new awards under the LTPP or ESOS. It is intended to 
embed these provisions in the amended rules of the LTPP which are to be 
presented for approval by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. In addition, the 
clawback provisions will also apply to any awards granted under the LTIP .
The clawback can be invoked if:
(a) it is necessary to restate the Group’s accounts used to calculate 
a participant’s entitlement to bonus or share awards in circumstances 
where the original over-statement has led to a bonus being paid or share 
awards being granted which would not otherwise have been paid or 
granted; or (b) the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in 
connection with his or her employment and this related to an act which 
led to a bonus being paid or share awards being granted to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the bonus 
and/or share award will be retrospectively recalculated. If bonus monies 
have been paid, the participant will be required to reimburse the 
Company for an amount up to the total amount of the net bonus paid, 
less any bonus that the Committee determines would have been paid 
regardless of the event in question. If share awards have been granted, 
the number of awards or options granted will be reduced accordingly.
Executive Directors’ shareholding guidelines
The Committee has implemented, and annually reviews, the following 
shareholding guidelines for all Executive Directors in order to further 
align the interests of the Executives with the expectations of the 
Company’s shareholders:
•	within five years of being appointed to the Board, Executive Directors 
are required to build up, and retain, ordinary shares in the Company 
equivalent in value to 100% of their base annual salary;
•	the share price to be used for the purposes of determining the value 
of the shares will be that prevailing on 30 June in each year; and
•	provided that Executive Directors hold the appropriate level of shares, 
they may sell shares (i) to realise their LTPP awards; or (ii) upon the 
exercise of share options, subject to the normal Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules’ requirements for directors’ dealings.
These guidelines are currently only applicable to Steven Boyes  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 57
status for both the Recommend score and the Quality score under the 
Home Builders Federation scheme. Failure to achieve this will result in 
10% of any bonus earned being forfeited. In terms of safety, health and 
environment, 10% of the total bonus earned will be forfeited for failure 
to achieve the on-target performance measure. As a result, if neither 
of these performance measures were to be achieved, in aggregate 
20% of the annual bonus earned would be forfeited. 
2011/12 financial year
For the financial year ended 30 June 2012, the Committee has approved 
a bonus payment to Executive Directors (no part of which is pensionable) 
of 148.75% of base salary (48.75% of which will be deferred into shares) 
based on performance against profit before tax, cash generation, employee 
engagement and individual objectives and after taking account of 
adjustments for the value of land sales. The Committee believes that after 
taking into account the Group’s significant improvement in profit before tax 
and exceptional items (which determined 80% of the total bonus for the 
year) to £1 10.7m against the minimum threshold established for the bonus 
of £85m, the target level of £95m and maximum threshold of £1 15m; the 
reduction of overall indebtedness to £167 .7m; and the contribution that 
the Executive Directors and the Senior Management have individually 
and collectively made to this strong operational and financial performance, 
this level of bonus is justified. Clive Fenton will receive no bonus in respect 
of the 201 1/12 financial year or the 2012/13 financial year.
Share incentive schemes
During the year the Committee undertook a review of the share incentive 
schemes currently in operation and agreed that grant levels, performance 
criteria and vesting schedules remain appropriate to the Company’s current 
circumstances and prospects. There have been no significant amendments 
to the terms and conditions of any entitlement under any scheme. Details 
of all Executive Directors’ long-term performance plans and share options 
are set out in Tables 7 and 8 respectively on pages 64 and 65. 
Each of the share schemes currently in operation is subject to two 
performance conditions and a three-year performance period. Half 
of the awards will vest on attainment of a performance target on relative 
TSR and the other half on the attainment of a target based on EPS. 
The TSR and EPS performance conditions are calculated as follows:
TSR
The TSR element is calculated as the percentage change in share price 
plus dividends over a three-year performance period against the 
comparable group comprising the FTSE 250 (excluding investment 
trusts), with the opening share price averaged across the dealing days 
in the three-month period ending immediately before the start of the 
performance period and the closing price averaged over the dealing days 
in the last three months of the performance period. Performance against 
the TSR target is measured at the end of a three-year performance period.
EPS
The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the earnings in 
EPS over a three-year performance period by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the performance period 
(excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust). For all schemes 
(except for the 2009/10 ESOS) performance against the EPS target 
is tested after the end of a three-year performance period. Details in 
respect of the testing of the 2009/10 ESOS can be found on page 60 
of this Remuneration Report.

Annual bonus
The Company’s annual bonus plan aims to motivate and reward 
Executive Directors and the Senior Management for the achievement 
of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures as set 
by the Board. The Committee ensures that performance measures  
for bonuses are stretching whilst having regard to the nature and risk 
profile of the Company and the interests of its shareholders. 
2012/13 financial year
For the financial year ending 30 June 2013, the Committee has 
maintained the maximum bonus for Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management at 150% of base salary but simplified the bonus structure, 
so that depending upon performance, this flexible element of 
remuneration will pay an amount between 0% and 150% of base salary 
on a linear basis. Any awards in excess of 100% of base salary will be 
deferred into shares in the Company, held under the Co-Investment 
Plan for a period of three years with a continued employment condition. 
No other performance conditions will apply to this award and the 
Committee has agreed that no matching shares will be awarded against 
these shares. The payment for on-target performance will again remain 
at 75% of base salary, however the ratio of profit before tax to overall 
indebtedness has been adjusted from 120:15 to 100:35. It is worth 
noting that the on-target and maximum bonus potential for the 
forthcoming year still remain below the levels in place prior to the 
economic downturn, which were at 130% and 180% of salary 
respectively. In addition, the Committee has retained an absolute 
discretion in the making of bonus payments, and will continue to 
consider, among other factors, the underlying financial performance 
of the business relative to the sector in its decision making.
The performance measures against which bonus payments for the 
2012/13 financial year will be determined are as follows:
Performance  
measure
% of Salary 
Maximum
Profit before tax 100
Overall indebtedness 35
Personal objectives 10
Employee engagement 5
Total 150*
 
*Any bonus earned in excess of 100% will be deferred into shares.
In addition to these performance measures, the Committee has retained 
the penalties introduced last year for under-performance in respect of 
customer service and safety, health and environment. The customer 
service penalty has however been revised so that performance is no 
longer measured against the achievement of the on-target percentage 
for customer service but is dependent on the achievement of five star  58 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REMUNERATION REPORT
In addition to the above, vesting of the 2012/13 LTPP Award will be 
subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee 
must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group 
over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as determined 
by applying the above targets. If the Committee is not of this view, then it 
is empowered to reduce the level of vesting.
Co-Investment Plan
The Committee has decided to use the Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) 
to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess 
of 100% of base salary. Any shares so awarded are subject to a 
continued employment performance condition over a three-year 
performance period. The Committee has agreed that no matching 
shares will be awarded against these shares.
The Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 
2005 for the purpose of compulsorily deferring any annual bonus earned 
above target into shares held under this Plan. Participants also have the 
opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to 
a maximum of 25% of base salary into the Plan. Under the rules of the 
Plan the Committee has a discretion which allows it to award matching 
shares at a rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum 
of four for one for voluntary deferral (the ‘Matching Award’). Any Matching 
Awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a 
period of three years.
For the financial years ended 30 June 2010 and 2011 no bonus was 
earned in excess of 100% of base salary by Executive Directors and 
Senior Management, and therefore no shares were deferred into the 
Plan. For the financial year ended 30 June 2012, Executive Directors 
(other than Clive Fenton who will not receive any bonus for the 2011/12 
financial year) earned, in aggregate, a bonus of £702,293 in excess of 
100% of base salary, which will be deferred into shares based on the 
share price as calculated by averaging the closing middle-market 
quotations, as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange, for the first five dealing days following the date of the 
announcement of the Group’s annual results for the financial year ended 
30 June 2012. The actual awards will be set out in next year’s report. 
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary by the Senior 
Management for the 2011/12 financial year will also be deferred into 
the Plan on the same basis.
 
TSR performance is calculated by NBS and EPS performance is verified 
by the Committee.
New awards to be granted during the financial year ending  
30 June 2013
Consistent with previous years, the Committee has decided to grant 
LTPP awards to Executive Directors and the Senior Management during 
the financial year ending 30 June 2013.
The LTPP was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 
2003. Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, 
taking into account individual performance and the overall performance 
of the Group. An employee is not eligible to receive options under the 
ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. The 
ten year limit on powers to grant any awards under the current LTPP 
expires on 12 November 2013. Consequently, a resolution seeking the 
approval of shareholders to extend the LTPP for a further ten years, to 
12 November 2023, will be proposed at the 2012 AGM. The Committee 
has also taken this opportunity to review and update the rules of the 
LTPP in order to take into account legislative changes and to include 
specific provisions relating to the Committee’s power of clawback. 
Further details can be found in the Notice of the 2012 AGM. 
Any LTPP awards that are made in the 2012/13 financial year (the 
‘2012/13 LTPP Award’) will not exceed 200% of base salary for each of 
the Executive Directors and 150% of base salary for all other participants. 
The 2012/13 LTPP Award will be subject to three-year TSR and EPS 
conditions. The vesting of half of the 2012/13 LTPP Award subject to 
a TSR condition will be dependent upon the Company’s performance 
over three years, commencing 1 July 2012, against the constituents 
of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
Levels of vesting against the TSR condition will be as follows:
Rank of Company’s TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile or above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The other half of the award which is based on an EPS measure will 
vest on the attainment of the EPS target for the financial year ending 
30 June 2015. Reflecting the significant improvement in the Company’s 
performance, current consensus targets for profit before tax for the 
financial year 2014/15, the Board’s assessment of the optimal scale 
of the business and the need to ensure continued focus on managing 
debt, the levels of vesting against the EPS will be as follows: 
EPS target – Financial year 2014/15
Level of vesting  
of EPS element
26 pence per share or higher 100%
22 pence per share 50%

employees of the Group to participate. Under the SRSOS, employees 
can save up to £250 per month for three or five years and receive options 
to purchase the Company’s shares at a discount of up to 20% on the 
market value. In March 2012, 1,623 employees (39.5% of those eligible) 
applied to participate in the fourth grant of options under the SRSOS at 
an exercise price of 125 pence per share. 
Outstanding Executive share awards
Long-Term Performance Plan
In December 2010 the Company made awards under the LTPP 
(the ‘2010/11 LTPP’). These awards were based on an allocation of 
ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 150% of base 
salary and are subject to three-year TSR and EPS performance 
conditions. There is no re-testing of performance conditions. 
Performance conditions
Half of the 2010/11 LTPP will vest on the attainment of a performance 
target based on TSR over a three-year performance period commencing 
1 July 2010.
The levels of vesting against the TSR targets are as follows:
Rank of Company’s TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile and above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The other half of the 2010/1 1 LTPP will vest on the attainment of EPS 
targets for the financial year ending 30 June 2013. The Committee believed 
given the macroeconomic uncertainties surrounding the Group’s future 
performance at that time that a wide target range should be set for the 
EPS element in order to ensure full engagement from management by 
having an achievable minimum vesting level whilst requiring outstanding 
performance to achieve maximum level of vesting. Accordingly, the EPS 
targets and corresponding levels of vesting are as follows:
 
EPS target – Financial year 2012/13
Level of vesting  
of EPS element
25 pence per share or higher 100%
10 pence per share 25%
Less than 10 pence per share 0%
Between 10 pence and  
25 pence per share
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
In addition to the above performance targets, the 2010/11 LTPP is subject 
to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group over the 
performance period warrants the level of vesting as determined by 
applying the above targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has 
the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it deems appropriate. 
Executive Share Option Plan
The award granted under the Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘ESOP’) 
in 2003 at an exercise price of 357 .37 pence per share vested in 2006, 
however, there are a number of participants, including Steven Boyes, 
who are still to exercise the options granted to them. 
 Executive share awards granted during the year 
Long-Term Performance Plan
During the year the Company granted LTPP awards to the Executive 
Directors (the ‘2011/12 LTPP’). The 2011/12 LTPP was based on an 
allocation of ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 150% 
of base salary and is subject to three-year TSR and EPS performance 
conditions. There is no re-testing of performance conditions.
Performance conditions
Half of the 2011/12 LTPP will vest on the attainment of a performance 
target based on TSR over a three-year performance period commencing 
1 July 2011.
The levels of vesting against the TSR targets are as follows:
Rank of Company’s TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile and above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The other half of the 2011/12 LTPP will vest on the attainment of EPS 
targets for the financial year ending 30 June 2014. The Committee 
believed given the macroeconomic uncertainties surrounding the 
Group’s future performance at that time, that a wide target range should 
be set for the EPS element in order to ensure full engagement from 
management by having an achievable minimum vesting level whilst 
requiring outstanding performance to achieve maximum level of vesting. 
Accordingly, the EPS targets and corresponding levels of vesting are 
as follows:
 
EPS target – Financial year 2013/14
Level of vesting  
of EPS element
30 pence per share or higher 100%
12.5 pence per share 25%
Below 12.5 pence per share 0%
Between 12.5 pence  
and 30 pence per share
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
In addition to the above performance targets, the 2011/12 LTPP is subject 
to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group over the 
performance period warrants the level of vesting as determined by 
applying the above targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has 
the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it deems appropriate. 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘SRSOS’) was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2008.
The SRSOS was implemented in order to promote share ownership 
amongst all employees of the Group, linking employee benefit to the 
performance of the Group and to aid retention of staff. All employees and 
Executive Directors who work more than 25 hours per week, and have 
five or more years of continuous service with the Company (or any 
subsidiary in the Group nominated to join in the SRSOS) ending on the 
date of grant are eligible to participate in the scheme. The Board has 
discretion to reduce the period of qualifying service and to invite other  60 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REMUNERATION REPORT
of each of the financial years during the performance period and each 
year’s EPS target will determine the vesting level of one sixth of the total 
award. It should be noted that the approach of using three one-year 
targets was adopted due to the uncertain economic conditions 
prevailing in 2009 when options under the ESOS were first granted. 
The Committee has since reverted back to the policy of setting 
three-year targets.
The EPS targets are before exceptional items and the impact of the 
reduction in the corporation tax rate from 28% to 24%. The level of 
vesting for the financial years ended 30 June 2010, 2011 and 2012 
were as follows:
2011/12 2010/11 2009/10
Amount of EPS Element

(one third of 50%) 16.67% 16.67% 16.67%
Minimum Target 5.8 pence 2.8 pence -4.4 pence
On Target 7.3 pence 4.3 pence -2.8 pence
Maximum Target 8.9 pence 7.3 pence 1.8 pence
Achievement Against Target 100.0% 39.0% 57.6%
Actual Level of Vesting 16.7% 6.5% 9.6%*
* In 2010 the Company disclosed that 10.17% of the award had vested for the 2009/10 financial year. Due 
to a change in the Group’s tax charge for that year, which was included in the 2010 published financial 
statements, the Company’s EPS was marginally reduced. Accordingly, the level of vesting was reduced to 9.6%.
Subject to the Committee’s overriding discretion to take into account, 
among other factors, performance relative to the sector and the 
underlying financial performance of the business, including free cash 
flow, when deciding if the level of vesting is justified, a cumulative total 
of 32.8% of the award is likely to vest on 10 December 2012 (being  
three years from the date of grant). Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management will then have until 10 December 2019 to exercise their 
options, otherwise they will lapse.
Executive share awards lapsed during the year
Executive Share Option Scheme
The options granted under the 2008/09 ESOS were subject to a 
Return on Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) financial performance measure, 
calculated as operating profit (measured across the whole financial 
year to 30 June 2011) divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less 
goodwill and intangible assets (being the average of the 12 month-end 
figures during the same year). There is no opportunity to retest any 
performance criteria. 
The options were tested during the 2011/12 financial year and, as the 
ROCE performance target had not been achieved, the options lapsed.
Recruitment Award to Group Finance Director
The recruitment award made to David Thomas in recognition of his loss 
of benefit under his previous employer’s long-term incentive and share 
option plans, which was subject to the same performance targets as 
the options granted under the 2008/09 ESOS and was on substantially 
the same terms and conditions as those options, was also tested and 
lapsed after 30 June 2011.
Dilution
On maturity or vesting of any of its share incentive schemes the Company 
seeks to satisfy the shares through: a new issue of shares; market 
purchases; or the Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’). As at 30 June 2012 
The ESOP was adopted by the Company in November 1997 . Any 
options granted under the ESOP are required to be held for a minimum 
of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and 
will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the grant date. The level 
of vesting of these options was subject to the achievement of objective 
performance conditions set by the Committee.
Under the rules of the ESOP no further options can be granted under 
this plan. Options which have been granted to Executive Directors 
in previous years remain unchanged and are set out on page 65.
Vesting of the 2009/10 ESOS 
The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 
2008. It was the view of the Committee that the focus on share price 
growth arising from the use of market value options combined with 
performance conditions would ensure strong alignment with the 
interests and expectations of shareholders at the time. Options awarded 
under the ESOS must normally be held for a minimum of three years 
from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not 
exercised within ten years of grant. The maximum number of shares 
over which an employee may be granted options in any financial year 
under the ESOS will be limited so that the aggregate cost of exercise 
does not exceed 200% of their annual base salary. The exercise 
of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement 
of objective performance conditions set by the Committee.
As the Committee has decided to grant awards under the LTPP for the 
2012/13 financial year it will not be making any grants under the ESOS 
as an employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and 
awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. 
The last grant made under the ESOS was the 2009/10 ESOS, which is 
subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions. The Committee chose 
these targets as the most appropriate measure of financial performance 
for a house builder at the time of the grant, as they are a fundamental 
measure of the Group’s underlying performance and are directly linked 
to the generation of returns to shareholders.
Performance conditions
Half of the 2009/10 ESOS will vest on the attainment of a performance 
target based on relative TSR, and the other half on the attainment of 
a target based on EPS growth. 
Levels of vesting against the TSR targets were as follows:
Rank of Company’s TSR against 
comparator group
Level of vesting  
of TSR element
Upper Quartile or above 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
Between Upper Quartile 
and Median
Straight-line basis  
between 25% and 100%
The TSR element was tested after 30 June 2012 and as the result 
was below median, none of the TSR element of the award will vest.
The EPS element of the award has three separate annual components 
with the Committee setting targets annually for the following financial 
year. Performance against each annual EPS target is tested at the end  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 61
Pension benefits 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that they can 
choose to participate in the Company’s money purchase pension plan 
or receive a cash supplement that does not count for incentive purposes. 
Only the base salary element of a Director’s remuneration is pensionable. 
The defined benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) was closed to new entrants in 2001 
and it ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefits for current 
members with effect from 30 June 2009. Mark Clare is paid a cash 
supplement equal to 30% of his base salary per annum. David Thomas 
was, for the 2011/12 financial year, entitled to a cash supplement equal 
to 25% of his base salary, 18.5% of which he received in cash and the 
remaining 6.25% was paid into the defined contribution section of the 
Scheme. For 2012/13 financial year David Thomas’ cash supplement 
has been increased to 30% of base salary so that it corresponds with 
the rate given to the other Executive Directors. 
Up until 30 June 2009, when the defined benefit section of the Scheme 
ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefits for current employees, 
Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton were members of the defined benefit 
section of the Scheme. This entitlement was based on a 1/60 accrual 
rate and a normal retirement age of 65. The entitlement of Clive Fenton 
was restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 
1989 for service up to 5 April 2006 and thereafter was calculated by 
reference to his base salary. Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes and 
Clive Fenton have been entitled to receive a cash supplement equal 
to 30% of their respective base salaries per annum. Steven Boyes 
receives the full 30% as a cash supplement and, until his resignation 
from the Board on 5 July 2012, Clive Fenton received 18.68% as a  
cash supplement and the remaining 11.32% was paid into the defined 
contribution section of the Scheme.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2010 
showed a deficit of £66.5m calculated on the basis of the Scheme’s 
technical provisions. The Company and the Trustees of the Scheme have 
agreed a plan to pay off the shortfall which requires the Company to 
continue to make deficit reduction payments of £13.3m per annum until 
31 January 2017 . The valuation for the financial statements was updated 
to 30 June 2012 by a qualified independent actuary and a deficit of 
£21.4m (2011: £11.8m) is included in the Group balance sheet as shown 
in note 26 of the financial statements. On 30 June 2009, the Company 
exercised its consent under the rules of the Scheme and agreed to cease 
offering future accrual of defined benefits for its current employees. 
Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the defined contribution 
money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009. 
The Company will continue to pay the deficit reduction contributions  
at a level not lower than the £13.3m agreed in December 2008 and will 
discuss the funding requirements of the Scheme with the Trustees if any 
material change in the Group’s financial circumstances is anticipated.
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for an insured lump sum 
of up to five times pensionable salary on death in service. Current 
employees who were members of the defined benefit section of the 
Scheme at closure also retain their dependants’ pension entitlements.
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to or are receivable by 
current and/or past directors in respect of their qualifying services during 
the financial year and there are no arrangements in place that guarantee 
pensions with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
the Company proposes to satisfy outstanding options under the 2009/10 
ESOS, the SRSOS and the ESOP through a new issue of shares. All other 
share schemes, including the LTPP , are to be satisfied through shares 
currently held or to be purchased in the market by the EBT.
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued under 
its schemes and the impact on dilution limits. The Company is satisfied 
that as at 30 June 2012 its usage of shares is compliant with the relevant 
dilution limits set by the ABI in respect of all share plans (10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period) and 
discretionary share plans (5% of the Company’s issued share capital 
in any rolling ten-year period). In the event that the outstanding options 
under each of the schemes to be satisfied through a new issue of 
shares were to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2012, the 
resulting issue of new shares would represent 1.34% of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at that date.
Change of Control
The rules of each share scheme operated by the Company contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. In the event that a change 
of control does occur any unvested options/awards will become vested 
on the date of the relevant event. However, the number of options/
awards that vest will be pro-rated depending on the number of weeks 
completed within the relevant performance period and the level of 
performance conditions achieved during that period. Options/awards 
which have already vested as at the date of the relevant event may 
still be exercised within prescribed timescales set out in the rules.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • REMUNERATION REPORT
and the Senior Independent Director received an additional annual 
fee of £5,000. In May 2012 the Board reviewed the roles of the 
Non-Executive Directors and decided that with effect from 1 July 2012 
all Non-Executive Directors would sit on each of its committees. 
In recognition of the additional time commitments this would entail 
and taking into consideration the results of a benchmarking exercise 
undertaken by NBS on Non-Executive Directors’ fees, it was agreed 
to increase the Non-Executive Directors’ base annual fee to £48,000 
with effect from the same date. It should be noted that this is the only 
fee increase for Non-Executive Directors in the last four years and that 
the total fees, after the increase, are still within the fee limits included in 
the Articles of Association with the approval of shareholders at the 2008 
annual general meeting. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any performance related schemes such as the annual bonus or any 
incentive schemes, nor do they receive any pension or private medical 
insurance benefits. 
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service 
contracts and their appointments can be terminated (by the Board) 
without compensation for loss of office and by giving the appropriate 
length of notice as prescribed in their respective letters of appointment. 
The notice period applicable for the Chairman, Bob Lawson, is three 
months and for each of the other Non-Executive Directors the notice 
period is one month. Under governance policies approved by the Board, 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term and usually 
serve a second three-year term subject to performance review and 
re-election by shareholders. Beyond this a further term of up to three 
years may be served subject to rigorous review by the Chairman and 
the Nomination Committee and re-election by shareholders. Details of 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment can be found in Table 4.

Service contracts 
In accordance with the Company’s policy, it engages all Executive 
Directors on the basis of one-year rolling contracts which can be 
terminated by 12 months’ notice given by either the Company or by the 
Executive at any time. There are no specific provisions for compensation 
on early termination (except for payment in lieu of holidays accrued but 
untaken) or loss of office due to a takeover bid. The Committee will apply 
mitigation against any contractual obligations as it deems fair and 
reasonable and will seek legal advice on the Company’s liability to pay 
compensation. The Committee also seeks to reduce the level of any 
compensation payable and takes into account, amongst other factors, 
the individual’s and the Group’s performance; the Director’s obligation 
to mitigate his/her own loss; and the Director’s length of service when 
calculating termination payments. The contracts entitle Executive 
Directors to the provision of a company car, annual medical screening, 
private medical insurance, some telephone costs and contributions to 
the cost of obtaining independent tax advice. Details of the Executive 
Directors’ service contracts are included in Table 3 and their emoluments 
are shown in Table 5 on page 63 of this Remuneration Report.

Non-Executive directorships
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to accept 
one Non-Executive directorship outside the Company and retain any 
fees received from such a position. Executive Directors are not allowed 
to take on the Chairmanship of any FTSE 100 company. Board approval 
will not be given for any Non-Executive position where such appointment 
would lead to a material conflict of interest or would have an effect on 
the Director’s ability to perform his/her duties to the Company. During 
the year Mark Clare was a trustee and Director of the BRE Trust and 
UKGBC Limited. Mark Clare does not receive any fees for either of these 
positions. The time commitment expected, in aggregate, for these 
positions is approximately 25 hours per annum. Neither David Thomas 
nor Steven Boyes held any Non-Executive directorships with other 
companies during the year.
 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board 
on the recommendation of a Committee of Executive Directors having 
regard to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with 
the role. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Committee again having regard to the time 
commitment and responsibilities of the role. The remuneration of the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed annually taking 
into account the fees paid by other companies in the house building sector. 
The base annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors during the financial 
year ended 30 June 2012 was £40,000. The Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees received an additional annual fee of £10,000  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 63

*   The performance condition set by the Committee for the ESOP award granted in 2003, that the growth in EPS of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%,
was met in 2006, but the option has not yet been exercised.
** All outstanding options and awards held by Clive Fenton lapsed on 5 July 2012 upon his resignation as a Director.
The ESOS is divided into two sub-schemes, one of which is approved under the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and the other of which 
is not. The exercise price is calculated differently for each sub-scheme in accordance with the rules of the ESOS. The performance conditions for the 
ESOS grants are described on page 60.
The performance conditions of the 2008/09 ESOS awards together with the performance condition of the recruitment award to the Group Finance 
Director made in 2009 were tested after the year end and none of the conditions had been achieved. Accordingly, the 2008/09 ESOS awards and 
the recruitment award to the Group Finance Director lapsed.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 30 June 2012 was 139.1 pence. The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company during

Notes
With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the link between 
accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed. As the Scheme is closed, no Directors have made any contributions to the Scheme 
during the year to 30 June 2012.
The total pension accrued at the end of the year is the amount that each Director had accrued when the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual 
at 30 June 2009 plus revaluation in accordance with the Scheme rules.
The inflation figure of 5.6% is based on the change in RPI from September 2010 to September 2011, consistent with previous years.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2008. The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need 
to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’ pension benefits. They do not represent 
sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and 
its Directors, such as market movements and the Trustees’ decision to update the assumptions used.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
Except as disclosed in respect of Clive Fenton and David Thomas on pages 61 and 63, none of the Directors have any rights under the Company’s 
money purchase pension scheme.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GOVERNANCE • OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
(‘East Scotland’), purchased an apartment from East Scotland 
at a purchase price of £176,025.
Each of the aforementioned purchases was conducted at a fair and 
reasonable market price based on comparable transactions at that 
time and were undertaken between a subsidiary director and a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. No shareholder approval 
is therefore required for these purchases under the Act or the Listing 
Rules. There were no amounts outstanding at 30 June 2012 in relation 
to these transactions. 
Property, plant and equipment
The Directors are of the opinion that the value of land and buildings 
included within the Group’s property, plant and equipment is in excess 
of book value but that the difference is not material in relation to the 
affairs of the Group.
Disclosure of information to auditor 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (that is, information needed by the Company’s auditor in 
connection with preparing its report) of which the Company’s auditor 
is not aware.
Each of the Directors has taken all the relevant steps that he/she ought 
to have taken in accordance with his/her duty as a Director to make 
him/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418(2) of the Act.
Charitable and political contributions 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £30,205 (2011: 
£45,700). The total amounts given for each charitable purpose were:
Purpose £
The advancement of education 3,450
The advancement of religion 1,100
The advancement of health and saving lives 4,340
The advancement of community development 2,879
The advancement of amateur sport 1,975
The relief of those in need because of youth, age, 
ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other 
disadvantage 8,507

Any other purposes 6,954
 
No political contributions were made during the year (2011: £nil).

an administrative function only) located throughout Great Britain at 
the end of the financial year. A full list of the Group’s offices and their 
locations can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary at the registered office of the Company or from 
the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Risk management objectives 
The principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 
36 to 39. The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative 
financial instruments are detailed in notes 22, 23 and 24 to the financial 
statements. Details of the Group’s liquidity, market price, credit and cash 
flow risks are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Likely future developments 
An indication of likely future developments in the Group including in the 
field of research and development is given in the Business Review on 
pages 18 to 35.
Creditor payments 
The Group is responsible for agreeing the detail of terms and conditions 
relating to transactions with its suppliers. It is Group policy to ensure that 
suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the 
agreed terms of payment with suppliers where the goods and services 
have been supplied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions 
of contract. Implementation of this policy resulted in a supplier payment 
period by the Group of 29 days (2011: 26 days) for its trade creditors as 
at 30 June 2012.
Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each. All issued shares are in registered 
form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s issued share capital 
and of the movements in the share capital during the year can be found 
in note 27 to the financial statements on page 118.
Subject to the Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ rights, shares 
are at the disposal of the Board. At each AGM the Board seeks 
authorisation from its shareholders to allot shares. At the AGM held on 
16 November 2011, the Directors were given authority to allot shares up 
to a nominal value of £32,181,332 (representing 33.33% of the nominal 
value of the Company’s issued share capital), such authority to remain 
valid until the end of the 2012 AGM or close of business on 15 February 
2013, whichever is earlier. A resolution to renew this authority will be 
proposed at the 2012 AGM.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may be issued 
with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does 
not make specific provision) as the Board may decide. 
Subject to the Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to any 
existing class of shares may be varied either with the written consent of 
the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury 
shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate 
general meeting of the holders of those shares. The rights conferred 
upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied 
by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 69
Voting
Subject to any special terms as to voting upon which any shares may  
be issued or may at the relevant time be held, every member present in 
person or by proxy at a general meeting or class meeting has one vote 
upon a show of hands or, upon a poll vote, one vote for every share of 
which such member is a holder. In the case of joint holders of a share, 
the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, 
shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the other joint holders and 
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in 
the register in respect of the joint holding. 
In accordance with the Act, each member is entitled to appoint one or 
more proxies, and in the case of corporations, more than one corporate 
representative to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and 
vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. The timescales 
for appointing proxies are set out in the Notice of the 2012 AGM. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any shares held by them if any call or other sum 
then payable by them in respect of that share remains unpaid or if they 
have been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) 
after failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act. 
Transfer of shares
Shares in the Company may be in uncertificated or certificated form. 
Title to uncertificated shares may be transferred by means of a relevant 
system and certificated shares may be transferred by an instrument of 
transfer as approved by the Board. The transferor of a share is deemed 
to remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into the 
Company’s register of members.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares except as follows. 
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason, 
decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid 
share. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be 
refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules 
(as defined in the Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint 
holders, the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share 
is to be transferred exceeds four. The Board may decline to register a 
transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly 
stamped or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board 
to be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board 
may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one class of share; and 
(iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees; 
or where the transfer is requested by a person with a 0.25% interest 
(as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been served with a 
restriction notice after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Act, unless the transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm’s 
length sale (as defined in the Articles).
Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares 
At the Company’s AGM held on 16 November 201 1, shareholders gave 
authority to the Company to buy back up to an aggregate of 96,543,990 
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the Company’s issued share capital). 
This authority is valid until the end of the 2012 AGM or close of business 
on 15 February 2013, whichever is the earlier. Under the authority there 
is a minimum and maximum price to be paid for such shares. Any shares 
which are bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, 
will be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby 
reducing the Company’s issued share capital.
No purchases had been made under this authority as at the date of this 
report. A resolution renewing the authority will be proposed at the 2012 AGM.
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution from time to time declare dividends for payment to the 
holders of the ordinary shares of 10 pence each, of an amount which 
does not exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board 
may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever 
the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies their payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable 
to holders of shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising 
from the payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. 
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or 
other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a person 
with a 0.25% interest if such person has been served with a restriction 
notice after failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act.
Shareholder arrangements to waive dividends 
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds 
ordinary shares in the Company for the purpose of satisfying options 
and awards that have been granted under the various employee share 
schemes operated by the Company. Details of the shares so held are 
set out in note 27 to the financial statements.
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend payments 
on shares held within the EBT and these shares do not count in the 
calculation of the weighted average number of shares used to calculate 
EPS until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held 
in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may take into account 
both financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT 
or their dependants.
Major shareholders 
In accordance with the UKLA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the 
‘DTRs’) all notifications received by the Company are published on the 
Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk and via a 
Regulated Information Service.
As at 30 June 2012 the persons set out in Table 10 have notified the

Employee share schemes
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28 to the 
financial statements.
Articles of Association
The Articles contain regulations which deal with matters such as 
the appointment and removal of Directors, Directors’ interests and 
proceedings at general and board meetings. Any amendments to the 
Articles may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Act by 
way of special resolution at a general meeting. 
Significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of 
a change of control of the Company:
•	Both of the forward start credit facility agreements dated 10 May 2011  
and in each case made between, amongst others, the Company, 
Lloyds TSB Bank Plc (as the facility agent) and the banks and financial 
institutions named therein as lenders (together, the ‘Credit Facility 
Agreements’) contain a mandatory prepayment provision on change 
of control. The Company must notify the facility agent promptly upon 
becoming aware of the change of control. After the change of control 
the facility agent must by notice to the Company, cancel the total 
commitment under the Credit Facility Agreements and must also 
declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility Agreements 
immediately due and payable. For these purposes, a ‘change of 
control’ occurs if any person or group of persons acting in concert 
(as defined in the Takeover Code) gains control (as defined in the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010) of the Company;
•	each of the note purchase agreements entered into in respect of the 
Group’s privately placed notes (being the £105m and $380m of notes 
issued pursuant to the following note purchase agreements: (i) a note 
purchase agreement dated 23 August 2007 (as amended and restated 
on 10 May 2011); (ii) a note purchase agreement dated 23 April 2008 
(as amended and restated on 10 May 2011); (iii) a note purchase 
agreement in respect of the issue of $15.0m notes dated 10 May 2011; 
and (iv) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of $65.0m 
notes also dated 10 May 2011) contain a change of control prepayment 
provision. Each such control provision provides that within five business 
days of the Company becoming aware that a change of control has 
occurred the Company shall notify all the holders of the notes of the 
same and give the holders the option to require the Company to prepay 
all outstanding amounts (principal and interest) under the Notes. No 
‘make whole premium’ is payable by the Company in respect of such 
prepayment if noteholders elect (or are deemed to have so elected) 
to accept the Company’s offer, such prepayment shall take place 
on a date that is not more than 90 business days after the Company 
notified the holders of the change of control. For these purposes a 
‘change of control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group of 
persons acting in concert (as defined in the Takeover Code) such that 
they gain beneficial ownership of more than 50 per cent of the issued 
share capital of the Company; and 
•	 the £100m term facility agreement between, amongst others, the 
Company and Prudential/M&G UK Companies Financing Fund LP 
dated 10 May 2011 also contains a mandatory prepayment provision; 
such mandatory prepayment provision is the same as that described 
for the Credit Facility Agreements.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders 
customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes other than 
in compliance with applicable securities laws.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
Financial statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts including the Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. The Directors are required by the International 
Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS Regulation’) to prepare 
the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and have 
also elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS. The financial statements are also required by law 
to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements 
present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation 
of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are 
also required to:
•	properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
•	provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
•	make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:
a) the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, 
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, Standing 
Interpretation Committee interpretations as adopted and endorsed by 
the European Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b) the management report contained in this report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
 
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed on pages 
40 and 41.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Barratt Developments PLC 
for the year ended 30 June 2012 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statements of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Group and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, 
the Accounting Policies, the Impact of Standards and Interpretations 
in Issue but not yet Effective, Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty and the related notes 1 to 35. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•	the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2012 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•	the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•	the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•	the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•	the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
•	adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•	the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•	certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•	we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	the Directors’ statement, contained within the Report of the Directors, 
in relation to going concern; 
•	the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on directors’ remuneration.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Year ended 30 June 2012
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and 
Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations as adopted 
and endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and 
therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU 
International Accounting Standards Regulation. The financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by 
the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, derivative financial 
instruments and share-based payments. A summary of the more 
significant Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The most 
significant estimates made by the Directors in these financial statements 
are set out in ‘Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty’.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group 
can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors 
consider are likely to affect its future development, financial performance 
and financial position are set out in the Group Chief Executive’s review 
on pages 8 to 15 and the Business review on pages 19 to 39. The 
material financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may impact 
the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 36 
to 39 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk 
and capital risk are outlined in note 25 to the financial statements. 
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider 
economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained  
in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 36 to 39, factors  
that particularly impact upon the performance of the Group include 
changes in the macroeconomic environment including buyer 
confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the Group’s customers 
and interest rates. 
As announced in May 2011, in accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
refinancing, on 26 April 2012 the Group’s committed revolving credit 
facilities (‘RCFs’) totalling £1,190.5m terminated and the forward start 
RCFs totalling £780m became available for drawing. At 30 June 2012, 
the Group’s total committed facilities and private placement notes were 
£1,091m. The maturity dates of these facilities range from April 2013  
to July 2021, with £690m of the RCFs maturing in May 2015.
The covenant package remains unchanged to that announced in May 201 1.
On 6 September 2012, the Group gave voluntary notice to cancel the 
£90m RCF with effect from 12 September 2012, which reduces the 
Group’s total committed facilities and private placement notes to 
£1,001m. The committed facilities and private placement notes now 
in place provide appropriate headroom above our current forecast 
debt requirements.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the Directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at 
least twelve months from the date of these financial statements. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2012, the Group has adopted:
Amendment to IFRS7 ‘Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets’, 
Amendment to IFRIC14 ‘Prepayment of a Minimum Funding 
Requirement’, IAS24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Transactions’ and 
the Annual Improvements to IFRS (2010 tranche).
The adoption of these standards, interpretations and amendments 
has not had any impact upon the profit or net assets of the Group 
in either the current year or comparative year and has not required 
any additional disclosures.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of Barratt Developments 
PLC (the ‘Company’), incorporated in the UK, and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 30 June. The financial statements of subsidiary 
undertakings are consolidated from the date when control passes to the 
Group using the purchase method of accounting and up to the date 
control ceases. All transactions with subsidiaries and intercompany profits 
or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded 
at their fair values. All changes to those assets and liabilities and the 
resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control 
of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition income statement.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest 
with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has 
established joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its 
housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s share 
of profits and losses from its investments in such jointly controlled 
operations is accounted for on a direct basis and is included in the 
consolidated income statement. The Group’s share of its investments, 
assets and liabilities is accounted for on a directly proportional basis 
in the Group balance sheet. 80 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012
ACCOUNTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Associated entities
An associated entity is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such 
as a partnership, in which the Group holds a significant influence and 
that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Associated 
entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total 
proceeds of building and development. An appropriate proportion 
of revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference  
to the stage of completion of contract activity. Revenue is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents 
the amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The 
sale proceeds of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Construction contracts
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably. Variations to, and claims arising in 
respect of, construction contracts, are included in revenue to the extent 
that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work 
performed to date. Contracts are only treated as construction contracts 
when they have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a 
development or property. When it is probable that the total costs on a 
construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised as an expense in the income statement immediately.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade 
receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable 
losses. Payments received on account for construction contracts are 
deducted from amounts recoverable on construction contracts. 
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction 
contracts are included in trade payables.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are 
presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The Directors 
are of the opinion that the separate presentation of exceptional items 
provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business 
performance. Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the 
classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and 
newly-acquired businesses, refinancing costs, gains or losses on the 
disposal of businesses or individual assets, pension scheme curtailments 
and asset impairments, including land, work in progress, goodwill  
and investments.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs are recognised in the income statement when the 
Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected 
parties. A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived from 
the Group’s operating businesses. Profit from operations excludes finance 
costs, finance income, the Group’s share of profits or losses from joint 
ventures and associates, tax and gains/(losses) on disposal of investments.
Segmental reporting
The Group consists of two separate segments for internal reporting 
regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate 
resources to the segments and to assess their performance, being 
housebuilding and commercial developments. These segments 
therefore comprise the primary reporting segments within the financial 
statements. All of the Group’s operations are within Britain, which is one 
geographic market in the context of managing the Group’s activities.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net 
assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses 
is capitalised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination at acquisition. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least 
annually. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
 
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has 
capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. 
Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash flows. 
Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over 
its useful life on a straight-line basis. Where a brand is capitalised 
with an indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that contribute to 
the durability of brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, 
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that 
limit the useful life of these intangible assets.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite 
life brands as part of the review of the carrying value of goodwill, 
by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount factor 
based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less 
any provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of 
subsidiary undertakings by the Company, they are treated as a capital 
contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased accordingly. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 81
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the fair 
value of the equity instruments.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value 
of the liability at the date of grant and are re-measured both at the end 
of each reporting period and at the date of settlement with any changes 
in fair value being recognised in the income statement for the period. Fair 
value is measured initially and at the end of each reporting period using 
a Black-Scholes model and at the date of settlement as cash paid.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all 
temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an 
obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in 
the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits 
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is 
a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to taxes levied by the same tax 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Pensions
Defined contribution
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for certain 
employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged in 
the income statement in the year in which the contributions fall due.
Defined benefit
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They 
are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost, until the scheme ceased to offer future accrual 
of defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, was 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight-line basis 
to their residual value over their estimated useful lives. Residual values 
and asset lives are reviewed annually.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 years. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful life, which ranges from one to seven years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads 
which have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. 
Land held for development, including land in the course of development, 
is initially recorded at discounted cost. Where, through deferred purchase 
credit terms, the carrying value differs from the amount that will ultimately 
be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost 
in the income statement over the period of settlement.
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current year 
and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such 
developments. In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent 
uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and 
review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Leases as lessee
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following 
the completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale 
of the development to third parties. Rental income from these operating 
leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all 
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of 
the equity instrument at the date of grant. Fair value is measured either 
using Black-Scholes, Present-Economic Value or Monte Carlo models 
dependent upon the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value is 
expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions apply.  82 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012

uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances are classified as 
‘trade and other receivables’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Impairment of financial assets
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment 
at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial 
difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer 
going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through 
the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other receivable is 
considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or 
prolonged decline in the value of the property underpinning the value 
of the loan or increased risk of default are considered to be objective 
evidence of impairment. 
In respect of debt instruments classified as available for sale financial 
assets, increases in the fair value of assets previously subject to 
impairment, which can be objectively related to an event occurring 
after recognition of the impairment loss, are recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that they reverse the impairment loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and balances in bank 
accounts with no notice or less than three months notice from inception 
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments consist of the Company’s ordinary share capital 
and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial 
liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade 
and other payables. 
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits were already 
vested, and otherwise was amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted 
for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value 
of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited 
to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part 
of the cost of the asset where developments are considered to fall 
under the requirements of IAS23 (Revised). Otherwise, the Group 
expenses borrowing costs in the period to which they relate through 
the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for sale 
financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined 
at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets
Non-interest bearing loans granted as part of sales transactions that 
are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property 
are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value. 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 15.
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets 
is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
in equity within other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising 
from impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest 
calculated using the ‘effective interest rate’ method are recognised 
directly in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included 
in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than twelve 
months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current 
assets and are measured at amortised cost less an allowance for any  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83
the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash 
flows of the hedged items.
Details of the fair values of the interest rate and cross currency swaps 
are provided in notes 22, 23 and 24 to the financial statements. 
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the 
statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.
Cash flow hedge
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains 
and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swap 
arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until realised. 
On realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within finance 
charges in the income statement. 
To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair 
value of these swap arrangements are recognised immediately in finance 
charges in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging 
relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain 
or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or 
loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable 
assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching 
to them and that the grants will be received. 
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as 
to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. 
Grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the 
asset. Grants related to income are included in the appropriate line 
within the income statement.
Kickstart
The Group has been granted assistance for the development of a 
number of sites under the Homes and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) 
‘Kickstart’ scheme. Where receipts under the Kickstart scheme relate 
to grants they are accounted for in accordance with the policy for 
Government grants stated above.
 
In addition the Group has received cash upon specific sites under the 
‘Kickstart equity’ scheme which is repayable in future periods, as the sites 
to which it relates are developed, along with the share of the profits or 
losses attributable to the HCA arising from the sites. This liability is included 
within borrowings and is initially recognised at fair value by discounting it at 
prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The discount to 
nominal value, which will be paid in settling the liability, is amortised over the 
expected life of the site and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of 
the liability related to the HCA’s share of the profits or losses of the site are 
recognised directly in the income statement. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing 
and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, 
are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which 
they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest rates at the date of 
recognition. The discount to nominal value, which will be paid in settling the 
deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over the period of the credit 
term and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and 
overdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle the net outstanding 
position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position 
in the balance sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method in the income statement. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form 
of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the interest 
rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising from the Group’s operations 
and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is governed by 
the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors as detailed 
in notes 24 and 25 to the financial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value 
at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in 
profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. 
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are designated 
as hedging instruments, being either hedges of a change in future cash 
flows as a result of interest rate movements, or hedges of a change in 
future cash flows as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset 
or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging 
relationship is more than twelve months and as a current asset 
or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship 
is less than twelve months.
Hedge accounting
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated 
as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy 
for undertaking various hedged transactions. In addition, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether  ACCOUNTS

IMPACT OF STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS  
IN ISSUE BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
At the date of approval of these financial statements there were a number 
of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been published 
and are therefore mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2012 and later periods. IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
(2010), IFRS10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS11 ‘ Joint 
Arrangements’, IFRS12 ‘Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities’, IFRS13 
‘Fair Value Measurement’, IAS27 (Revised), IAS28 (Revised), Amendment 
to IFRS7 , Amendment to IAS1, Amendment to IAS12, Amendment 
to IAS19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and Amendment to IAS32 have been 
adopted by the EU. The Group has not early adopted any standard, 
amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected 
to impact upon the Group are: 
•	IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is likely to apply to the Group from  
1 July 2015. The standard was reissued in October 2010 as the 
second step in the IASB project to replace IAS39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. IFRS9 (2010) now 
includes new requirements for classifying and measuring financial 
assets and financial liabilities and the derecognition of financial 
instruments. The IASB is continuing the process of expanding IFRS9 
to add new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting. The 
Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the 
Group’s results and financial position and will continue to assess the 
impact as the standard is revised by the IASB.
•	IFRS10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ will apply to the Group 
from 1 July 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 to 
establish principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated 
financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the 
Group’s results and financial position.
•	IFRS11 ‘ Joint Arrangements’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2013. 
The new standard was issued in May 2011 and requires that a party 
to a joint arrangement determines the type of joint arrangement 
in which it is involved by assessing its rights and obligations and 
accounts for those rights and obligations in accordance with that type 
of joint arrangement. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
•	IFRS12 ‘Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities’ will apply to the Group 
from 1 July 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 and 
requires the disclosure of information that enables users of financial 
statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its 
interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on its 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The Group 
is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the financial 
statements of the Group.
•	IFRS13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 
2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 and defines fair 
value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The Group 
is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s 
results and financial position.
•	IAS27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ will apply to the 
Group from 1 July 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the amendment on the financial statements of the Group.
•	IAS28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ will 
apply to the Group from 1 July 2013. The Group is currently assessing 
the impact of the amendment on the financial statements of the Group.
•	IAS19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 
2013. It principally revises existing accounting treatment for pensions 
and other post-employment benefits and termination benefits. The 
Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the 
Group’s results and financial position.
•	Amendment to IFRS7 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’. This amends 
the disclosure requirements in respect of financial instruments that are 
set-off in accordance with guidance in IAS32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’. The amendment applies to the Group from 1 January 
2013 and is expected to impact upon the Group by requiring additional 
disclosures in the annual financial statements.
•	Amendment to IAS32 will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. This 
amendment provides guidance on the application of offsetting 
in financial statements. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and interpretations 
is not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group:
•	Amendment to IAS12 ‘Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’ 
provides an exception to the general principles of IAS12 for investment 
property measured using the fair value model in IAS40 ‘Investment 
Property’. The amendment applies to the Group from 1 July 2012 
and is not expected to have an impact on the Group.
•	Amendment to IAS1 ‘Financial Statement Presentation’ will apply to the 
Group from 1 July 2012. This amends the presentation of other 
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The amendment is not expected to have material impact on the Group.
•	Amendment to IAS1 ‘Government Loans’ (Amendments to IFRS1) 
will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. This amends IFRS1

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES  
OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed 
below the critical accounting judgements made and the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty within these financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the financial 
statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt 
with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dates, are discussed below.
Carrying value of land and work in progress
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and commercial 
development. The majority of the development activity is not contracted 
prior to the development commencing. Accordingly, the Group has 
in its balance sheet at 30 June 2012 current assets that are not covered 
by a forward sale. The Group’s internal controls are designed to identify 
any developments where the balance sheet value of land and work 
in progress is more than the lower of cost or net realisable value.
As a result of the downturn in the market in 2007/08 and continued 
market uncertainties, the Group conducts ongoing six-monthly reviews 
of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress. Where the 
estimated net realisable value of the site was less than its current carrying 
value within the balance sheet, the Group has impaired the land and 
work in progress value. The inception and utilisation of these provisions 
is set out in the table below:

In 2012, this review resulted in £nil (2011: £nil) net exceptional impairment 
charge for the housebuilding business. Due to performance variations 
upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross exceptional 
impairment charges and reversals of £31.5m (2011: £65.0m). In addition, 
due to changes arising from normal trading, such as planning status, 
there was a net inventory impairment charge of £6.6m (2011: £5.4m) 
included within profit from operations. There was £nil (2011: £nil) net 
impairment for the commercial developments business although there 
were gross impairment charges and reversals of £3.3m (2011: £1.2m) 
due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
Excluding the operating impairment charge of £6.6m (2011: £5.4m), 
included within gross profit is a charge of £6.7m (2011: benefit of £4.7m) 
relating to the realisation of written down inventory above its originally 
estimated net realisable value.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value 
of a site which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales 
prices and estimated costs to complete. Sales prices were estimated 
on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took 
into account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each 
product type. In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included 
an allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single digit sales price inflation 
in future periods. The estimation of costs to complete also included an 
allowance for low single digit build costs inflation in future periods.
At 30 June 2012 the Group had a total land holding of £2,077 .3m of 
which £1,964.2m is land held for current housing development. Of this 
£319.7m is made up from impaired land, £677 .2m consists of non-
impaired land purchased prior to mid-2009 where the gross margin 
is on average c. 9%, and the remaining £967 .3m has an average gross 
margin of around 20% based on current house prices. 
In the past six months, in general, the Group has not seen an improvement 
in underlying prices and has continued to manage costs to achieve no 
overall net cost inflation. If the UK housing market were to change beyond 
management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the 
assumptions around likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete, 
then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress 
may be required.
The land held at the balance sheet date that has already been impaired 
is most sensitive to the judgements being applied and the potential for 
further impairment or reversal. Forecasting risk also increases in relation 
to those sites that are not expected to be realised in the short to 
medium term. The Group’s current forecasts indicate that, by volume, 
around 36% of the impaired plots are expected to be realised within 
one year, 23% between one and two years, and 41% in more than  
two years.
The Group estimates that the impairment sensitivity for the 
housebuilding business to an immediate uniform fall in house prices 
across the UK, from those prevailing as at 30 June 2012, is as follows:
Uniform fall in national house prices

Indicative impairment

These estimates are illustrative as any changes in house prices have 
historically tended to be weighted either positively or negatively towards 
particular geographic regions of the UK, they exclude any sensitivity upon  86 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012

our commercial developments segment. In addition, variances in future 
build cost inflation from that allowed for in the Group’s base calculation 
would impact upon the impairment sensitivity. The value of impairment 
is prior to attributing any tax credit that may accrue for future use.
Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its 
developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide 
development costs between units built in the current year and in future 
years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. 
In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. 
The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying 
values and appropriateness of estimates made.
Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for under 
IAS11 ‘Construction Contracts’ 
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising 
revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. The application of this 
policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total expected 
costs to complete each site. The Group has in place established internal 
control processes to ensure that the evaluation of costs and revenues is 
based upon appropriate estimates. 
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of the impairment of goodwill of the housebuilding 
business requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the housebuilding 
cash-generating unit as defined in note 10. The value-in-use calculation 
requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the housebuilding 
business, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and 
requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present 
value of the cash flows. The discount rate used is based upon the average 
capital structure of the Group and current market assessments of the time 
value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. 
Changes in these may impact upon the Group’s discount rate in future 
periods. The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2012 was £792.2m 
with no impairment recognised during the year ended 30 June 2012.
Impairment of brands
The determination of the impairment calculation for the Group’s indefinite 
life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires an estimation of the value-in-use 
of the brand as defined in note 1 1. The value-in-use calculation requires 
an estimate of the future cash flows expected from this brand as part 
of the review of the carrying value of goodwill, including the anticipated 
growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination of a 
suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
The discount rate used is based upon the average capital structure of the 
Group and current market assessments of the time value of money and 
risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Changes in 
these may impact upon the Group’s discount rate in future periods. The 
carrying amount of indefinite life brands at 30 June 2012 was £100.0m 
with no impairment recognised during the year ended 30 June 2012.
Deferred tax assets
At 30 June 2012 the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of 
£1 18.6m comprising of gross deferred tax assets of £148.3m and gross 
deferred tax liabilities of £29.7m. £124.9m related to losses that arose 
during preceding years, predominantly as a result of the refinancing and 
land impairments, that are to be carried forward and relieved against 
profits arising in future periods. The judgement to recognise the deferred 
tax asset is dependent upon taxable profits arising in the same company 
as the losses originally arose and the Group’s expectations regarding 
future profitability including site revenue and cost forecasts for future years 
which contain a degree of inherent uncertainty.
Defined benefit pension scheme 
The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate the 
Group’s liability in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. In 
calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be 
made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, price 
inflation, the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets and mortality.
As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from those assumed, 
the pension liability may differ from that included in these financial statements.
Hedge accounting
The majority of the Group’s facilities are floating rate, which exposes the 
Group to increased interest rate risk. The Group has in place £192.0m 
(2011: £192.0m) of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The Group has 
adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the basis that it is highly 
probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match with the period 
of swaps. If this basis was not met in future then any changes in fair value 
of the swaps would be recognised in the income statement, rather than 
in equity. During the year ended 30 June 2012, there was a loss of 
£16.6m (2011: gain of £6.1m) included in equity related to these swaps. 
In addition, the Group has $267 .2m (2011: $267 .2m) of cross currency 
swaps to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange, 
arising from the Group’s sources of US Dollar denominated finance. 
These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge against future foreign 
exchange rate movements. If the hedges ceased to be highly effective 
then any changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised in the 
income statement, rather than equity. During the year ended 30 June 
2012, there was a gain of £4.6m (2011: loss of £8.2m) included in equity 
related to these swaps. 
Available for sale financial assets
The Group holds available for sale financial assets principally comprising 
interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions that are secured 
by way of a second legal charge on the respective property. The loans 
are held at fair value. The fair value calculation requires an estimate 
of the future cash flows expected from the redemption of interest free 
loans, including an estimate of the market value of the property at the 
estimated time of repayment, and requires the determination of a 
suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
The estimated market value is based on original selling prices, local 
market conditions with an allowance for low single digit sales price 
inflation. The estimated repayment profile is based on historical data 
for first time buyers selling their property. The discount rate used is 
consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge 
loan of a similar amount and duration. Changes in these may impact 
upon the Group’s discount rate in future periods. At 30 June 2012 the 
asset recognised on the balance sheet was £189.2m (2011: £169.4m). BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 87

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The tax rate assessed for the year is higher (2011: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 25.5% (2011: 27 .5%). 
The differences are explained below:

Tax on share-based payments 0.4 0.2
Impact of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset 8.7 9.6
Tax charge for the year 32.6 2.3 
Legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 29 March 2012. Accordingly, 
the current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 25.5% and the closing deferred tax asset has been provided for at a rate of 
24% in these financial statements. 
An additional reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was enacted within the Finance Act 2012 on 
17 July 2012. As this reduction was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, its effect has not been reflected in these financial statements. 
A further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% to 22% on 1 April 2014 has been announced by the Government but has not yet been 
substantively enacted; therefore its effect has not been reflected in these financial statements.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2014, the effect of the reduction from 24% to 22% would be to reduce 
the net deferred tax asset by £9.9m. To the extent that the net deferred tax asset reverses more quickly than this, the impact of the rate reductions 
on the net deferred tax asset will be reduced.  ACCOUNTS

9. Earnings/(loss) per share
Basic earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £67 .4m (2011: loss of £13.8m) 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated 
as cancelled, which was 963.9m (2011: 961.4m).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £67 .4m by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the year, giving a figure of 979.6m 
shares. There was no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share for the Group in the prior year as the Group was loss making.
The earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations were as follows:

The Group’s goodwill has a carrying value of £792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment. The goodwill relating to the commercial developments 
segment, with cost of £24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments 
segments. The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2012 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying 
value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill. The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets 
on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment. The first two years of cash flows 
were determined using the Group’s approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the third to fifth years were determined using 
Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases 
and work in progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was 
based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
•	Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s 
housebuilding business. Accordingly the rate of 12.9% (2011: 12.3%) is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted 
discount rate being the Group’s estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. This rate used in the 30 June 2012 impairment 
review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality 
of the Group’s borrowing requirements. 
•	Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site 
basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For years three to five these have been estimated at 
a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
•	Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability  
and planning permissions. For years three to five these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations  
of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
•	Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the expected 
costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur due to the business being 
on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions. For years three to five these have been estimated at a Group level 
based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Group’s goodwill related to the housebuilding segment was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2012 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected 
changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the uncertain conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate considered 
appropriate to the position and risks of the Group. The result of the impairment review was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible 
assets exceeded its carrying value by £379.1m (2011: £428.5m). 
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 1.0% per annum 
(2011: 1.5% per annum) or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 1.0% (2011: 1.0%) and all other variables were held constant then 
the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value. Further information is given in Critical Accounting

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the Directors 
consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for an indefinite 
period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so. 
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. At 30 June 2012 
an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 10. The conclusion of this impairment review was 
that the Group’s David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7 .0m prior to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business 
brand operating in niche markets. Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

At 30 June 189.2 169.4
Available for sale financial assets principally comprise interest free loans which are granted as part of sales transactions and for which the cash flows 
receivable are based on the value of the property at redemption. These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property 
(after the first mortgage). These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the 
property at the estimated time of repayment. The income statement includes a net impairment of £11.8m (2011: £16.3m) in cost of sales.
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second 
charge loan of a similar amount and duration. This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in nature to 
second charge loans offered by third party financial institutions. The average discount rate used for year ended 30 June 2012 was 7 .5% (2011: 7 .0%). 
The movement in the discount rate during the year has resulted in a fair value adjustment debit which has been taken through other comprehensive 
income of £3.4m (2011: credit £2.5m).
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices, local market conditions with an allowance for low single digit sales price inflation. 
The Group has also used independent valuation specialists to review and assess the estimated portfolio value.
The repayment profile used to calculate the timing of future cash flows is based on historical data for first time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment of the available for sale financial assets taken through the income statement relates to borrower default including an estimate 
made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first charge provider and the impact of the decline 
in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of these assets.

a) Nature of inventories
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories 
will not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject 
to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
b) Impairment of inventories
At 30 June 2012 the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites. The impairment review 
compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying value. This review resulted in £nil 
(2011: £nil) net exceptional impairment charge for the housebuilding business. Due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, 
there were gross exceptional impairment charges and reversals of £31.5m (2011: £65.0m). In addition, due to changes arising from normal trading, 
such as planning status, there was a net inventory impairment charge of £6.6m (2011: £5.4m) included within profit from operations. There was £nil 
(2011: £nil) net impairment for the commercial developments business, although there were gross impairment charges and reversals of £3.3m 
(2011: £1.2m) due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales  
prices and estimated costs to complete. Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into 
account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type. In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an 
allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single digit sales price inflation in future periods. The estimation of costs to complete also included an 
allowance for low single digit build cost inflation in future periods. Further information regarding these judgements is included within the Critical 
Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty section on page 85.
In the past six months, in general, the Group has not seen an improvement in underlying prices and has continued to control overall cost inflation.  
If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around likely 
sales prices and estimated costs to complete, then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments £607 .5m (2011: £793.1m) of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c) Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in 2012 and included in cost of sales was £1,900.5m (2011: £1,696.7m) including £18.8m (2011: £11.8m) of inventory 
write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of £nil (2011: £0.4m) on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting 
period, but excluding the £nil (2011: £nil) exceptional impairment and £6.6m (2011: £5.4m) operating impairment.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2012 totalled £25.4m (2011: £17 .2m), being the £6.6m (2011: £5.4m) 
operating impairment and £18.8m (2011: £11.8m) incurred in the normal course of trading.

The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables which are in default. The impairment recognised in cost 
of sales represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. 
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

The following table provides an analysis of financial assets that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
•	Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
•	Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).

Trade and other payables excludes deferred income, payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on contracts, tax and social security 
and other non-financial liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
•	The fair values of available for sale financial assets represent the value of their discounted cash flows, which have been calculated using market 
assumptions of the likely period to redemption and movements in UK house prices.
•	Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates.
•	The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market 
rates for similar instruments.
Trade and other payables include land payables, which may bear interest on a contract specific basis. Trade and other payables includes items 
secured by legal charge on certain assets as disclosed in note 19.
The following table provides an analysis of financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
•	Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities;
•	Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).

a) Interest rate swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest rates, 
arising from the Group’s and Company’s sources of finance. 
All of the Group’s and Company’s interest rate swap arrangements contain a clause that allows the Group/Company or the counterparty to cancel 
the swap in May 2015 at fair value.
During the year ended 30 June 2011 swaps with a notional amount of £288.0m were cancelled following the Group’s refinancing. Cumulative losses 
on interest rate swaps of £29.8m were recognised in exceptional finance costs in the income statement following these cancellations.
As at 30 June 2012 the Group had outstanding net floating rate Sterling debt of £106.5m (2011: £175.5m) and the Company had outstanding net 
floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts of £108.9m (2011: £281.8m). In obtaining this funding the Group and the Company sought to achieve 
certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £192.0m (2011: £192.0m) of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in 
accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 25. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates 
applicable to the debt were as follows:

The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 
30 June 2012, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of £52.5m (2011: £36.0m) with a loss of £16.6m (2011: gain of £6.1m) charged 
directly to equity in the year. 
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 25.

b) Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign 
exchange arising from the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2012 the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $267 .2m (2011: $267 .2m). 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group 
treasury policy outlined in note 25. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows:

267.2 267.2
The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements. The hedges match the contractual 
initial receipt, the final settlement and match 82% of the interest payments. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2012, which is 
based on third party valuations, was an asset of £28.6m (201 1: £24.0m) with a gain of £4.6m credited (201 1: loss of £8.2m charged) directly to equity 
in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year. Further disclosures relating to financial 
instruments are set out in note 25.
25. Financial risk management
The principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 36 to 39. The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial 
instruments are detailed in notes 22, 23 and 24.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed 
system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and 
appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department. These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis 
to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management 
programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including 
debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, 
which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury 
Operating Committee. ACCOUNTS

25. Financial risk management (continued)
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and 
medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends 
in income. Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal operating basis the Group has 
a policy of maintaining headroom of up to £150.0m. The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for 
the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2012, the Group had committed bank and other facilities of £1,091.0m 
(2011: £1,501.6m) and total facilities of £1,137 .2m (2011: £1,547 .8m). The Group’s drawn debt against these facilities was £342.0m (2011: £405.8m). 
This represented 31.3% (2011: 27 .0%) of available committed facilities at 30 June 2012. In addition the Group had £150.3m (2011: £72.7m) of cash 
and cash equivalents. 
On 6 September 2012, the Group gave voluntary notice to cancel the £90.0m revolving credit facility with effect from 12 September 2012. Further 
details of the cancellation are set out in note 35.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2012. At the date of approval of the financial statements the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of 
signing these financial statements.
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and 
private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2012, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities 
was 3.7 years (2011: 3.7 years). 
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations. The undrawn committed 
facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows:

25. Financial risk management (continued)
b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions 
and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group has detailed procedures to manage its 
market related operational risks which include:
•	a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash  
flow projections;
•	the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in  
order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision; and
•	collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for their customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management 
in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands.
 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows:

169.4 (1,546.5) (1,377.1)
The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2012 these assets were carried  
at a fair value of £189.2m (2011: £169.4m). Further information is set out in note 15.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
At 30 June 2012, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets 
and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £9.7m (2011: £8.1m) with  
a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk 
and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is 
appropriate flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating  
to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated  
private placements. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 113
25. Financial risk management (continued)
b) Market risk (price risk) (continued)
ii) Interest rate risk (continued)
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy. The proportion of the Group’s median gross borrowings calculated on the latest 
three-year plan that should be at fixed rates of interest is determined by the average expected interest cover for that period. The current target is for 
30-60% to be at fixed rates of interest. Due to the cyclicality of our borrowings throughout the year, at 30 June 2012, 61.7% (2011: 99.3%) of the 
Group’s gross borrowings were fixed. Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.

Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2012 was 3.5% (2011: 2.4%).
Sterling private placement notes of £65.8m (2011: £65.8m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2012 was 12.0% (2011: 11.9%) with, at 30 June 2012 
a weighted average period of 6.9 years (2011: 7 .9 years) for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £145.0m (2011: £145.0m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair 
value interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign 
exchange rate swaps, for 2012 was 10.2% (2011: 11.0%) with, at 30 June 2012, a weighted average period of 4.9 years (2011: 5.9 years) for which 
the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2012, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £1.6m (2011: £0.4m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £1.2m (2011: £0.3m) and 
the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £1.2m (2011: £0.3m). ACCOUNTS

iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2012, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $267 .2m (2011: $267 .2m). In order to mitigate risks 
associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt 
and a significant proportion of the interest payments. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US 
Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on 
the principal of its US Dollar debt. The foreign exchange swaps match 82% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign 
exchange rate risk upon the remaining 18%.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 24.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2012, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher/lower and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £0.3m (2011: £0.7m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by 
£0.2m (2011: £0.5m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £0.2m (2011: £0.5m).
c) Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered 
Social Landlords for social housing. The Group has £189.2m (2011: £169.4m) of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, 
although this asset is spread over a large number of properties. As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
•	The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has 
a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
•	The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place. 
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2012 was £42.5m (201 1: £15.8m) of cash on deposit with a financial institution. The carrying 
amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
As at 30 June 2012, the Company was exposed to £556.4m (2011: £780.7m) of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial 
guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 33 and 34.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the condensed consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, its bank 
borrowings (being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans) and its private placement notes, as set out in note 23. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 
36 to 39.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary 
dividends paid to shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend), issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments, 
and selling assets to reduce debt.

At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.5m (2011: £0.5m), which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) 
which, with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions. Alternative defined contribution pension 
arrangements are in place for current employees.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2010. The results of this valuation have been updated to 
30 June 2012 by a qualified independent actuary. The Group has agreed with the Trustees to make contributions to the Scheme of £13.3m per 
annum until 31 January 2017 to address the Scheme’s deficit. The Group also continues to meet the Scheme’s administration expenses, death 
in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy. 
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £1.1m (2011: £1.1m).
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair (bid) value. The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance 
sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions 2012 2011
Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations
Discount rate 4.80% 5.50%
Rate of price inflation 2.90% 3.50%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost
Discount rate 5.50% 5.40%
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.10% 5.96%
Rate of price inflation 3.50% 3.20%
Members are assumed to exchange 15% of their pension for cash on retirement. The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice 
from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, the Group’s actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to 
calculate the Scheme liabilities:
Assumptions Male Female 
Retired member born in 1935 (life expectancy at age 65) 24.1 years 26.5 years
Non-retired member born in 1965 (life expectancy at age 65) 25.8 years 28.6 years
The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables. The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Scheme’s 
membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption. In 2011 the base mortality assumptions were based upon the PA92 mortality tables. 
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection, with an underpin on the annual rate of 
improvement in mortality of 1.25% (2011: 1.0%).

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free 
investments (primarily Government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested 
and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset 
allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

28. Share-based payments (continued) 
a) Details of the share-based payment schemes
i) Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect 
from 1 July 2003. 8,313,562 (2011: 6,841,830) LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 2012. Awards under the LTPP are at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), taking into account individual performance and overall performance of the Group. 
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the Executive Share Option Scheme and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. 
Information on the performance conditions for the LTPP can be found on page 59.
ii) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘SRSOS’). Under the SRSOS, participants are required 
to make monthly contributions to a HM Treasury approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three or five years. On 
entering into the savings contract participants were granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined 
under the rules of the SRSOS. The exercise of options under the SRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the SRSOS 
is HM Revenue and Customs approved and open to all eligible employees. The first grant under the SRSOS was made on 3 February 2009 at an 
exercise price of 87 .05 pence per share (which was subsequently adjusted to reflect the Rights Issue to 57 .05 pence per share). The second grant 
under the SRSOS was made on 30 March 2010 at an exercise price of 116.18 pence per share. The third grant under the SRSOS was made 
on 29 March 2011 at an exercise price of 104.59 pence per share. The fourth grant under the SRSOS was made on 28 March 2012 at an exercise 
price of 125.00 pence per share. 
iii) Executive Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’). The grant of share options under the ESOS is at 
the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for 
a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee, 
which for options granted in 2009/10 was based upon total shareholder return and earnings per share performance conditions. More information 
can be found on page 60.
iv) Senior Management Share Option Plan
In December 2009, the Company adopted the Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009-2012 (the ‘SMSOP’). The Board approved the grant 
of share options to employees under the SMSOP which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided 
the employee remains employed by the Group. It is intended that the grant of options under the SMSOP will be a one-off event and those 
who participate in the SMSOP are not eligible to participate in the LTPP or ESOS, therefore Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in the SMSOP .
v) Executive Share Option Plan
In November 1997 , the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘ESOP’). The grant of share options under the ESOP is at the 
discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for 
a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee. 
vi) Employee Share Option Plan
In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Plan’). The Board approved the grant of share options 
to employees under this Employee Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of the 
options granted under the Employee Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the 
growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail 
Price Index by at least 9%. No options may be granted under the Employee Plan after 10 April 2010. Those who have participated in the ESOP 
do not participate in the Employee Plan.
vii) Senior Management Incentive Plan
In May 2009, the Company adopted the Senior Management Incentive Plan 2008-2011 (the ‘SMIP’). The SMIP entitles participants to a cash bonus 
linked to the Company’s share price, subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee.  ACCOUNTS

viii) Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2005 and is currently utilised 
to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary. There are no matching shares awarded against these 
shares. In previous years any annual bonus earned above target was normally compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan. The Executive 
Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan.

28. Share-based payments (continued)
e) Income statement charge
A charge to the income statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 
in accordance with IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. 
i) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2012 was 37 .7p (2011: 29.0p) per award. The awards have been valued using  
a Black-Scholes model.
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes model were as follows:
Grants
2012 
Grants
2011
Average share price 145p 113p
Average exercise price 125p 105p
Expected volatility 32.2% 30.7%
Expected life 3.5 years 3.0 years
Risk free interest rate 0.77% 1.33%
Expected dividends 1.91% –
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected life 
of the options. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
ii) Long-Term Performance Plan
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2012 was 50.0p (2011: 51.2p). 
The awards have been valued using a Black-Scholes model for the earnings per share element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the total 
shareholder return element of the scheme. 
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models were as follows:

29. Reserves
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of deferred fair value gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that have 
been designated as cash flow hedges by the Company, where the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur.
Transfers to the hedging reserve in the period equate to losses of £21.1m (2011: £23.6m). This loss comprises losses of £25.7m (2011: £15.4m) 
relating to interest rate swaps and gains of £4.6m (2011: losses of £8.2m) on cross currency interest rate swaps.
Transfers from the hedging reserve to the income statement for the period are gains of £5.1m (2011: £58.3m).
Transfers arose from continuing cash flow hedges of interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks where the hedged risk impacted profit or loss in 
the period. Of these costs £9.1m (2011: £21.5m) related to hedged interest cash flows and a loss of £4.0m (2011: gain of £7 .0m) related to hedged 
foreign currency cash flows.
In the prior year, an amount of £29.8m, relating to deferred losses on interest rate swaps that previously hedged floating rate interest payments 
(on £288m of debt that was repaid and not refinanced) which are no longer expected to occur, was recognised in the income statement as an 
exceptional item.  ACCOUNTS

29. Reserves (continued)
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the non-statutory premium arising on shares issued as consideration for acquisition of subsidiaries where merger 
relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Own shares
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Barratt Developments PLC purchased in the market and held by the EBT on behalf 
of the Company in order to satisfy options and awards under the Company’s incentive schemes. 
Share-based payments reserve
The share-based payments reserve represents the obligation of the Group in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Parent Company income statement
In accordance with the provisions of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been

The Group has lease agreements with third parties for certain commercial properties either in the process of development or which have been developed 
by the Group and units on land to be subsequently developed for residential use. It is intended that the commercial properties, with their future rental income, 
will be sold to third parties in the normal course of business and therefore they are classified as work in progress until the date of sale. At 30 June 2012, 
these properties had a carrying value of £14.4m (201 1: £18.4m), and land with rental units had a carrying value of £5.6m (201 1: £1 7 .6m). At 30 June 2012, 
these rental agreements had an average term of 2.6 years (201 1: 2. 1 years) to expiry and total rental receivables over the remaining lease period are £6.9m 
(201 1: £7 .4m) with £2.2m (201 1: £2.8m) within one year, £3.9m (201 1: £3.8m) in more than one year and no later than five years and £0.8m (201 1: £0.8m)

32. Acquisitions
In 2006 the Group entered into a joint venture agreement to develop sites in Greater Manchester including one in Hattersley. The Group’s interest 
comprised 50% of Base Regeneration LLP and its subsidiaries, Base East Central Rochdale LLP , Base Hattersley LLP and Base Werneth Oldham 
LLP . The Group’s joint venture partner went into liquidation in March 2012 and on 9 May 2012 the Group acquired their 50% share for £1. Following 
this transaction the Group wholly owns these entities. In accordance with IFRS3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ the Group has disposed of its 
share in the joint venture and acquired the entities as subsidiaries. The total cost of investment to the Group of the 100% equity holding was £25.5m. 
On consolidation the Group has reviewed the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the entities acquired. This resulted in a loss on re-measurement 
of the joint venture interest on acquisition of control of £10.7m in the year ended 30 June 2012. The cash inflow in respect of this acquisition during 
the year ended 30 June 2012 was £1.6m which is net of consideration of £1 paid to Artday LLP .
The recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below:

The accounting for this business combination has been prepared on a provisional basis as new information regarding the identifiable assets 
and liabilities as at the acquisition date may arise during the measurement period, being no more than one year from the date of acquisition.
The provisional fair value adjustments recognised on acquisition relate to the value of inventories and primarily the carrying value of land, 
the write off in respect of loans from the former joint venture party and tax adjustments. 
The Group incurred professional fees of £0.2m in connection with the acquisition of the business. These costs were expensed to the income statement.
Base Regeneration LLP contributed £1.9m in revenue and a loss after tax of £0.4m since acquisition on 9 May 2012. If the acquisition had been 
completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been £2,327 .0m and Group profit after tax for the year 
would have been £65.6m. BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 127
33. Contingent liabilities
a) Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries
The Company has guaranteed certain bank borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings.
Certain subsidiary undertakings have commitments for the purchase of trading stock entered into in the normal course of business.
In the normal course of business the Group has given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees. Management 
estimate that the bonds and guarantees amount to £424.8m (2011: £434.1m), and confirm that at the date of these financial statements the possibility 
of cash outflow is considered minimal and no provision is required.
b) Contingent liabilities related to joint ventures
At 30 June 2012, the Group has an obligation to repay £0.9m (2011: £0.9m) of grant monies received by a joint venture upon certain future disposals 
of land. 
The Group also has a number of performance guarantees in respect of its joint ventures, requiring the Group to complete development agreement 
contractual obligations in the event that the joint ventures do not perform their obligations under the terms of the related contracts.
c) Contingent liabilities related to associates
During the year, the Group provided bank guarantees to the value of £2.8m (2011: £3.1m) to one of its associates.
 
d) Contingent liabilities related to subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice as to the 
likelihood of success of claims, counterclaims and all other actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, 
that the action, claim or counterclaim is unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligations cannot be made.
i) Incident at Battersea Park Road, London
One of the principal subsidiaries within the Group is BDW Trading Limited (‘BDW’). On 26 September 2006 at Battersea Park Road, London, a tower 
crane supplied to BDW (with operator) by a third party contractor collapsed. The collapse of the crane was not contained within the boundaries of the 
site and the crane operator and a member of the public were killed. In March 2012, a Jury came to a verdict that the deaths were accidental and 
issued a narrative with their verdict that made no criticism of BDW. There is an ongoing criminal investigation by the London Metropolitan Police and 
the Health and Safety Executive to ascertain whether any of the parties involved are criminally liable for manslaughter or under relevant health and 
safety legislation. Although no assurance can be given, the Board has been advised that on the information available as at 11 September 2012, being 
the last practicable date prior to the publication of the Annual Report and Accounts, the risk of a finding of criminal liability against BDW is low.
 
ii) Incident at Bedfont Azure Lakes
On 28 February 2008, a resident was found dead and another resident seriously injured in housing association accommodation at the Bedfont Azure 
Lakes site, that was developed by BDW. It is believed that the cause of both the death and the serious injury was carbon monoxide poisoning. 
Following investigations by the Police and the Health and Safety Executive criminal proceedings were pursued against the plumbing and heating 
sub-contractor, and against an individual registered gas engineer. The criminal charges included alleged manslaughter caused by gross negligence 
and breach of gas legislation. The criminal trial against these defendants began in March 2012 and after a trial lasting for circa 75 days the jury returned 
unanimous verdicts of not guilty against both defendants on all charges. Following the conclusion of the criminal case an inquest will be arranged. Civil 
claims have been made against BDW by both the housing association and by various residents on the estate where the incident occurred. A number 
of claims have been settled by the Group’s insurers but the remainder are still outstanding and are being dealt with by the Group’s insurers, although 
the extent to which these are recoverable or to which they are covered by the Group’s insurance or the insurance of other parties cannot, at present, 
be clearly ascertained.
iii) Barratt American Incorporated
A former indirect subsidiary of the Company, Barratt American Incorporated (‘American’), is one of a number of defendants in a construction defect 
claim commenced in California. The Company has also been named as a defendant in this construction defect claim, as well as in a separate class 
action claim which arises out of the same alleged facts. (The construction defect claim and the class action claim will be referred to jointly as the 
‘Claims’.) American was sold in August 2004 and subsequently became insolvent, although it has significant insurance and is represented by counsel. 
The Company asserted that the courts in California have no jurisdiction over it. Ultimately the California Supreme Court disagreed. Nevertheless, 
the majority of the events in issue in both of the Claims post-date the 2004 sale and the Company asserts that it had no involvement in these 
post-sale events. The Company and the Directors believe that the Company has good defences to both Claims, although the outcome of the Claims 
remains uncertain and may not be known for some time.

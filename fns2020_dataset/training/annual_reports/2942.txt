We are one of the UK’s largest 
support services companies 
with the skills and resources to 
provide all the services needed to 
manage, maintain and operate 
buildings and infrastructure. 
Having the ability to 
combine these services and 
use leading-edge technology 
to provide customers with 
fully integrated, nationwide 
solutions is a key strength 
that helps to differentiate 
Carillion from many of our 
competitors. 
The long-term contracts we 
have – some of them for 
more than 30 years – to 
deliver services for hundreds 
of thousands of buildings, 
over 17,000 km of roads and 
substantial sections of the 
UK rail and utility networks, 
provide good visibility of 
future revenues and make 
a major contribution to the 
resilience of our business mix. 
1
 Facilities management
Our facilities management 
business provides an extensive 
range of services, notably 
integrated solutions for blue- 
chip private sector customers 
with large, complex property 
estates. We have strong 
positions in a number of market 
sectors, particularly for 
customers in the fi nancial 
services, commercial, utilities, 
media and telecommunications 
sectors. For example, we 
provide integrated facilities 
management services for over 
7,000 BT properties in the 
UK, for Virgin Media, Philips, 
Siemens, Deutsche Bank, Bank 
of Ireland and the Nationwide 
Building Society.
2
 Government services
In the UK, we are a major 
supplier of integrated facilities 
management services to 
central and local government 
departments. For example, 
Support services

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 05
we are the leading supplier to 
Defence Estates and to acute 
NHS hospitals. We also provide 
facilities management services 
for the HM Revenue and 
Customs estate and we have 
a growing presence in the 
education sector, as a leading 
supplier to the Building Schools 
for the Future programme. In 
Canada, we have a growing 
business, driven by our success 
in winning Public Private 
Partnership projects, especially 
in the health sector, for which 
we provide facilities 
management services.
3
 Planned Maintenance
Carillion Planned Maintenance 
is one of the top three suppliers 
of mechanical and electrical 
engineering (M&E) services in 
the UK. As well as providing 
M&E services direct to its 
own extensive customer base, 
Planned Maintenance plays a 
key role in supporting our 
facilities management and 
government services businesses, 
because M&E services form a 
substantial part of the 
integrated facilities 
management contracts we have 
for public and private sector 
customers. These include Public 
Private Partnership projects, 
such as the UK Government 
Communications Headquarters, 
for which Planned Maintenance 
delivers M&E maintenance 
services.
4
 Infrastructure services
We have long-term asset 
management and maintenance 
contracts for roads, railways and 
public utility services networks. 
In the UK, we are a leading 
supplier to the Highways 
Agency, providing integrated 
management and maintenance 
services for motorways and 
trunk roads and we provide 
similar services for a number 
of Local Highway Authorities. 
In Canada, we have market-
leading positions in the Ontario 
and Alberta road maintenance 
markets. In the rail sector, our 
main customers are Network 
Rail and Transport for London, 
for whom we recently secured 
a seven-year contract to 
maintain the East London Line.
We also provide a wide range 
of support services to the 
telecommunications, water, gas 
and electricity supply industries. 
We signifi cantly strengthened 
our position in the 
telecommunications sector in 
2009, when a Carillion-led Joint 
Venture secured a £1.0 billion, 
seven-year contract to provide 
nationwide asset management 
and maintenance services for 
Openreach, BT’s local access 
network business.
5
 Consulting
Our consultancy business 
provides engineering and 
architectural design and project 
management services. This 
business has a high-quality 
customer base and a strong 
track record on high-profi le 
projects, such as Heathrow 
Terminal 5. Our consultancy 
business uses its specialist 
capabilities to support other 
Carillion businesses by providing 
the design services they need 
in order to deliver integrated 
solutions for buildings and 
infrastructure, notably Public 
Private Partnership projects.

Public Private 
Partnership projects
What we do
We are a leader in Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) projects, both 
in the UK and in Canada. PPP 
projects use private sector fi nance 
to deliver a wide range of asset-
based services for central and 
local government. 
Our specialist private fi nance 
team arranges fi nance for 
these projects in which we 
make equity investments 
on which we target a 
15 per cent internal rate of 
return over the life of the 
concession contract, which is 
typically between 25 and 35 
years. To date, Carillion has 
won concession contracts for 
over 50 PPP projects.
Once the construction phase 
is complete and the project 
has moved successfully into 
the operational phase, we 
have the option of selling 
our equity investments and 
reinvesting the proceeds in 
new projects. To date we 
have sold investments in 
28 projects, generating 
proceeds of some £280 
million and a pre-tax profi t 
of £106 million.

 UK – education
Carillion has a strong track 
record in the education sector. 
We have delivered, or are in the 
process of delivering, over 140 
new schools, most of which 
form part of the UK 
Government’s £65 billion 
Building Schools for the Future 
(BSF) programme, which is 
being partly funded by private 
fi nance. We are one of the 
leading suppliers to the national 
BSF programme, having been 
awarded contracts for BSF 
programmes in Durham, 
Gateshead, Nottingham, 
Rochdale, South Tyneside and 
Tameside. The BSF programme 
also encompasses the delivery 
of the Academy schools 
programme for which Carillion 
has been selected by the UK 
Government as a framework 
supplier.

 UK – health
As a leader in the development 
of PPP projects since their 
inception in the early 1990s, 
we delivered the UK’s fi rst PPP 
hospital in 1997, the Darent 
Valley Hospital, in Kent. Since 
then, we have maintained a 
leading position in the health 
sector of the UK PPP market. To 
date, we have secured contracts 
for 20 PPP hospitals and other 
healthcare facilities, of which 
15 are in the UK. We have sold 
our equity investments in eight 
hospital projects, but continue 
to provide facilities management 
services for these hospitals. 
The construction phase of 
the new Queen Alexandra 
Hospital in Portsmouth will be 
completed in 2010 and Carillion 
is already providing facilities 
management services for both 
the old and new hospitals, as 
part of the 35-year concession 
contract.
3
 UK – defence
Carillion has three major PPP 
defence projects for the UK 
Ministry of Defence. The largest 
of these is Allenby Connaught, a 
35-year concession contract that 
commenced in 2006 with a 
six-year construction phase to 
rebuild Army accommodation 
across the South of England. 
Carillion is also providing 
facilities management services 
for the old estate as well as for 
the new accommodation being 
built to replace it. The other two 
projects are the Permanent Joint 
Headquarters, Northwood, 
construction of which is nearing 
completion and for which our 
facilities management contract 
is already fully operational, and 
the Royal School of Military 
Engineering, based at Bicester, 
Chatham and Minley, on 
which construction is due 
for completion in 2015.
4
 UK – secure and other 
Government accommodation 
Carillion delivered the fi rst PPP 
prison in the UK, namely HM 
Prison Altcourse in Liverpool in 
1997, and subsequently three 
further prisons and secure 
training centres. We have sold 
our equity investments in all 
these projects, but continue to 
be well placed to deliver prisons 
under any future PPP investment 
programmes. Carillion also 
built the landmark Government 
Communications Headquarters 
at Cheltenham, one of the 
largest, technically complex and 
secure accommodation projects 
to be delivered under the PPP 
programme in the UK to date.
5
 UK – roads
Carillion delivered one of the 
fi rst privately fi nanced road 
projects in the UK, namely the 
widening of 12 kilometres of 
the M40 between its junction 
with the M25 and Loudwater, 
which was completed in 1998. 
The 30-year PPP concession 
contract for this project also 
includes the management 
and maintenance 
by Carillion of around 123 km of 
the M40, between the M25 and 
Warwick. In total, Carillion has 
built six PPP road projects, 
for which it continues to provide 
long-term maintenance services, 
and sold its equity investments 
in three of these, including the 
M40 widening project.
6
 Canada – health
The UK PPP procurement model 
has been adopted in Canada 
where our well-established 
business is a leader in this 
market, especially in the health 
sector. Carillion delivered two 
of the fi rst PPP hospitals in 
Canada, the Royal Ottawa and 
the new William Osler Hospital 
in Ontario, for which Carillion 
also has long-term facilities 
management contracts. 
Currently we have three further 
hospital projects under 
construction in Ontario, the 
Sault Area Hospital, the Royal 
Victoria Hospital in Barrie and 
the Centre for Addiction and 
Mental Health in Toronto.

What we do
We have nearly 40 years 
experience in the Middle 
East, during which time our 
businesses in the region have 
built an outstanding reputation 
for quality and reliability, having 
delivered some of the region’s 
most prestigious buildings and 
infrastructure projects. 
The growth we have 
achieved over the last two 
years, during which time 
revenue and underlying 
operating profi t have 
increased by 64% and 85%, 
respectively, has been driven 
by our strategy of building 
strong relationships with a 
small number of selected, 
fi nancially robust customers 
with long-term investment 
programmes, for whom 
quality and value for 
money are paramount. 
Geographical diversifi cation, 
notably the extension of 
our operations into Abu 
Dhabi in 2008, has enabled 
us to continue to deliver 
substantial revenue and 
profi t growth in the region 
despite the downturn 
in Dubai.
1
 Abu Dhabi
We extended the operations 
of Al Futtaim Carillion to Abu 
Dhabi at the beginning of 2008. 
Since then, our business in Abu 
Dhabi has grown substantially, 
contributing 55 per cent of our 
total Middle East construction 
services revenue in 2009. Our 
fi rst project in Abu Dhabi was 
the prestigious 500-bedroom 
Yas Hotel for Abu Dhabi’s 
largest developer, ALDAR. This 
stunning hotel forms the centre

and a new headquarters for the 
Abu Dhabi Investment Council.

 Oman
Our business in Oman, Carillion 
Alawi, has a long history of 
delivering high-profi le projects 
to exacting standards, including 
the Guest Palace Qas’r Al Alam, 
the Grand Mosque and, currently, 
the Royal Opera House, which 
is due for completion in 2010. 
In 2009, we continued to grow 
our business in Oman, which 
contributes around 23 per cent 
of our Middle East construction 
services revenue, and won 
further major and prestigious 
projects, including the Majlis, 
a new parliament building, 
the National Museum and the 
Muscat Court Complex.

 Dubai
In Dubai, Al Futtaim Carillion 
also has an outstanding track 
record for delivering high 
quality projects, including 
Dubai Festival City, Motor City, 
the infrastructure works for 
world-renowned Burj Dubai 
Development and infrastructure 
works for Dubai Aluminium. 
Although our activity levels in 
Dubai have reduced signifi cantly 
over the last 12 months, from 
55 per cent of our Middle East 
construction services revenue 
in 2008 to 20 per cent in 2009, 
we expect our markets to 
stabilise in 2010 and to use our 
market leading reputation to 
continue to win high-quality 
projects selectively, for 
fi nancially robust customers.
4
 Egypt
Al Futtaim Carillion extended 
its operations to Egypt to build 
the £2 billion Cairo Festival 
City development for our Joint 
Venture partner, Al Futtaim. In 
2009, this project contributed 
some two per cent of our 
Middle East construction 
services revenue, but we expect 
activity levels on the project to 
increase in 2010 as further 
phases of the Cairo Festival City 
development are scheduled to 
start during the year.

We have a strong and selective 
construction capability in the UK 
and in Canada, focused on large, 
higher added value contracts for 
long-term customers. 
As well as creating value 
in its own right, a strong 
construction capability plays 
a key role in driving growth 
in Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) projects and in support 
services. It is fundamental 
to our ability to provide 
customers with the services 
they require, not only to 
create, but also to manage 
and operate buildings and 
infrastructure. 
Having the capabilities 
to offer design and 
construction services gives 
us a competitive advantage 
when it comes to optimising 
the whole-life cost of 
providing, maintaining and 
operating assets such as 
schools, hospitals, military 
accommodation, prisons, 
roads and railways – an 
essential requirement for 
PPP projects. 
1
 UK building – education
Our construction capability has 
played a key role in establishing 
the strong positions we have in 
our chosen sectors of the UK 
PPP market. For example, 
Carillion is a leading supplier 
to the UK Government’s 
£65 billion Building Schools 
for the Future programme, 
signifi cant parts of which are 
being procured through PPP 
projects. Combining our design 
and construction capabilities 
with our private fi nance and 
support services skills, has 
already secured contracts for 
over 140 schools and academies 
where we are creating state-of 
the-art learning environments.

 UK building – health
Our design and construction 
capabilities are also 
fundamental to our success in 
the health sector of the PPP 
market. Carillion has won 
contracts for 20 PPP hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities, 
of which 15 are in the UK – 
including the UK’s fi rst PPP 
hospital, the Darent Valley 
Hospital in Kent – and fi ve are 
in Canada. In December 2009, 
we were selected as the 
preferred bidder for the new 
Southmead Hospital in Bristol, 
on which we have since 
achieved fi nancial close, with 
building work on the main 
hospital scheduled to begin in 
spring 2010.
3
 UK building – defence
Having a strong construction 
capability is also enhancing the 
development of our support 
services business in the defence 
sector. For example, our Public 
Private Partnership projects, 
such as Allenby Connaught, 
where we are rebuilding Army 
accommodation across the 
South of England, and the 
Permanent Joint Headquarters 
project in North London, both 
include long-term support 
services contracts. Being the 
leading supplier of facilities 
management and maintenance 
services for Defence Estates, 
also creates opportunities for 
our construction business. For 
example, at Catterick Garrison, 
one of many Ministry of 
Defence locations where we 
provide facilities management 
and maintenance services, 
we have carried out extensive 
building work, including a 
new leisure and sports centre.
4
 UK infrastructure
Our largest sectors of the UK 
infrastructure market are roads 
and railways. Current major 
contracts include upgrading the 
A1 in Yorkshire to motorway 
standards and upgrading the 
Airdrie to Bathgate rail link, 
which forms part of a 
programme to improve rail 
links in central Scotland. 
Our construction capabilities 
in these sectors are also key 
to our success in winning 
and delivering PPP road 
and rail projects, long-term 
maintenance contracts for roads 
and railways and contracts for 
the new ‘managed motorways’ 
programme. This programme 
involves the installation and 
operation of mandatory 
speed limits, together with 
hard-shoulder running, to 
improve traffi c fl ow during 
peak periods, which requires 
both construction and 
support services skills.
5
 Canada and the 
Caribbean building
In Canada and the Caribbean, 
where our businesses were 
established over 40 years ago, 
we have strong construction 
capabilities both for buildings 
and infrastructure. In Canada, 
PPP construction is growing 
strongly. Having delivered two 
of the fi rst PPP hospitals to be 
built in Canada, we have since 
won a further three major PPP 
hospital projects, which are 
now under construction. In 
December 2009, we were 
awarded one of our largest 
ever contracts in Canada to 
extend and refurbish Toronto’s 
Union Station, refl ecting 
the reputation we have 
for delivering major high-
quality projects.

Chairman’s statement
I am delighted to report that 
Carillion achieved its objective of 
delivering materially enhanced 
earnings in 2009, despite 
challenging market conditions. 
This strong performance refl ects the resilience of the Group’s 
business mix, the strength of the management team and the 
skills and commitment of Carillion’s people. On behalf of the 
Board, I should like to thank all our employees for the 
contribution they have made to Carillion’s success in 2009.
In line with the Group’s strategy, support services continues to 
make the largest contribution to earnings. This was supported 
by a good performance in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, 
which more than offset the expected decline in UK construction 
revenue, and substantial growth in Middle East and Canada 
construction services.
By the year end, cost savings from integrating the Carillion 
and Alfred McAlpine businesses had reached a run rate of 
£50 million per annum, in line with our expectations, and this 
made a signifi cant contribution to margin and earnings growth. 
Revenue including joint ventures increased by four per cent to 
£5.4 billion (2008: £5.2 billion) and underlying profi t before tax
(1)
 
increased by 16 per cent to £182.2 million (2008: £157.5 million). 
Underlying earnings per share
(2)
 increased by 14 per cent to 
39.0 pence (2008: 34.3 pence).
The Group’s profi t was again strongly cash-backed, with 
underlying cash fl ow from operations of £268.2 million 
(2008: £198.3 million) substantially ahead of underlying 
profi t from operations of £196.8 million (2008: £165.2 million). 
This, together with proceeds from the sale of equity investments 
in PPP projects and from the disposal of non-core businesses, has 
enabled the Group to achieve a net cash position of £24.9 million 
at 31 December 2009 (2008: net borrowing of £226.7 million). 
The Group continues to have a substantial high-quality forward 
order book that was worth approximately £17.7 billion at the year 
end (2008: £20.4 billion), with the reduction since December 2008 
primarily due to the sale of equity in PPP projects and the disposal 
of non-core businesses. Beyond that we have a strong pipeline of 
probable orders and contract opportunities, particularly in support 
services where we have our largest ever pipeline.

Section 03 – Our performance
In view of the Group’s performance in 2009 and prospects for 
2010, the Board is recommending a fi nal ordinary dividend for 
2009 of 10.0 pence per share, making the total dividend for 2009 
14.6 pence per share, an increase of 12 per cent on the total paid 
in respect of 2008 (13.0 pence). 
In December 2009, the executive responsibilities for the Group’s 
UK Building, Private Finance and Middle East businesses were 
combined to streamline Board responsibilities and refl ect the 
strategic development and needs of these businesses, which 
share common skill sets. Richard Howson who has been Managing 
Director of the Middle East businesses since July 2007, was 
appointed to the Board on 10 December 2009 as the Executive 
Director responsible for those businesses and for our UK Building 
and Private Finance businesses. Richard brings to the Board 
considerable knowledge and experience that will enable him to 
make a signifi cant contribution to the Group’s future development. 
David Hurcomb, the Executive Director responsible for UK Building 
and Private Finance, decided to step down from the Board on 
8 December 2009. David left the Group with the Board’s best 
wishes and grateful thanks for the contribution he has made to 
Carillion and to the development of our UK Building business 
in particular. 
 
In view of the wider economic environment we continue to 
expect market conditions to remain challenging in 2010. 
However, our performance has demonstrated that the Group 
has a resilient business mix, including strong international 
businesses, a substantial high-quality order book, a good pipeline 
of contract opportunities, good cash fl ow and a strong balance 
sheet. Consequently, the Group continues to be well positioned 
and the Board believes that it will make further progress in 2010.

Group Chief Executive’s review
A seventh successive year of 
substantial growth in earnings 
per share and dividend is an 
outstanding achievement, 
especially in the current economic 
climate, which has made market 
conditions very challenging. 
Our ability to perform strongly in current market conditions refl ects 
the benefi ts of implementing a consistent and successful strategy 
for sustainable profi table growth, supported by a commitment to 
behaving in accordance with our core values and applying rigorous 
risk management policies and processes.
Our strategy
>  Growing support services and Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
projects
>  Developing and marketing integrated solutions tailored to the 
needs of customers, including project fi nance, design and 
construction, maintenance and lifetime asset management
>  Maintaining a strong and selective construction capability 
focused on higher added-value contracts for long-term 
customers, especially the delivery of PPP projects and integrated 
solutions for support services customers.
The effects of our strategy
The success of our strategy is clearly evident in our track 
record, having 
>  transformed Carillion from being primarily a UK construction 
company into a leading UK support services business
>  delivered seven successive years of signifi cant earnings and 
dividend growth, with underlying earnings per share and our 
dividend increasing over the last fi ve years at compound annual 
growth rates of 15 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively
>  consistently achieved or exceeded our fi nancial and 
strategic objectives 
>  created a resilient business mix with strong market positions, 
both in the UK and internationally. 
The transformation of Carillion’s business away from a heavy 
dependence on UK construction into one of the UK’s leading 
support services companies, with a large portfolio of PPP projects 
and a strong and selective construction capability, has given us the 
resilience to perform strongly in 2009 and the platform to make 
further progress in 2010. 
A resilient business mix
In 2009, 66 per cent of underlying operating profi t came from 
long-term contracts for support services and PPP projects, which 
are more resilient in cyclical downturns. The remaining 34 per cent 
of underlying operating profi t came from construction services, 
where earnings have also become more resilient, due to contract 
selectivity and geographical diversifi cation, which have greatly 
reduced our dependence on the UK and increased the 
contributions from our international businesses, notably in the 
Middle East. In 2009, Middle East construction services accounted 
for 21 per cent of underlying operating profi t, with construction 
services (excluding the Middle East) accounting for 13 per cent.

Section 03 – Our performance
We have been a leader in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects 
since the inception of the UK’s Private Finance Initiative in the 
early 1990s. Since then, we have won over 50 PPP contracts 
in the UK and Canada, for hospitals, schools, prisons, military 
accommodation, roads and railways. We also led the way in 
developing the secondary market for PPP equity and to date we 
have sold 28 equity investments, generating proceeds of some 
£279.9 million and a pre-tax profi t of £105.6 million.
In the Middle East, where we have had Joint Venture construction 
businesses for nearly 40 years, we have built an outstanding 
reputation for quality and reliability through delivering many 
of the region’s most prestigious projects, including Dubai Festival 
City, the Grand Mosque in Oman and more recently the Yas Hotel, 
which forms the centrepiece of Abu Dhabi’s new Formula 1 
Grand Prix circuit. 
In construction services (excluding the Middle East) our 
experience spans almost two centuries, as Carillion brings 
together the heritage of Tarmac, Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. 
Our highly selective approach has focused our construction skills 
on fewer higher value-added projects for long-term customers, 
particularly PPP projects for which our ability to provide fully 
integrated solutions helps to differentiate us from our competitors. 
For example, our portfolio includes the UK Government 
Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham, 20 major hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities, over 140 new schools, several 
prisons and numerous motorway, trunk road and rail projects.
Our values
Applying our core values to everything we do is creating a culture 
focused on understanding the needs of customers and using the 
Group’s wide range of skills and resources to create high-quality, 
value-for-money solutions to meet those needs. 
> Openness
> Collaboration 
> Mutual dependency
> Professional delivery
>  Sustainable profi table growth
> Innovation
Strong market positions
In transforming our business mix, we have also developed strong 
positions in new market sectors, while selectively capitalising on 
our existing strengths. 
In support services, through organic growth and acquisitions, 
notably Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine, we have built a UK 
business that has the skills and resources to provide customers with 
nationwide services to manage, maintain and operate property 
and infrastructure. Our ability to combine our skills and resources 
and use leading-edge technology to deliver fully integrated services 
for large, complex property estates and infrastructure networks, is 
one of our key strengths. For example, we provide facilities 
management and other support services for hundreds of 
thousands of buildings, including an estate of around 43,000 
houses for military personnel in the UK and some 7,000 properties 
for BT. We also provide management and maintenance services for 
over 17,000 kilometres of roads in the UK and Canada and for 
extensive sections of the UK’s rail and public utilities networks.

Group Chief Executive’s review
continued
The principal risks facing the Group are summarised in the table 
below, together with the measures we have in place to mitigate 
and manage these risks. 
Business disposals
In 2009, we disposed of two non-core businesses, Carillion IT 
Services and Enviros, an environmental consultancy business, 
generating total gross proceeds of £62.4 million. In line with our 
policy of selling equity investments in Public Private Partnership 
projects once they have moved successfully into the operational 
phase and reinvesting the proceeds in new projects, we sold 
investments in a further four mature projects during 2009, 
generating total proceeds of £100.7 million. 
 
Group key performance indicators in 2009
The Board set six Group key performance indicators for 
2009, in respect of which the Group has performed strongly, 
as discussed below. 
1. To continue to attract, develop and retain excellent 
people by being an employer of choice.
Delivering the high-quality services that our customers expect and 
upon which the reputation of Carillion and that of its customers 
depend, requires excellent people at all levels throughout the 
Group. The services we provide are often critical to the success 
Operational risk management 
The application of rigorous risk management policies and 
processes also plays an essential role in our success. These policies 
and processes are fi rmly embedded in our culture and designed 
to identify, mitigate and manage strategic risks and those specifi c 
to individual business and contracts, including economic, social, 
environmental and ethical risks. These processes are described in 
more detail in the Corporate Governance report on page 45. 
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic 
risk issues across the Group and for oversight of risk training. 
The Group Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out 
independent appraisals of all projects before these are submitted to 
the Major Projects Committee, which is a committee of the Board 
that sanctions all major commitments and transactions, including 
capital expenditure, major contracts and business acquisitions and 
disposals. The Committee has delegated authority up to specifi ed 
levels of risk, beyond which Board approval is required.
We apply our risk management processes to every aspect of our 
operations, from choosing our market sectors and the contracts 
for which we bid, to the selection of our customers, partners and 
suppliers. We also apply them to every stage of a contract, from 
its inception to completion, in order to deliver high-quality services 
for our customers and the cash-backed profi t we expect.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 17
Section 03 – Our performance
In 2009, the Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) was 0.13 
reportable accidents per 100,000 man hours worked (2008 
AFR: 0.14), with four out of fi ve operational sites, worldwide, 
achieving Target Zero. The improvement we achieved in 2009, 
on an already relatively low accident rate in 2008, refl ected our 
continuing and rigorous focus on reducing reportable accidents 
to zero. It is particularly pleasing to note that in 2009 the accident 
rates in our construction businesses in the UK and the Middle East 
reduced by around 40 per cent.
In 2009, we continued to submit information on the Health and 
Safety performances of all our business units to the Corporate 
Health and Safety Performance Index, which is sponsored by the 
Health and Safety Executive and covers all aspects of Health and 
Safety management and performance. A wide range of industries 
participates in the Index and this enables us to benchmark our 
performance beyond our own industry sector. In 2009, our 
Index score of 8.3 (2008: 8.0) continued to show year-on-year 
improvement. This score compares very favourably with the 
average Index score of 6.7 and places Carillion in equal 16th 
place out of the 127 organisations that chose to take part in 
the 2009 Index.
We deeply regret that in 2009 there was one fatal accident in 
which Kenneth Campbell, a Carillion employee at a quarry in 
Scotland, was fatally injured when the vehicle he was driving 
overturned on the quarry haul road. No other vehicle was 
involved. Every accident is a personal tragedy and our thoughts 
are very much with the family and friends of Mr Campbell. 
Two prosecutions of Carillion companies by the Health and 
Safety Executive were completed in 2009. One of these related 
to an accident that occurred in the former Alfred McAlpine 
business, before it was acquired by Carillion.
Being a leader in delivering sustainable solutions for our customers 
continues to help differentiate Carillion from its peers. In 2009, 
Carillion was included in the Top 20 UK companies in the Sunday 
Times Best Green Companies. We also continued to improve our 
ranking in Business in the Community’s (BITC) Corporate 
Responsibility Index, moving from a ‘Gold’ to a ‘Platinum’ ranking, 
with a score of 96.5 per cent, which topped the support services 
sector. The Corporate Responsibility Index involves a detailed, 
independent third-party assessment of company strategy, 
management processes and performance. The average score of 
participating companies was 87.5 per cent, which demonstrates 
that Carillion not only continues to be a leader in the support 
services sector, but that our performance ranks favourably with 
that of all participating companies. Carillion also continues to be a 
member of the FTSE4Good Index. 
of the public and private sector organisations for which we work 
and for whom Carillion employees are frequently the ‘public face’. 
Consequently, our ability to attract, develop and retain excellent 
people by being an employer of choice remains our top priority. 
In 2009, we continued to develop and implement our bespoke 
leadership, personal development and employee engagement 
programmes, which are designed to help all our people achieve 
their full potential.
We strongly believe in the power of engaging with, and 
empowering, our employees to play a full role in improving service 
delivery and the overall development of our business, through 
creating a culture of trust and open communication. Our managers 
and supervisors seek to engage with all our people through regular 
one-to-one meetings, individual performance and development 
reviews and monthly team talks, supported by newsletters and 
our national award winning company newspaper, ‘Spectrum’. 
Successful employee engagement depends on listening to what 
our people tell us and acting upon it. Therefore, in addition to 
one-to-one meetings and team talks, we also conduct regular 
employee surveys to help us monitor and measure our progress. 
For example, every year we conduct ‘The Great Debate’, a major 
interactive survey in which our people, selected randomly from 
across the Group, share their views on a wide range of issues that 
are important to their personal development and satisfaction and 
to the success of Carillion. In 2009, 3,867 people took part in The 
Great Debate, the results of which showed that we made very 
good progress across the Group, with improved responses in 21 
out of 23 areas tested and signifi cant improvements in key areas 
relating to the satisfaction of our people, such as the extent to 
which they feel valued at work and feel proud to work for Carillion.
2. Be a recognised leader in the delivery of safety and 
sustainability in the sectors in which we operate.
The health and safety of our people and everyone who works with 
us or is affected by our operations is paramount. Our corporate 
objective, known as ‘Target Zero’, is to eliminate all reportable 
accidents. This demanding objective requires the constant vigilance 
and the commitment of everyone in Carillion in order to ensure 
that everyone consistently adopts safe working practices. 
We support the achievement of Target Zero with a wide range of 
tools including training, audits, our hazard reporting programme 
‘Don’t Walk By’, Safety Action Groups, strong visible leadership, 
such as regular Directors’ Safety Tours and employee engagement 
activities. Carillion’s behaviour standard, ‘Behaving Safely’, 
which was launched in 2008, was widely embedded across 
our businesses during 2009 and we have started to measure 
progress using workforce feedback. Carillion plc

Outlook and prospects
In view of the wider economic environment, we expect market 
conditions to remain challenging in 2010. However, we have 
a substantial high-quality order book and a good pipeline of 
contract opportunities in each of our business segments. 
Consequently, the Group continues to be well positioned with 
a resilient business mix and we believe we will make further 
progress in 2010. 
The Group’s order book was worth approximately £17.7 billion 
at the year end (2008: £20.4 billion), with the reduction since 
December 2008 due to the sale of equity in Public Private 
Partnership projects and the disposal of non-core businesses. 
In addition, we had a pipeline of probable new orders worth 
some £2.0 billion at the year end (2008: £3.1 billion).

3. Deliver integration and re-organisation cost savings 
arising from the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine of 
£35 million in 2009 and achieve a run rate of £50 million 
per annum by the end of 2009.
Absolute integration and re-organisation cost savings were 
£35 million in 2009 and by the year end we had achieved a run 
rate of £50 million a year, fully meeting this key performance 
indicator.
4. Deliver materially enhanced earnings.
Underlying earnings per share
(1)
 increased by 14 per cent to 
39.0 pence per share (2008: 34.3 pence per share). Achieving this 
key performance indicator, despite challenging market conditions, 
refl ected the resilience of the Group’s business mix, including 
strong international businesses, and the benefi ts of the Alfred 
McAlpine integration and re-organisation cost savings.
5. Generate cash-backed profi t.
Delivering cash-backed profi t from operations continues to be an 
absolute priority for all Carillion’s business units. A rigorous focus 
on cash management has once again resulted in strong underlying 
cash fl ow from operations of £268.2 million (2008: £198.3 million), 
which represented 136 per cent of underlying profi t from 
operations of £196.8 million (2008: £165.2 million).
6. Continue to reduce year-end net borrowing.
At 31 December, the Group had net cash of £24.9 million, 
compared with net borrowing at 31 December 2008 of 
£226.7 million. This refl ected the Group’s strong cash fl ow from 
operations, together with total gross cash proceeds of £163.1 
million from the sale of investments in Public Private Partnership 
projects, in line with the Group’s policy of recycling these 
investments, and from the disposal of non-core businesses.

Section 03 – Our performance
In construction services (excluding the Middle East), we 
expect the contribution to revenue from the UK to continue to 
decline in 2010, in line with our expectations, by applying strict 
contract selectivity criteria. In Canada, we expect further growth 
in 2010 partially to offset the reduction in UK revenue. Through 
contract selectivity we will continue to ensure that the size of our 
construction business is appropriate to support the delivery of 
PPP projects, the needs of our support services business and our 
expectations for reduced demand in our other UK construction 
markets. We have already made signifi cant progress in this regard 
and 100 per cent of expected revenue for the year in this segment 
is already covered by the order book and probable orders. 
Maintaining fi nancial discipline and contract selectivity will also 
support our objective of moving the combined operating margin 
for all our construction activities, including the Middle East, 
towards three per cent in 2010.
John McDonough
Group Chief Executive
3 March 2010
In support services, the outlook is positive. We have our largest 
ever pipeline of contract renewal and new contract opportunities, 
and currently only some 15 per cent of expected revenue in 2010 
is not already covered by our order book and probable orders. 
The level of new contract opportunities refl ects the pressure on 
both public and private sector organisations to reduce costs and 
increase effi ciency through outsourcing non-core services. We 
expect this trend to continue and in the public sector to accelerate, 
following the UK General Election in 2010, as both central and 
local government are expected to step up their efforts to reduce 
the costs of delivering better public services. As market conditions 
are expected to remain competitive, we will maintain our fi nancial 
discipline and continue to apply strict contract selectivity criteria in 
order to underpin our margins. Having increased our operating 
margin in this segment to 4.9 per cent in 2009 (2008: 4.6 per 
cent), we are targeting a margin of around fi ve per cent in 2010. 
In Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, we have a good 
pipeline of concession contracts for which we are either the 
preferred bidder or shortlisted. This refl ects the strong positions we 
have in our target market sectors in the UK and in Canada, where 
we expect continuing opportunities for new projects, notably in 
the education sector in the UK and in the health sector in Canada. 
Consequently, we expect to continue adding new PPP projects to 
our portfolio. We also expect to continue to explore opportunities 
for selling equity investments in mature projects, namely once 
construction of the asset has been completed and the project 
has moved successfully into the operational phase with the 
support services contract fully established. Therefore, we expect 
to continue generating signifi cant value for the Group through 
our PPP equity investments. 
In Middle East construction services, currently some 85 per 
cent of expected revenue in 2010 is already covered by our order 
book and probable orders. In addition, we have a strong pipeline 
of contract opportunities that is currently worth over £4 billion, 
the largest elements of which are in Abu Dhabi and Oman. Given 
our reputation for delivering projects to the highest standards of 
quality and reliability, we expect to continue benefi ting from the 
region’s major investment programmes, notably in Abu Dhabi and 
Oman, and also in Qatar where we have recently established a 
new business. Following the global economic downturn, rather 
than negotiating contracts we are now tendering competitively 
for contracts in this region. As a result, we expect our operating 
margin to reduce from the very high level we achieved in 2009 
of 8.5 per cent (2008: 7.4 per cent). However, we are still targeting 
a healthy margin of over six per cent in 2010. Furthermore, given 
the scale of opportunities we have in the region, we believe that 
the medium to long-term outlook also continues to be positive, 
with margins expected to stabilise in the medium term at between 
fi ve and six per cent.  Carillion plc

2009 to deliver a 19 per cent 
increase in underlying
(1)
 profi t 
from operations and a 14 per 
cent increase in underlying

earnings per share.
This was backed by strong cash generation that resulted 
in the Group having net cash at 31 December 2009 of 
£24.9 million, compared with net borrowing of £226.7 million 
at 31 December 2008.
Profi t and earnings growth were due to the Group’s resilient 
business mix, which delivered a good underlying operating 
performance, together with the benefi ts of cost savings from 
integrating the Alfred McAlpine business, which was acquired 
in February 2008. 
Carillion is a leading UK support services company with a 
substantial portfolio of Public Private Partnership projects and 
extensive construction capabilities. Having this wide range of 
skills and resources enables the Group to deliver fully integrated 
solutions for buildings and infrastructure, from project fi nance 
through design and construction, to life-time asset management.
The Group has operations in the UK, Middle East and North Africa 
and Canada and the Caribbean and our principal market sectors 
and activities are described on pages 2 to 11.

Section 03 – Our performance
Total underlying profi t from operations increased by 19 per cent 
to £196.8 million (2008: £165.2 million), including profi t from 
Joint Ventures of £65.9 million (2008: £45.1 million). 
The underlying profi t from operations margin increased to 
3.6 per cent (2008: 3.2 per cent) and refl ected our continuing 
drive to improve margins through contract selectivity, cost 
reduction and greater effi ciency. 
After a net fi nancial expense of £14.6 million (2008: £7.7 million), 
underlying profi t before tax was £182.2 million (2008: £157.5 
million), an increase of 16 per cent. Underlying earnings per share 
on the same measure increased by 14 per cent to 39.0 pence 
(2008: 34.3 pence).
Intangible amortisation was £30.8 million (2008: £54.5 million, 
including impairment of other investments). Non-recurring 
operating costs amounted to £15.2 million (2008: £22.7 million) 
and non-operating income was £11.5 million (2008: £35.6 million). 
Total non-recurring operating and non-operating items therefore 
amounted to a net cost of £3.7 million (2008: £12.9 million income), 
leaving reported profi t before tax of £147.7 million (2008: 
£1 15.9 million). 
Group taxation was £11.5 million (2008: £4.1 million), which 
when combined with Joint Ventures taxation of £6.5 million 
(2008: £10.7 million) represented an underlying effective tax 
rate of 16 per cent (2008: 20 per cent). Profi t after tax was 
£136.2 million (2008: £111.8 million) and minority interests were 
£3.8 million (2008: £3.5 million), leaving profi t attributable to 
Carillion shareholders of £132.4 million (2008: £108.3 million). 
Basic earnings per share were 33.4 pence (2008: 28.4 pence). 
Underlying cash fl ow from operations of £268.2 million 
(2008: £198.3 million) again comfortably exceeded underlying 
profi t from operations of £196.8 million (2008: £165.2 million). 
After payments of £29.0 million to pension funds (2008: 
£50.5 million), in line with our pension defi cit recovery plan, 
net capital expenditure of £47.3 million (2008: £26.4 million), 
restructuring and other costs of £17.1 million (2008: £32.4 million), 
interest, tax and dividend payments of £63.2 million (2008: 
£62.2 million) and a net income from disposals of £142.7 million 
(2008: £227.0 million net cost), the Group had net cash at 
31 December of £24.9 million, compared with net borrowing 
at 31 December 2008 of £226.7 million.

In this segment we report the results of our facilities

Underlying operating profi t
(1)
 increased by four per cent to 
£117.7 million, on revenue three per cent lower at £2,389.5 million, 
refl ecting a substantial improvement in the operating margin from 
4.6 per cent to 4.9 per cent. Margins improved, despite more 
competitive market conditions, as a result of maintaining our 
fi nancial discipline through continuing to apply strict contract 
selectivity criteria, together with the benefi ts of the Alfred 
McAlpine integration and re-organisation costs savings, which 
are coming through as expected. 
The reduction in revenue refl ected the sale of non-core businesses, 
the loss of a contract to manage insurance claims for Aviva, 
following a strategic decision by Aviva to take in-house services 
that involve direct contact with their customers, and the effect of 
being fi nancially disciplined and selective in respect of contract bids 
and re-bids. 
In 2009, we continued to strengthen our position as one of the 
UK’s leading support services companies through our ability to 
combine our extensive skills and nationwide resources to provide 
innovative cost-effective service solutions tailored to meet the 
needs of our customers. In particular, having the skills and 
resources to provide all the services needed to manage and 
maintain large, complex property estates and infrastructure 
helps to differentiate Carillion from its competitors. Our use of 
leading-edge technology to improve the quality and reduce the 
cost of these services has also become increasingly important to 
existing and new customers in the current economic climate. 
Our order book has increased following a number of notable 
successes during the year. These included a £1.0 billion, 
seven-year contract awarded to a Carillion-led Joint Venture 
to provide Openreach, BT’s local access network business, with 
nationwide asset management and maintenance services; facilities 
management and services contracts for the NHS worth some 
£240 million; road and rail infrastructure maintenance contracts 
worth £250 million; and facilities management contracts for other 
Government, regulated and blue-chip private sector customers 
worth approximately £400 million. 
The strong positions we hold in Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
projects, both in the UK and Canada, through combining our 
project fi nance, design, construction and supports services 
capabilities, continue to make signifi cant contributions to this 
segment. The support services forward order book relating 
to PPP projects currently stands at £6.9 billion and provides 
exceptional long-term revenue visibility, given PPP contract 
periods are typically between 25 and 35 years. 
The total value of our forward order book for support services at 
31 December 2009 was £11.1 billion (2008: £10.8 billion). At the 
year end, we also had a pipeline of probable new orders worth 
£0.6 billion (2008: £0.6 billion) and our largest ever pipeline of 
contract opportunities.

Section 03 – Our performance
Public Private 
Partnership projects
In this segment we report the equity returns from our 
investments in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. 
The results of the support services and construction 
services we provide as part of delivering PPP projects 
are reported in ‘support services’ and ‘construction 
services (excluding the Middle East)’, respectively. 
Our ability to combine our skills and resources in project fi nance, 
design, construction and support services to win and successfully 
deliver the high-quality assets and services expected from these 
projects, continues to generate considerable value for the Group. 
We target a 15 per cent internal rate of return on our investments 
in these projects over the life of the concession contracts, which 
is typically between 25 and 35 years. Once construction of the 
asset is complete and the project has moved successfully into 
the operational phase, with the support services contract fi rmly 
established, we have the option of selling our equity investments 
and reinvesting the proceeds in new projects. 
During 2009, we sold investments in four mature projects – Exeter 
Schools, Renfrewshire Schools, the New Accommodation Project 
(Cheltenham) and Allenby Connaught – generating proceeds of 
£100.7 million, which refl ected a net present value of the cash 
fl ows from these investments based on a discount rate of some 
eight per cent. Over the last six years, we have sold a total of 
28 investments, generating proceeds of some £279.9 million 
and a pre-tax profi t of £105.6 million. 
During the year, we also continued to add new projects to our 
portfolio: Carillion joint ventures achieved fi nancial close on fi ve 
projects – two Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programmes, 
namely Tameside and Durham, the Lister Surgicentre in 
Hertfordshire, the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, Ontario and 
the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto – in 
which Carillion expects to invest total combined equity of some 
£22.8 million. 
At the year end, we had a portfolio of 23 fi nancially closed projects 
in which we had invested £46.6 million and had commitments to 
invest a further £74.1 million of equity. Following the equity 
disposals made during 2009, the Directors’ valuation of our 
remaining equity investments at 31 December 2009 was 
£115 million (2008: £216 million), based on discounting the cash 
fl ows from these investments at an average discount rate of nine 
per cent. At 31 December 2009, we had a forward order book 
worth £2.4 billion (2008: £5.3 billion), with the reduction on 2008 
refl ecting the sale of four PPP equity investments during the year, 
and probable orders worth £0.2 billion (2008: £0.1 billion). 
Since the year end, we have achieved fi nancial close on Southmead 
Hospital, Bristol, in which we will invest £50 million of equity, and 
on the Rochdale BSF programme in which we will initially invest 
some £2.4 million of equity. We expect to make further equity 
investments in subsequent phases of the Rochdale programme.
In addition, we are currently the preferred bidder for the 
Wolverhampton BSF programme, in which we expect to invest 
up to £6 million of equity and we are shortlisted for a further four 
projects in the UK and Canada in which Carillion could potentially 
invest up to £59 million of equity.

Middle East 
construction services
In this segment we report the results of our building 
and civil engineering activities in the Middle East and 
North Africa.
Our Middle East construction businesses have again performed 
strongly against our previously announced target of more than 
doubling our share of revenue from these businesses from 
£269 million in 2006 to around £600 million in 2009, at an 
operating margin in excess of six per cent. In 2009, revenue 
increased by 19 per cent to £554 million, with the underlying 
operating margin up from 7.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent which 
resulted in an increase of 36 per cent in underlying operating profi t 
to £47.0 million. Cash fl ow has also remained strong with receipts 
from customers in 2009 of some £555 million, which supported an 
increase in the dividend received from our Middle East businesses.
We have continued to deliver substantial growth in the Middle East, 
despite the slowdown of construction activity in Dubai, through 
our strategy of geographical diversifi cation and of focusing on a 
small number of fi nancially robust customers with whom we have 
strong long-term relationships. 
We commenced operations in Abu Dhabi in early 2008, since when 
its contribution to Middle East revenue has increased from 20 per 
cent in 2008 to 55 per cent in 2009, while the contribution from 
Dubai has reduced as expected from 55 per cent in 2008 to 20 per 
cent in 2009. Revenue in Oman has also grown signifi cantly to 
leave its contribution broadly unchanged at 23 per cent, with the 
balance of two per cent coming from Egypt. 
The successful completion in October 2009 of the £350 million Yas 
Hotel, the centre piece of Abu Dhabi’s new Formula 1 Grand Prix 
circuit, for developer ALDAR, has further reinforced the reputation 
of Al Futtaim Carillion as one of the region’s leading contractors, 
well positioned to continue winning high-quality work. For 
example, during 2009, Al Futtaim Carillion secured a number of 
new orders in Abu Dhabi, including a £550 million contract for 
ALDAR to build the Al Muneera development and a £150 million 
contract to build a new headquarters for the Abu Dhabi Investment 
Council, together with further infrastructure works for Emirates 
Aluminium and the Qasr Al Muwaiji museum for the Authority for 
Culture and Heritage, together worth some £50 million. 
Our business in Oman, Carillion Alawi, also used its reputation 
as a market leader in delivering high-quality projects to secure 
signifi cant new contracts in 2009, the largest of which being a 
£275 million contract for the Royal Court Affairs to build the Majlis, 
a prestigious new Parliament building. In Egypt, we continue to 
make progress on the construction of Cairo Festival City, for which 
the customer is our Joint Venture partner, The Al Futtaim Group. 
At the year end, Carillion’s share of the forward order book of 
our Middle East businesses was £0.7 billion (2008: £0.8 billion). 
We also had probable new orders worth approximately £0.2 billion 
(2008: £0.9 billion) and a pipeline of contract opportunities worth 
over £4 billion.

Section 03 – Our performance
Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East)
In this segment we report the results of our UK building, 
civil engineering and developments businesses, together 
with those of our construction activities in Canada and the 
Caribbean.
Total revenue increased by eight per cent to £2,267.8 million. 
Within this total, UK revenue reduced slightly in line with our 
expectations, but this was more than offset by growth in Canada, 
primarily due to the acquisition of the Vanbots Group in October 
2008. Underlying operating profi t
(1)
 increased by eight per cent, 
refl ecting a stable operating margin of 1.4 per cent, which was a 
satisfactory result in challenging market conditions. The operating 
margin for all our construction activities, including Middle East 
construction services, increased to 2.8 per cent (2008: 2.5 per cent).
The UK contribution to revenue reduced slightly as a result of 
continuing to apply strict contract selectivity and risk management 
criteria, in order to secure high-quality projects for long-term 
customers in our chosen sectors of the non-housing, new-build 
market. As a result, we have continued to adjust the scope 
and scale of our construction capability to ensure it has the 
critical mass necessary to support the delivery of Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) projects and the needs of our support services 
business, while taking account of our expectations for reduced 
future demand in other UK construction markets. 
The intake of new orders has remained healthy. Notable successes 
in the UK included contracts for the Building Schools for the 
Future (BSF) programme worth £800 million, a £209 million 
contract to upgrade the A1 trunk road to motorway standard 
in Yorkshire, a £130 million contract for a luxury residential 
development for Grosvenor on London’s South Bank and a 
£116 million contract for HM Prison Low Moss in Scotland. 
 
In Canada and the Caribbean, we have had a very successful year. 
The acquisition of the Vanbots Group further strengthened our 
construction capability and leadership position in the growing PPP 
projects market in Canada, as evidenced by a number of major 
contract wins in 2009. Notable successes in Canada included two 
PPP projects in the health sector – the £144 million Royal Victoria 
Hospital in Barrie, Ontario, and the £107 million Centre for 
Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto – and a £360 million 
contract for the revitalisation of Union Station in Toronto. 
At the year end, our forward order book for construction 
services (excluding the Middle East) was worth £3.5 billion 
(2008: £3.5 billion) and we had a pipeline of probable new 
orders worth approximately £1.0 billion (2008: £1.5 billion).
Since the year end, we have achieved fi nancial close on the 
Rochdale BSF programme and the Southmead Hospital 
PPP project in Bristol, which together will generate over 
£600 million of construction services revenue for Carillion.

Non-operating income in 2009 amounted to £11.5 million 
(2008: £35.6 million) and comprised a profi t of £1.2 million on 
the sale of investments in Public Private Partnership projects and 
a provisional profi t of £10.3 million on the sale of two non-core 
businesses – Carillion IT Services and the Group’s environmental 
consultancy business, Enviros.
Net fi nancial expense 
The Group had a net fi nancial expense of £14.6 million (2008: 
£7.7 million). This comprised a net expense of £15.8 million in 
respect of borrowings, a net interest charge of £2.2 million in 
respect of retirement benefi t schemes and an interest credit of 
£3.4 million in respect of loans to Special Purpose Companies 
for Public Private Partnership projects.
 
Taxation
The effective tax rate on underlying profi t was 16 per cent, 
which is below the UK standard rate of corporation tax, principally 
refl ecting the change to UK legislation in July 2009 that made 
dividends received from overseas companies exempt from 
UK taxation, together with the utilisation of UK tax losses. 
At 31 December 2009 the Group had £375 million (2008: 
£355 million) of corporate tax losses in the UK that are available 
to reduce future tax payments.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 
39.0 pence (2008: 34.3 pence). This substantial increase refl ected 
the Group’s strong operating performance, notably through 
growing operating margins and by reducing central costs.
 
Dividend 
Carillion has a dividend policy of progressively increasing the 
dividend paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings growth, 
after taking account of the investment needs of the business. 
Consistent with this policy, the Board has recommended a fi nal 
dividend in respect of 2009 of 10.0 pence, making the full-year 
dividend 14.6 pence, an increase of 12 per cent on the total paid 
in respect of 2008 (13.0 pence). Underlying dividend cover was 
2.7 times (2008: 2.6 times).

Our performance
Intangible amortisation and impairment of 
other investments
Intangible amortisation of £30.8 million (2008: £54.5 million) 
relates to the amortisation of intangible assets arising primarily 
from the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred McAlpine 
and the Vanbots Group in 2008. The £54.5 million charge in 
2008 included an impairment charge of £11.7 million in respect 
of the investment in the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, 
a Public Private Partnership project acquired with Mowlem. 
Non-recurring operating items 
These costs are summarised in the table below.
(£m)   2009 2008
Rationalisation costs   (9.9) –
Offi ce of Fair Trading penalty   (5.4) –
Curtailment gain    0.1 35.5
Alfred McAlpine integration and re-organisation costs – (55.0)
Vanbots Group integration and re-organisation costs – (3.2)
    (15.2) (22.7)
Rationalisation costs of £9.9 million relate to redundancy and other 
associated costs incurred in rationalising the Group’s structure at 
the end of 2009. This includes ensuring that the size of the Group’s 
UK construction capability refl ects the expected decline in our 
general construction markets, while maintaining the capability we 
need to support the delivery of Public Private Partnership projects 
and meet the needs of our support services business. 
The Offi ce of Fair Trading (OFT) penalty of £5.4 million was 
imposed on Carillion JM Limited, which was formerly Mowlem plc 
prior to its acquisition by Carillion. Mowlem was one of 103 
companies penalised following an OFT investigation into cover 
pricing in the construction industry under the Competition Act 
1998. The anti-competitive activities for which Mowlem was 
penalised related to the activities of Mowlem prior to its acquisition 
by Carillion in February 2006. No other Carillion companies were 
subject to the OFT investigation. 
A curtailment gain of £35.5 million was recognised in 2008, 
as a result of closing four Carillion defi ned benefi t pension 
schemes to future accrual, net of £2.8 million of expenses. 
From 31 December 2009, benefi ts paid in respect of the Alfred 
McAlpine Pension Plan will no longer be linked to fi nal salary 
(see also ‘Retirement benefi ts’ on page 28). This gave rise to a 
curtailment gain of £0.1 million (net of expenses). Carillion plc

(1) Post the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine.
Our continuing focus on strong cash management and the 
delivery of cash-backed profi t has produced underlying cash 
fl ow from operations of £268.2 million, signifi cantly ahead of 
underlying profi t from operations of £196.8 million. This, together 
with proceeds from the sale of four investments in Public private 
Partnership (PPP) projects and from the disposal of non-core 
businesses, namely, Carillion IT Services and Enviros, has 
resulted in the Group having net cash at 31 December 2009 of 
£24.9 million, compared with net borrowing of £226.7 million 
at 31 December 2008. 
Additional cash payments to the Group’s pension’s schemes 
amounted to £29.0 million, in line with our pension defi cit 
recovery plan. The cash cost of restructuring of £17.1 million 
includes costs relating to the integration of the Alfred McAlpine 
and Vanbots Group businesses, which were acquired in 2008, and 
costs relating to restructuring the Carillion Group, as described 
under ‘Non-recurring operating items’ on page 26. Net capital 
expenditure of £47.3 million was higher than in 2008, because the 
latter was net of disposal proceeds of £15.0 million, not repeated 
in 2009. Overall capital expenditure was higher than the Group’s 
annual depreciation charge, because of additional investment in 
IT infrastructure, in order to accommodate the Alfred McApine 
businesses and deliver planned synergy benefi ts, and in plant and 
equipment to support the growth of our business in Canada. 
The cash infl ow in respect of acquisitions and disposals in 2009 
refl ected £157.9 million of proceeds (net of costs) from the sale 
of investments in PPP projects and non-core businesses, net of 
£15.2 million of further investments in PPP projects.
Balance sheet 
Carillion’s balance sheet remains strong and is supported by 
committed bank facilities of £655 million, the largest of which is a 
£590 million syndicated facility which matures in September 2012.
(£m)   2009 2008
Property, plant and equipment   168.2 167.2
Intangible assets   1,241.3 1,276.9
Investments   177.1 238.6
    1,586.6 1,682.7
Inventories, receivables and payables  (608.0) (490.4)
Net retirement benefi ts liability (net of tax)  (211.1) (76.2)
Other   (15.2) (21.8)
Net operating assets   752.3 1,094.3
Net cash/(borrowing)   24.9 (226.7)
Net assets   777.2 867.6
Intangible assets reduced primarily as a result of amortisation. 
The reduction in investments refl ects the sale of four of the 
Group’s equity investments in PPP projects. The movement in 
inventories, receivables and payables was primarily due to a 
£40 million receipt resulting from outsourcing Carillion’s internal 
IT functions to Accenture, as announced in June 2009, and a 
reduction in working capital of some £33 million arising from the 
disposal of Enviros and our external IT business. The increase in the 
Group’s net retirement benefi ts liability was due to a number of 
factors, but primarily refl ects a reduction in market bond yields 
since December 2008, partially offset by additional cash payments 
to our pension schemes under our pension defi cit recovery plan 
and a curtailment gain, which is explained on page 28 in the 
section headed ‘Retirement benefi ts’.  Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 28
Retirement benefi ts
The Group’s ongoing pensions charge against profi t in 2009 
was £28.6 million (2008: £35.8 million). After additional cash 
payments to the Group’s pension schemes of £29.0 million 
(2008: £50.5 million), in line with our defi cit recovery plan, and a 
curtailment gain of £3.3 million (2008: £38.3 million), the Group’s 
pension schemes had a total defi cit net of tax at 31 December 
2009 of £211.1 million (2008: £76.2 million). As part of the 
Group’s strategy for managing the risks and liabilities associated 
with its defi ned benefi t pension schemes, the benefi ts for 
members of the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan will, as with other 
Carillion schemes, no longer be linked to fi nal salary with effect 
from 31 December 2009. 
Committed bank facilities 
The Group’s main committed bank facilities of £655 million 
comprise a £590 million syndicated fi ve-year facility, bilateral 
facilities of £50 million and a £15 million 364-day facility. The 
£590 million facility is repayable on 30 September 2012, having 
been arranged in September 2007 on favourable terms, before 
the severe tightening of the credit markets. The bilateral facilities 
have repayment dates between September and December 2012. 
These facilities have proved to be more than adequate to support 
the operations of the Group.
Operational and fi nancial risk management 
Carillion has rigorous policies and processes in place to identify, 
mitigate and manage strategic risks and those specifi c to 
individual businesses and contracts, including economic, 
social, environmental and ethical risks. These are summarised 
on page 16 of the Group Chief Executive’s review.
Treasury policy and fi nancial risk management
The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary 
role is to manage funding, liquidity and fi nancial risks. In addition, 
Treasury sources and administers contract bond and guarantee 
facilities for the Group. Treasury is not a profi t centre and does not 
enter into speculative transactions. The Board sets policies within 
which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective fi nancing 
of the Group’s operations and limit exposure to fi nancial risk. The 
areas of signifi cant fi nancial risk facing the Group relate to funding 
and liquidity, counterparty risk, foreign exchange and interest rates.
Share price
Carillion’s share price was 303.8 pence at close of business on 
31 December 2009, an increase of 22.5 per cent in the closing 
price on 31 December 2008 of 248.0 pence.
Carillion’s total shareholder return increased in 2009 by 23 per 
cent, broadly in line with the return for the FTSE 350. Over the 
last fi ve years, Carillion’s total shareholder return has signifi cantly 
outperformed the FTSE 350. The FTSE 350 has been chosen 
by the Board as the best comparator to illustrate Carillion’s 
performance against a broad equity market index.

by the Board. The Group has not entered into interest rate 
derivatives to fi x or hedge interest rate risk and currently none are 
outstanding. Certain longer-term assets have been fi nanced using 
fi xed rate leases.
Carillion has invested equity in a number of Joint Venture Special 
Purpose Companies (SPC) to deliver Public Private Partnership 
projects. SPCs obtain funding for these projects in the form of 
long-term bank loans or corporate bonds without recourse to 
the Joint Venture partners and secured on the assets of the SPC. 
A number of SPCs have entered into interest rate derivatives as 
a means of hedging interest rate risk. These derivatives are 
interest rate swaps that effectively fi x the rate of interest payable.
Credit risk
An analysis of the Group’s credit risk is provided in Note 27 on 
page 95.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, the 
fi nancial position of the Group, its cash fl ows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in Section 3 on pages 12 to 
29, entitled ‘Our Performance’. In addition, note 27 to the fi nancial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its fi nancial risk management objectives; 
details of its fi nancial instruments and hedging activities and its 
exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable fi nancial resources together 
with long-term contracts with a number of customers and 
suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. 
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the 
current uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors confi rm that, after making enquiries, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the fi nancial statements.

Funding and liquidity 
In addition to Carillion plc’s principal borrowing facilities described 
on page 28, money market and short-term overdraft facilities are 
available to Carillion plc and certain subsidiaries. Operating leases 
are also employed to fund longer-term assets. The quantum of 
committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is regularly 
reviewed by the Carillion Board and is designed to satisfy the 
requirements of the Group’s business plan. At 31 December 2009, 
the Group had undrawn committed facilities amounting to 
£518.4 million (2008: £242.3 million). This excludes the Group’s 
share of cash balances amounting to £144.5 million (2008: 
£157.7 million) within jointly controlled operations, which are 
outside of the Group’s facilities. These cash balances are available 
to the Group to the extent that they are not needed to meet the 
working capital requirements of the jointly controlled operations.
Counterparty risk
The Group undertakes signifi cant fi nancial transactions only with 
counterparties that have strong credit ratings. The limits and 
requirements in respect of such transactions are reviewed regularly 
by the Board of Carillion plc.
Foreign exchange
The Group hedges all signifi cant currency transaction exposures 
using foreign exchange risk management techniques. In order to 
protect the Group’s balance sheet from the impact of exchange 
rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using 
matching currency loans equivalent to at least 60 per cent of 
the net asset value, where these assets exceed the equivalent 
of £10 million. Profi ts arising within overseas subsidiaries are 
not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such 
distributions are then treated as currency transactions and 
hedged accordingly.
The average and year-end exchange rates used to translate the 
Group’s overseas operations were as follows:
 Average Year end
(£ sterling) 2009 2008 2009 2008
Middle East (US Dollar) 1.56 1.84 1.61 1.44
Oman (Rial) 0.60 0.71 0.62 0.55
UAE (Dirhams) 5.72 6.75 5.93 5.28
Canada (Dollar) 1.78 1.95 1.69 1.77
Trinidad (Dollar) 9.81 11.52 10.23 9.04
Interest rates
The Group’s borrowing facilities are at fl oating rates of interest 
linked to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate, UK base rate or 
prevailing local currency interest rates. Short-term bank deposits 
and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with 
highly credit-rated authorised counterparties and credit exposures 
to counterparties are monitored regularly so that exposure to any 
one counterparty is either within Board approved limits or approved  Carillion plc

Section 03 – Our performance
Managing sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability is driven by our Board, supported 
by a Sustainability Committee. This Committee is chaired by our 
Chief Executive, John McDonough, and includes a number of 
Executive and Senior Directors. The Committee also benefi ts from 
expert advice from two external members, Dame Julia Cleverdon, 
Vice President of Business in The Community (BITC) and Jonathan 
Porritt, Founder Director of Forum for the Future.
The Sustainability Committee is supported by a Sustainability 
Forum, comprising our senior business leaders, that informs the 
development of our sustainability strategy, shares best practice and 
ensures the effective dissemination of our sustainability strategy 
and policies to our business units. All our business units have a 
sustainability plan and objectives, which form an integral part of 
their annual business plans. Our seventh annual Sustainability 
Week was again organised to coincide with World Environment 
Day. In 2009, our focus for sustainability week was on carbon 
reduction and our chosen charity for the week was The Prince’s 
Trust, for which we raised over £6,500 from employees’ 
fundraising activities. We chose The Prince’s Trust, because we 
already support the work it does to promote more sustainable 
practices, for example the ‘Get Into Construction’ programme.
Our performance
In 2009, Carillion was included in the Top 20 UK companies in 
the Sunday Times Best Green Companies. We also continued 
to improve our ranking in BITC’s Corporate Responsibility Index, 
moving up from a ‘Gold’ to a ‘Platinum’ ranking, with a score 
of 96.5 per cent. The Corporate Responsibility Index involves a 
detailed, independent assessment of Carillion’s sustainability 
strategy, management processes and performance. Such 
assessments enable us to benchmark our performance against 
other companies, including those in different market sectors. 
Carillion continues to be a member of the FTSE4Good Index and 
this year we submitted a full response to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project for the fi rst time.
Our Middle East and North Africa (MENA) business won the 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the Year Award and the 
Build Safe UAE Award for best practice, at the 2009 Construction 
Week Awards held in Dubai. To win this award, our MENA 
business had to demonstrate that it has its employees’ welfare 
and that of the community at heart. Our MENA business was 
specifi cally recognised for its efforts to protect the environment 
through effi cient waste management techniques and a number 
of clean-up campaigns.
Our Joint Venture business, Al Futtaim Carillion, received The 
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) award for ‘Build Safe UAE’ 
for its diligent and rigorous efforts to make its construction sites 
across the Middle East as safe as possible and by taking a very 
active role in the Build Safe UAE programme.
In 2009, as well as continuing to set specifi c sustainability targets 
for each of our business groups and for the Group as a whole, 
we focused on a number of important specifi c areas, namely
>  embedding our carbon reduction strategy into all areas of 
our business with action plans to support the delivery of our 
target to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2010, 
measured against a 2006 baseline
>  delivering the commitment we have made to halve the 
volume of construction waste sent to landfi ll by 2012
>  through the Business Action on Homelessness programme, 
enabling 100 candidates to gain valuable two-week 
work placements in our businesses and supporting their 
re-introduction to employment
>  working with communities and in particular ensuring that 
at least one per cent of our pre-tax profi ts are given in cash 
or kind to community activities
>  monitoring progress with implementing our apprenticeship 
charter to ensure at least 250 apprentices are gaining 
valuable work experience on our contracts and projects and
>  delivering our commitments on sustainable procurement 
through applying the framework methodology developed by 
the UK Government’s Sustainable Procurement Task Force.
The Group’s sustainability targets for 2009 were based on 
14 specifi c and measurable targets. In order to drive continuous 
improvement we set demanding targets and our performance 
against them is independently verifi ed by Bureau Veritas. A full 
report on what we have achieved will be published in our 2009 
Sustainability Report, in April 2010.  Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 32
Our performance
Sustainable communities and workforce
Creating a sustainable business requires the commitment of all our 
people. We seek to achieve this through our Health and Safety, 
leadership, personal development and employee engagement 
programmes, which are described in more detail on pages 16, 
17, 37 and 38.
How we do business is based on our belief that it is not only 
what we do that matters, but also how we do it, which drives 
our commitment to living our values in everything we do. We 
make Values Awards to our people to recognise the outstanding 
contributions they make to our success in delivering an excellent 
service to our customers and to creating a positive impact on the 
communities in which we operate.
We feel proud that our people are also winning prestigious 
awards. Our Group Chief Engineer, Professor Quentin Leiper, 
was awarded the CBE in Her Majesty the Queen’s 2009 Birthday 
Honours List. Quentin received the award for services to the 
Sustainability agenda as an employee of Carillion and also 
as a former President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
Carillion Building’s Tony Fleming won the Business in the 
Community (BITC) Midlands Region, Volunteer of the Year Award. 
Tony received this award for showing exceptional commitment 
to volunteering, through Carillion, to make a positive impact on 
his local community. Tony, who was also a Business Action on 
Homelessness champion, has now retired from Carillion, but 
remains committed to his involvement in the Carillion programme. 
Our commitment to sustainable communities also extends beyond 
the roles played by our own people. We have a community 
engagement strategy for all our major worksites and projects 
and we encourage our people to understand how Carillion can 
have positive impacts on the communities in which we operate 
and to participate in community activities. 
Carillion gives over one per cent of its pre-tax profi ts in cash or 
in kind to community activities. We are a national partner in the 
Business Action on Homelessness (BAOH) campaign, designed 
to help homeless people break the cycle of ‘no home, no job’ 
and since becoming a partner in 2006 we have assisted over 100 
homeless people every year on their journey to full employment. 
As 2009 marked Carillion’s tenth anniversary as an independent 
company, we donated £25,000 to charities in the UK, Canada and 
the Middle East. Donations of £500 were made to 50 different 
charities, nominated by our employees. 
As one of the UK’s leading providers of training for support 
services and construction skills, we continue to work with the 
Construction Industry Training Board and contribute to the 
development of individuals and communities. In 2009, 69 per cent 
of our apprentices successfully completed their training in one of 
our 18 UK training centres, including 258 people who were trained 
through The Prince’s Trust ‘Get into Construction’ programme. 
National resource protection and 
environmental enhancement
What we do and how we do it can have signifi cant impacts on 
the use of natural resources and the environment. We use our 
knowledge and skills to develop sustainable service solutions for 
customers to create positive impacts in these areas.
Carillion has developed and implemented environmental 
management systems across the Group and all our UK and Middle 
East and North Africa operations are accredited to ISO14001 by a 
registered third party.
The preservation of natural habitats and the wildlife they support 
is important both socially and environmentally. Since 2000, we 
have supported the UK Wildlife Trusts through the Carillion Natural 
Habitats Fund, and to date we have given over £255,000 to the 
Trusts to support 44 projects. The local Wildlife Trusts, which care 
for almost 2,500 nature reserves across the country, are able to 
apply for a grant from the Fund to support a conservation project. 
We also encourage our employees to work with their local Wildlife 
Trusts on these projects to improve nature conservation, especially 
where projects are close to Carillion offi ces or worksites.
In recognition of our ongoing commitment to integrate 
sustainability into everything we do, we have adopted the UK 
Government’s Sustainable Procurement Taskforce (SPTF) ‘Flexible 
Framework’. This framework provides a step-by-step approach to 
demonstrating leadership in sustainable procurement and we have 
plans in place to achieve the requirements of each phase of the 
framework.
Carillion continues to be a member of the WWF-UK Forest and 
Trade Network (FTN) and during 2009 we continued to work 
towards ensuring we use timber products from sources certifi ed by 
the Forest Stewardship Council on all our projects. We report the 
volumes and sources of the timber we use to the WWF-UK FTN 
annually and develop detailed action plans for improvement.

Section 03 – Our performance
Climate change and energy
Climate change is increasingly recognised as the most serious 
long-term threat to human prosperity and lifestyle. The effective 
management and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
has become increasingly important, as it is now widely accepted 
that companies will need to make substantial changes to the ways 
in which they operate, if we are to respond effectively to this threat. 
In 2007, Carillion set the challenging target of reducing its direct 
carbon emissions by 50% by 2010. This target will be measured 
against the Group’s 2006 carbon emissions, adjusted for revenue 
growth. In order to achieve this target, we have developed a 
carbon reduction strategy and policy, which involves measuring 
and reporting our carbon footprint each quarter, in accordance 
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol carbon accounting standard. 
Our carbon footprint covers our direct emissions generated from 
buildings, transport, travel, waste and from plant powered by fossil 
fuel on project sites. 
We are focusing on our activities in areas where we can have the 
greatest direct impact by reducing carbon emissions generated by 
> employee business travel
> commercial vehicles
> plant fuel
> Carillion offi ces.
In order to manage our carbon emissions effectively, we have 
begun a programme of work to understand our indirect impacts 
and in 2010 we will be trialling our models for managing these 
impacts on a selection of construction sites.
In 2009, we continued to develop our understanding of how our 
operations affect climate change, together with our commitment 
to developing new measures to reduce these effects. We regard 
this as fundamental to the development of our business and we 
have also linked this to other measures we are pursuing, including 
the reduction of our overall cost base. We continue to promote 
the use of telephone and video conferencing to reduce the need 
to travel, introduced more fuel effi cient cars and procured all 
the electricity we use from renewable or climate change 
levy-exempt sources. We are also working with our customers to 
provide sustainable building, infrastructure and lifetime facilities 
management and services. 
Our 2009 sustainability report provides more information on our 
carbon reduction programme and will be published in April 2010 
on our website.
Sustainable consumption and production
Carillion’s leadership in developing and implementing its 
sustainability strategy model, which relates our impacts on the 
environment and on society to business performance, has made 
a major contribution to the Group’s risk management policies 
and processes. 
These policies and processes address strategic risks and those 
specifi c to individual businesses and contracts, including economic, 
social, environmental and ethical risks, and are therefore 
fundamental to the management of the Group and all its 
operations.
We believe that our leadership in sustainability differentiates us 
from our competitors. We seek to understand the needs of our 
customers and their objectives in respect of sustainability and to 
use our knowledge and skills to meet their needs by developing 
sustainable service solutions. We also seek to promote sustainable 
solutions by explaining to our customers how a sustainable 
approach can not only create positive impacts on the environment 
and on society, but also reduce costs, increase effi ciency and 
improve the quality of the services we offer.
For example, Carillion recently secured the prestigious Public 
Private Partnership project to fi nance, design, build and operate 
the new Southmead Hospital in Bristol. The delivery of sustainable 
solutions for all aspects of this project were key to Carillion’s 
success, as Carillion and the North Bristol NHS Trust are both 
committed to achieving the highest standards of sustainability. 
The project will involve creating a state-of-the-art building that will 
be the most sustainable major acute hospital in the UK, with low 
energy utilisation and a carbon footprint below the government 
target of 3.43Te CO
2 a year. This demonstrates how Carillion’s 
leadership in sustainability helps to differentiate us from our 
competitors and contributes to the strong positions we hold in 
our chosen market sectors. Carillion plc

Employees
Information relating to employee numbers and remuneration is

Employees are key to achieving Carillion’s business strategy and the 
Group is committed to improving their skills through training and 
development and through nurturing a culture in which employees 
feel valued for the contributions they make to the Company and 
motivated to achieve their full potential. 
Carillion’s core values of openness, collaboration, mutual 
dependency, sustainable profi table growth, professional delivery 
and innovation help to differentiate Carillion from its competitors 
by creating a culture in which everyone in Carillion is encouraged 
to understand the needs of their customers and to work in 
partnership with customers and suppliers to deliver high-quality, 
value-for-money services. 
It is Carillion’s aim to foster a working environment in which all 
employees are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect. Carillion 
strives continually to eliminate all bias and unlawful discrimination 
in relation to job applicants, employees, business partners and 
members of the public.
The objectives of Carillion’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity Policy 
are to
>  have a workforce that represents and responds to the diversity 
of customers and today’s society
>  improve safety and quality delivered through a balanced and 
productive workforce
>  develop the Group’s public image and market reputation and to 
improve links with the communities in which it operates 
>  adhere to legal requirements
>  reduce employee turnover, absenteeism and sickness levels and 
thereby reduce costs and improve effi ciency
>  provide a fair working environment in which discrimination is not 
tolerated
>  create a working environment free from discrimination, 
harassment, victimisation and bullying
>  work towards fi nding ways in which under-represented groups 
can fully realise their potential within the Group and to take 
reasonable steps to help such groups 
>  ensure that all employees are aware of the Group Equal 
Opportunities and Diversity Policy and to provide any necessary 
ongoing training to enable them to comply with it
>  be an organisation that understands and values employee 
diversity and recognises the merits of having a workforce that 
refl ects the diverse backgrounds and skills available within the 
total population and accordingly provides all employees with 
opportunities to develop and reach their full potential.
Carillion places great importance on open and regular 
communication with employees through both formal and informal 
processes. As part of this commitment, a Group newspaper, 
‘Spectrum’, is produced on a regular basis for all employees. 
The views of employees on matters affecting their interests 
and the success of Carillion are also sought through ‘The Great 
Debate’, ‘People Forums’, ‘Team Talks’, and one-to-one meetings 
between employees and their line managers. 
The ‘Great Debate’ is a major exercise, which has been undertaken 
by the Group in each of the last six years, involving a wide range of 
employees that forms a statistically signifi cant sample. In 2009, 
around 3,900 UK employees took part in ‘The Great Debate’. The 
results of each Great Debate are used to inform and guide the 
development of work related initiatives as part of Carillion’s 
strategy to become an employer of choice.  Carillion plc

both as an employer and as a business
>  demonstrate Carillion’s commitment to listening to, and 
responding to, the views of its employees.

>  support the continued education and development of 
employees
>  improve business performance by improving the awareness of 
employees to the business climate in which they operate
>  help employees to be responsive and better prepared for 
change.
‘Team Talks’, which are held monthly, provide Carillion employees 
with a face-to-face communication with their line managers 
and facilitates two-way communication, discussion and feedback. 
It focuses on local issues and key corporate messages and 
information. 
One-to-one meetings between individual employees and their line 
managers are also held to discuss performance and progress in 
order to help all employees to develop and reach their full potential.
Employees can also exchange best practice information via a 
Business Exchange forum on the Group intranet.

programmes to integrate safety into every aspect of the Group’s 
operations and to improve its environmental performance, 
including the understanding and application of the principles 
of sustainability. Further information on Health and Safety is 
given in the Group Chief Executive’s review on page 17 and on

terms and conditions for transactions with its suppliers and for

their obligations to the businesses’ satisfaction. The Group as a 
whole does not apply a general payment policy as this would 
not be practicable or appropriate, given the diverse nature of 
the transactions undertaken by its business units. The Company 
does not have any trade creditors.

Corporate Governance report
The Board is fi rmly committed 
to high standards of corporate 
governance.
General principles
The Board is fi rmly committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. During the year to 31 December 2009, as detailed 
below and in the Remuneration report on page 47, the Company 
complied with both the main principles and the provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(June 2008) except in respect of Board Balance (principle A.3.2). 
The reason for non-compliance in this matter is explained on 
page 41 of this report. Since the Annual General Meeting on 
6 May 2009, the Company has been fully compliant with the 
Combined Code.
Ethics and Business Integrity Policy
Carillion has a clear and unequivocal approach to business integrity 
and ethics which underlies the Group’s core values of openness, 
collaboration, mutual dependency, sustainable profi table growth, 
professional delivery and innovation. The Ethics and Integrity Policy 
is designed to ensure that Carillion will conduct its business to the 
highest ethical standards.
The policy applies to all employees of any Carillion Group 
company. The way Carillion delivers this policy is refl ected in the 
way the Group competes for business and delivers its services, 
focused on quality, value for money and the reliability and 
reputation of its employees.
The policy is
>  business integrity: we do not give or accept bribes; we do 
not sanction or accept any illegal payments, allowances, 
or gifts-in-kind; we investigate fully all alleged breaches of 
this policy and will dismiss any employee who has breached 
this policy
>  mutual respect: we do what we say we will do; we treat our 
people fairly and with respect at all times, avoiding 
discrimination and bullying; we provide a safe and healthy 
working environment, and respect sustainable principles in all 
the Group’s operations
>  trust: we engender trust within our work groups and companies, 
respecting diverse traditions and cultures; we respect the trust 
placed in us by others, not least when we are asked to take 
responsibility for aspects of their business or resources; we 
maintain and demand high professional standards and demand 
honesty and openness; we avoid confl icts of interest wherever 
possible, and we proactively declare any unavoidable confl icts 
for open scrutiny and resolution
>  legality: we respect the rule of law in all our dealings; we clearly 
communicate procedures for disciplining those who do not 
comply with the law or our standards and policies; we maintain 
a system for confi dential reporting of breaches of our standards 
and policies
>  human rights: we support the belief that human rights are 
universal and adhere to the principles of human rights in our 
operations; we support the United Nations Universal Declaration 
on Human Rights.
This policy is applied into Carillion’s business through a series 
of detailed procedures. They allow Carillion to carry into practice 
its reputation for conducting business to the highest ethical 
standards, which are essential to its relationships with customers, 
business partners, employees, shareholders and the public. 
The detailed procedures refl ect the way Carillion competes for 
business, through the quality and value of its work and through 
the reliability and reputation of its people.
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy and its implementation 
is reviewed annually by the Board. The policy is currently under 
review in light of the Bribery Bill. Carillion plc

Executive and fi ve Non-Executive Directors. However, Roger 
Robinson retired from the Board at the Annual General Meeting 
on 6 May 2009 such that the Company was once again fully 
compliant with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are terminable by one year’s notice. 
In 2009, a detailed internal evaluation of the Board’s corporate 
governance procedures and compliance was conducted by the 
Chairman in conjunction with the Company Secretary. The internal 
evaluation took into account the views of each of the Directors on 
(i) the role of Directors, (ii) the performance of the Board, the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, (iii) Board Committees, 
(iv) leadership and culture, (v) Corporate Governance (vi) Directors’ 
remuneration, (vii) relations with shareholders and (viii) Board 
accountability and audit. The Board at its meeting in November 
2009 reviewed the results of the internal evaluation and, where 
required, issues were acted upon in order to further enhance the 
effectiveness of the Board’s procedures and working practices. 
Such an evaluation has been conducted in each of the last eight 
years and the intention is to repeat it annually. In addition, the 
performance of each individual Director has been reviewed. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Group Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and 
encompasses the following parameters
>  the primary job of the Chairman of a public company is to 
provide continuity, experience and governance while the 
Group Chief Executive provides leadership, energy, imagination 
and the driving force
>  the Chairman is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward 
of the business and the guardian of the interests of all the 
shareholders. Nonetheless, it is essential that the outline of 
their respective roles encourages the Chairman and Group 
Chief Executive to work well together to provide effective and 
complementary stewardship
>  the Chairman must:
 –  take overall responsibility for the composition and capability 
of the Board
 –  consult regularly with the Group Chief Executive and be 
available on a fl exible basis for providing advice, counsel 
and support to the Group Chief Executive.
> the Group Chief Executive must: 
 –  manage the Executive Directors and the Group’s day to 
day activities
 –  prepare and present to the Board strategic options for 
growth in shareholder value
 –  set the operating plans and budgets required to deliver 
the agreed strategy
 –  ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk 
management and control mechanisms.
The Board had a programme of ten meetings in 2009 and it 
also met on an ad hoc basis as required.
A formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for 
consideration and decision is maintained. These matters include
>  statutory issues such as the approval of fi nal and interim 
fi nancial statements and the recommendation of dividends
>  appointments to, and removals from, the Board and the terms 
of reference and membership of Board committees
> approval of Group strategy and annual budgets
> approval of authority levels, fi nancial and treasury policies
> authorisation for any acquisition or disposal
>  review of the internal control arrangements and risk 
management strategies
> review of corporate governance arrangements.
The Executive Directors and the Carillion subsidiary companies 
operate within clearly defi ned limits of authority delegated by the 
Board and any matters outside of these limits must be referred to 
the Board for consideration. Carillion plc

Any Director may, in furtherance of his duties, take independent 
professional advice when necessary, at the expense of the 
Company. 
The Board is provided with regular and timely information on the

Group as a whole, together with reports on trading matters, 
markets, sustainability and other relevant issues.

Other Board matters
Policy on external appointments
Recognising that external appointments can broaden their 
knowledge and so be of benefi t to the Company, Executive 
Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to accept a 
limited number of such appointments and retain the fees received 
for such appointments. John McDonough is a Non-Executive 
Director of Tomkins plc and Richard Adam is a Non-Executive 
Director of SSL International plc.
Nomination and remuneration of Directors
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by the 
Board as a whole, taking advice from the Nominations Committee.
For Board appointments, the Nominations Committee uses the 
services of the executive recruitment consultants JCA and Odgers. 
Details of potential candidates are provided by the consultant 
and initially reviewed by a sub-committee of the Nominations 
Committee. Meetings with selected candidates are then held with 
Directors. Subsequently, the Nominations Committee meets to 
recommend an appointment, which is then proposed to the Board 
for approval. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 43
Section 04 – Governance
In the case of Non-Executive Directors, initial appointments are 
normally for three years; re-appointment is subject to review and is 
not automatic. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board 
as a whole, taking into account the commitment required and 
participation in the work of committees and other advisory services 
in relation to the business of the Group. In advising the Board on 
such fees, it is the policy of the Executive Directors to seek 
independent external advice concerning the appropriateness of the 
amounts by comparison with general practice. The level of fees 
currently payable to the Non-Executive Directors is based on 
independent external advice.
The remuneration of the Directors is dealt with in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 53.
Retirement of Directors by rotation
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years. The Directors retiring and seeking 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
5 May 2010 are Richard Adam, Don Kenny, John McDonough 
and Steve Mogford.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders 
at the fi rst opportunity following their appointment. Accordingly, 
Richard Howson will seek election at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 5 May 2010.
The service contracts of the Executive Directors and the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the registered offi ce of the Company 
during normal business hours on any weekday (bank holidays 
excepted) and at the Annual General Meeting.
Induction and development of Directors
Directors are provided with a comprehensive information pack on 
joining the Company and are advised of their legal and other 
duties and obligations as a director of a listed company. In 
addition, all new Directors receive induction on their appointment 
covering such matters as the operation and activities of the Group, 
the role of the Board and the Company’s corporate governance 
procedures. Directors are also briefed by the Company’s external 
advisors, where appropriate, on changes to legislation or 
regulation or market practice as well as receiving briefi ngs from 
business groups throughout the year.
At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in 
November 2009 the Directors visited the Group’s operations in 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Directors also visit other operations and 
meet a wide range of employees. 
The regular updating of Directors’ skills and knowledge is 
encouraged and a procedure has been established whereby the 
Company Secretary is notifi ed by Directors of their requirements in 
this respect.
Relations with shareholders
In addition to communicating with shareholders generally from 
time to time, the Executive Directors and the Director of Group 
Corporate Affairs meet regularly with representatives of major 
shareholders in order to foster the mutual understanding of 
objectives. Meetings are also held with other shareholders and 
prospective shareholders. The details of these meetings are 
reported to the Board. The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director are available for meetings with 
representatives of major shareholders as required.
Private and institutional shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined 
Code in respect of the notice, content of agenda and conduct of 
its Annual General Meetings. The Chairmen of the Remuneration 
and Audit Committees will be present at the Annual General 
Meeting on 5 May 2010 to respond to shareholders’ questions.

Main activities of the Audit Committee in the year 
to 31 December 2009
Financial statements
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management 
and the external auditors the annual and interim statements. In this 
context, the Committee also reviews the written reports of KPMG 
Audit Plc on issues arising from the annual audit and the review of 
the interim results.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control. This responsibility includes clearly determining the 
control environment and reviewing annually the effectiveness of 
the internal control system. However, such a system can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors ‘Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’, the Board 
confi rms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signifi cant risks (both fi nancial and 
non-fi nancial and including Corporate Social Responsibility risks) 
faced by the Group (including Joint Ventures and overseas 
businesses). The process has been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts and is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Corporate Governance report
continued Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 45
Section 04 – Governance
Assurance over the design and operation of internal controls across 
the Group is provided through a combination of techniques.
>  Internal Audit carries out audits to assess the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls over the key risks faced by the 
business and reports its fi ndings to management, the Executive 
Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan is presented 
to and approved by the Audit Committee annually
>  recommendations to improve the system of control are made by 
Internal Audit. The implementation of these recommendations is 
followed up and reported on quarterly
>  Internal Audit independently reviews the risk identifi cation 
procedures and control processes implemented by management 
>  a process of Control Risk Self-Assessment is used in the Group 
where Directors and senior managers are required to detail and 
certify controls in operation to ensure the control environment in 
their business areas is appropriate. They also confi rm annually, in 
writing, that risk management processes and appropriate 
controls are in place and are operating effectively
>  Internal Audit advises on aspects of the design and application 
of internal controls in key business projects and on policy and 
procedure changes.
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. 
The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures and 
ensures that the level of confi dence required by the Board is 
obtained. It also ensures the fi nancial reporting process is credible 
and reliable. The Audit Committee presents its fi ndings to the 
Board regularly and the Head of Internal Audit has direct access to 
the Audit Committee members. 
Any signifi cant internal control issues would be disclosed in this 
report. On the basis of the assurances given in 2009, no disclosures 
in this respect are required.
Following a review in 2009, the decision was taken to outsource 
the internal audit function to Deloitte LLP. After a transition 
period, Deloitte LLP assumed full responsibility for internal 
audit in January 2010.
Risk management
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic risk 
issues across the Group, and for oversight of risk training. The 
Group Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out an 
independent appraisal of all projects before submission to the 
Major Projects Committee (see below). This appraisal ensures that 
the differentiating factors of the Group’s offer have been properly 
identifi ed so maximising the opportunities available; it also involves 
ensuring that all inherent and residual risks associated with the 
project have been properly identifi ed and considered.
In addition, the Risk Forum, a committee of professionals from 
each of the business groups, meets on a quarterly basis to assess 
the strategic risks facing the Carillion Group. The conclusions of the 
Risk Forum are reported to the Board.
Management is responsible for the identifi cation and evaluation 
of signifi cant risks applicable to its areas of business together 
with the design, operation and monitoring of suitable internal 
controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may 
be associated with a variety of internal or external sources, 
including control breakdowns, disruption in information systems, 
competition, corporate social responsibility, natural catastrophe 
and regulatory requirements. Management is also responsible for 
timely and accurate reporting of business performance and for 
ensuring compliance with the policies set by the Board in its 
areas of business. Regular performance review meetings are held 
where management reports to the Executive Directors on business 
performance, risk and internal control matters. The results of these 
meetings are presented to the Board.
The Major Projects Committee, a committee of the Board, acts 
as the sanctioning body for major commitments and transactions 
including capital expenditure, major contracts and company and 
business acquisitions and disposals. This committee has delegated 
authority up to specifi ed levels of risk as determined by a risk 
assessment matrix, beyond which Board approval is required.
In addition, practical guidance for all staff is maintained in Group 
policy and procedure documents regarding the authorisation levels 
for commitments, contract selectivity and bidding, the provision of 
guarantees and management accounting as well as reporting and 
resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. 
The Board has a policy to prosecute individuals found to have 
defrauded the Company or its subsidiaries. Learning points for 
management are identifi ed and action plans implemented to 
minimise the recurrence of fraud. 
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about 
malpractice at the earliest possible stage and a confi dential 
‘whistleblowing’ hotline provided by an independent third party 
is available.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on material changes in 
the business and the external environment that affect signifi cant 
risks. The Group Finance Director provides the Board with regular 
fi nancial information, which includes key performance indicators 
and a summary of risk. These key performance indicators and risks 
are listed in the Group Chief Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 19. 
Where areas for improvement are identifi ed, the Board considers 
the recommendations made both by the Executive Directors and 
by the Audit Committee. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 46
Governance
This report is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on the 
objectivity of the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG), in 
their reporting to shareholders.
The KPMG audit director is present at Audit Committee meetings 
to ensure full communication of matters relating to the audit.
The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually by the 
Audit Committee, taking into account the views of management, 
and feedback is provided to senior members of KPMG unrelated to 
the audit. This activity also forms part of KPMG’s own system of 
quality control. The Audit Committee also has discussions with the 
auditor, without management being present, on the adequacy of 
controls and on any judgmental areas. These discussions have 
proved satisfactory to date.
The scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in advance 
by the Audit Committee. Audit fees are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee after discussions between the businesses and the local 
KPMG offi ces and are then referred to the Board for approval. 
Rotation of audit director’s responsibilities within KPMG is required 
by their profession’s ethical standards. The current audit director 
responsible for the Carillion engagement is in his fi rst year of 
signing the report. There is also rotation of key members within 
the audit team. 
Assignments awarded to KPMG and its associates have been and 
are subject to controls by management that have been agreed by 
the Audit Committee so that audit independence is not 
compromised. In summary, the procedures are
>  audit related services: as auditor this is the main area of work of 
KPMG and its associates. If any additional accounting support is 
required then this is considered competitively
>  tax consulting: in cases where they are best suited, Carillion uses 
KPMG and its associates but the Group also uses other tax 
consultancies. Signifi cant pieces of tax work are evaluated 
competitively
>  general and systems consulting: all signifi cant consulting projects 
are subject to competitive tender.
Other than audit, the Group Finance Director is required to give 
prior approval of work carried out by KPMG and its associates, part 
of this review is to determine that other potential providers of the 
services have been adequately considered.
These controls provide the Audit Committee with adequate 
confi dence in the independence of KPMG in their reporting on the 
audit of the Group.
Health and safety and sustainability
A review of the Group’s progress on health and safety is provided 
in the Group Chief Executive’s review on page 17 and the Group’s 
Sustainability performance is contained in the Sustainability review 
on pages 30 to 33.

Section 04 – Governance
This report explains what we pay 
to the Directors of Carillion plc 
and why. It has been prepared 
on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee. It 
will be presented for approval at 
the Annual General Meeting on 
5 May 2010 and David Garman, 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, will be available 
to answer shareholders’ questions.
Remuneration Committee members and advisers
The Remuneration Committee consists exclusively of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, David Garman, David Maloney, Steve 
Mogford and Vanda Murray. Its terms of reference can be found 
on the Company’s website www.carillionplc.com. The Committee 
determines policy for remuneration of the Executive Directors of 
Carillion plc and key members of the senior management team. 
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in its work by Susan 
Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough, Group 
Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is consulted on the 
remuneration of those who report directly to him and also of 
other senior executives. No Executive Director or employee is 
present or takes part in discussions in respect of matters relating 
directly to their own remuneration. 
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses Deloitte LLP to 
provide salary survey and benchmarking information and external 
and internal contextual information and analysis as required. 
Deloitte LLP, which was appointed in 2005, also provides internal 
audit services and certain specialist consultancy services but 
otherwise has no other connections with the Group.
The Committee adopts the principles of good governance as set 
out in the Combined Code and complies with the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002. It met three times during the year and all 
members attended all meetings.
Remuneration philosophy
Carillion’s remuneration philosophy is that reward should be used 
to incentivise Executive Directors in a manner which is consistent 
with the Group’s objectives and
(i)   supports its strategic objective of attracting, developing and 
retaining excellent people and encouraging them to work in 
line with Carillion’s values
(ii)   aligns the interests of the Directors with those of shareholders 
and other stakeholders. As a result, a substantial proportion 
of Executive Directors’ remuneration is variable
(iii)  applies demanding performance conditions to deliver 
sustained profi table growth
(iv)  has due regard to actual and expected market conditions and
(v)   includes achieving high standards in respect of Carillion’s 
health and safety, environmental and social performance 
targets.
Remuneration and other benefi ts are reviewed annually with 
regard to competitive market practice and, where considered 
appropriate, are supported by external independent surveys.
Elements of remuneration
Basic salary
This is reviewed annually, taking account of individual experience 
and performance and by reference to information provided by 
independent sources. The Remuneration Committee has adopted 
a policy of setting basic salary within the market range of salaries 
for equivalent roles and expects to pay around the median when 
the individual has been performing in the role for a reasonable 
period of time.
Salary increases for Executive Directors in 2009 were two per cent 
refl ecting the economic climate and in 2010 will be zero, both in 
line with pay for other employees in both years.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan
The bonus plan is designed to drive and reward excellent 
operational performance, linking the interests of shareholder and 
participants by paying one half of the bonus in cash immediately 
and investing the other half in shares of the Company for a two 
year deferment period.

Long-term share incentives
These require and reward exceptional performance based on performance targets that are aligned to the interests of shareholders. 
Awards are made under the Carillion plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2006, known internally as the Leadership Equity Award Plan (‘LEAP’). 
Each Executive Director is required to hold shares acquired through LEAP until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their 
annual salary. ‘Good leavers’ during the performance period receive a pro-rata award at the normal release date provided the plan 
meets its performance requirements.
Carillion share incentives comply with the share dilution guidelines.
Pension benefi ts
Following the closure to future accrual of its defi ned benefi t pension schemes in April 2009, the Company offers competitive defi ned 
contribution pensions to all Executive Directors. Pensionable salary is limited by an internal cap and salary supplements are paid on 
earnings above the cap.
Other benefi ts
These include a car or car allowance by individual choice, and private healthcare.

2009 Bonus Plan
In 2009, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 100 per cent of their basic salary through the bonus plan comprising up 
to 25 per cent for personal objectives and 75 per cent for fi nancial objectives. Awards under the personal element are based on delivery 
against clear and stretching objectives closely aligned to the strategic aims of the Company. The fi nancial element is determined by 
outstanding performance against stretching targets based on growth in earnings per share. The 2009 plan limits the amount of any 
award that may be taken in cash to 50 per cent of the bonus earned overall. The balance is deferred into shares of the Company that are 
held in trust in the participant’s name and vest after two years. The number of shares allocated is determined by the price prevailing at 
the date of bonus award and by using this mechanism, the value individuals receive at the point of vesting is aligned to the value 
delivered to shareholders over the same period. The bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of 2009 are shown in the 
remuneration table on page 48 (half of these benefi ts being paid in cash in 2010 and the balance deferred to March 2012). Tax and 
national insurance is calculated on the deferred element based on the value of the shares at the vesting date and paid at that point.
Similar deferral mechanisms have operated in respect of earlier years and during 2009 the following deferred bonus shareholdings vested:
   Bonus year Number of shares
Richard Adam – Nil
Richard Howson 2007 9,882
David Hurcomb 2007 40,000
Don Kenny – Nil
John McDonough 2006 75,911
Roger Robinson 2006 47,857
The price prevailing on the above shares at the date of award was 406.0 pence (2007 bonus) and 382.5 pence (2006 bonus). At the 
vesting date the share price was 218.0 pence.
Pension benefi ts
In April 2009, the Company closed the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme to future accrual and the Executive Directors who were members of 
this scheme became deferred pensioners, their deferred benefi ts being based on pensionable salary and service at the date of closure. 
Future service accrual will be on a defi ned contribution basis and benefi ts will be delivered through the Carillion 2009 Pension Plan. 
This is a trust-based, contracted-in defi ned contribution plan set up for former members of the four closed defi ned benefi t schemes. 
Defi ned benefi t pensions accruing during the period to 5th April 2009 to Executive Directors in their capacity as Directors of Carillion plc

Executive Directors have no additional entitlement to 
compensation for loss of offi ce. Service contracts contain provision 
for early termination and in such cases, the Remuneration 
Committee will consider the specifi c circumstances together with 
the Company’s commitments under the individual’s contract and 
the requirement to mitigate. Mitigation is applied to reduce any 
compensation payable to departing directors.
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of 
service, but are generally appointed for fi xed terms of three years 
renewable for further terms of one to three years, if both parties 
agree. Steve Mogford, who will stand for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting on 5 May 2010, has a letter of appointment until 
4 September 2012 subject to re-appointment at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Long-term (share) incentives
The Leadership Equity Award Plan (‘LEAP’)
The LEAP is offered to key people in the Company to provide an 
opportunity to earn a potentially higher level of reward but only 
where there is commitment from those individuals and stretching 
performance targets are met.
In any fi nancial year, Executive Directors may receive an award 
under the LEAP over shares worth 150 per cent of their basic 
annual salary (excluding bonuses and benefi ts in kind), other senior 
executives may receive an award under the LEAP over shares 
worth up to 100 per cent of their basic annual salary. The extra 
50 per cent awarded to Executive Directors will only vest if 
exceptional performance is achieved. In exceptional circumstances 
a fi rst award of up to 200 per cent of salary can be made under 
the rules. Thereafter the maximum opportunity will be 150 per 
cent of basic salary.
Under the terms of the LEAP, awards of ordinary shares in the 
Company can be made for nil consideration.

when the external cap was removed. The Carillion cap commenced 
at the level of £110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 and rises in line 
with the published increases in HMRC’s Life Time Allowance up 
until 2010 in line with the table below.

All the Executive Directors will be subject to this cap on salary in 
respect of their pensionable pay. Bonus and other benefi ts received 
by Executive Directors do not count towards pensionable pay. 
In addition, a salary supplement of 33.6% is paid in respect of 
earnings over the internal cap in place of the contributions the 
Company would have made towards pension provision had the 
cap not been in place. Salary supplements are taxed at source. Carillion plc

All awards/options are subject to a minimum three-year performance period from the date of the award. The vesting of the shares is 
subject to the relevant participant remaining in employment and the achievement of specifi ed stretching performance conditions based 
on annual average growth in earnings per share above the Retail Price Index. ‘Good leavers’ during the performance period receive a 
pro-rata award at the normal release date provided the plan meets its performance requirements. The progression is linear between 
each of the target levels specifi ed. The requirements for current plans are as follows:
Growth in earnings per share:
Level 1 RPI + 3% pa  30% vests
Level 2 RPI + 7% pa  50% vests
Level 3 RPI + 12% pa  100% vests

Don Kenny exercised Executive Share Options on 14 September 2009. The market price of Carillion Shares on this date was 293 pence. 
The net asset value received by Don Kenny was therefore £344,676. Similarly, David Hurcomb exercised an Executive Share Option on 
25 November 2009 when the market price of Carillion shares was 300 pence. The net asset value received by David Hurcomb was £17 ,687.
The ESOS options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company’s shares on the three business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant. Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 (which 
carries certain tax advantages for UK employees) and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are exercisable normally between three 
and 10 years after the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition. For options granted from 2003 onwards, 
the following performance condition prevailed:
 Average compound annual earnings 
per share growth (before exceptional items)  Percentage of option
in excess of RPI over the three-year period following grant that becomes exercisable
Less than 4% 0%
4% 30%
Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% (straight-line basis)
10% or more 100%
Grants of options using this performance condition were made in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Carillion met the performance target such that 
80 per cent, 71 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively of the shares under option are now exercisable.
For options granted before 1 July 2003, the performance target required that the earnings per share of Carillion over a rolling three-year 
period must increase by a percentage not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period, expressed as a 
percentage, plus four percentage points per annum. All options granted pre-2003 are excercisable.
At 31 December 2009, Executive Share Options were outstanding over 1,408,032 shares (2008: 1,754,361 shares) under both schemes 
at exercise prices ranging from 129.5 pence to 210.7 pence.
The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence granted to John McDonough in March 2002 was made later in the 
year than had been specifi ed at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of 67.3 pence. Therefore, in 
order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 
67.3 pence per share (less tax) will be made when and if the option is exercised. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 53
Section 04 – Governance
Sharesave options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 
shares, in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares and in November 
2006 over 2,580,461 shares. At 31 December 2009, options over 
1,349,565 ordinary shares of 50 pence each were outstanding 
under the Sharesave Scheme (2008: 1,684,664 ordinary shares

There have been no changes to the interests of Executive Directors 
in share incentives and options in the period 1 January to 3 March

An employee benefi t trust was established to acquire shares in 
Carillion plc and hold them for the benefi t of participants 
(including Executive Directors) in the share incentive and share 
option schemes. During 2009, 1,400,000 shares were issued to 
the Trust. At 31 December 2009, the Trust held 362,909 Carillion

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report

the corporate and fi nancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of fi nancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Section 05 – Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements
1. Signifi cant accounting policies
Carillion plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled and 
incorporated in the United Kingdom (UK). The consolidated 
fi nancial statements of the Company for the year ended 
31 December 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest 
in jointly controlled entities. 
The consolidated fi nancial statements were authorised for 
issuance on 3 March 2010.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s fi nancial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted 
IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
fi nancial statements in accordance with UK GAAP. These are 
presented on pages 114 to 121.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the Group’s fi nancial statements. 
The fi nancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis 
based on the assessment made by the Directors as described in 
the Operating and fi nancial review on page 29.
The fi nancial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They 
are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following 
assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative fi nancial 
instruments, pension scheme assets and fi nancial instruments 
classifi ed as available-for-sale. 
The following relevant standards and interpretations have been 
adopted in 2009 as they are mandatory for the year ended 
31 December 2009:
>  Amendments to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 
‘Presentation of fi nancial statements – A revised presentation’
>  Revised International Accounting Standard 23 ‘Borrowing costs’
>  International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8 – 
‘Operating segments’ 
>  International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) 14 ‘The limit on a defi ned benefi t asset, minimum 
funding requirements and their interaction’
>  Amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard 2 
‘Share-based payment – vesting conditions and cancellations’
>  Amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard 7 
‘Improving disclosures about fi nancial instruments’.
IAS 1 ’Presentation of fi nancial statements – A revised 
presentation’ requires the presentation of a consolidated statement 
of changes in equity as a primary statement rather than as a note. 
Since the changes are presentational only, there is no impact on 
profi t, earnings per share or net assets.
Revised IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’ requires the Group to capitalise 
borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the 
cost of the asset. Previously, Group subsidiaries immediately 
recognised all borrowing costs as an expense. Revised IAS 23 
has been applied prospectively from 1 January 2009 and has 
no material impact on profi t, earnings per share or net assets in 
the year ended 31 December 2009.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ requires operating segments to be 
identifi ed on the basis of information that internally is provided 
to the Group Chief Executive, who is the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker. Following the adoption of IFRS 8, Middle East 
construction services has been classifi ed as a separate operating 
segment, whereas previously it was a component of the 
Construction services segment. In addition, IFRS 8 requires the 
Group to disclose on a segmental basis the revenue that is derived 
from individual customers that amounts to 10 per cent or more 
of Group revenue. Since the changes are presentational only, 
there is no impact on profi t, earnings per share or net assets.
IFRIC 14 ‘The limit on a defi ned benefi t asset, minimum funding 
requirements and their interaction’ limits the amount of defi ned 
benefi t pension assets which can be recognised on certain 
schemes where the Group does not have an unconditional right 
to the refund of any surplus which may exist. This results in the 
derecognition of any surplus and the recognition of a liability for 
defi cit funding arrangements. Comparative information has been 
restated for the effect of the retrospective application of IFRIC 14, 
the impact of which has been to reduce net assets at 1 January 
2009 by £5.0m (see note 33). The adoption of IFRIC 14 has no 
impact on profi t or earnings per share. 
 
The adoption of Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment –
vesting conditions and cancellations’ and Amendments to IFRS 7 
‘Improving disclosures about fi nancial instruments’ in the current 
year has had no impact on the fi nancial statements. 
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards 
under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are 
mandatory for the year ending 31 December 2009, have been 
adopted in 2009. None of these amendments have had a material 
impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 62
1. Signifi cant accounting policies (continued)
The following standards and interpretations are effective for the 
year ended 31 December 2010: 
 
>  International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and 
separate fi nancial statements (revised 2008)’ 
>  International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 12 
‘Service concession arrangements’ 
>  Revised International Financial Reporting Standard 3 ‘Business 
combinations’ 
>  International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 15 
‘Construction of Real Estate’ 
>  International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 16 
‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’.
 
The Group has considered the impact of these new standards 
and interpretations in future periods on profi t, earnings per 
share and net assets. The only impact of the above is in relation 
to International Financial Reporting Committee 12, which is 
expected to reduce net assets at 1 January 2010 by £9.2 million. 
The Group has chosen not to early adopt any of the above 
standards and interpretations. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries 
The consolidated fi nancial statements comprise the fi nancial 
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the 
Company drawn up to 31 December 2009. Control exists when 
the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the fi nancial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefi ts 
from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
fi nancial statements from the date that control transfers to the 
Group until the date that control ceases. The fi nancial statements 
of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated 
fi nancial statements are prepared for the same reporting year 
as the parent Company. 
 
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. 
 
(b) Joint ventures 
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group 
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method. Under this method the 
Group’s share of the profi ts less losses of jointly controlled entities 
is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest 
in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated 
balance sheet. Where the share of losses exceeds the interest in 
the entity the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of 
further losses is discontinued. Interest in the entity is the carrying 
amount of the investment together with any long term interests 
that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the entity. 
 
Financial statements of jointly controlled entities are prepared for 
the same reporting period as the Group except for: 
 
> Carillion Enterprise Ltd 
> Modern Housing Solutions (Prime) Ltd 
 
Both of these entities have 31 March year ends, and their results are 
included in the Group accounts based on management accounts. 
 
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, 
that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and 
expenses it incurs and its share of the income. Such arrangements 
are reported in the consolidated fi nancial statements on the 
same basis. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 
2004 represents the difference between the fair value of the cost 
of acquisition and the fair value of the identifi able assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity. Consideration 
includes the attributable costs of the acquisition. In respect of 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is included on the 
basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded 
under previous Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated 
balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised 
separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of jointly controlled entities is 
included within the carrying value of the investment. Negative 
goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is based on the 
useful economic lives of the assets concerned, which are principally

1. Signifi cant accounting policies (continued)
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefi t 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the 
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
Impairment
Assets that have an indefi nite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Assets subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed 
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement based on the amount by 
which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specifi c to the asset. 
 
Other non-current asset investments 
Other non-current asset investments are classifi ed as available 
for sale fi nancial assets and are recognised at fair value. Changes 
in fair value in the year are recognised directly in the statement 
of comprehensive income. Dividend income from investments is 
recognised in the income statement when the right to receive 
payment is established. 
 
Construction contracts 
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference 
to the degree of completion of each contract, as measured by the 
proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the estimated 
total cost of the contract. 
 
Insurance claims, incentive payments and variations arising from 
construction contracts are included where they have been agreed 
with the client. 
 
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract 
costs incurred where it is probable those costs will be recoverable. 
 
The principal estimation technique used by the Group in 
attributing profi t on contracts to a particular period is the 
preparation of forecasts on a contract by contract basis. 
These focus on revenues and costs to complete and enable an 
assessment to be made of the fi nal out-turn of each contract. 
Consistent contract review procedures are in place in respect of 
contract forecasting. 
 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately. 
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which 
they are incurred. 
 
Where costs incurred plus recognised profi ts less recognised 
losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due from 
customers on construction contracts within trade and other 
receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus 
recognised profi ts less recognised losses, the balance is shown 
as due to customers on construction contracts within trade and 
other payables. 
 
Pre-contract costs 
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is 
appointed preferred bidder or formal notifi cation of intention to 
appoint is received. Provided the contract is expected to generate 
suffi cient net cash infl ows to enable recovery and the award 
of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs incurred post the 
appointment as preferred bidder are included in amounts owed 
by customers on construction contracts. 
 
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at fi nancial close, 
the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in 
amounts owed by customers on construction contracts. Any 
excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and 
released to profi t over the period of the contract.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, 
excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external 
customers. It also includes the Group’s proportion of work 
carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year. 
Revenue from service contracts is recognised by reference to 
services performed to date as a percentage of total services 
to be performed. Revenue from construction contracts is 
recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
on construction contracts.

Property, plant and equipment 
Depreciation is based on historical cost, less the estimated residual 
values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their 
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: 
 
Freehold buildings 40-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements  Period of lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles  Three-ten years
 
Assets held under fi nance leases are depreciated over the shorter 
of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset. 
 
Leasing 
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
 
Assets held under fi nance leases are included in property, plant 
and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of acquisition 
or present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital 
element of outstanding fi nance leases is included in fi nancial 
liabilities. The fi nance charge element of rentals is charged to the 
income statement at a constant periodic rate of charge on the 
outstanding obligations. 
 
Inventories 
Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development and 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
calculated using the weighted average method. 
 
Taxation 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years. 
 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for fi nancial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will 
be realised. 
 
Foreign currencies 
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the 
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are 
included in the income statement. 
 
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Income statements and cash fl ows of overseas 
entities are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the 
foreign exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Gains or 
losses arising from the consolidation of overseas entities are 
recognised in the translation reserve. 
 
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved 
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign 
currencies. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion 
of the hedges are recognised in equity and ineffective portions 
are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
 
Employee benefi ts 
(a) Retirement benefi t obligations 
For defi ned contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, 
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they 
fall due. 
 
For defi ned benefi t pension schemes, the IAS 19 cost of providing 
benefi ts is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The charge to the income statement 
refl ects the current service cost of such obligations, and where 
applicable, past service cost. 
 
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost of scheme 
liabilities are included within fi nancial income and expenses in the 
income statement. 
  Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 65
Section 05 – Financial statements
1. Signifi cant accounting policies (continued)
The retirement benefi t obligation recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the excess of the present value of the scheme liabilities 
over the fair value of scheme assets. When the calculation results 
in an asset to the Group, the amount recognised is limited on 
certain schemes where the Group does not have an unconditional 
right to refund of any surplus which may exist. Differences 
between the actual and expected returns on assets and experience 
gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities during the year, 
together with differences arising from changes in assumptions, are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year. 
 
The Group’s contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance 
with the scheme rules and the recommendations of the actuary.
(b) Other post-retirement benefi t obligations
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare 
benefi ts to their employees. The expected costs of providing these 
benefi ts are accrued over the period of employment and are 
calculated by independent actuaries based on the present value of 
the expected liability.
(c) Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled to 
participate in the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP). In addition, 
UK employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair value of the LEAP and Sharesave schemes at the date of 
grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. For 
both schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an 
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs 
qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the 
income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled 
entities relating to the construction of assets in Public Private 
Partnership projects are capitalised until the relevant assets are 
brought into operational use.
Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the 
effective interest method.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental 
issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from 
the retained earnings reserve. Where such shares subsequently 
vest in the employees under the terms of the Group’s share option 
schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in the 
retained earnings reserve.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and where it is probable that an outfl ow will be required to 
settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has an 
approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or been 
announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal 
fi nancial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows: 
 
(a) Other non-current investments 
Other non-current investments relate to unquoted equity interests 
that are not designated on initial recognition as at fair value 
through the income statement. Instead, they are recognised 
at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the fair 
value reserve.
 
(b) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then 
are stated at amortised cost. 
 
(c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at 
amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash fl ow statement, cash 
and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including 
bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are also included as they are an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management. 
 
(d) Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are 
stated at amortised cost.

Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements
continued
1. Signifi cant accounting policies (continued)
(e) Bank and other borrowings 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are recognised at amortised cost less attributable transaction costs. 
All borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption value 
recognised in the income statement over the period to redemption.
 
(f) Derivative fi nancial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured in future periods at 
their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument. 
 
A number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk. 
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged items will affect profi t or loss. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay 
to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date. 
 
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. 
In cases where these derivative instruments are signifi cant, hedge accounting is applied as described above. Where hedge accounting 
is not applied, movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the 
balance sheet date. 
 
Net borrowing 
Net borrowing comprises cash and cash equivalents together with bank overdrafts and loans, fi nance leases and other loans.
2. Segmental reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s strategic operating segments. The operating segment reporting format 
refl ects the differing economic characteristics and nature of the services provided by the Group and is the basis on which strategic 
operating decisions are made by the Group Chief Executive.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well 
as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Operating segments
The Group is comprised of the following main operating segments:
Support services
In this segment we report the results of our facilities management, facilities services, road maintenance, rail services, utility services and 
consultancy businesses.
Public Private Partnership projects
In this segment we report the equity returns on our investments in Public Private Partnership projects in our chosen sectors of Defence, 
Health, Education, Transport, Secure and other Government accommodation.
Middle East construction services
In this segment we report the results of our building and civil engineering activities in the Middle East and North Africa.
Construction services (excluding the Middle East)

As part of the Group’s strategy for managing defi ned benefi t pension scheme risk, the benefi ts for members of the Alfred McAlpine 
Pension Plan will no longer be linked to fi nal salary with effect from 31 December 2009 resulting in a curtailment gain of £0.1 million 
(net of expenses of £3.2 million). Following the completion of a consultation process on the closure to future accrual of four defi ned benefi t 
schemes in December 2008, a curtailment gain of £35.5 million (net of expenses of £2.8 million) was recognised in 2008. There is no 
deferred tax relating to curtailment gains in 2009 (2008: £9.9 million).
Rationalisation costs of £9.9 million relate to non-recurring redundancy and other associated costs incurred in the rationalisation of the 
Group’s structure at the end of 2009, including ensuring that the size of the Group’s UK construction capability refl ects the expected 
decline in our general construction markets, while maintaining the capability to support the delivery of Public Private Partnership projects 
and meet the needs of the support services business.
The Offi ce of Fair Trading (OFT) penalty of £5.4 million was imposed on Carillion JM Limited (CJM) (formerly Mowlem) following the 
conclusion of the OFT’s investigation of cover pricing in the construction industry (under the Competition Act 1998). The penalty relates 
to CJM’s construction business and relates entirely to the period prior to CJM’s acquisition by Carillion. No other member of the Group 
was subject to the investigation.
Alfred McAlpine and Vanbots Group integration and reorganisation costs in 2008 primarily relate to redundancy and property exit costs 
arising from a review of the Group’s requirements following the acquisition of these businesses in 2008. 
An income tax credit of £2.8 million (2008: £16.5 million) relating to the above has been included within taxation in the 
income statement.

The curtailment gain of £38.3 million in 2008 arose following the closure of a number of defi ned benefi t pension schemes to future

The introduction of the foreign profi ts exemption with effect from 1 July 2009 has had a twofold impact on the current year tax charge. 
Firstly, current year profi ts earned in low tax jurisdictions no longer require the provision of a taxable temporary adjustment, the impact 
of which is included within ’Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions’. Secondly, it has allowed the release of the liability that was 
associated with the taxable temporary differences that arose on the historical unremitted earnings from investments overseas. 
The amount over provided in prior years of £0.2 million includes £Nil (2008: £8.3 million) attributable to the agreement of certain issues 
with the tax authorities and the release of a taxable timing difference associated with an investment in an overseas subsidiary.

(1)   Upon the adoption of IFRIC 14 on 1 January 2009, goodwill arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 has been restated. This has resulted in an increase of £9.4 million in the 
goodwill arising on acquisition refl ecting the recognition of defi cit funding obligations in relation to defi ned benefi t pension arrangements.
Goodwill of £633.5 million and customer contracts and lists of £127.8 million arose in 2008 on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and 
the Vanbots Group as disclosed in note 30. The goodwill recognised on these acquisitions represents the present value of future income 
streams expected to be generated from margin growth in the businesses acquired together with identifi able cost savings within the 
enlarged Group.  Carillion plc

(1) Restated on adoption of IFRIC 14 (see note 33)
Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of 
goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units. In the absence of any identifi ed impairment risks, tests are performed based on 
internal valuations of each cash generating unit (CGU). 
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services, Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East), and Head offi ce as distinct reporting segments. Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash 
generating units (CGUs), within the Construction services and Support services reporting segments detailed above. Our CGUs have 
been identifi ed within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash infl ows largely independently of other businesses 
within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The value in use in 2009 was determined on a 
similar basis to 2008. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and 
expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period. These assumptions were reviewed in 2008 and revisited in 2009 in the 
light of the challenging economic environment which resulted in more conservative estimates about the future. The impact of the global 
economic downturn on the fi nancial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous 
selectivity criteria in relation to their fi nancial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that refl ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specifi c to the CGUs. Whilst the Group has fi ve CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services are consistent, 
and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU. Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services 
CGUs are consistent so one discount rate has been applied to each CGU. In determining the discount rate management have sought 
to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity 
and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt. In calculating the cost of equity a range of market 
risk premiums were used with a Beta value of 0.74 (2008: 0.9). A market premium of 9.0 per cent (2008: 9.0 per cent) was used to 
calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 12.4 per cent (2008: 13 per cent) for the CGUs in the Construction services (excluding the Middle 
East) segment. A market premium of 5.8 per cent (2008: 5.1 per cent) was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 9.5 per cent 
(2008: 9.0 per cent) for the CGUs in the Support services segment. The annual growth rates are based on internal assessments with no 
growth anticipated for the Construction services segment and Infrastructure services CGU and growth expected in the Business services 
CGU at 5.0 per cent for the next 5 years, 2.5 per cent growth for years six to ten which refl ects expected changes to the Retail Price 
Index and no growth thereafter.  Carillion plc

Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements
continued
12. Intangible assets (continued)
The Group prepares cash fl ow forecasts derived from the most recent fi nancial budgets approved by management for the following 
year and extrapolates cash fl ows based upon the growth rates indicated above. These growth rates do not exceed the long term 
industry average and refl ect the synergies from recent acquisitions. The impairment tests at 31 December 2009 show that for all CGUs 
the number of years required to recover the carrying value is below 11 years. Management consider that these pay back periods are not 
excessive given the long term strategic benefi t of all the acquisitions and in particular the acquisition of Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. 
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows an increase of 1.0 per cent does not increase the number years to recover the carrying 
amount over 12 years for any of the CGUs. Sensitivity analysis on the Business services growth rate shows that with no growth the 
number of years required to recover the carrying value increases to 15 years.
As at 31 December 2009, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash 
generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge of £33.0 million (2008: £44.2 million) is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement. 
Amortisation of the intangible asset of £119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 
2016. The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years. Amortisation of the intangible asset of £125.4 million 
arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge 
continuing until 2019.

Tax losses       81.0 71.0
The tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses due to 
the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years taxable profi ts of the companies concerned.
Following the introduction of the foreign profi ts exemption with effect from 1 July 2009, no deferred tax liability is required to be

24. Reserves 
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the fi nancial statements of foreign 
operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. The translation 
reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash fl ow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is 
derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999. The reserve increased on acquisition of Mowlem on 
23 February 2006 and Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares. 
The Group has opted to credit the merger reserve rather than the share premium account as permitted by The Companies Act. 
The £29.7 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised 
on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions. Carillion plc

Retained earnings
Retained earnings include the reserve for the Company’s own shares which comprises of the cost of the Company’s shares held by the 
Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the 
Group’s share incentive schemes. The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows:

At 31 December 2009, the ESOP held 362,909 (2008: 419,827) of the Company’s shares and had a market value of £1.1 million 
(2008: £1.0 million). During the year the Company acquired 1.4 million of its own shares for £4.2 million to meet the plan’s future 
commitments. The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘Quest’). During the year, 
91,376 ordinary shares (2008: 210,859) in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the 
exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme. 
At 31 December 2009 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 134,683 (2008: 8,904) and had a market value of 
£409,167 (2008: £22,100). The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
25. Share-based payments
The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the 
Company. Full details of share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 53.
The recognition and measurement principles in International Financial Reporting Standard 2 ‘Share-based payment’ (IFRS 2) have not 
been applied to grants of options before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in International Financial 
Reporting Standard 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ and IFRS 2. Carillion plc

Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed 
primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s fi nancial risk management 
policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on fi nancial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal fi nancial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board 
of Directors. Treasury is not a profi t centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 93
Section 05 – Financial statements
27. Financial instruments (continued)
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East, Canada and the Caribbean. In order to protect the 
Group’s balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 
£10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value. Net investment hedging of overseas 
operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency 
which the relevant currency closely follows. 
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions 
immediately in the income statement.
Profi ts arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are then treated 
as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. Any individual exposures that are 
signifi cant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques. 
Foreign currency exposure         
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows:
        2009 2008
        £m £m
United States of America Dollar       (15.6) (17.6)

United Arab Emirates Dirham       (7.6) (8.5)
Other       (0.5) (1.5)
        (115.3) (109.8)
Of the total foreign currency borrowing of £115.3 million (2008: £109.8 million), the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas 
currency net assets amounts to £61.6 million (2008: £62.6 million). The foreign exchange gain of £1.0 million (2008: loss of £8.9 million) 
on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve. 
The Group does not have a signifi cant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of fi nancial assets.

27. Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowing that arose from the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred 
McAlpine in 2008, ongoing working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of 
overseas operations. Such borrowing is subject to fl oating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate. No interest rate 
hedging is currently undertaken by the Group’s subsidiaries. However, a number of the Group’s Public Private Partnership jointly 
controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in respect of US dollar denominated borrowing interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge 
by approximately £0.3 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowing an increase of £0.7 million, in respect of sterling 
denominated borrowing an increase of £3.1 million and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowing an increase 
of £0.4 million.
     
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that suffi cient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the 
need to carry signifi cant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core 
relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities 
available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels. The average net borrowing during 
2009 was £274.4 million (2008: £329.8 million for the period post the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine).

Credit risk
Credit risk arises on fi nancial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging contracts. 
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency 
hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating 
agencies. Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at 
main board level or within predetermined limits. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each 
fi nancial asset.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management
following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. The 
ageing of trade receivables is as follows:

In the current global economic climate, whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased, on balance the Group believes 
that debtors will meet their payment obligation in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are 
past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2009.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a signifi cant amount of credit risk. Carillion plc

The movement in fair value of forward foreign currency contracts has been recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s Public Private Partnership (PPP) jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate 
derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk. Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP 
jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group. The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge 
future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035. The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in 
active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash fl ow hedges 
within jointly controlled entities in the statement of comprehensive income. At 31 December 2009 the Group’s share of the total net 
fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to £31.6 million (2008: £43.7 million) of which 
£23.9 million (2008: £26.1 million) (and the related deferred tax asset of £6.7 million (2008: £7.3 million)) has been recognised in the 
hedging reserve.
Fair values
Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-current asset other investments and derivative fi nancial 
instruments. The fair value of non-current asset other investments is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation 
techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data. Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash 
fl ows using asset specifi c discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available 
for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income. The fair value of derivative fi nancial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation 
method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
The movement in fair value of non-current asset other investments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below:

Fair value adjustments        –
At 31 December 2009        43.8
The fair value of non-current investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used. A one percentage point increase in 
the discount rate would reduce the fair value by £5.3 million.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends 
paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business. 
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or process during the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.

(1)  Upon the adoption of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 14 on 1 January 2009, the carrying amounts in relation to retirement benefi t liabilities and deferred 
tax assets have been restated. This has resulted in an increase in the carrying amount adjustments to retirement benefi t liabilities and deferred tax assets of £13.1 million and £3.7 million 
respectively, refl ecting the recognition of defi cit funding obligations in relation to defi ned benefi t pension arrangements, together with the associated deferred tax asset. The overall impact 
of IFRIC 14 has been to increase goodwill recognised on acquisition by £9.4 million.
There are two types of adjustments which have been refl ected in the above; (a) those which have been made to Alfred McAlpine’s initial 
carrying amounts for events up to the acquisition date and (b) those which have been made to the acquired assets and liabilities of 
Alfred McAlpine. The allocation of these adjustments between these two categories involves a degree of judgement and both 
categories should therefore be considered when reviewing the Alfred McAlpine balance sheet. 
The determination of the carrying amount adjustments by Alfred McAlpine included in (a) followed a dialogue between Alfred 
McAlpine’s and Carillion’s management teams during the course of the due diligence period granted to Carillion by Alfred McAlpine. 
Both types of adjustments are discussed further below.
(a) Carrying amount adjustments 
The £46.8 million carrying amount of net assets acquired at 12 February 2008 (restated for the impact of IFRIC 14 as set out above) 
incorporates a number of adjustments made to Alfred McAlpine’s initial carrying amounts. These adjustments followed a rigorous 
review of all balance sheet categories, including over 400 contracts, and include the following items, which are stated net of deferred 
tax where appropriate:
A reduction in the capitalised value of IT assets of £45.3 million which followed an impairment review of all IT capitalised intangible assets. 
A £101.2 million reduction in the carrying amount of contracts which comprised a £53.8 million reduction in the carrying amount of 
completed contracts, with a view to facilitating a swift resolution of all outstanding matters, including cash settlements pertaining to 
these contracts and a £47.4 million reduction in the carrying amount of ongoing contracts. A deferred tax asset of £25.0 million was 
recognised in relation to these reductions in carrying amounts. 
The increase in retirement benefi t liabilities of £29.0 million (restated for the impact of IFRIC 14 as set out above) refl ected changes in 
general market assumptions in respect of the rate of increase in salaries, the rate of increase in pensions, the infl ation rate and the 
discount rate. In addition to this an associated deferred tax asset of £8.1 million was also recognised.  Carillion plc

30. Acquisitions and disposals (continued)
(b) Fair value adjustments 
The principal fair value adjustment relates to £184.5 million of goodwill on the Alfred McAlpine balance sheet at the date of acquisition 
which is reclassifi ed at the same value as goodwill on Carillion’s balance sheet under the requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards.
The £15.5 million accounting policy adjustment results from applying Carillion’s policy in respect of expensing rather than capitalising 
certain mobilisation costs associated with the commencement of new contracts.
The £90.3 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts.
Total consideration for the acquisition comprises the following:
         £m
Equity shares issued        381.5
Cash        171.7
Loan notes issued        1.3

Attributable costs        10.4
Total consideration        564.9
Attributable costs include direct adviser costs incurred in relation to the acquisition contracts and due diligence procedures.
On 8 October 2008, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of the Vanbots Group for a total consideration of £18.4 million. 
The Vanbots Group operates primarily as a construction management services group in Canada.

The principal fair value adjustments relate to a £1.8 million market value adjustment to the carrying value of an investment that was sold 
post acquisition and a £1.5 million provision against contract balances.
The accounting policy adjustment of £1.3 million relates to the alignment of profi t recognition policies on construction contracts.
The £1.6 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition of £9.1 million represents the present value of future income streams expected to be generated 
from margin growth in the Vanbots Group together with identifi able cost savings within the enlarged Group. Carillion plc

acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008, Group revenue would have been £4,681.4 million and profi t before tax would have been 
£113.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Disposals in 2009
On 30 June 2009, the Group disposed of the entire issued share capital of Carillion IT Services Limited for total cash consideration of

During 2009, the Group disposed of equity investments in four Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities. The disposals 
generated cash consideration of £100.4 million (after deducting disposal costs of £0.3 million) and a non-operating profi t of £1.2 million.
Disposals in 2008
During 2008, the Group disposed of equity investments in six Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities. The disposals 
generated cash consideration of £59.9 million (after deducting disposal costs of £0.1 million) and a non-operating profi t of £35.6 million.
In February and March 2008, the Group received £25.9 million of cash consideration relating to the disposal of three Public Private 
Partnership jointly controlled entities announced by Alfred McAlpine prior to acquisition. These disposals do not generate any profi t 
in the post acquisition period as the investments were included at fair value in the acquired balance sheet of Alfred McAlpine.
31. Retirement benefi t obligations
Carillion operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below:
Principal defi ned benefi t schemes
Carillion Staff and ‘B’ Pension Schemes
Both schemes are defi ned benefi t schemes and were closed to new entrants on 1 April 2003. Existing members no longer accrue 
benefi ts for future service with effect from 5 April 2009 but instead are eligible to participate in the Carillion 2009 Pension Plan, which 
is a defi ned contibution scheme.
An actuarial valuation of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2005 
using the projected unit credit method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date were £485.0 million and £106.4 million 
respectively, which represented approximately 90 per cent and 94 per cent of the benefi ts that had accrued to members at that date 
on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. An actuarial valuation of the schemes by the Trustees’ independent 
actuaries as at 31 December 2008 is currently being undertaken.
The regular ongoing contributions paid to 5 April 2009 were £2.4 million (2008: £9.9 million) in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension 
Scheme and £0.2 million (2008: £0.9 million) in respect of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme. Regular ongoing contributions are no longer 
payable following the closure of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes to future accrual on 5 April 2009.
As part of the defi cit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes, payments were made to the schemes during 
2009 of £2.6 million and £0.3 million respectively (2008: £16.0 million and £2.0 million respectively). Recovery payments of £2.6 million 
and £0.3 million to the Staff and ‘B’ schemes respectively are scheduled to be made in 2010. 
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the above. The PPF levies for the year ended 31 March 2009 were 
£1.0 million (2008: £1.0 million) for the Staff scheme and £16,000 (2008: £14,000) for the ‘B’ scheme. Carillion plc

The Mowlem Staff Pension and Life Assurance scheme was part of Mowlem, which was acquired on 23 February 2006.

IAS 19 disclosures
The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualifi ed actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were:
 31 December 2009 31 December 2008
      UK Canada UK Canada
Rate of increase in salaries     4.40% 3.00% 3.80% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions*     3.40% 2.00% 2.80% 2.04%
Infl ation rate      3.40% 2.00% 2.80% 2.04%
Discount rate     5.80% 6.25% 6.30% 7.50%
* Where schemes have adopted the 2.5% per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment the assumption is 2.4% per annum (2.2% p.a. in 2008) rather than the higher amount shown above.
The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to signifi cant change 
before they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA 
corporate bonds. The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation. All the schemes, except 
the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary. 
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specifi c assumptions based on industry experience.
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme, the Mowlem (1993) Scheme and the
Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan adopted the ‘PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 years’ table for non-retired member’s mortality and the 
‘PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 years’ for retired member’s mortality at the last valuation. The previous bases were ‘PA92(Base) – 3 years’ 
and ‘PA92(Base) – 1 year’ respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
 2009 2008

31. Retirement benefi t obligations (continued)
The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefi ts 
under the local GAAP, CICA 3461. The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental infl ation rates in relation to 
the Post Retirement Benefi t Plan. The immediate trend rate is eight per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of fi ve per cent per 
annum (2013). An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by £0.8 million and the total service cost 
by £0.1 million. A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by £0.6 million and total service cost by 
£0.1 million. The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts 
or Treasury stock and the Actuary’s recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Comprehensive Income as 
permitted under IAS 19.
Following the adoption of IFRIC 14 ‘The limit on a defi ned benefi t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction’ on 
1 January 2009, comparative information for 2008 has been restated accordingly.

The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group statement of comprehensive income is 
£236.5 million (2008 restated: £16.5 million). The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme defi cit recognised 
on transition to IFRS of £85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the 
schemes. Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in 
the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.
32. Accounting estimates and judgements
Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting 
policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
signifi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fi nancial year, are 
discussed below:
Construction contracts
In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in 
relation to fi nal out-turn on each contract. On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome 
cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable. Once the outcome can 
be estimated reliably the estimates of fi nal out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specifi c risks 
within each contract that have been identifi ed during the early stages of the contract. The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular 
basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate. However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they 
often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project. Management 
continually reviews the estimated fi nal out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 111
Section 05 – Financial statements
32. Accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Intangible assets
In determining the fair value of identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in 
relation to fi nal out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash fl ows and profi tability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash fl ows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached. Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defi ned benefi t pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defi ned benefi t pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. 
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group;
> expected return on plan assets
> infl ation rate
> mortality
> discount rate
> salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
33. New accounting standards and interpretations
Upon the adoption of IFRIC 14 on 1 January 2009, the Group has restated prior year information, which has had the following impact 
on net assets:
       At  At
       31 December  1 January
       2008  2008
       £m  £m 
Net assets as previously reported      872.6  502.9
Impact of adoption of IFRIC 14 on – goodwill    9.4  –
  – retirement benefi ts    (20.0)  (21.6)
  – deferred tax    5.6  6.0 
       (5.0)  (15.6)
Net assets as restated      867.6  487.3
The impact on goodwill of £9.4 million relates to the effect of IFRIC 14 on retirement benefi t liabilities (net of deferred tax) at the date 
of acquisition of Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 refl ecting the recognition of minimum funding arrangements. In addition to the 
above, IFRIC 14 reduced actuarial losses and taxation in the 2008 consolidated statement of comprehensive income by £14.7 million and 
£4.1 million respectively.
In 2009, IFRIC 14 reduced actuarial losses and taxation in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by £13.3 million and 
£3.7 million respectively, leading to an increase in net assets of £9.6 million.
The adoption of IFRIC 14 has no impact on reported profi t or cash fl ow. None of the other new accounting standards adopted on 
1 January 2009 as referred to in note 1 has any impact upon reported profi t, net assets or cash fl ows. Carillion plc

34. Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Group’s principal activities that are not required to 
be included on the Group balance sheet. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows:
> operating leases (see note 28) 
> pledged assets securing fi nance lease liabilities (see note 11) 
>  contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance contracts in PPP jointly controlled entities 
(see note 26) 
> capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt investments in PPP jointly controlled entities (see note 28) 
> outsourcing contracts.
In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-offi ce 
functions with a third party provider. These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated 
with these arrangements will not have a material impact on the fi nancial position of the Group.

Notes to the Company fi nancial statements
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal fi nancial assets and liabilities are cash at 
bank and in hand and borrowings. Cash at bank and in hand is 
carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Borrowings are 
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs 
and subsequently at amortised cost. In addition, the Company 
enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and 
infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. The forward 
contracts are measured initially at fair value, with changes in fair 
value during the year recognised in the profi t and loss account. 
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance
sheet date.
Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled to 
participate in the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP). In addition, 
UK employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair value of the LEAP and Sharesave schemes at the date of 
grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. For 
both schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the period in which any performance 
conditions are fulfi lled, ending on the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the 
employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual fi nancial 
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries 
equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge 
recognised in its consolidated fi nancial statements with the 
corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. Amounts 
recharged to the subsidary are recognised as a reduction in the 
cost of the investment in subsidiary. If the amount recharged 
exceeds the increase in the cost of investment the excess is 
recognised as a dividend to the extent that it refl ects post 
acquisition profi ts of the subsidiary.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into fi nancial guarantee contracts to 
guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary companies, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for 
them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the Company will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee. 
1. Signifi cant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s fi nancial statements.
Basis of preparation
The fi nancial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They are 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative fi nancial 
instruments which are stated at fair value, and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and law.
Taxation
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences 
between the recognition of gains and losses in the fi nancial 
statements and their recognition in the tax computation that 
have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except 
as otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’. Liabilities are 
calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are 
calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments
In the Company’s fi nancial statements, investments in subsidiary 
undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision 
for any impairment.
Leasing
The Company enters into fi nance lease arrangements on behalf 
of subsidiary companies. As permitted by SSAP 21 ‘Accounting 
for leases and hire purchase contracts’, the assets relating to the 
fi nance leases are included in the fi nancial statements of the 
subsidiaries concerned. The capital element of outstanding 
fi nance leases is included within borrowings. The fi nance charge 
element of rentals is charged to the profi t and loss account at a 
constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations. 
Own shares
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted 
from the profi t and loss account reserve. Where such shares 
subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the 
Company’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration 
received is included in the profi t and loss account reserve.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling and recorded using the exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and the 
gains and losses on translation are included in the profi t and 
loss account. Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 116
1. Signifi cant accounting policies (continued)
Retirement benefi t obligations
Pension costs are recognised in the fi nancial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefi ts’. Employees 
of the Company participate in the Carillion Staff and ‘B’ schemes which provide pensions on a defi ned benefi t basis. The assets and 
liabilities of these schemes relating to the Company cannot be readily ascertained on a reasonable and consistent basis as the schemes 
are operated for the benefi t of the Carillion Group as a whole. Consequently, the Company accounts for these schemes as if they were 
defi ned contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed in note 31 of the consolidated fi nancial statements.
Cash fl ow statement
A cash fl ow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash fl ow statements’.
2. Profi t for the year and dividends
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profi t and loss account for the year. 
Carillion plc reported a profi t for the fi nancial year ended 31 December 2009 of £167.5 million (2008: £62.5 million).
Fees paid to KPMG Audit Plc and its associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts 
of Carillion plc because the Company’s consolidated accounts are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
A fi nal dividend, declared in the previous year, of 8.9 pence per share was paid during the year, amounting to £35.2 million 
(2008: £29.6 million).
An interim dividend of 4.6 pence per share was paid during the year, amounting to £18.2 million (2008: £16.2 million).
A fi nal dividend of 10.0 pence (2008: 8.9 pence) per share, amounting to £39.7 million (2008: £35.2 million), was approved by the 
Board on 3 March 2010 and, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 18 June 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 23 April 2010.

11. Pension arrangements
As the Carillion Staff and ‘B’ defi ned benefi t schemes are run for the Carillion Group as a whole, the Company is unable to identify 
its share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are 
accounted for by the Company separately as if the schemes were defi ned contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension schemes 
are disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
12. Share-based payments
The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the 
Company. Details of the Group’s share option programme are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated fi nancial statements and in the 
Remuneration Report on page 50. Carillion plc

Multiple Accounts on the Shareholder Register

not amalgamate the accounts without your written consent, so if 
you would like any multiple accounts combined into one account, 
please write to Equiniti at the address given above.

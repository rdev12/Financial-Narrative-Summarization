Pub restaurants 
Frankie & Benny’s brings together 
the best of classic American and 
Italian style and cuisine, offering 
traditional home-style dishes from 
Little Italy combined with popular 
American dishes that always 
provide great value for money. 
The kitchen buzzes with bustling 
activity as the chefs prepare 
dishes from our broad menu 
– pizza, pastas, burgers, grills 
and other favourites while, in 
typical stateside fashion, service 
at Frankie & Benny’s is second  
to none! 
Settle into a cosy booth to enjoy 
delicious, perfectly cooked and 
filling food while enjoying a casual 
family meal or a catch up with 
friends and observe the clatter 
and chatter of the open kitchen 
and the familiar classic 50’s and 
60’s soundtrack playing in the 
background. The restaurant walls 
are filled with family snapshots 
and memorabilia showing life  
on the lower east side of the  
Big Apple, helping you into a  
“New York state-of-mind”.
Frankie & Benny’s provides a fun 
and friendly atmosphere for all to 
enjoy delivering fantastic value, 
great food and brilliant service.
First opened in 1995 in Leicester, 
Frankie & Benny’s has become 
one of the best known casual 
dining brands in the United 
Kingdom, and trades successfully 
in leisure and retail locations, 
stand-alone sites and at five 
airports. The estate comprises 
almost 200 restaurants spread 
across the country from 
Aberdeen to St Austell. 
Mexican for fun, for fantastic food, 
for an amazing atmosphere –  
for a good time, guaranteed.
Chiquito offers great value, 
authentic Mexican food in a fun 
and lively venue, with fantastic 
Latin American music. What more 
do you need for a great night out?
The décor draws inspiration from 
Mexican architecture and Latin 
style. Some sites have a rustic 
and relaxed feel while others 
demonstrate the buzz and 
graphic energy of contemporary 
Mexico City.
The menu offers traditional 
Mexican, including nachos, 
burritos, enchiladas and our 
signature sizzling fajitas, as well 
as favourites from “North of  
the Border” – burgers, salads  
and steaks from the grill. We 
specialise in Mexican beer and 
fantastic cocktails to ensure  
every meal is a fiesta.
Chiquito is open seven days a 
week for lunch, lazy afternoons 
and lively evenings, so whether 
you’re out shopping, meeting 
friends after work or planning  
a party it’s the only place to be!
Trading in the UK for over 20 
years, Chiquito continues to 
attract a broad mix of young 
adults, couples, teenagers, 
families and large parties.  
More than 60 leisure, retail  
and stand-alone sites cover  
the United Kingdom with more 
development planned for the 
years ahead. 
 
Garfunkel’s – a truly great name  
in British and world cuisine. 
Founded in London’s West End  
in 1979, Garfunkel’s has become 
legendary! It embraces the 
concept of being all things to all 
people and epitomises all that is 
great in world food. But don’t take 
our word for it, relax and enjoy....
Offering something for everyone, 
the menu is a fantastic mix of the 
best of British and international 
cuisine. From the tempting  
Thai Green Curry to the Giant 
Enchilada everything has been 
chosen because we just love  
the taste. Our favourites are the 
classic Fish & Chips and Cottage 
Pie – true British classics.
Our salad bar has become 
famous. With a delicious range of 
fresh salads and prepared dishes 
and dressings available all day, 
you can choose from a single visit 
or opt for the Unlimited Salad Bar 
and make as many visits to the 
salad bar as you wish.
Principally located across  
Central London, each Garfunkel’s 
restaurant offers a place to relax 
and take a break from the  
hustle and bustle outside. Each 
restaurant has a loyal following  
of visitors, local residents and 
workers who have been eating at 
Garfunkel’s for years. It’s as much 
about the experience as the  
tasty food, and you won’t be 
disappointed in either! 
Garfunkel’s continuing popularity 
means expansion is still on the 
menu after over 30 years of 
trading. Our latest restaurant 
opened on Tottenham Court 
Road, Central London, in 2009, 
and offers the same friendly 
welcome and broad menu in a 
warm contemporary setting, just 
what you need after a hectic 
shopping trip in the West End or 
the perfect way to complement a 
theatre visit. Continued success 
means a healthy appetite  
for growth with more sites 
earmarked to open in  
Central London.
Really great pubs are timeless, 
familiar and very British. 
Everybody knows what their 
perfect pub looks like. For us it’s 
an ideal place for people who like 
to get together, eat, drink and talk 
in a relaxed friendly atmosphere. 
Each of our pubs has its own 
style and personality, and you’ll 
always find a warm welcome, 
ageless interiors, fine British  
pub food, a large variety of  
great real ales and fine wine  
and great coffee.
Mostly set in beautiful rural or 
semi-rural locations, each pub 
has a ‘local’ feel and many are  
set in intriguing buildings with 
fascinating histories. We don’t 
want all our pubs to look and feel 
the same – instead we preserve 
the character of the building, 
which after all was what attracted 
us to the pub in the first place. 
We open all day, and you can pop 
in for a fresh coffee, a pint of real 
ale, glass of wine or some honest 
home cooking at any time. The 
range of beers available changes 
frequently and seasonal and local 
specials mean the menu also 
offers new choices alongside 
trusted favourites each time  
you visit.
There’s friendly, engaging service 
from the moment you arrive, 
ensuring that all your needs are 
taken care of. We hire people who 
genuinely like people and enjoy 
“being there” for our customers, 
and have the flair to operate their 
own business within our Group.
We believe that really great pubs 
will never go out of fashion, and 
that opportunities to expand in 
the sector are available for 
experienced operators with the 
right offer for customers. In 2007 
The Restaurant Group bought 
Brunning & Price, an award-
winning pub business. By 
blending the expertise that 
Brunning & Price brings with  
our own resources, ideas and 
experience, we will develop our 
pubs business and aim to open 
three or four new sites a year 
going forward.  Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

Chairman’s statement
“ I am pleased to report that 
The Restaurant Group plc 
(“TRG” or “the Group”) has 
delivered another excellent 
set of results, despite the 
manifest weakness in the  
UK economy.”
The Group has again grown revenues, profits and earnings 
per share. As anticipated, the difficult economic backdrop 
presented a very challenging marketplace for companies 
operating within our sector but, despite those challenges,  
our distinct market positioning, strong brands and focus on 
our customers have enabled TRG to continue its profitable 
development. Building on a solid first half performance the 
Group has continued to grow revenues and returned to 
positive like-for-like sales growth towards the end of 2009.  
It is encouraging that this positive trend has continued with 
like-for-like sales for the first nine weeks of the current year 
1% ahead of last year. During 2009, we served 35 million 
meals (including approaching five million children’s meals), 
opened 19 new restaurants and created approximately  
500 new full and part-time jobs. 
During 2009 the Group’s revenues grew 4.6% to £436m 
(2008: £417m), adjusted profit before tax grew 2% to £50.0m 
(2008: £48.9m) and adjusted earnings per share increased 
by 5% to 17.48p (2008: 16.67p). This increase in adjusted 
earnings per share marks the achievement of greater than 
100% growth over the five year period to 2009, representing 
a compound annual growth rate of 17.4%, a significant 
achievement that demonstrates the on-going positive 
performance of the Group.
Accordingly, the Board is recommending an increased 
dividend for 2009 to be paid as follows: a second interim 
dividend of 6.3p per share to be paid on 30 March 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 12 March 2010 and shares 
will be marked ex-dividend on 10 March 2010. This second 
interim dividend is equivalent to the final dividend of 6.3p per 
share paid in respect of the 2008 financial year. Additionally, 
and subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, the Board is recommending the payment of a final 
dividend of 0.3p per share. This will be paid on 7 July 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 11 June 2010 and the shares 
will be marked ex-dividend on 9 June 2010. This means that 
the total dividend in respect of 2009 will be 8.0p (2008: 7.7p), 
an increase of 4%. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 05
We have continued to focus on our two divisions, Leisure and 
Concessions, and this has enabled the Group to produce a 
resilient performance despite the severe challenges arising 
from the poor domestic and global economic backdrop. 
Our Leisure division, which incorporates Frankie & Benny’s, 
Chiquito, Garfunkel’s and Pub restaurants, performed  
solidly delivering a 7.5% growth in revenues and a modest 
improvement in profit. During the year we opened 14 new 
restaurants in the Leisure division; these are trading ahead of 
expectations and all are set to deliver strong returns. During 
2010 we plan to open between 13 and 21 new restaurants in 
the Leisure Division. 
Against a very difficult backdrop our Concessions division 
performed commendably and this highlights the resilient 
characteristics of this business. Significant declines in 
passenger numbers at UK airports resulted in our 
Concessions division experiencing a 6% decline in revenues 
and a 4% decline in EBITDA. I am pleased to report that, 
more recently, passenger numbers at UK airports have begun 
to stabilise and this is encouraging. During 2009 we opened 
five new airport sites – four at Aberdeen airport and one at 
Manchester airport. In addition, we redeveloped a site at 
Heathrow Terminal 4 which is now trading as the “Bridge 
Bar”. These new sites are trading very well and are expected 
to deliver strong returns. We plan to open two to four new 
airport sites during 2010. 
Overall, this is another excellent set of results – the Group 
continued to grow its estate with quality openings, increase 
earnings and dividends, generate high levels of cash and 
significantly reduce net debt. This strong performance was 
the result of the hard work, expertise and dedication of our 
Directors, senior management and staff. On behalf of the 
Board I would like to record our thanks to all of them. 
John Jackson, one of our non-executive Directors, has 
decided not to stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
John has been with the Company for 13 years and I would 
like to thank him, on behalf of the Board, for his important 
contribution during that time and we wish John well for the 
future. Recruitment of a new non-executive Director is 
progressing very well and a further announcement will be 
made in due course.
We have started the current year well with like-for-like sales 
growth for the first nine weeks of the year 1% ahead of 2009 
levels and this is encouraging. Last year was, without a 
doubt, an exceptionally difficult one for our sector and it is 
clear that TRG demonstrated its resilience. This not only 
enabled the Group to continue to grow earnings and 
cashflows, but also to strengthen its market position further 
and this means that we are well placed to continue our 
progress in 2010 and beyond.

A robust  
business  
model and 
distinct market 
positioning 06 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations
“ Our core objective continues 
to be growth in shareholder 
value and our strategy to 
achieve this is to build a 
business capable of delivering 
long-term, sustainable and 
growing cashflows.”
A global slump, the deepest since the Second World  
War, a credit crunch which threatened to bring down the 
international financial system and, closer to home, six 
consecutive quarters of declining GDP have not provided  
an attractive backdrop for consumer-facing businesses. 
At the start of the 2009 it was apparent that the UK faced  
an unpalatable cocktail of economic contraction, rising 
unemployment and a paucity of consumer and corporate 
credit. We expected our sector to face new and sustained 
pressures which would test the robustness of business 
models. This led us to be cautious about the short-term 
outlook but, at the same time, to be confident that TRG’s 
robust business model, distinct market positioning, prudent 
capital structure, operational discipline (including eschewing 
deep discounting) and clear focus would enable it to 
capitalise on the opportunities which might arise whilst also 
adapting to the more difficult trading conditions which would 
prevail. We did not expect TRG to be immune to the effects  
of the UK recession, rather we expected our business to 
demonstrate resilience. 
And so, in spite of the difficulties caused by the recession,  
I am pleased to report that TRG enjoyed another year of  
good progress. Both of our divisions performed admirably 
with our Leisure division delivering modest profit growth  
and our Concessions division successfully managing an 
extremely challenging airport marketplace to deliver a very 
commendable level of full year profit. Overall, the Group’s 
performance was good with both margins and sales holding 
up well. Despite a 2% contraction in like-for-like sales, total 
sales grew by 4.6%, adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 2% 
and adjusted earnings per share were 5% higher than the 
previous year. Against a challenging backdrop, this represents 
a very satisfactory result. 
The TRG business model and rationale
Our core objective continues to be growth in shareholder 
value and our strategy to achieve this is to build a business 
capable of delivering long-term, sustainable and growing 
cashflows. 2009 was a year in which business models were 
severely tested and I am pleased to report that, once again, 
we have successfully converted our growing profits into  
cash at a very healthy rate. TRG’s business model enables 
the Group to grow in a predominately organic and highly 
value-accretive way, funded from internally generated funds.  Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 07
Our touchstones are cashflow and return on investment.  
This model has enabled our shareholders to enjoy the 
benefits of high returns on capital, growth in profits and 
cashflow and sizeable income distributions from our 
progressive dividend policy. 
TRG’s primary focus is on edge of town, out of town, rural, 
semi-rural and airport locations. These locations have 
significant barriers to entry, offer good growth prospects  
and enable the Group to generate consistently high returns 
on investment. We occupy leading market positions in each 
of these segments and are well placed to continue to grow  
our business. 
Capex and TRG opening programme
Our philosophy regarding capital expenditure remains 
consistent – we focus on cash generation and on securing  
a return on invested capital at rates ahead of TRG’s  
weighted average cost of capital. We will continue to apply 
the same high levels of analytical rigour, commercial analysis, 
experience and risk adjustment to each capital project that 
we undertake. This approach has served TRG well and we 
do not intend to deviate from it. 
In the light of lower levels of development activity over  
the past eighteen months, TRG has opened fewer new 
restaurants than it normally would and this level of new 
development activity is likely to continue during 2010. 
However, we are confident that, in due course, many of the 
projects which have been postponed or delayed will come to 
fruition and those projects should therefore contribute to our 
forward pipeline. At present, it is still not clear when this might 
be although there are tentative signs of new activity in some 
quarters of the commercial property market and this is 
encouraging. During this period of lower levels of new 
development activity, we will not look to substitute unduly 
risky and/or less attractive projects for those which have 
been delayed or postponed. Rather, we will retain our cash 
until such time as the original projects reappear or other 
equally attractive opportunities become available. In the 
meantime, our surplus cashflow will be applied towards 
reducing debt, as it was during 2009 with a resultant  
£12m reduction in Group net debt.

Frankie & Benny’s performed well during 2009. Turnover, 
EBITDA and profit all increased and margins held up strongly. 
Last year we opened 10 new restaurants of which three were 
on non-cinema sites. These are all trading superbly and are 
set to deliver strong returns. During the year we focused  
our efforts towards our customers with very close attention  
to the variety of offering, price point, hospitality and service 
standards. As with all of our brands, we eschewed deep 
discounting and this helped to produce a very satisfactory 
profit performance. We anticipate opening between seven 
and eleven new Frankie & Benny’s restaurants during 2010.

Chiquito (63 units)
Chiquito produced a solid performance during 2009, 
although profits were a little below the level of the prior year. 
Profit margins were adversely impacted by two factors: firstly, 
the introduction of a new lunchtime menu which was priced 
at a very competitive level and also as a result of food input 
cost increases which we did not pass on to customers. 
During the year we opened three new restaurants – the 
performance of these restaurants has been superb and we 
expect all of them to deliver very strong returns. We expect  
to open two to five new Chiquito restaurants during 2010. 
Pub restaurants (42 units)
Overall, our Pub restaurant business had a good year. Those 
Pub restaurants located in the North West of England traded 
very well, without exception. Trading in the South East was 
more variable, with some very good performers and others 
where results were less buoyant. 
As noted in our interim report we have embarked on a 
programme of aligning the majority of the Pub restaurants 
towards a less formal (Brunning & Price) style of operation. 
This programme commenced in the summer of 2009 and will 
continue this year. The results of these changes have been 
very encouraging with significant improvements in trading 
being secured. By the end of 2010 we will have substantially 
concluded this programme and we are also looking forward 
to adding some additional Pub restaurants during the year. 
Currently, we expect to open between two and three new 
Pub restaurants in 2010 and, as we have previously indicated, 
we believe that further opportunities to accelerate the growth 
of our Pub restaurant business will arise in the future.  
In the meantime, we will look to steadily add to our Pub  
restaurant estate. 
Garfunkel’s (22 units) 
Garfunkel’s performed superbly during 2009 finishing with a 
very strong final quarter. Most of our Garfunkel’s restaurants 
trade from prominent locations in Central London and they 
enjoyed a strong and sustained trade throughout the year 
and I am pleased to report that this trend continues. 
Revenues and margins grew strongly and this resulted in a 
double digit growth in EBITDA and profit. During the second 
half we opened a new Garfunkel’s restaurant on Tottenham 
Court Road. It is trading strongly and is set to deliver  
excellent returns. During 2010 we expect to open two  
new Garfunkel’s restaurants.

The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 09
Our Concessions division, which operates at eight of the  
UK’s principal airports, faced very tough trading conditions 
throughout 2009. Passenger numbers (“pax”) in UK airports 
fell by 7.5% over the course of 2009 with some of the larger 
airports suffering falls of up to 12%. The decline in pax 
started towards the end of 2008 and, as I indicated in last 
year’s review, we expected 2009 to be a tough year for  
our Concessions division. In anticipation of these tougher 
conditions we took steps to limit the adverse impact of lower 
levels of trade primarily by rigorous control of our operations 
and cost base. These steps, combined with the turnover-
based rental model under which our airport business 
operates, meant that we were able to manage the downturn 
in trade successfully. As a result, I am pleased to report that 
our Concessions division produced a creditable level of 
EBITDA of £15.9m (2008: £16.6m) and a profit of £11.0m 
(2008: £12.7m). Although these are below the prior year level, 
they demonstrate both the resilient nature of our Concessions 
business and also the benefits of rigorous operational and 
cost controls. 
During the year we opened five new airport sites, four at 
Aberdeen airport and one at Manchester airport. In addition, 
we redeveloped a site at Heathrow Terminal 4, which is now 
trading as the “Bridge Bar”. These new sites are trading very 
well and are expected to deliver strong returns. We plan to 
open two to four new airport sites during 2010. 
Whilst we do not anticipate a rapid increase in pax during 
2010, we are encouraged by the recent positive trend. 
Additionally, we believe that a secular shift away from 
full-service travel towards low cost travel has been hastened 
during these more straitened times and this bodes well for 
TRG. In the medium and longer-term we are confident that 
our market-leading position and expertise in this segment 
means that we are well placed to capitalise on the growth 
that will, in due course, resume.

Market dynamics and the economy
Eating out has become an increasingly popular pastime for 
large parts of the UK population in recent years with growth 
trending at levels ahead of changes in GDP and we remain 
confident that the prospects for our market are positive. 
Socio-economic factors, such as an ageing population, more 
females in work and levels of disposable income significantly 
higher than in previous generations augur well for our 
industry. Eating out, particularly at our popular price points 
(£10-£16 spend per head), is a relatively “small ticket” item for 
most people and for many it has become a habitual part of 
their lives and something that they are reluctant to give up. 
Nevertheless, eating out represents, to a significant degree, 
discretionary spend and as such can be flexed according to 
consumers’ disposable income and confidence. It would 
therefore be naïve to assume that our business is impervious 
to the recessionary forces and poor economic backdrop. 
Over the past eighteen months, the reaction of many 
companies within our sector has been to discount selling 
prices. In many cases these discounting programmes have 
been deep both in terms of the level and duration. “Buy one 
get one free” promotions have become commonplace and 
continue to be used frequently. However, TRG has taken a 
different approach; eschewing deep discounting, our focus 
has been directed very much towards our customers, 
concentrating on value, range of choice across price points, 
service and standards. 
To date, TRG has demonstrated a level of resilience and 
popularity with diners that has enabled it to continue to grow 
revenues and profits and, at the same time, deliver high 
margins – we are determined to continue this. There are a 
number of factors that have enabled TRG to withstand the 
economic downturn. These include our distinct market 
positioning in segments with lower supply-side risk, our price 
points (and avoiding the deep discounting that has pervaded 
large parts of the market), offerings which have wide appeal 
to most socio-economic groups and a commitment to 
delivering great hospitality and service to our customers. 
The UK’s macro-economic landscape has taken on some 
new and unusual features over the past twelve months. 
Faced with the threat of a recession becoming a depression 
(and all of the concomitant long-term deflationary damage 
that would be implied) our authorities, along with those of all 
of the leading economies, embarked upon unprecedented 
levels of monetary and fiscal stimulation. This included a 
Keynesian style uplift in public sector spending which has 
contributed to an increase in the level of national debt and 
involved running a budget deficit above 12% of UK GDP;  
this represents a post-war high. Additionally, an exceptionally 
loose monetary policy was pursued and this was further 
augmented through a £200bn quantitative easing 
programme. This resulted in interest rates remaining low  
and a bank rate of just 0.5%; the lowest since records  
began in 1694. Whilst these unprecedented measures 
appear to have averted a depression, positive impacts  
in terms of employment, consumption and growth have,  
so far, been fairly limited. 
There are two key macro-economic variables which 
significantly impact our business – interest rates and 
unemployment. Over the past year, unemployment has  
risen together with its equally corrosive bedfellow, the fear  
of unemployment. Combined, these two blights can have a 
dramatic effect on confidence, consumption and household 
spending and this effect has manifested itself clearly over  
the past fifteen months. For whilst those households where 
the breadwinners have remained in work have enjoyed an 
increase in disposable income, as a result of low interest rates 
and lower inflation, this has not translated into significant 
increases in consumer spend. Rather, households have used 
this excess income to pay down debt or to build up savings 
and this has been reflected in a sizeable increase in the 
savings ratio. This pattern of behaviour is similar to that  
which took place following the economic downturn in the 
early 1990s. 
Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations continued Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 11
An end to rising unemployment and a renewed confidence  
in job prospects within the UK will, we believe, represent a 
significant point of upturn for consumer-facing businesses. 
For many of our customers, unemployment and short-time 
working (or the fear of these) acts as a disincentive to spend. 
If, however, people feel that their jobs are secure they are 
more likely to spend, including on eating out, even if interest 
rates are higher. 
So what are the implications for consumer-facing 
businesses? In the short-term much will depend upon the 
timing and impact of the exit from the monetary and fiscal 
stimuli and in turn this is likely to be impacted by the outcome 
of the general election. At some point interest rates are likely 
to rise and it is noteworthy that recent statistics indicate that 
inflation remains above target. More fundamentally perhaps  
is how the fiscal malaise is treated. A budget deficit at the 
current levels is not sustainable and the corrective forces 
which will be brought to bear to rectify this are not very 
palatable. A resumption of economic growth will certainly  
play its part in closing the gap and, although current forecasts 
indicate below trend growth in 2010, this is forecast to return 
towards trend in 2011. In the short term, this means two 
things are likely – higher taxes (probably both direct and 
indirect) and lower levels of government spend. Whilst neither 
of these are attractive for the consumer, if the timing and 
nature of these exit actions are such that the private  
sector takes up some of the spare capacity created, and 
unemployment does not materially increase, it is likely that  
the result will be a further period of tough but, for those 
businesses with sound business models and robust finances, 
manageable conditions. It is against this backdrop that  
we have framed our plans for the year ahead. 
Future prospects
At the end of 2008 and in early 2009, we were on the verge  
of a severe economic depression and there was virtually no 
forward visibility. Now, however, we have a clearer picture  
of the issues that have to be faced and, to a degree, a 
quantification of those issues. The UK economy has moved 
away from a period of fear of a depression towards one of 
austerity, and we will have to continue to carefully manage  
our way through this. I am confident that we will successfully 
do so.
Beyond the short-term, the challenging economic backdrop 
is likely to have a cathartic effect on the supply side of  
our sector. The reasons for this are two-fold: firstly, some 
operators will withdraw or significantly downscale their plans 
and secondly, it is likely, for some time, to deter new entrants. 
Combined, these factors should act as a brake on restaurant 
supply and the positive impact of this is likely to be felt for 
some time. 
Looking forward, our company is well placed to benefit  
from economic growth, when it resumes. We have a robust 
business model, distinct market positions, a strong balance 
sheet and we are well positioned to continue our expansion. 
These factors, combined with the efforts of all of our people 
enabled the Group to produce good results last year despite 
an extremely challenging marketplace and in 2010 we will 
continue to:
•	 	 Stick 	 t o 	 our 	 ar e as 	 o f 	 e x pe r tise ;
• 	 	 F o c u s 	 o n 	 o u r 	 c u s t om e r s 	 b y 	 pr o v i d i n g 	 e x c e l l e n t 	 v a l u e

•	 	 Con tinue 	 our 	 f ocus 	 on 	 c ash flo w 	 and 	 r e tur ns .
By so doing, our aim is to continue to strengthen our market 
positions and deliver long-term and sustainable profitable 
growth. We have an outstanding team of people at TRG  
of whom a great deal was asked in 2009. Yet again, they 
responded magnificently and I am grateful to all of them.  
I am confident that they will put in every effort to ensure  
that we deliver another good performance this year.

  12 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Group Finance Director’s report
“ Adjusted post tax profits  
of £34.5m were up 5% on 
the prior year resulting in  
an adjusted EPS of 17 .48p,  
a 5% increase.”
Results 
Against a difficult macro economic backdrop the Group  
has recorded another very satisfactory set of financial  
results. Total Group revenues increased by 4.6% to £435.7m. 
Although underlying like-for-like sales were down 2% for the 
year, this was more than offset by the full year impact of 
openings in 2008 and a part year effect of the 19 new sites 
opened in 2009.
Group adjusted EBITDA was £79.6m, an increase of 2.8% on 
the prior year. After adding back the non-cash share-based 
payment charge of £2.1m (2008: £1.9m), total EBITDA in the 
year was £81.7m (2008: £79.4m). After depreciation charges 
in the year totalling £26.3m (2008: £23.3m), Group adjusted 
operating profit for the year was £53.4m (2008: £54.2m).  
This represents a slightly reduced operating margin of 12.2% 
(2008: 13.0%). However, this outcome was considerably 
better than anticipated earlier in the year, and has resulted 
from a diligent focus on costs and efficiencies across the 
business throughout the year. 
Adjusted net interest costs in the year were £3.3m, a 37% 
reduction compared to 2008. This reflects lower average  
debt during the year and lower interest rates on the 
unhedged portion of the Group’s debt. Total adjusted Group 
profit before tax was £50.0m, a 2.3% increase on the prior 
year. After taking into account a lower average tax rate (as 
discussed later in this report), adjusted post tax profits of 
£34.5m were up 5% on the prior year resulting in an adjusted 
EPS of 17.48p, a 5% increase.
Cost Inflation
During 2009 the Group successfully absorbed significant 
upward cost pressure on wages, food and beverage input 
costs, and utility costs. Wage costs in particular were affected 
by the October 2008 increase of 3.8% in national minimum 
wage, as well as changes to the statutory holiday pay regime 
which came into effect in April 2009. The outlook for 2010 in 
terms of cost inflation is significantly more benign: national 
minimum wage only increased by 1.2% in October 2009; we 
expect overall food and beverage cost inflation to be less in 
2010 than in 2009; rent increases are running at much lower 
levels than we have seen historically; utility costs are currently 
running at about the same level as last year and we expect 
these to reduce with effect from the final quarter of the year. 
We estimate that total sales growth of 2% to 3% would be 
sufficient to offset these cost increases. After nine weeks   Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 13
total sales were up over 6%, more than double the level  
of growth necessary to cover the expected levels of cost 
inflation outlined above.
Non-trading and non-core items 
The full year results include a net credit of £2.8m in respect  
of non-trading items. The principal components of this are:
• 	 	 A 	 £ 1 . 2 m 	 c ha r g e 	 a r i s i n g 	 o n 	 t h e 	 r e v a l u a t i o n 	 o f 	 t h e

satisfactory outcome of negotiations with HMRC on the 
2005 tax computation in connection with the tax treatment 
of the Caffe Uno disposal profits realised in that year.
During the year non-core losses increased to £1.3m  
(2008: £0.9m) and we will continue to take steps to  
minimise these non-core losses. 
Capital expenditure 
During the year the Group invested a total of £31.5m  
in capital additions (2008: £46.7m). This consisted of 
development expenditure totalling £20.1m (2008: £35.9m), 
including the acquisition of four pub freeholds for £3.6m.  
We have also continued to invest in the refurbishment and 
maintenance of the existing estate and during the year the 
Group spent £11.4m on this type of capital expenditure 
(2008: £10.8m). We are committed to continuing this 
programme of investment in the existing estate and believe 
that this is a key element in ensuring the on-going trading 
success of the like-for-like estate.
During the year the Group opened a total of 19 new outlets, 
all of which are trading very satisfactorily. All are generating 
levels of turnover and profit at least in line with feasibility, and 
in many cases substantially ahead of feasibility. We opened 
significantly fewer new units in 2009 than in recent years, 
primarily as a result of property companies and developers 
significantly reducing new activity over the course of the last 
two years in response to the economic downturn. After 
taking into account a number of closures and disposals in 
the year (primarily leases and concessions coming to the 
end of their term) the Group finished the year with 367 
trading units. The following table summarises openings  
and closures during the year.

Total  354 19 (6) 367
    
We continue to be highly focused on ensuring that all our 
investments achieve excellent returns on investment. We adopt 
a rigorous approach to the capital investment appraisal of all 
new sites. This includes a detailed financial evaluation as  
well as demographic, competitor and market analysis. All 
significant projects are approved by the Group board. We also 
conduct regular post-investment appraisals and these confirm 
that target levels of return continue to be achieved. 
Cash flow  
Set out below is a summary cash flow statement for 2009. 
This clearly demonstrates the strong cash flow generation 
characteristics of The Restaurant Group and the transparent 
conversion of operating profits into cash. Net cash flow from 
operations was £83.5m (2008: £76.5m). Free cash flow 
(defined as net cash flow from operations less interest, tax  
and maintenance capex) was £56.2m (2008: £47.3m).  
Adding high-
quality new 
restaurants to 
our portfolio 14 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Group Finance Director’s report continued
This cash flow has been utilised to finance the new site 
development programme (including the pub freehold 
acquisitions referred to above) and also to pay cash dividends 
totalling £14.9m (2008: £14.2m). Working capital was 
particularly strong in the year, largely due to the beneficial 
timing of certain items, which will partly reverse in 2010. 
Whereas in most recent years, all of the Group’s free cash 
flow has been utilised to develop new sites and pay a 
dividend, in 2009, due to the lower level of new openings, the 
business has generated surplus cash which has been used 
to pay down debt. As a result, even after spending £3.9m 
acquiring shares for the employee benefit trust, the Group  
still paid down over £12m of net debt resulting in a year end 
net debt position of £66.7m (2008: £78.9m).

Financing 
The Group has committed banking facilities of £120m and a 
£10m overdraft facility. The committed bank facility was put  
in place in December 2007 and runs for five years until 
December 2012. 
The Group has interest rate hedging instruments in place to 
fix interest costs on £40m of total debt. £20m is fixed at a rate 
of 3% plus margin until January 2012. A further £20m is fixed 
at 2.7% plus margin until 2011.
The Group’s banking arrangements contain two financial 
covenants which are tested on a six monthly basis. These, 
and other key financial ratios, are summarised as follows:
    Banking 
    covenant 2009 2008
EBITDA / Interest cover   >4x 23.9x 14.6x
Net debt / EBITDA    <3x 0.84x 1.02x
Fixed charge cover    n/a 2.5x 2.4x
Balance sheet gearing   n/a 58% 84%
In terms of financial gearing, fixed charge cover (defined as 
EBITDA plus rent divided by rent plus interest) improved 
slightly in the year from 2.4 times in 2008 to 2.5 times in 2009 
and balance sheet gearing fell from 84% to 58%. In the 
current climate we are happy to see a reduction in the overall 
level of net debt, putting us in a strong position to accelerate 
the new opening programme as circumstances allow over  
the next few years. 
Taxation 
The total taxation charge in the year was £11.1m, as follows:
   2009   2008 
   Non-   Non- 
  Trading trading Total Trading trading Total 
  £m £m £m £m £m £m
Corporation tax 16.0 (0.7) 15.3 15.0 (0.5) 14.5
Deferred tax (0.4) (3.8) (4.2) 1.1 (0.7) 0.4
      
Total 15.6 (4.5) 11.1 16.1 (1.2) 14.9
      
On trading activities the underlying tax charge in the year of 
£15.6m represents a tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 33%  
in 2008. The Group’s average tax rate is higher than the 
mainstream corporation tax rate of 28% primarily due to a 
significant level of disallowable spend within the capital 
expenditure total. Given the somewhat lower level of total 
capital expenditure this year compared to other recent years, 
the differential has reduced somewhat. On an ongoing basis, 
with a level of total capex more in line with recent years, we 
would expect our average tax rate to be some 31.5%.

year was 105.0p to 209.5p.
Share capital structure
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares of 
28
1
⁄ 8p. The authorised share capital is 284,444,444 ordinary 
shares of 28
1
⁄ 8p. As at 27 December 2009, the issued, called 
up and fully paid number of shares in issue was 197,575,863 
shares. There are no preference shares or special rights 
pertaining to any of the shares in issue.
Following the 2009 Annual General Meeting the Directors 
have had the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £18,444,266 which represented 
approximately one third of the ordinary share capital of the 
Company at the time the authority was given by shareholders. 
This authority expires at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 6 May 2010 and it will be proposed to extend this 
authority (updated for the current number of shares in issue) 
at the forthcoming Meeting. The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority.
In addition, following the 2009 Annual General Meeting,  
the Directors have the authority to make market purchases  
of shares in The Restaurant Group plc on behalf of the 
Company up to 19,673,884 ordinary shares (which 
represented 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital at the time of the Notice of the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting). The minimum price that may be paid for such 
shares is 28
1
⁄ 8p per share. The maximum price is the higher  
of 5% above the average middle market quotation for the 
ordinary shares for the five business days preceding the  
date of purchase and the higher of the price of the last 
independent trade and the highest current independent bid 
on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List at the time 
the purchase is carried out. This authority expires at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and it will be proposed 
to extend this authority (updated for the current number of 
shares in issue) at the forthcoming Meeting. The Directors 
have no present intention of exercising this authority.
The Group has entered into various contracts including  
leases during the course of ordinary business which may  
be terminated in the event of a change of control of The 
Restaurant Group plc.

Report of the Directors continued
The Board
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of 
the Company and Group within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and 
managed. The Board reviews the Group’s strategic objectives 
and looks to ensure that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place to achieve these objectives, and to 
review management performance against these objectives. 
The Board also sets the Company’s values and standards 
and manages the business in a manner to meet its 
obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders. The 
Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman,  
the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Finance Director, the 
Executive Director of the Concessions division and two 
non-executive Directors. Their biographies appear on pages 
16 and 17 and these demonstrate a range of experience and 
sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on issues  
of strategy, performance, resources and standards of 
conduct which is vital for the success of the Group.
John Jackson acts as senior independent non-executive 
Director and is available to shareholders if they have reasons 
for concern on which contact through the normal channels  
is inappropriate or has failed to resolve an issue.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
defined. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the 
strategic direction and operational management of the Group. 
The Board meets on a regular basis and there is a formal 
schedule of matters specifically reserved for its consideration. 
This includes approval of the annual budget and the three 
year business plan, approval of the interim and year end 
Report and Accounts, review and approval of significant 
capital expenditure (including development of new sites), 
significant disposals of assets and acquisitions or disposals 
of businesses.
Operational management are responsible for the day-to-day 
running of the Group and report on a regular basis on that 
performance to the Board. The Board is responsible for 
reviewing, challenging and approving the strategic direction  
of the Group and monitoring operational performance.  
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group and has access to the necessary 
information to enable it to discharge its duties. All Directors 
are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment, except where they are appointed by 
shareholders, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of not 
more than three years.
There is significant involvement from the non-executive 
Directors. This involves an ongoing dialogue with the 
executive Directors including constructive challenge of 
performance and the Group’s strategy. The non-executive 
Directors are provided with sufficient information to allow 
them to monitor, assess and challenge the executive 
management of the Group. Comprehensive Board papers 
including financial information are circulated to all Directors 
prior to Board meetings and, on a weekly basis, they receive 
up-to-date trading information. The non-executive Directors 
have the opportunity to meet without the executive Directors 
present, and this includes discussions of targets set and 
achieved by management.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and a procedure has been agreed for 
the Directors in the furtherance of their duties to take 
independent professional advice, if necessary, at the expense 
of the Company. On joining the Board there is a process  
for Directors to receive training as to their role and its 
requirements and for non-executive Directors to gain an 
understanding of the whole business. Non-executive 
Directors are actively encouraged to meet with operational 
management and to visit the Group’s operations in order to 
enhance their understanding of the Group’s business, its 
brands, employees and processes. During 2009 there  
were eight Board meetings with full attendance by  
Board members. 
Executive Directors are included in the annual performance 
evaluation of all senior employees within the Group. This 
involves a comprehensive review of performance against 
objectives and covers areas for future development through 
appraisal documentation and meetings. The non-executive 
Directors also meet in the absence of the Chairman to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance in the light of his  
fee review.
The Company acknowledges the importance of developing 
the skills of the Directors to run an effective Board. To assist 
in this, Directors are given the opportunity to attend relevant 
courses and seminars and to acquire skills and experience 
which may enhance their contribution to the ongoing 
progress of the Group. The Board and committees of the 
Board have been subject to a formal performance appraisal, 
through an internal questionnaire, and the performance of all 
members of the Board is considered as part of the annual 
remuneration review process. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. 
The Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review of 
operations and Group Finance Director’s report on pages 4 
to 15 include a detailed review of the business and the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review of operations on pages 6 to 11 
includes a review of planned future developments. There  
is a regular dialogue with institutional investors including 
presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement 
of the year-end results, and at the half year.
Feedback from major institutional shareholders is provided  
to the Board on a regular basis and, where appropriate,  
the Board will take steps to address their concerns and 
recommendations. The Board uses the Annual General 
Meeting to communicate with private and institutional 
investors and welcomes their participation. The Chairman 
aims to ensure that the chairmen of the Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and Nominations Committee are 
available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions, 
and for all Directors to attend.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of two non-executive 
Directors. There was 100% attendance of the four 
Remuneration Committee meetings during 2009. The role  
of this Committee and details of how the Company complies 
with the principles of the Code are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 29 to 36.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the non-executive 
Directors, the non-executive Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer. It met twice during 2009 with full 
attendance at both meetings. There are written terms  
of reference for the Nominations Committee. It makes 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment or 
replacement of additional Directors. It is also responsible  
for succession planning for the Group.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of two non-executive 
Directors. During the year the Committee was chaired by 
John Jackson who is a qualified accountant. The Audit 
Committee met twice during 2009 with full attendance at 
each meeting. A more detailed description of the work 
undertaken by the Audit Committee is included in the Audit 
Committee report on pages 37 and 38. Shareholders of the

The Restaurant Group plc – strategy
The Restaurant Group’s key objective is to grow shareholder 
value and the strategy deployed to achieve this is to build a 
business capable of generating long-term, sustainable and 
growing cash flows. In pursuit of this we have built a business 
which is focused on the growing casual eating-out market. 
We have targeted segments of this market which offer distinct 
barriers to entry and where we can be confident of delivering 
good growth in profits and cash flows and where there is 
good potential for high returns on investment. This has led the 
Group to focus our activities in two areas – Leisure and 
Concessions. The Group operates in the expanding casual 
dining market, and our offerings continue to provide good 
value for money in comfortable surroundings and excellent 
service from our dedicated teams.
The Group’s strategy is to deliver further organic growth 
through the roll-out of our brands – Frankie & Benny’s, 
Chiquit o , 	 Gar f unk e l ’ s 	 and 	 our 	 P ub 	 r e stauran t 	 busine s s . 	 W e	
have a solid pipeline of sites for development, coupled with a 
strong focus on continuing to deliver like-for-like sales growth 
from our existing restaurants. Our Concessions business 
operates in a dynamic and complicated market where our 
management teams have market-leading expertise and a 
track record of innovation and improving sales performance 
and the Group continues to look for opportunities to expand 
this division.
The Restaurant Group plc – risk factors
The Board of Directors regularly identify, monitor and manage 
potential risks and uncertainties to the Group. The list overleaf 
sets out what the Directors consider to be the current 
principal risks and uncertainties, with an overview of the 
mitigation process for these. This list is not presumed to  
be exhaustive and is, by its very nature, subject to change.
The Restaurant Group plc –  
key performance indicators
The Board of Directors and executive management receive a 
wide range of management information delivered in a timely 
manner. Listed below are the principal measures of progress 
that are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor the 
development of the Group. 
Like-for-like sales
This measure provides an indicator of the underlying 
performance of our existing restaurants, and highlights 
successful development of our offerings to best match 
changing consumer demands over time. There is no 
accounting standard or consistent definition of “like-for-like 
sales” across the industry, although the Group has applied  
a consistent basis of calculation across years for reporting 
like-for-like performance. During 2009, the Group like-for-like 
sales declined by 2% which followed a 1.5% increase in 2008 
and a 5.5% increase in 2007. 22 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009

Report of the Directors continued Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 23
New sites opened
The expansion of our brands is a key driver of the Group’s 
profitability. As noted in the Group Finance Director’s report, 
potential new sites are subject to a rigorous appraisal process 
before they are presented to the Board for approval. This 
process ensures we maintain the quality of openings as well 
as the quantity of sites opened. During 2009 the Group 
opened 19 new sites and plans to open 15-25 new 
restaurants during 2010.
EBITDA
The ability of the Group to finance its roll-out programme  
is aided by strong cash flows from the existing business.  
The Group defines EBITDA as operating profit before 
depreciation, amortisation and non-trading items. EBITDA 
serves as a useful proxy for cash flows generated by 
operations and is closely monitored. During 2009 the  
Group generated £79.6m EBITDA, an increase of 3%  
on the 2008 level of £77.5m.
Operating profit margin
The Board and management closely monitor profit margins 
as an indicator of operating efficiency within restaurants and 
across the Group. During 2009 the Group adjusted operating 
margin was 12.2% (2008: 13.0%). In addition, the Group 
closely scrutinises the returns on invested capital from  
new site openings and the average EBITDA generated  
by restaurants.
Further information on these key metrics is provided in the 
Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations and the Group 
Finance Director’s report.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. In accordance  
with guidance for directors “Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code” (the “Turnbull Guidance”), 
the Board has ensured that there is an ongoing process for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
including identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group. This process, which is regularly 
reviewed by the Board, is carried out in conjunction with 
business planning and is documented in a risk register that 
has been progressively enhanced during the financial year 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. Whilst acknowledging its overall responsibility for 
the system of internal control, the Board is aware that the 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group has well-established procedures which have been 
developed over many years which meet the requirements  
of the Turnbull Guidance. A key control procedure is the 
day-to-day involvement of executive members of the Board  
in all aspects of the business and their attendance at regular 
management meetings at which performance against plan 
and business prospects are reviewed. The Group has 
established a monthly executive management meeting  
where the three executive Directors, senior operational 
managers and head of functional departments review  
Group performance and issues affecting the Group.
Additionally, the Board seeks to continually strengthen the 
internal control system where this is consistent with improving 
the relationship between risk and reward. The Group’s 
associate company, Living Ventures Restaurants Group 
Limited, does not fall under the same internal controls as  
the Group. The internal controls within the associate are 
discussed with management of that company during 
shareholder meetings and are considered to be appropriate 
f or 	 a n 	 e n t it y 	 o f 	 it s 	 s i z e .	
Other key features and the processes for reviewing 
effectiveness of the internal control system are  
described below:

Operational performance and operational matters are 
considered at monthly meetings of the executive Directors 
with senior management. Financial performance is 
monitored and action taken through weekly reporting  
to the executive Directors and monthly reporting to the  
Board against annual budgets approved by the Board.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation  
to the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the  
Annual Report, Directors’ remuneration report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The Directors are required 
by the International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) Regulation 
to prepare the Group financial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union. The Group financial statements are also 
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
IAS 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for 
each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in 
the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be 
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.

a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.  
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and enable them to 
ensure that the parent company financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and

statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Information provided to auditors
Each of the current Directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any 
relevant information needed by the Company’s auditors for 
the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors 
are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware  
of any relevant information of which the auditors are unaware. 
This information is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies  
Act 2006.
Going concern
As referred to in the Chief Executive Officer’s review of 
operations there are significant economic concerns facing the 
United Kingdom and consumer-facing industries in particular. 
The Group Finance Director’s report also contains a summary  
of the cash flows and borrowing position of the Group.  
Further information on the Group’s policies for capital risk 
management and financial risk management are set out

affect the business are listed above. 
The Group is highly cash generative, as explained in the 
Group Finance Director’s report, and enjoys negative working 
capital as it is generally does not give credit to its customers. 
The Group has a debt facility of £120m which matures in 
December 2012 and net debt at 27 December 2009 of 
£66.7m (28 December 2008: £78.9m). Based on the  
Group’s plans for 2010 and after making enquiries (including 
preparation of reasonable trading forecasts, consideration of 
current financing arrangements and current headroom for 
liquidity and covenant compliance), the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Corporate responsibility
The Restaurant Group plc (“TRG”) acknowledges that it has  
a significant role to play with regard to the community and 
wider environment in which it operates. This statement sets 
out the principal areas of focus and activity that the Group 
has undertaken to date, and what the Group is looking at for 
future development, in managing its impact on customers, 
employees, communities and the wider environment.

Our market
The Restaurant Group plc has focused its attention on 
markets in the United Kingdom which have significant growth 
potential. For a number of years, dining out has been a 
growing market, and, partially as a result of this, there has 
been an increased focus from customers and regulatory 
authorities on health issues relating to our sector. We have 
seen initiatives on alcohol, food (in particular on calorie 
consumption and the fat and salt content in food) and 
smoking over recent years and these are set to continue to 
be a focus. It is important that the Group continues to monitor 
closely these developments and ensure that we continue  
to offer our customers a broad range of choice in our 
restaurants, including healthy options.
Healthy eating
H e a lt h y 	 e a t i n g 	 i s 	 a 	 p e r s o na l 	 r e s po n s i bi l it y 	 b u t 	 T R G	
acknowledges that as a provider of food and drink we have  
a role to play in providing appropriate options from which 
individuals may choose when they eat out. TRG strongly 
believes that it should provide its guests with choice. Whilst 
we do not wish to be prescriptive we aim to provide a healthy 
choice at each menu point, alongside more indulgent options. 
For many people dining out is a treat, and therefore the 
normal restrictions which may be applied to healthy eating on 
a day-to-day basis are waived in favour of enjoyment and 
experience. For example, whilst completing the weekly shop 
a consumer may choose chocolate fudge cake for their 
weekend dessert as opposed to a piece of fruit during  
the week.
The Group is undertaking a process of monitoring nutritional 
content across its menus and, as part of our ongoing menu 
review, will look to develop the healthier options available to 
customers and to work with our suppliers to reduce salt 
content and calorific content.
The Group has engaged with the Food Standards Authority 
H e a lt h y 	 C a t e r i n g 	 i nit ia t i v e 	 a n d 	 i s 	 c om mit t e d 	 t o 	 e n s u r e 	 t ha t	 
all menus feature lighter options and all children’s meals  
come with a choice of carbohydrate alternatives and a 
complementary portion of salad or vegetables, and to work 
with our suppliers to source lower salt, saturated fat and 
calorie versions of ingredients where possible.
Hydrogenated fats
In light of UK government and consumer focus with regard  
to consumption of products containing high levels of fat, 
particularly saturated fats and artificial hydrogenated  
trans-fats*, which have been linked to potential risks to 
cardiovascular health, we conducted a detailed review  
of our suppliers and our menu ingredients in conjunction  
with our external food safety consultants.
•	 	 W e 	 ha v e 	 w or k ed 	 close ly 	 with 	 all 	 o f 	 our 	 supplie rs 	 t o

identify and progress opportunities for reducing overall 
levels of saturated fat wherever possible and to provide 
healthier choices.
 *  Whilst some trans-fats occur naturally and are found in small 
amounts in meat and dairy products, concerns have been raised 
about artificial trans-fats, formed during a food manufacturing 
process called hydrogenation that turns oils into solid/semi-solid 
fats. These hydrogenated fats/oils can be found in products such 
as biscuits, cakes, margarine, processed foods and cooking oils.
Other initiatives
All our red meat is supplied from producers in the UK and 
Ireland and we have taken significant steps to reduce our 
“food miles”. This process will continue into 2010, with a 
focus on improving our supply chain efficiency and reducing 
the number of deliveries, and therefore food miles, to  
our restaurants.
TRG is a member of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange 
(SEDEX), which facilitates measurement and improvement  
i n 	 e t hi c a l 	 b u s i n e s s 	 pr a ct i c e s 	 a c r o s s 	 t h e 	 s u ppl y 	 c ha i n ; 	 8 8	 
of our food suppliers provide information describing their 
procedures and practices to the Group via SEDEX.
As in previous years, there continue to be no known 
genetically modified foods in any product the Group uses  
and new suppliers are required to confirm that they will not 
provide the Group with such products. We are also working 
with our suppliers to target and remove the “Southampton 
Institute” colourings that can cause hyperactivity in children 
and this will remain an ongoing focus during 2010.
Drink aware
All our restaurants operate an “Are You 21” policy, whereby 
we will ask for proof of identification to anyone who appears 
to be under 21. We also do not permit the sale of alcohol to 
under 18’s, even if the alcohol is for consumption with a meal. 
All of our restaurants offer a wide range of non-alcoholic 
drinks including fruit juices, carbonates, minerals and 
non-alcoholic cocktails and tap water is available for 
customers free of charge.  26 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Smoking
From 1 July 2007 we have complied fully with the legislation 
throughout the United Kingdom which has banned smoking 
in public areas.
Our people
The most important asset any company can have is its 
people. At The Restaurant Group plc we strive to nurture our 
individuals to build great teams. Anyone has the potential to 
develop within our company and we endeavour to give them 
the tools and knowledge to encourage this. This is the key to 
any successful business and our team is one of which we are 
especially proud.
We employ approximately 10,000 people and continue to 
increase this number as we expand our business. Even 
during the difficult trading conditions experienced in 2009  
we have continued to build our workforce and have created 
around 500 extra jobs, meaning more opportunities for 
individuals and the strengthening our brands nationwide.
Our policies ensure that we offer equal rights regardless of 
age, colour, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion. 
This gives us a diverse group of employees able to meet the 
challenges our market presents. We have a fair and open 
recruitment process with clear terms of employment. All staff 
are provided with a contract of employment and copies of our 
staff handbook along with other policies to ensure everyone 
is aware of our rules, expectations and procedures, including 
grievance and disciplinary issues. The Group also has a 
defined termination policy, should this be required.
Recently there has been a stronger focus on ensuring the 
recruitment of our teams complies with current legislation. 
With the UK Border Agency instigating regular visits to 
employers to check the validity of our employees’ rights  
to work in the UK we have instigated robust measures  
to prevent the possibility of TRG contravening the rules.
The Restaurant Group pays all of its employees at least the 
national minimum wage and does not utilise tips in any form 
to make up this rate. All gratuities are paid to the employees, 
with credit card tips attracting only the usual tax deductions, 
but unlike some of our competitors, no administration fee is 
taken by the company.
The Group allocates considerable resources to provide high 
quality training to our teams. Training begins on the first day 
and is an ongoing process of development and support. Our 
training team is fully qualified and deliver high quality courses, 
as well as guiding new and established team members 
throughout their development. 2009 saw the team receive  
a National Innkeeping Training Awards (‘NITA’) award for  
the ‘Best Licensee Induction’ for our ‘Manager in Training’ 
programme. TRG have been nominated again in the same 
category for 2010, as well as an individual award for one  
of our General Managers for the quality of his training. 
With our portfolio of sites it is vital that our communication is 
of a very high standard. Each day branch staff are given team 
br i e fi n gs ; 	 w e e k l y 	 m e e t i n gs 	 f or 	 s t a f f 	 a n d 	 m a na g e m e n t 	 a r e	
he ld ; 	 and 	 w e e k ly 	 communic a tions 	 pack s 	 ar e 	 is sued 	 f r om	
head office to each brand. Our senior managers are out in  
the business extensively and interact daily with their branch 
management and team members to ensure full two-way 
communication is present throughout the business.
The health and safety of our customers and employees is of 
paramount importance. The Group has extensive procedures 
to ensure we mitigate risks to our guests and teams as far as 
possible. We have very clear procedures and standards in 
place, and to enforce these we employ external auditors and 
carry out benchmarking of our restaurants. We have also 
significantly increased the level of training in health and safety 
matters across the Group in recent years to further enhance 
the clean, safe environment for our customers and staff.
Our communities
Active involvement in the local communities around our 
restaurants and pub restaurants is important to The 
Restaurant Group plc. Whilst we operate successful national 
brands our focus is on local community marketing whether 
this is for Frankie & Benny’s, with almost 200 restaurants, or 
the individual pub at the heart of a village community. The 
Restaurant Group supports staff fundraising activities at a 
brand and local level. 
During 2009 we engaged in a number of local and national 
charitable events:

Our environment
During 2009 there have been a number of developments 
regarding the Group’s commitment to mitigating its impact on 
the environment. Not only are the attitudes and expectations 
of our customers changing over time but we recognise that 
the Group’s activities impact the natural environment, most 
significantly with regard to energy consumption (and carbon 
emissions), water consumption and the creation and removal 
of waste. Innovative regulatory mechanisms are being 
introduced that may in future create a direct link between 
environmental outcomes and financial benefits or penalties.
TRG is working towards ensuring the business is compliant 
with the requirements of the Carbon Reduction Commitment. 
To that end we have established a close relationship with the 
Carbon Trust, who advise the Group on best practice and 
ensure energy-consciousness is at the heart of our strategic 
objectives covering premises design and construction, 
heating, lighting, ventilation and food production. TRG is 
working towards achieving the Carbon Trust Standard.
We have a multi-disciplinary team working on reducing  
our energy consumption through operational practices and  
staff awareness, premises design and the improved use of 
technology to monitor and control our use of energy, water 
and waste.

by the Group will require changes in behaviour for  
our whole team. The provision of accurate and timely 
management information covering energy consumption 
will become an essential tool supporting the change. A 
web-based energy-information portal to provide real time 
consumption data to restaurants and our operators has 
been developed in association with our energy consultants 
and 	 will 	 be 	 launched 	 in t o 	 the 	 busine ss 	 in 	 2 0 1 0 ; 	 and

The systems allow for remote monitoring of equipment

Reducing the resources we use and the waste we generate  
is also a key objective for the Group.

During 2009, we have also trialled a more environmentally 
friendly building design with more efficient kitchen equipment 
and other machinery. During 2010 we will monitor the savings 
in energy consumption from this restaurant and we are 
working with the Carbon Trust and other external advisers  
to develop further environmental efficiencies in our building 
design and equipment used in our operations.
Our shareholders
The Group has had a clear strategy since 2001 – to deliver 
value for shareholders by focusing on sectors within the 
eating out market that offer high barriers to entry, where we 
can generate sustainable and growing cash flows and which 
offer high returns on investment. This has led the Group  
to focus investment into the Leisure division and our 
Concessions division, which operates principally on airports. 
In 2005 the Group disposed of its high-street focussed 
brands, Est Est Est and Caffe Uno. Garfunkel’s in Central 
London, Bath and Edinburgh continues to perform well for 
the Group.
The Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review  
of operations and Group Finance Director’s report provide 
further detail on the Group’s strategy, performance during 
2009 and prospects for the Group.
Donations
No donations for political purposes have been directly made 
by the Company during the year. Charitable events, fund 
raising and sponsorship are organised by restaurants for 
organisations in their locality as described above.
Creditor payment policy
The Company’s policy is to agree the terms of payments with 
its suppliers as and when a trading relationship is established. 
The Company ensures that the terms of payment are clear 
and its policy is to abide by the agreed terms, provided the 
supplier meets its obligations. At 27 December 2009 the 
Company had no trade creditors. The Group had an  
average of 41 days (2008: 45 days) purchases outstanding  
in trade creditors. 28 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able  
to continue as a going concern while looking to maximise 
returns to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of equity (comprising issued share capital, reserves 
and retained earnings), debt, finance leases and cash and 
cash equivalents. The Group monitors its capital structure  
on a regular basis through cash flow projections and 
consideration of the cost of financing its capital.
In December 2007 the Group completed a refinancing 
exercise. As part of this the Group has externally imposed 
capital requirements. The Group has a £120m revolving 
facility in place until December 2012 and a £10m overdraft 
facility. Under the terms of the £120m revolving facility the 
Group is required to comply with its financing covenants 
whereby net interest charges must be covered by at least 
four times by EBITDA and net debt must not exceed three 
times EBITDA. These covenants are tested twice annually 
and are monitored on a regular basis. During 2009 the  
Group remained within its external limits throughout the year.
Financial risk management
The Board of The Restaurant Group plc regularly reviews the 
financial requirements of the Group and the risks associated 
therewith. The Group does not use complex financial 
instruments, and where financial instruments are used it is for 
reducing interest rate risk. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. Group operations 
are primarily financed from retained earnings and bank 
borrowings (including an overdraft facility).
In addition to the primary financial instruments, the Group 
also has other financial instruments such as debtors, 
prepayments, trade creditors and accruals that arise directly 
from the Group’s operations. Further information is provided 
in note 24 to the accounts.
Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into a 
three year interest rate swap, for an initial notional amount of 
£20m rising to £50m from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 
2008, when it reduced to £30m until 16 January 2009, at 
which date it terminated. The fixed rate for the duration of  
the three years was 4.695% (plus margin).
Effective from 18 January 2008, the Group entered into a 
further three year interest rate swap for a notional amount of 
£25m, from 18 January 2008 to 18 January 2011 at a fixed 
rate of 4.92% (plus margin). On 8 February 2010 this swap 
was terminated on payment of £1.0m.
Effective from 16 January 2009, the Group entered into a 
further two interest rate swaps: a two year interest rate swap 
for a notional amount of £20m at a rate of 2.70% (plus 
margin) and a three year interest rate swap for a notional 
amount of £20m at a rate of 2.975% (plus margin).
After the impact of the interest rate swaps, the average rate  
of interest charged during the year on the Group’s debt was 
3.56% (2008: 5.64%), and the average year-end rate was 
4.06% (2008: 2.10%). On 2009 results, net interest was 
covered 16.0 times (2008: 10.2 times) by profit before tax, 
interest and non-trading items. Based on year end debt  
and profits for 2009, a 1% rise in interest rates would  
reduce profits before tax and non-trading items by 0.5% 
(2008: 0.6%) and interest cover would reduce to 14.9 times  
(2008: 9.7 times).
At 27 December 2009 the Group had gross borrowings 
attracting interest (including overdraft) of £70m (2008: £85m) 
and cash balances of £2.8m (2008: £5.5m).
Annual General Meeting
A separate Circular is included with the mailing of the Annual 
Report to shareholders setting out the resolutions to be voted 
on at the Annual General Meeting, which is to take place at 
11am on 6 May 2010 at the offices of Maclay Murray & Spens 
LLP , 	 O ne 	 London 	 W all , 	 London 	 E C 2 Y 	 5 AB .
The Board believes that the proposed resolutions to be put

best interests of shareholders and, accordingly, recommends 
that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as the 
Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial 
shareholdings in the Company.

Introduction

Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) which is constituted in accordance with  
t h e 	 r e c om m e n d a t i o n s 	 o f 	 t h e 	 C om bi n e d 	 C od e . 	 T h e 	 m e m b e r s 	 o f 	 t h e 	 C om mit t e e 	 du r i n g 	 t h e 	 y e a r 	 w e r e 	 T o n y 	 Hu g h e s 	 a n d

None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company (other than as shareholders). The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. In determining 
the other executive Directors’ remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson (non-executive Chairman) 
about its proposals.

provided advice to the Committee, encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executive Directors of the high calibre  
needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward them for top quartile sector performance and enhancing value to 
shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration 
package are undertaken by the Committee. In addition, the Committee determines the remuneration for the Chairman. The 
remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board. The Company’s policy is that a substantial 
proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related. There are four main elements  
of the remuneration package for executive Directors:

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Basic salary
An executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an 
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole 
and by reference to remuneration levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors. 
Following a recommendation from the executive Directors to hold salaries, the Remuneration Committee determined at the 
December 2008 salary review that no increase to the basic salary of executive Directors would be applied for the 2009 
financial year. At the December 2009 review, it was determined that basic salaries for executive Directors should increase 
modestly for the 2010 financial year, with such increases capped at 1.5%. This is below the average salary increase of 2% 
provided to other employees in the Group.

In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car 
(or car allowance), and health and life insurance.

targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the 
financial year. The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid in respect of performance in 2010 is 100% (reduced 
from the 120% limit operated for 2009) of basic annual salary and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be 
outstanding. For any bonus payment made between 75% and 100% of salary there is a reinvestment commitment for the 
Director into shares in The Restaurant Group plc, and these shares can form part of the matching element described in

exceptional circumstances in relation to retention and recruitment of employees. For awards expected to be made shortly

SAYE Scheme
The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which 
options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value. Eligible employees are full time employees and executive 
Directors who have worked for the Group for at least one year. Under the terms of the Scheme, the eligible employees are  
able to purchase shares under a three-year savings contract. Awards under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004, 2006  
and 2008 to eligible employees and Directors. It is planned to make an offer to all eligible employees under the SAYE scheme  
during 2010.
Pension arrangements
Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans. The Company makes a 
contribution at a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Director’s pension plan. To the extent that 
this 	 funding 	 e x ce eds 	 the 	 r ele v an t 	 curr e n t 	 HMR C 	 limit , 	 the 	 sur plus 	 ma y 	 be 	 paid 	 as 	 a 	 salar y 	 supple me n t . 	 T he r e 	 ar e 	 no 	 un f unded

As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Company’s TSR performance with the FTSE 350 Travel and 
Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant  
to gauging the Company’s relative performance. This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2009, of £100 invested in  
The Restaurant Group plc on 31 December 2004 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index

executive Directors have contracts which are subject to one year’s notice by either party. In the event of early termination 
(including following a change of control in the Company), the Directors’ contracts provide for compensation in line with their 
contractual notice period. 
The details of the executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:

Non-executive Directors
The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three-year period (thereafter renewable  
for periods of three years). They are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years. Alan Jackson and  
John Jackson were re-elected in 2009. John Jackson has notified the Board of his intention to step down from the Board  
of Directors at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 May 2010. The non-executive Directors’ 
appointments were made as follows:

*  Alan Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001. From 1 January 2006 he has held  
the position of non-executive Chairman.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration (with the exception of Alan Jackson) is 
determined by the Board based on a review of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time 
commitment and responsibilities of each role. The basic fee paid to the non-executive Directors (excluding Alan Jackson) in 
the year was £50,000 (2008: £50,000) (pro rated by tenure of service). Alan Jackson’s fee was £300,000 (2008: £300,000). 
No increases to the fees of non-executive Directors have been made in respect of 2010.

Note (1): Alan Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of  
45p per share. This option was divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain 
performance criteria are met. The Company’s share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first 
tranche, 105p in the case of the second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group 
before any tranche of the option can be exercised. For the second and third tranches, half of each tranche of the option may 
be exercised after three years and half after four years in each case following the date of the grant. Each tranche of the 
option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by then been met. If, however, the 
target share price relating to any tranche of the option is met within this period that tranche will remain exercisable until ten 
years following the date of grant. If a change of control of the Company occurs, Alan Jackson is entitled to exercise the 
option in full. The Company’s share price has met the criteria of the three tranches and the Remuneration Committee is 
satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group. Alan Jackson has 
exercised all of those options available to him under the first and second tranches, and has exercised 600,000 options 
available to him from the third tranche. Consequently Alan Jackson has 200,000 options remaining available to him at an 
exercise price of 45p. 36 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009

The Board as a whole reviews the risks facing the Group, and the processes on mitigating those risks, on a regular and formal 
basis. The Board also reviews the work carried out by the Internal Audit function.
Audit Committee frequency
The Committee meets at least twice a year. During 2009 two meetings of the Committee were held with full attendance.
Audit Committee process
The Committee discharges its responsibilities, as defined in its terms of reference, through a series of Audit Committee 
meetings throughout the year at which detailed reports are presented for review. The Committee commissions reports from 
external advisers or Company management, either after consideration of the Company’s major risks or in response to 
developing issues. The Committee has the opportunity to meet privately with the external auditors at least twice a year and 
liaises with Company management in considering areas for review.
During the year, the Committee considered the following matters:

required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards 	 r equir e 	 us 	 t o 	 comply 	 with 	 the 	 A udit ing 	 P ract ice s 	 Board ’ s 	 ( “ AP B ’ s ” ) 	 E thic al 	 Standards 	 f or 	 A udit ors .
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have

Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts
Significant accounting policies
The Restaurant Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and registered in Scotland. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended 27 December 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in its associate. 
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the 
European Union. 
(b) Going concern basis
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquires, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future at the time of approving the financial statements. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
and further comments on going concern are set out in the report of the Directors on pages 21 to 24.
(c) Basis of preparation
The accounting year runs to a Sunday within seven days of 31 December each year which will be a 52 or 53 week period. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except derivative financial instruments which are held at their fair value. Non-current assets and assets 
held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Statements’ (revised 2007).
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that  
are regularly viewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. Following 
consideration of the operating segments of the Group, two segments, Leisure and Concessions, have been identified and for 
the purposes of IFRS, the performance measure has been identified as operating profit. Both segments derive revenue from 
the operation of restaurants and pub restaurants but are distinguishable on the basis of a combination of factors including 
location, customers, allocation of resources, management reporting and new site identification. There has been no change  
in segments following the adoption of IFRS 8 and there has been no material change to the allocation of assets between the 
operating segments since the year end.
IAS 1 (revised) requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from  
the income statement, and a statement of comprehensive income. As a result, the financial statements now include a 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and a consolidated statement of changes in equity showing changes  
in each component of equity for each year presented.
These changes in accounting policies have not resulted in any prior year restatements and consequently, no third balance 
sheet has been presented. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 41
Future accounting policies
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were  
in issue but not yet effective. In some cases these standards and guidance had not been endorsed by the European Union:
•	 IF RS 	 1 	 ( ame nded ) 	 / IA S 	 2 7 	 ( ame nded ) 	 Cost 	 o f 	 an 	 in v e stme n t 	 in 	 a 	 Subsidiar y , 	 Join t ly 	 Con tr olled 	 En t it y 	 or 	 As socia t e
•	 IF RS 	 3 	 ( r e vised 	 2 0 08 ) 	 Busine ss 	 Combina tions
• 	 I A S 	 2 7 	 ( r e v i s e d 	 2 0 0 8 ) 	 C o n s o l i d a t e d 	 a n d 	 Se p a r a t e 	 F i na n c ia l 	 S t a t e m e n t s
•	 IA S 	 2 8 	 ( r e vised 	 2 0 08 ) 	 In v e stme n ts 	 in 	 Associa t e s

• 	 I m pr o v e m e n t s 	 t o 	 I F R S s 	 ( A pr i l 	 2 0 0 9 )
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and interpretations in future periods will have a material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group except for the treatment of the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates 
when IFRS 3 (revised 2008), IAS 27 (revised 2008) and IAS 28 (revised 2008) come into effect for business combinations  
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
(d) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account, regardless of management’s intention to 
exercise that option or warrant. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of 
associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant 
influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount would 
be reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only 
to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(e) Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance 
sheet. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. The 
profit and loss accounts for overseas operations are translated at the average rate of exchange for the periods covered by the 
accounts. Exchange differences that relate to the net equity investment in overseas activities are taken directly to reserves. 
(f) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing 
and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
i n s t r u m e n t s 	 f or 	 t r a d i n g 	 p u r po s e s . 	 Ho w e v e r , 	 d e r i v a t i v e s 	 t ha t 	 do 	 n o t 	 qu a l i f y 	 f or 	 h e dg e 	 a c c o u n t i n g 	 a r e 	 a c c o u n t e d 	 f or 	 a s	 
trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments 
are stated at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Ho w e v e r , 	 whe r e 	 deriv a tiv e s 	 qualif y 	 f or 	 hedge 	 accoun t ing , 	 r e cognition 	 o f 	 an y 	 r e sultan t 	 gain 	 or 	 los s 	 de pe nds 	 on 	 the 	 na tur e 	 o f 	
the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. 42 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy l). 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items  
of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. The owner-occupied property (excluding land element) acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal  
to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated 
depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy l). Lease payments are accounted for as described in 
accounting policy s.
Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an 
item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense  
as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item 
of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold land    Indefinite
Freehold buildings    50 years
Long and short leasehold property   Term of lease or 50 years, whichever is lower
Fixtures and equipment    3-10 years
Motor vehicles     4 years
Computer equipment    3-5 years
(h) Intangible assets – Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents amounts arising  
on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since  
1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable 
assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been 
reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is 
formally tested bi-annually for impairment (see accounting policy l). In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill  
is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses (see accounting policy l).
(j) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 43
(l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. 
For property, plant and equipment, the carrying value of each cash generating unit is compared to its estimated value  
in use. Value in use calculations are based on discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the CGU (between  
3 and 50 years). Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.  
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
(m) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company and all options are equity settled. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair  
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market based conditions not achieving the  
threshold for vesting.
(n) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of  
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current  
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
(o) Deferred and current tax
Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit at the current rate. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all 
temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred 
tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are 
expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
(p) Pensions
The Group makes contributions for selected employees into defined contribution pension plans and these contributions  
are charged to the income statement as they become payable. The Group does not operate any defined benefit plans.
(q) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract  
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(r) Revenue
Revenue represents amounts received and receivable for services and goods provided (excluding value added tax and 
voluntary gratuities left by customers for the benefit of employees) and is recognised at the point of sale. 44 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009

rental expense.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest  
on the remaining balance of the liability.

(iv) Borrowing costs
Debt is stated net of borrowing costs which are spread over the term of the loan. All other borrowing costs are recognised  
in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
(t) Dividend policy
In accordance with IAS 10, ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not 
recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received 
approval by shareholders.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies as described above, management has made a number of 
judgements and estimations of which the following are the most significant.
a) Impairment of carrying value of associate
The investment in Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited and the loan note of £10.4m receivable from a subsidiary of that 
company were fully provided against in the years ended 30 December 2007 and 31 December 2006. Following a review of 
the trading performance of the company, the Directors have concluded that this treatment is appropriate and no adjustment 
has been made in either the current or the previous year. Further details are provided in note 13.
b) Impairment of goodwill
The Group formally determines whether goodwill is impaired on a bi-annual basis. This requires an estimate of the value in  
use of the assets to which goodwill is ascribed to. Estimating the value-in-use requires the Group to make an estimate of the 
future cash flows from those assets and to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. No impairment of goodwill is required in the year ended 27 December 2009. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

Results are stated excluding non-trading items 
  
Additional non-statutory income statement information is provided as a useful guide to underlying trading performance. The 
2009 and 2008 results include a number of items which are of a one-off nature or are unrelated to the year’s result and hence 
are not representative of the underlying trading performance of the business. The following segmental analysis excludes these 
non-trading items, as described in note 5, and is provided to aid understanding of the income statement and should be read in 
conjunction with, rather than as a substitute for, the reported information.

after the provisional accounting was completed. These adjustments were made in the year ended 28 December 2008 in accordance with 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and resulted in a decrease of £0.3m in the goodwill on acquisition.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Therefore, goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
Blube ck e rs 	 L imit ed 	 and 	 Br unning 	 and 	 P rice 	 L imit ed 	 is 	 monit or ed 	 and 	 an 	 impair me n t 	 t e st 	 is 	 c ar r ied 	 out 	 which 	 compar e s 	 the 	
value in use to the carrying value.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year  
business plans approved by the Board. Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.

and this investment is accounted for using the equity method. Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited has an accounting 
year end date of 31 March and as there is no material benefit in making the accounting year end co-terminus with the Group, 
no change has been made. 
As a result of a detailed review of the trading performance of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, the investment has 
been recorded at £nil and a loan note of £10.4m, plus interest receivable, due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of Living 
Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, was fully provided against as at 27 December 2009 and 28 December 2008.  
The Group’s share of the post-tax result of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited for the year ended 27 December 2009 
was a loss of £0.04m (2008: loss of £0.61m). This loss has not been recognised in the income statement, in accordance with 
IAS 28 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’, as the investment has a carrying value of £nil.
Interest is receivable from LV Finance Limited on the loan note of £10.4m at a rate of LIBOR. In the year ended  
27 December 2009 £0.2m of interest has accrued of which the Group has recognised £nil (2008: £0.6m of which the  
Group recognised £nil). Consequently in addition to the loan note of £10.4m outstanding at that date, £1.1m of interest 
receivable had accrued, of which, under the terms of the agreement, £1.0m was overdue.

21 Share-based payment schemes
The Group operates a number of share option schemes, details of which are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report  
on pages 29 to 36. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” not to account  
for share options granted before 7 November 2002.
The charge recorded in the financial statements of the Group in respect of share-based payments is £2.1m (2008: £1.9m).
The other reserve account reflects the credit to equity made in respect of the charge for share options made through the 
income statement and the purchase of shares in the market in order to satisfy the vesting of existing and future share awards

Save As You Earn Scheme
Under the Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) scheme, the Board may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to 
UK-based employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price 
of the shares for the five days prior to invitation. Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each 
month for the three-year savings period. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise 
their options using the funds saved. If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved 
and the options expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group. In exceptional 
circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period. 
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

  Expected volatility is the measure of the amount by which the share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. In order to calculate 
volatility, the movement in the return index (share price plus dividends re-invested) over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to  
the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated. For the discount for the Conditional awards, the 
calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of three years prior to the grant has been used.

*  Total financial liabilities attracting interest were £70.0m (2008: £85.0m). Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and  
are dependent on LIBOR and base rate. The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.22% (2008: 2.98%).  
After taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 4.06% 
(2008: 2.10%).
On 19 December 2007 the Group entered a 5 year facility agreement for £120m which was utilised from 17 January 2008. 
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the bank’s margin, which is dependent on 
the debt to EBITDA ratio. The Group has a £10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable 
at the bank’s overdraft rate.
The Group has £50.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings at 27 December 2009 (28 December 
2008: £35.0m).

Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into an interest rate swap for an initial notional amount of £20m, rising to 
£50m from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduced to £30m until 16 January 2009, when it terminated. The 
fixed rate for the duration of the three years was 4.695%.
Effective from 18 January 2008 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of £25m for three years.  
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 4.92%. On 8 February 2010 the interest rate swap was terminated on 
payment of £1.0m. 
Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of £20m for two years.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The Group has derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps and in accordance with IAS 39 these have been 
valued at 27 December 2009. 
The fair value of these instruments was £2.2m and this is accounted for as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet (2008: 
£1.1m liability). The movement in fair value has been recorded as a non-trading item in the consolidated income statement.
All financial assets and liabilities, excluding the interest rate swaps, are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the 
carrying value to approximate their fair value. 68 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009
24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the 
Group. Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions. The Group is exposed 
to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet 
their obligations. 
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from 
customer transactions. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but 
management believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past 
due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of £10.4m due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Group’s 
associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited. This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures 
Restaurants Limited, formerly Est Est Est Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limited’s 
bank. In 2007 , following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board 
made full provision against the loan note due (further details are provided in note 13). 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and 
liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank 
facilities by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The 
Group’s loan facilities, which mature in 2012 (as set out in note (a) above) ensure continuity of funding, provided the Group 
continues to meet its covenant requirements (as detailed in the report of the Directors on page 28).
(d) Foreign currency risk
As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign 
exchange rate is limited. The Group operates three restaurants in Spain that are serviced by local Euro denominated debt. The 
Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
(e) Interest rate risk
Exposure to interest rate movements is controlled through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a 
balanced interest rate profile and to ensure that a minimum level of borrowings are at fixed rates for the next two years in line 
with the Group’s treasury strategy. Details of the current swaps are set out in note (a) above. The interest rate profile is 
reviewed on a regular basis.

Amount due for settlement after one year     2,718 2,652
Present value of lease obligations     2,994 2,926
Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions 
of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease. There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor. The interest 
rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each 
lease. The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as £3.0m (2008: £2.9m).
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: 
    Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 
    2009 2009 2008 2008

    559,852 44,578 558,652 46,371
The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor. There are 
no restrictions imposed by the Group’s operating leases, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover. For 
these properties, primarily in the Group’s Concession division, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as 
detailed in the concession agreement. Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the 
estimated amount payable.

27 Contingent liabilities
The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and 
therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this 
date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement. Consequently, should the current tenant default, the 
landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments. As and when  
any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
28 Related party transactions
Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Group’s 38% holding.  
A loan note of £10.4m is due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which 
attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR. During the year ended 27 December 2009, £0.2m of interest was accrued of which the 
Group recognised £nil (2008: £0.6m of which the Group recognised £nil). Consequently, in addition to the £10.4m loan note 
outstanding at 27 December 2009, £1.1m interest had accrued, of which £1.0m was overdue under the terms of the 
agreement. Further details are provided in note 13. 
Alan Jackson is a non-executive director of Charles Wells Limited, an independent brewing, pub and distribution company. 
During 2005, The Restaurant Group plc entered into a lease for a site owned by Charles Wells Limited and subsequently this 
site was converted into a Frankie & Benny’s restaurant. No premium was paid by the Group to Charles Wells Limited. The 
Group has entered into the lease with Charles Wells Limited, on an arm’s length basis, with an annual rent of £73,850 per 
annum. In addition, the Group purchased products with a value totalling £0.9m (2008: £0.9m) from Charles Wells Limited 
during the year, on an arm’s length basis. No balance was directly outstanding at the year end. Alan Jackson received no 
remuneration or compensation in respect of these transactions.
Remuneration in respect of key management personnel, defined as the Directors for this purpose, is disclosed in note 6. 
Further information concerning the Directors’ remuneration is provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages  
29 to 36, of which pages 33 to 36 are audited.

Investments
Investments are valued at cost less any provision for impairment.

In accordance with FRS 21, ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not 
recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received 
approval by shareholders.
Share-based payment transactions
The share options have been accounted for as an expense in the company in which the employees are employed, using a 
valuation based on the Stochastic simulation model.
In accordance with an available election in FRS 20, share-based payment awards granted before 7 November 2002 have not 
been subject to a charge. An increase in the investment held by the Company in the subsidiary in which the employees are 
employed, with a corresponding increase in equity, is recognised in the accounts of the Company. Information in respect  
of the Company’s share option schemes is provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
The value is accounted for as a capital contribution in relevant Group subsidiaries that employ the staff members to whom 
awards of share options have been made. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

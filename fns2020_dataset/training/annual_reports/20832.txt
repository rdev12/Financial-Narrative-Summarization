market share. This approach is underpinned by incentive 
structures which reward underwriters for both short and 
long term profitability.

Amlin Re Europe: investing for future growth
Amlin Re Europe represents Amlin’s second major start-up following the successful 
establishment of Amlin Bermuda in 2006. Continental European insurers do not readily 
buy treaty reinsurance from Lloyd’s or Bermudian reinsurers, preferring to deal with local 
reinsurers in their own language, although Amlin London already provides catastrophe 
reinsurance to some European companies. The local relationships of Amlin Re Europe’s 
experienced underwriting team, combined with Amlin’s existing reinsurance franchise, 
strong ratings and long-standing broker relationships, are already proving to be an 
attractive business proposition to the target client base. Amlin Re Europe will further 
diversify our reinsurance portfolio by geography and class and Amlin AG gives us a 
substantial European platform from which to further develop the business over time. 
Profitable underwriting across the insurance cycle, combined with a diverse and balanced 
portfolio, enhances capital efficiency and helps to offset volatility within higher margin 
catastrophe lines. This chart shows, in premium terms, how Amlin’s business mix has 
developed since 2002 and how the growth in catastrophe reinsurance underwriting since 
2005 has been offset by the less volatile commercial and specialty business lines of recent 
acquisitions, particularly ACI.
Amlin’s market position as a specialist 
international insurer and reinsurer remains 
advantageous. Our business is small enough 
to be flexible and opportunistic, able to shrink 
or grow individual lines according to market 
conditions, and we have excellent and long-
standing relationships with key brokers. 
Nevertheless we remain mindful of the long 
term global consolidation trend in insurance 
and the likelihood that this will be given further 
momentum by Solvency II. Major brokers are 
increasingly focused on streamlining their 
distribution and concentrating premium flows 
with the optimum carriers in each market 
segment. Amlin needs to have sufficient critical 
mass to count in this changing environment. 
During 2010, we continued to invest in the  
core business, extending our underwriting scope 
and expertise through targeted recruitment. 
Given that one of our strategic objectives is for 
Amlin to be seen as ‘the place to work’, it was 
pleasing that we were able to attract a very high 
quality cadre of senior underwriters to join the 
Group in 2010, mainly for Amlin Re Europe but  
also in London and Bermuda. We also further 
strengthened regional management and operational 
resources in ACI, Amlin France and Bermuda. 
We continue to see suitable acquisitions as 
important to our longer term growth. During 
2010 we reviewed our acquisition strategy in 
the light of valuable lessons learned from recent 
acquisitions. This is now informing our planning 
to ensure that we are fully resourced to integrate 
further acquisitions effectively in the future. 
The Group made further significant progress 
towards Solvency II with the pre-application 
preparation completed on schedule. This was 
a major achievement which reflects the hard 
work and commitment of a substantial team 
of colleagues across the Group. It is becoming 
increasingly clear that Internal Model approval  
will be crucial to the success of businesses such 
as Amlin in the future and we remain confident  
of achieving that objective. We continue to expect 
that Amlin’s Target Operating Model, which is at 
the centre of our preparations for Solvency II  
( pp.41), will deliver substantial benefits 
and enhance Amlin’s competitive position. In 
particular, we see leading edge risk management 
as a crucial competitive advantage for the future. 
People 
Once again turnover of total employees and 
senior underwriters was low at 5.2% and 3.7% 
respectively. The stability of our employee base 
is an important asset, particularly as the business 
grows and we meet the challenge of extending the  
‘Amlin DNA’, which has been the foundation of the  
Group’s success, across the broader business. 
Amlin’s attainment of the first Chartered Insurer 
status in the London Market was a resounding 
endorsement of the professionalism and expertise 
of our people and underlines our continued 
commitment to our Vision of becoming  
‘the global reference point for quality in  
each of our markets’.
Employees across the Group again showed 
teamwork, dedication and commitment to 
meet these varied demands and deliver value 
to shareholders and clients. I admire and thank 
them for their outstanding performance.

Business development
As described in the market reviews ( pp.22-25), 
the trading environment for Amlin London was 
variable. Despite the market losses generated 
by the Chile and New Zealand earthquakes 
and other major losses such as the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, pricing on much of Amlin 
London’s portfolio weakened during the year. 
Nevertheless, there were opportunities to write 
profitable new business, mainly in Marine and 
Property and Casualty lines. We continued to 
invest in additional underwriting expertise, with 
the recruitment of Leading Class Underwriters in 
Hull, Specie and Professional Lines to the Marine 
and Property and Casualty teams respectively. 
Reinsurance pricing, although under pressure, 
remained attractive, particularly for US risks 
where catastrophe pricing on Amlin’s portfolio 
was within 10% of peak levels. Reinsurance 
income consequently remained relatively  
stable. In line with our strategy to have balanced 
portfolios of risk within each class of business, 
Amlin has a substantial international reinsurance 
book alongside its US catastrophe exposures. 
The general pattern of the last decade has seen 
this profitable international catastrophe portfolio 
counterbalance large US catastrophe claims, 
for example in 2004, 2005 and 2008. A second 
quiet year for US catastrophe claims in 2010 
meant that the returns on the US catastrophe 
portfolio and the contribution of other profitable 
reinsurance lines such as risk excess of loss 
helped to mitigate the effects of the notable 
losses experienced on the reinsurance account.
In the marine market, the first part of the year 
saw a general softening of rates across the 
majority of marine business lines, but following 
the Deepwater Horizon loss this trend reversed 
for the offshore energy and energy liability 
accounts, where rates showed a strong upturn 
during the second half of the year reflecting 
substantially increased demand for liability 
insurance. Energy liability and control of well 
rates increased by up to 50%, in particular for 
deepwater drilling risks. The environment for 
underwriting energy business also benefited 
during 2010 from the improvement in both  
the economy and the oil price which led to  
an increase in drilling activity. 
The US property and casualty market remained 
highly competitive and rating across the majority 
of business lines continued to soften. As a result, 
we reduced exposures in areas no longer offering 
sufficient potential for profit, while looking to 
maintain the underlying quality of our core  
client base. The financial impact of the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes on Amlin’s Property 
and Casualty portfolio was modest and well 
contained within reserves. There was a tightening 
of terms and conditions for loss affected parts  
of the international book and we witnessed  
some withdrawals from the market. However  
we remain in the soft part of the insurance cycle. 
During 2010, although there were further 
significant airline losses, this failed to address 
the considerable over capacity within the aviation 
market, which again made it difficult to obtain 
adequate pricing, particularly for airline business. 
An exception was the general aviation market, 
where we cautiously expanded our participation 
to take advantage of improving pricing.
In November 2009 we acquired Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting Limited, a Lloyd’s coverholder which 
provides specialist insurance to the livestock 
industry. During 2010, the business was fully 
integrated and as anticipated has already proved 
a valuable complement to our well-established 
Bloodstock account. 
In January 2010, we acquired Lead Yacht 
Underwriters, one of the largest and most 
highly respected agencies servicing super and 
mega-yacht business, which compliments Haven 
Knox-Johnson, which operates at the smaller end 
of the market.
Client service 
Despite more competitive market conditions Amlin 
London maintained a high level of retention across 
the portfolio, at 86% (2009: 91%), reflecting the 
value placed on our expertise and high service 
standards by brokers and clients. During the 
year , we again participated in the annual survey 
conducted by Gracechurch Consulting 1 of the 
attitudes of 200 UK-based brokers towards the 
claims services offered by insurers in the London 
market. Amlin ranked third overall, compared to 
second in 2009, but continued to perform above 
the market average across all the service attributes 
covered by the survey and led the market on  
broker perception of a ‘strong commitment to 
paying fair claims’.
As a result of the continued consolidation among 
the major brokers, 51% of the international 
insurance and reinsurance business handled  
by Amlin is generated by the three largest global 
brokers Aon, Willis and Marsh.

2010 Highlights
  Profitable result overall and in reinsurance, despite international 
catastrophe claims 
  Growth of 3.9% in GWP to £889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million)
  Combined ratio of 80% despite £132.2 million of major catastrophe claims
  Improved risk reporting, expanded use of catastrophe models and 
calibration of technical pricing as part of preparation for Solvency II
  New business growth in reinsurance, marine and property and casualty 
  Continued investment in underwriting teams 
  Further strengthening of relationships with key brokers.
A priority for 2010 was to further develop 
strategic relationships with key brokers and 
to identify and target business development 
opportunities. As part of this process we also 
entered into strategic partnerships with two 
brokers in order to secure high quality new 
business opportunities for the future. 
Underwriting performance
Gross written premium increased by 3.9% to 
£889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million). Much 
of the increase was due to net new business 
generated within the Aviation, Marine and 
Property and Casualty business units, following 
investment in underwriting teams and a focus on 
opportunities where rating conditions proved more 
attractive. Net earned premium was up by 16.8%, 
reflecting an increase in net written premium in 
2009 and 2010 and the earning of 2009 premium 
at more favourable exchange rates.
The average renewal rate decrease was 3.1%, 
driven by average reductions on reinsurance 
business of 4.7%. Average reductions of 2.2% 
and 5.0% were also evident for the Property and 
Casualty and Aviation business units respectively. 
Marine rates were broadly stable. 
The division achieved a combined ratio of 80% 
(2009: 71%). The claims ratio at 44% (2009: 
28%) increased by 15% due to the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes. Prior period reserve 
movements were £80.8 million (2009: £95.1 
million). Across the division, reserves for 2003 
and prior years, which are well developed, have 
now been set at close to the actuarial best 
estimates, releasing £20.0 million at year end. 
This change has been made to avoid consistent 
increases in the reserving strength of the division. 
The expense ratio was 36% (2009: 43%). The 
decrease reflects a positive foreign exchange 
swing, with a weaker US dollar in 2009 relative 
to 2010.

Return of capital

underwriting cycle the Group will hold equity capital in excess of our forecast 
capital requirements. In the absence of opportunities to deploy this capital 
at attractive rates of return we look to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Since 2006, through a combination of a progressive dividend strategy, special 
dividend and ‘B’ share issue, we have returned £593.7 million. We have also 
repurchased £27.6 million of capital through share buy backs.

the global reference point for quality  
in each of our markets
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 12 Overview Our Vision
Vision
Last year, we reviewed the Vision and strategy 
for the Group which had been established in 
2005. We concluded that, with minor changes, it 
continues to provide a robust framework for the 
delivery	of	shareholder	value.	The	core	objective	
of this strategy remains achieving a cross cycle 
return on equity of at least 15%. We believe that 
there	is	a	positive	correlation	between	profitable	
growth and the price to book multiple and hence 
creation of shareholder value. We intend to deliver 
significant	growth	over	the	insurance	cycle	through	
expansion of the platforms and markets in which 
Amlin operates. 
A key aspect of our strategy is the focus on 
maintaining a balance between catastrophe and 
non-catastrophe exposures within our portfolio, 
together with a broad spread of risk by geography 
and class. We aim for the mean expected 
profitability	of	our	total	business	to	offset	claims	
(after reinsurance) in the event of any of the 
extreme catastrophe scenarios to which the 
Group’s catastrophe underwriting is exposed.  
The diversity of the business has been 
fundamental	to	our	financial	and	operating	
performance in recent years and also provides 
the balance to allow our catastrophe business  
to grow. We continue to focus on ways in which  
we can develop our non-catastrophe business, 
generated via alternative platforms and in 
different geographies. Amlin Re Europe will 
contribute to that diversity, giving the Group 
access to the substantial Continental European 
reinsurance market and over time developing 
another diverse business stream. The continued 
growth of Amlin UK as market conditions improve,  
and following recent strategic investment, will 
also expand our non-catastrophe earnings. 
We continue to invest in our underwriting and 
marketing capabilities to develop our business.
Growth through acquisition is a key element 
of our plans as we believe that organic growth 
alone is less likely to deliver the diversity, quality 
and scale of growth targeted over our strategic 
horizon. Investments in the UK and France in 
2008 were initial steps in this direction and the  
acquisition of ACI in 2009 was a material step 
forward.	During	2010,	we	focused	on	the	
integration of ACI and the start up of Amlin  
Re Europe. 
The cycle management focus of our Vision is 
crucial as we move forward in challenging market 
conditions. Our underwriting discipline underpins 
Amlin’s record of robust cross cycle performance. 
The business is well positioned to generate 
significant	growth	when	the	trading	environment	
is favourable, but equally well placed to continue 
to perform in soft market conditions, where 
the diversity of the portfolio continues to offer 
opportunities for selective expansion. As the  
cycle turns, we have the people and the capital  
in	place	to	grow	significantly.
Strategic priorities for 2011
The Group’s priorities represent the key 
benchmarks against which we will measure our 
progress in 2011. Other related or business 
area	specific	objectives	are	recognised	in	the	
remainder of this report.

 
Continued optimisation of the core business
 
Further alignment of the business and 
operations with Solvency II requirements

continued performance improvement of its

Chairman’s statement
Positive performance
“ During 2010 we continued to expand the 
scope of our business, both organically 
and through acquisition. We also further 
strengthened our operational capability  
in order to position the Group for future 
growth when market conditions allow.”
Results and dividend
2010 was a year with both substantial catastrophe 
claims and a high incidence of large risk losses. 
Pre-tax	profits	of	£259.2	million,	with	a	return	 
on equity of 13.9%, were as a consequence  
lower than in 2009. Earthquakes in Chile and 
New	Zealand	accounted	for	just	over	£200	million	
of catastrophe claims, while storms in Europe and 
floods	in	Australia,	together	with	the	Deepwater	
Horizon oil spill added to the incremental level  
of claims. 
Protecting and serving our policyholders is our 
business. We also strive to manage the business 
in a manner that produces excellent cross cycle 
returns for shareholders. Two features stand 
out in the 2010 result. Firstly, the underlying 
performance of most of Amlin’s portfolios 
was satisfactory. Secondly, the diversity of our 
reinsurance portfolio meant that the reinsurance 
account	as	a	whole	was	profitable	in	2010,	
despite	the	international	earthquake claims.	
The	Board	is	proposing	a	final	dividend	of	15.8	
pence per share (2009 second interim dividend 
13.5p), making total dividends declared for the 
year of 23.0 pence per share, a 15.0% increase 
over	2009.	The	final	dividend	will	be	paid	on	 
19	May	2011,	subject	to	shareholder	approval,	to	
shareholders on the register on 25 March 2011.
Steadily growing the dividend, as illustrated again 
this year, remains our goal. However, we also 
remain committed to the active management  
of capital and the Board has authorised up to  
£75 million of share buy backs.
Strategic progress
During	2010	we	continued	to	focus	on	the	
delivery of our strategic vision through the 
expansion of the platforms from which Amlin 
operates,	which	we	believe	will	support	significant	
growth once trading conditions are favourable. 
Amlin	Corporate	Insurance	(ACI),	was	the	subject	
of concentrated attention in every aspect of its 
activities and, while the 2010 performance was 
disappointing,	we	remain	confident	that	it	is	on	
course to meet our performance targets. 
During	2010	we	established	a	reinsurance	
business in Switzerland by re-domiciling Amlin 
Bermuda to Zurich and recruiting a team of 
reinsurance specialists to create a new business 
division which trades as Amlin Re Europe. We 
were pleased to welcome our new colleagues 
in Amlin Re Europe and delighted that they 
exceeded their challenging budget for business 
attaching on 1 January 2011. Our team in 
Bermuda collaborated in this restructuring but 
remain based in Hamilton where they continue  
to run a very successful division for Amlin. 
In addition to these developments, our two  
UK-based operations, Amlin London and 
Amlin UK, maintained their focus on business 
development with real success, strengthening 
links with brokers, bringing in new teams and 
acquiring additional portfolios. Enhancing the 
performance of our established platforms is  
as important as developing new opportunities. 
In terms of supporting our strategy, we have 
remained focused on enhanced reporting of 
risk across the organisation, to enable us to 
make progress towards meeting Solvency II 
requirements.	This	is	a	major	project	for	the	
Group which continues to have the full  
support and engagement of the Board.
As we prepare for future growth, the value of  
the Amlin brand is becoming more apparent.  
It is a key asset to the business, founded on our 
core values, the quality of our people and our 
consistent performance. The strength of our 
brand	is	reflected	in	the	competitive	advantage	
Anglo French Underwriters (now Amlin France), 
ACI and other recent smaller acquisitions have 
derived from becoming part of the Amlin Group. 
Similarly, our brand was an important factor for 
the management team of Amlin Re Europe in  
the positive response received from brokers  
and prospective clients. 
Outlook
As anticipated, we experienced increased 
competition across most markets which were 
unaffected	by	major	losses	in	2010.	Amlin’s	
selective approach to underwriting enabled us to 
maintain satisfactory margins across much of the 
portfolio. In some market sectors, most notably 
the	UK	fleet	motor	market,	we	saw	an	improving	
trend. Following the severe winter weather and 
consequent	claims	impact	on	major	UK	insurers,	
a more widespread upturn in the UK commercial 
market may be drawing closer. Amlin UK is 
extremely well positioned to take advantage  
of this upturn when it arises. 
Amlin’s long term performance has been built on 
underwriting discipline when trading conditions 
offer limited returns, combined with opportunism 
when	there	is	scope	for	profitable	growth.	With	
established operations in the UK, Bermuda and 
Continental Europe, together with the newly 
created Swiss business, Amlin now has more 
platforms from which to grow than ever before. 
There is a real momentum throughout Amlin to 
develop and enhance our business and a strong 
capital base to support rapid expansion when 
market conditions are favourable. 
As always the level of catastrophe claims activity 
will	influence	financial	performance.	Tragically,	2011	 
has	started	with	another	major	New	Zealand	
earthquake,	which	this	time	has	led	to	significant	
loss of life. Following so quickly after the 
September 2010 event, it will take a period 
of	time	before	the	full	financial	effect	of	the	
Christchurch damage can be assessed.

Governance and the Board
Amlin continues to strive for excellence in 
corporate governance. We have a strong 
culture	of	accountability,	which	is	reflected	
throughout the organisation in the serious 
way that we operate executive processes and 
subsidiary boards. The Board has focused, not 
only on the increasingly complex regulatory 
environment and on challenging and encouraging 
executive management, but also on strategy 
development and the integration of recent 
acquisitions. Alongside the work on Solvency II, 
the Board’s consideration of risk and solvency 
has progressively deepened over the last 
couple of years, with a Board-level Risk and 
Solvency Committee, separating out some of 
the Audit Committee’s responsibilities, having 
been established with effect from 1 January of 
this	year.	I	am	pleased	that	Richard	Davey,	an	
independent non-executive, has agreed to chair 
the new committee. 
The Board was active in the debate leading 
up to the adoption of the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code, with which we intend fully to 
comply in 2011, including the annual re-election of 
Directors	from	the	AGM	this	May.	I	am	confident	
in recommending to shareholders, following 
individual as well as collective evaluation, that the 
Board possesses the necessary skills and diversity 
of experience that a complex insurer such as 
Amlin requires. Further governance details are set 
out in this Annual Report, particularly in the 
Board Corporate Governance Statement  
( pp.60), which I commend to you. 
All	of	the	Directors	are	standing	for	re-election	at	
the AGM other than Tony Holt, a non-executive 
since	his	retirement	as	Underwriting	Director	in	
2008.	I	pay	tribute	to	Tony’s	major	contribution	
to Amlin’s success since its formation in 1998. 
His continued Board involvement over the last 
two years, including at two key subsidiaries, has 
helped complete the transition of underwriting 
leadership to the next generation. For that 
reason	it	is	particularly	fitting	that	Simon	Beale,	
the	Underwriting	Director	of	Amlin	London,	is	
being	proposed	to	be	elected	as	a	Director	at	the	
forthcoming AGM in May. 
The Amlin team 
Amlin’s Vision is to be the global reference point for 
quality in each of our markets, and our people are 
crucial to attaining this goal. A pleasing recognition 
of Amlin’s long term investment in training and 
development and of the professionalism of our 
people was the granting to Amlin of Chartered 
Insurer status during	2010,	the	first	time	this	
recognition has been awarded to a London Market 
insurer . The range of skills and expertise required 
to	deliver	a	first	class	service	to	clients	is	wider	than	
ever before and we remain committed to ensuring 
that our people are well equipped to meet client 
needs wherever we operate. 
Rod	Dampier,	Head	of	Aviation	for	Amlin	London	
and a director of Amlin Underwriting Limited, 
who has been with Amlin since 1997, will be 
retiring in 2011 after more than 42 years in the 
London market. I would like to thank him for his 
contribution to establishing Amlin as one of the 
most respected aviation markets in the sector. 
Rod has been supported by a high quality and 
experienced	team	and	I	am	confident	that	his	
successor, Miles Taffs, and the team will maintain 
Amlin’s excellent underwriting record and 
considerable reputation in this class.
It has been a demanding year for Amlin, with 
challenging trading conditions, heightened 
claims activity and a rigorous focus on regulatory 
matters. We have continued to make real 
progress due to the positive leadership of Charles 
Philipps and his management colleagues, and the 
ready response of our employees. I would like to 
thank them all for their energy and commitment.
Committed to governance
The Board believes that high standards 
of corporate governance are intrinsic 
to Amlin’s culture and values. Our 
commitment to high standards 
of conduct is highlighted in the 
Corporate Governance section.

Chief Executive’s review
Well positioned for growth
“ The diversity of Amlin’s business stood  
us in good stead during 2010, generating  
a ROE of 13.9% despite substantial 
international catastrophe losses and  
a challenging trading environment.”
Charles Philipps 
Chief Executive
Financial results
2010 proved a more challenging year than 2009, 
with pricing under pressure in many areas and a 
significantly	higher	level	of	claims	events.	There	
were substantial catastrophe losses, unusually 
weighted to the international catastrophe portfolio 
rather than the US, together with a higher 
incidence of large risk losses, most notably the 
Deepwater	Horizon	oil	spill.	There	was	some	
firming	of	rates	in	loss	affected	areas	such	as	
energy, although in catastrophe reinsurance the 
impact of the Chile earthquake loss on pricing 
was modest and localised. Some sectors such  
as	UK	fleet	motor	continued	to	improve,	but	with	
these few exceptions there was a general reversal 
of price increases seen in 2009 and the market was 
softened, albeit modestly, throughout the year.
Against	this	background,	the	2010	profit	before	
tax of £259.2 million, while materially less than 
our	record	2009	profit	of	£509.1	million,	still	
represents a solid result, and is a sign of the good 
underlying performance of our core Syndicate 
2001 businesses, as well as the diversity within our 
reinsurance businesses in London and Bermuda. 
The return on equity was 13.9% (2009: 37.0%).
The	increased	claims	activity	is	reflected	in	the	
higher combined ratio of 88% (2009: 72%), which 
brought the underwriting contribution down to  
£202.1 million (2009: £365.8 million). The 
investment return of 4.0% on average invested 
assets was creditable given the low interest rate 
environment, but was nevertheless also down  
on 2009 (5.9%).
Amlin	London’s	contribution	to	pre-tax	profit	was	
£143.3 million (2009: £177.5 million). Having 
incurred	significantly	more	major	catastrophe	
claims, of £132.2 million, compared with  
£22.1 million in 2009, this result demonstrates 
solid underlying performance. 
Amlin UK contributed £23.5 million (2009:  
£46.4	million),	the	lower	result	reflecting	the	
trough of the UK commercial trading cycle and 
lower	reserve	releases,	having	benefited	from	 
a one-off release of £16.0 million in 2009.
Amlin Bermuda contributed £103.4 million 
(2009:	£249.6	million)	also	reflecting	the	higher	
level of catastrophe losses of £103.9 million 
compared to £20.4 million in 2009, this business 
being predominantly a catastrophe reinsurer. 
That both Amlin Bermuda and the reinsurance 
business in Amlin London produced reasonable 
returns, despite the impact of the Chile and  
New Zealand earthquake losses, illustrates  
the geographical balance of Amlin’s 
catastrophe portfolio between international  
and US exposures as part of our overall approach 
to catastrophe underwriting.
Neither Amlin London nor Amlin Bermuda 
accrued recoveries under their new retrocessional 
reinsurance programmes which were put in place 
in 2010. These new programmes were designed 
to protect Amlin against an accumulation of 
catastrophe losses, with Amlin’s net exposure to 
a	second	and	subsequent	major	events	dropping	
progressively if the claims	from	the	first	event	or	
cumulative	losses	exceeded	pre-defined	amounts.	
With	the	2010	catastrophes	we	remained	just	
within our retention levels but would have borne 
significantly	lower	retained	net	losses	if	there	had	
been	further	major	events.	
Amlin France, which for most of 2010 included 
ACI’s former French business, suffered from 
windstorm	Xynthia	and	flooding	in	the	south	 
of France last June which reduced its contribution 
to £1.9 million (2009: £2.5 million). 
Amlin Corporate Insurance
ACI	contributed	a	profit	of	£16.6	million	(2009:	
£54.4 million), helped by a strong investment 
performance but with disappointing underwriting 
returns. The actions taken to improve underwriting 
performance in its Rotterdam marine business 
will	take	time	to	be	recognised	in	earned	figures	
and the result was also affected by worse than 
expected performance in its smaller Antwerp 
commodities cargo account.
There was concerted action throughout 2010 to 
continue re-underwriting ACI’s marine portfolio. 
This is resulting in improved trends in its hull claims 
ratios, but in its smaller cargo account softening 
market conditions have held back progress. In 
Antwerp the commodities cargo book was also  
re-priced during the second half of the year and 
into the 1 January 2011 renewals, with the high 
level	of	client	retention	reflecting	the	value	clients	
place on ACI’s specialist expertise and service 
capability in this sector. 
Re-underwriting activity has resulted in the 
non-renewal of approximately €71 million of 
marine business where pricing was considered 
inadequate and historic claims ratios unacceptable. 
Much of the remaining portfolio has better historic 
performance and more acceptable pricing.
ACI’s underwriting practices, incentive 
arrangements, risk management and reserving 
were brought more into line with Amlin and we 
strengthened management resource with the 
recruitment	of	a	Chief	Risk	Officer	and	a	Chief	
Operating	Officer,	both	of	whom	are	making	
a positive impact. ACI has also successfully 
completed the transition of services such as 
motor	fleet	claims	and	reinsurance	processing	
away from Fortis, leaving only the migration of its 
systems to Amlin’s platform, which is scheduled 
for completion in mid-2011. All of this has required

Outlook
Over-capacity continues to drive competition in 
many segments of the market, most notably in the 
US, where premium to surplus ratios in the property 
and casualty market are at a 30 year low
2
. In many 
market sectors, particularly reinsurance, downward 
pressure on pricing has increased despite the 
impact of the losses borne by the market in 2010. 
This	was	reflected	in	rate	reductions	in	January	of	
3.2% and 4.4% for our reinsurance books in Amlin 
London and Amlin Bermuda respectively. 
Amlin	benefits	from	the	diversity	of	its	portfolio,	
which gives access to a varied range of market 
conditions. For example, energy physical damage 
rates and energy liability rates have increased by 
20%	and	50%	respectively	since	the	Deepwater	
Horizon oil spill. While drilling activity in the Gulf 
of Mexico is presently low due to restrictions on 
permits, the reassessment of marine and energy 
exposures prompted by this event seems likely  
to result in demand for increased coverage 
which may exceed current market capacity 
when activity resumes. This should create 
an attractive opportunity to expand our 
underwriting in this sector. 
In the UK, we saw an improving rating trend for 
fleet	motor	at	the	end	of	2010,	following	a	more	
competitive market than expected earlier in the 
year .	This	was	reflected	in	an	overall	rate	increase	
of	7.4%	for	fleet	motor	in	January.	In	motor	fleet,	
as elsewhere in the UK commercial market, 
there	is	increasing	evidence	of	financial	distress	
as competitors withdraw or reduce capacity on 
unprofitable	business.	With	similar	trends	in	the	
personal lines market exacerbated by the impact 
of the severe winter weather in 2010, we expect 
to see improvement in pricing for UK commercial 
lines in 2011. Amlin UK is already taking advantage 
of	growth	opportunities	in	the	firmer	motor	fleet	
market and has the ability to generate further 
substantial growth as market conditions improve. 
With	the	benefit	of	these	more	favourable	trends	
combined with largely stable pricing in some other 
key sectors such as marine, Amlin’s overall portfolio, 
saw a January decline of only 1.3% in rates. 
Nevertheless, surplus capacity combined with 
the continued impact of the depressed global 
economy on premium volume, together with 
declining investment yields, is creating a challenging 
environment	in	which	to	pursue	profitable	growth.	
Amlin	is	well	positioned,	with	a	profitable	core	
portfolio supported by strong client and broker 
relationships,	as	reflected	in	our	high	retention	ratios.	
Our disciplined underwriting approach is focused 
on	profit	not	volume	and	driven	by	our	cross	cycle	
target of an average return on equity of at least 15%. 
This discipline and focus has enabled the business to 
perform well at the bottom of previous cycles. 
The	Group	is	benefiting	from	previous	investments	
in teams and acquisitions which have broadened 
the client base, distribution and market access 
of the business. We continue to anticipate 
opportunities to expand selectively through teams, 
portfolios and small acquisitions and we expect 
to add approximately £40 million of new business 
from the acquisitions of JR Clare and Lead Yacht 
Underwriters which were completed in January 
and February respectively this year. 
While	trading	conditions	also	remain	difficult	
in Continental Europe, we believe that ACI will 
benefit	from	the	improvements	made	to	its	risk	
management practices and the re-underwriting of 
its marine accounts. The Rotterdam hull portfolio, 
which was a focus of attention in late 2009 and 
early 2010, is showing signs of improvement, and 
actions taken in the Antwerp commodities cargo 
account in the second half of 2010 should have  
a positive impact on performance in 2011.
A further challenge is likely to be the substantially 
lower investment returns expected in 2011.  
Amlin will not materially increase risk appetite  
to compensate, however our proven capabilities  
in investment management, which have enabled us 
to outperform the investment return of our Lloyd’s 
peers by a simple average of 1.1% since 2005, will 
stand us in good stead to optimise available returns. 
Key highlights in 2010
 
Creation of Amlin AG and launch of Amlin Re Europe
 
Significant	progress	in	integrating	ACI
 
Completion of Solvency II pre-application preparation
 
First London Market insurer to achieve Corporate Chartered Insurer status 
 
Further investment in growth potential through senior recruitment  
and acquisitions.
Overall, while we expect market conditions 
to make 2011 another tough year, we have 
good levels of underlying performance in both 
Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda, and with an 
improving outlook for Amlin UK and the actions 
taken in ACI we expect to trade through the 
current cyclical downturn successfully.
Capital
Net tangible assets increased by 8.0% to 
£1,545.4 million in 2010, after £30.4 million 
spent on goodwill and intangibles associated with 
acquisitions and dividends paid of £102.5 million. 
We remain in a strong capital position with 
capital and available resources of £695.9 million 
in excess of our assessed capital requirements. 
As we move closer to the bottom of the cycle 
in	many	lines,	efficient	capital	management	
in support of our cross cycle goal of at least 
15% ROE becomes more critical, but with the 
introduction of Solvency II looming, it is important 
to balance this with the need for capital strength.
Our capital strength also supports our policy 
of steadily increasing the dividend, which with 
our	final	dividend	of	15.8	pence	per	share,	has	
increased by 15.0% over 2009. Allowing for this 
and the current importance of maintaining a 
more robust position than normal, we have also 
allocated up to £75 million for share buy-backs 
over the coming year. We believe that our 
prospects, both for 2011 and especially when 
better market conditions return, make it attractive 
to buy in shares at or near the current price. 
Strategy and business development
A	major	initiative	in	2010	was	the	creation	of	 
Amlin AG through the redomicile of Amlin Bermuda 
to Switzerland. On 5 May 2010 we announced 
our intention to establish Amlin Re Europe in 
Switzerland to provide the Group with access  
to European reinsurance business that does not 
typically	flow	into	the	London	and	Bermuda	market	
places.	Amlin	AG’s	incorporation	in	Zurich,	a	major	
financial	centre	and	home	of	many	global	financial	
and (re)insurance companies, will provide an ideal 
location for the further growth and expansion of 
the group’s reinsurance activities. We believe that 
Switzerland	provides	Amlin	with	strategic	flexibility,	
a strong professional workforce, a solid legal and 
regulatory environment and an improved ability  
to manage our capital.
Amlin Bermuda is now operating as a Bermuda-
based branch of Amlin AG but in all other respects 
exactly as before. Amlin Re Europe has been  
extremely well received by brokers and 
prospective clients and has made an excellent 
start in 2011, writing some €66 million of gross 
written premium, marginally above plan. With 
current pricing and the new business strain of 
incurring expenses before the development of 
earned premium, we do not expect it to make a 
material contribution in the current year. We are, 
however, excited by its longer term prospects.
19
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Amlin Re Europe: investing for future growth
Amlin	Re	Europe	represents	Amlin’s	second	major	start-up	following	the	successful	
establishment of Amlin Bermuda in 2006. Continental European insurers do not readily 
buy treaty reinsurance from Lloyd’s or Bermudian reinsurers, preferring to deal with local 
reinsurers in their own language, although Amlin London already provides catastrophe 
reinsurance to some European companies. The local relationships of Amlin Re Europe’s 
experienced underwriting team, combined with Amlin’s existing reinsurance franchise, 
strong ratings and long-standing broker relationships, are already proving to be an 
attractive business proposition to the target client base. Amlin Re Europe will further 
diversify our reinsurance portfolio by geography and class and Amlin AG gives us a 
substantial European platform from which to further develop the business over time. 
Amlin’s market position as a specialist 
international insurer and reinsurer remains 
advantageous. Our business is small enough 
to	be	flexible	and	opportunistic,	able	to	shrink	
or grow individual lines according to market 
conditions, and we have excellent and long-
standing relationships with key brokers. 
Nevertheless we remain mindful of the long 
term global consolidation trend in insurance 
and the likelihood that this will be given further 
momentum	by	Solvency	II.	Major	brokers	are	
increasingly focused on streamlining their 
distribution	and	concentrating	premium	flows	
with the optimum carriers in each market 
segment.	Amlin	needs	to	have	sufficient	critical	
mass to count in this changing environment. 
During	2010,	we	continued	to	invest	in	the	 
core business, extending our underwriting scope 
and expertise through targeted recruitment. 
Given	that	one	of	our	strategic	objectives	is	for	
Amlin to be seen as ‘the place to work’, it was 
pleasing that we were able to attract a very high 
quality	cadre	of	senior	underwriters	to	join	the	
Group in 2010, mainly for Amlin Re Europe but  
also in London and Bermuda. We also further 
strengthened regional management and operational 
resources in ACI, Amlin France and Bermuda. 
We continue to see suitable acquisitions as 
important	to	our	longer	term	growth.	During	
2010 we reviewed our acquisition strategy in 
the light of valuable lessons learned from recent 
acquisitions. This is now informing our planning 
to ensure that we are fully resourced to integrate 
further acquisitions effectively in the future. 
The	Group	made	further	significant	progress	
towards Solvency II with the pre-application 
preparation completed on schedule. This was 
a	major	achievement	which	reflects	the	hard	
work and commitment of a substantial team 
of colleagues across the Group. It is becoming 
increasingly clear that Internal Model approval  
will be crucial to the success of businesses such 
as	Amlin	in	the	future	and	we	remain	confident	 
of	achieving	that	objective.	We	continue	to	expect	
that Amlin’s Target Operating Model, which is at 
the centre of our preparations for Solvency II  
( 	pp.41),	will	deliver	substantial	benefits	
and enhance Amlin’s competitive position. In 
particular, we see leading edge risk management 
as a crucial competitive advantage for the future. 
People 
Once again turnover of total employees and 
senior underwriters was low at 5.2% and 3.7% 
respectively. The stability of our employee base 
is an important asset, particularly as the business 
grows and we meet the challenge of extending the  
‘Amlin	DNA’,	which	has	been	the	foundation	of	the	 
Group’s success, across the broader business. 
Amlin’s	attainment	of	the	first	Chartered	Insurer	
status in the London Market was a resounding 
endorsement of the professionalism and expertise 
of our people and underlines our continued 
commitment to our Vision of becoming  
‘the global reference point for quality in  
each of our markets’.
Employees across the Group again showed 
teamwork, dedication and commitment to 
meet these varied demands and deliver value 
to shareholders and clients. I admire and thank 
them for their outstanding performance.

Reinsurance
Surplus capacity and a second year of low 
US catastrophe claims caused a softening in 
reinsurance pricing in 2010, despite major 
earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand which 
caused significant regional market losses. 
The reinsurance market provides risk transfer and 
contingent capital to insurance companies. As  
a result of a sustained period of consolidation in 
Europe, Bermuda and the US, the global market 
is dominated by large reinsurers in Germany, 
Switzerland, Bermuda, the US and within Lloyd’s. 
Amlin underwrites reinsurance principally through 
Syndicate 2001 (Amlin London) and Amlin AG. 
The main focus of Amlin’s core reinsurance 
portfolio is catastrophe reinsurance, which 
protects insurers against major losses caused 
by natural catastrophes such as hurricanes or 
earthquakes. Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda 
also write other reinsurance business across a 
range of classes, mainly covering property risks. 
Amlin Re Europe, which started underwriting 
in October 2010, will develop a Continental 
European reinsurance account focused mainly  
on property and casualty treaty reinsurance for 
small and mid-sized insurance companies.
Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda source the 
majority of their reinsurance business through 
global reinsurance brokers. Amlin Re Europe 
also expects to source most of its business 
through brokers, but it will also develop some 
business which is not already brokered directly 
with insurers, in line with market practice in 
Continental Europe. 
Market commentary
2010 was dominated by substantial international 
catastrophe claims, most notably from the Chilean 
earthquake on 27 February, and the major 
earthquake in New Zealand on 3 September. 
In addition, European windstorm Xynthia, 
which occurred in February and the Australian 
floods in December (and January 2011) were 
also significant events. By contrast, the level of 
US catastrophe losses was relatively low, with 
a second consecutive year of limited landfall 
hurricane activity. However the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, which started on 22 April,  
is expected to generate substantial reinsurance 
claims to the global marine and energy market. 
Amlin’s estimated exposure to each of these 
events is shown opposite. 
At an estimated $8 billion
1
, the Chilean 
earthquake was one of the largest insured 
earthquake losses ever, but despite this,  
any upward pressure on catastrophe pricing  
was confined to the local region. Even with  
the additional impact of windstorm Xynthia  
and the New Zealand earthquake, at an  
estimated $3.1 billion
1 
and $3.3 billion
1
 
respectively, the overall rating environment for 
international catastrophe business remained 
materially unchanged.
The unusually low level of catastrophe losses in 
2009 combined with the continued recovery in 
financial markets boosted industry capital, with 
brokers estimating that the surplus capital in 
the global catastrophe reinsurance market had 
increased to more than $50 billion by the end 
of 2010
2
. However, margins remained attractive 
in the US catastrophe markets even though 
the absence of significant catastrophe losses 
led to a softening in pricing. Rates on Amlin’s 
international catastrophe portfolio fell by 0.5% 
(2009: increase of 4.1%) and on Amlin’s US 
catastrophe business rates decreased by 4.9% 
(2009: increase of 10.5%). Property reinsurance 
rates declined by 9.8% (2009: increase of 1.2%).

Delivery beyond expectation
A long-standing Amlin client was one of the insurers 
in Chile affected by substantial claims following 
the earthquake and resulting tsunami, with many 
policyholders suffering real hardship. As part of our 
commitment to timely and fair claims settlement, we 
fast-tracked reinsurance claims payments to support the 
client’s cash flow and to enable them to pay policyholders 
quickly. The client recognised Amlin’s superior service 
with a significantly increased share of its reinsurance 
programme at renewal.

Amlin’s market position
Amlin is a recognised leader in the 
catastrophe reinsurance market, with  
Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda viewed  
by brokers as preferred markets by virtue  
of their strong Financial Strength ratings  
( pp.18) and underwriting expertise. 
Amlin London is the largest catastrophe 
underwriter in Lloyd’s by premium, with a 
market share of 9% in 2010
4
. Amlin London 
and Amlin Bermuda offer their capacity 
only to London treaty reinsurance brokers. 
This is a key differentiator in the Bermuda 
market. Both businesses are recognised for 
excellence in client service which is reflected 
in consistently high retention levels achieved 
on renewal business. 
Amlin’s catastrophe account is underwritten 
mainly on a treaty excess of loss basis. While 
the US accounts for the largest proportion of 
catastrophe premium by geography for both 
London and Bermuda, the overall catastrophe 
portfolio is a global one with a significant 
spread of international business outside 
the US, reflecting Amlin’s strategy to seek 
profitable diversity within individual business 
classes as well as across the whole Group 
underwriting portfolio. 
Amlin Re Europe was established in 2010 to 
provide the Group with access to European 
reinsurance business that does not typically 
flow into the London and Bermuda markets, 
by meeting increased demand for greater 
diversity of risk transfer and counterparty  
risk among small and medium sized insurers. 
Like Amlin’s other reinsurance businesses, 
Amlin Re Europe offers strong ratings and 
capitalisation, underwriting expertise based on 
substantial experience in the European market 
and high levels of client service.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Market review
Global Specialty
Specialty lines showed variance in pricing during 2010 
with over-capacity continuing to drive competition in 
some sectors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, as well  
as generating an insured market loss expected to exceed  
$6 billion
1
, prompted a market-wide reassessment  
of energy risks, particularly liability exposures, which  
is now being reflected in higher pricing. 
The global specialty market includes a wide range 
of risks which are typically commercial, large and 
complex, requiring specialist underwriting expertise 
and individually tailored cover. Distinct markets 
include the US surplus lines market and the 
international marine and aviation markets. Lloyd’s 
remains an important hub for the insurance of 
many of these highly specialised risks, but capacity 
is also provided by global insurers operating world-
wide and in regional market centres such as the 
Dutch Beurs and Singapore.
Amlin has specialist expertise in many different 
specialty lines, with most being written through 
Syndicate 2001 via Amlin London, and through 
ACI in the important Benelux marine market 
centred on Rotterdam. Our office in Singapore 
sources local energy and cargo business, which 
is also underwritten through Syndicate 2001. 
A substantial proportion of Amlin’s specialty 
business comes from the US, accounting for 25% 
of Amlin London’s specialty premium in 2010. 
Amlin also provides specialist tailored insurance 
cover for thoroughbred breeding and racing stock 
and high value competition horses through Amlin 
Plus Limited, and for other types of livestock 
through Crowe Livestock Underwriting Limited. 
Amlin sources its specialty business mainly 
through brokers and other intermediaries. In 
certain lines, such as Amlin London’s marine 
account, part of the business is written via 
lineslips and binding authorities, whereby  
Amlin gives limited and defined underwriting 
authority to selected intermediaries.
Market commentary
The diversity of the specialty lines market is 
reflected in the typically mixed picture for pricing 
and capacity seen during 2010, as illustrated by 
the index of rate movements for Amlin’s portfolio 
provided in the table opposite. Overcapacity 
in many lines continued to drive competition, 
particularly in aviation and the US property and 
casualty market. However in some loss affected 
sectors, notably energy physical damage and 
liability following the Deepwater Horizon oil  
spill, the softening trend in pricing that had  
been evident at the start of the year was 
reversed. The impact of the global economic 
slowdown was less marked than in 2009 for 
trade-related sectors such as cargo, but the  
cargo market remained competitive, especially  
in Continental Europe. 
Our marine portfolio
Following the acquisition of ACI, marine is 
Amlin’s largest specialty class by premium 
with 2010 gross written premium of 
£547.4 million, including energy  
premium of £56.5 million.
On a proforma basis to include ACI for the 
full year, Amlin’s total marine premium  
for 2009 would have represented 3.4%  
of global marine premium

Pirates hijacked a record number of ships and crew in 
2010, mostly off the coast of Somalia. 53 vessels were 
captured along with 1,181 crew members, compared to

proportion of the total volume of shipping in high risk

Amlin’s market position
Amlin is a major insurer in the global marine 
market, with a combined gross written premium 
for Amlin London and ACI’s marine account of 
£547.4 million including energy in 2010. Amlin 
London underwrites all major international 
marine classes including energy, cargo, marine 
hull and liability. Amlin is also a leading provider 
of yacht insurance through two specialist 
subsidiaries, Haven Knox-Johnston, which 
services the small yacht market, and Lead Yacht 
Underwriters which provides coverage  
for super-yachts. 
ACI is the market leader in marine insurance in 
the Benelux region with an estimated share of 
written premium of more than 30% in the Dutch 
and Belgian marine insurance markets
5
. In the 
Dutch market ACI writes a diverse regional and 
international account with a focus on specialist 
inland and coastal risks such as dredging, lifting 
and salvage and is also a market leader in 
cargo. In Belgium ACI is a leading underwriter 
of specialist commodities cargo business. 
In other specialty lines, Amlin pursues a 
disciplined underwriting approach based on 
writing a small percentage line across a large 
number of risks, rather than taking larger 
shares of fewer risks. This gives us flexibility 
and the ability to be highly selective to protect 
underwriting profitability according to market 
conditions, while the different pricing cycles 
and demand dynamics across such a broad 
portfolio give varied opportunities for profitable 
growth. The expertise of Amlin’s underwriters 
across a wide range of disciplines is well 
recognised in the market and Amlin’s strong 
Financial Strength ratings ( pp.18) give a 
competitive advantage. Both Amlin London 
and ACI are also noted for quality client service 
which is reflected in long standing broker 
and client relationships and consistently high 
retention levels achieved on renewal business.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Market review
Commercial
Commercial insurance markets in Continental 
Europe remained highly competitive with 
abundant capacity during 2010. In the UK, an 
improving trend continued in fleet motor and, 
while other classes remained near cycle lows, 
positive signs emerged as the year progressed. 
Commercial lines insurance provides motor, 
property and liability insurance to commercial 
enterprises ranging in size from sole traders to 
global corporations. In some markets commercial 
insurers also provide insurance to local and 
national government entities.
Amlin’s commercial lines businesses comprise 
Amlin UK, which serves clients in the UK and 
Ireland, ACI, which operates in the Netherlands 
and Belgium, and Amlin France, which serves 
the French corporate market. The insurance 
markets in these countries are mature and 
established, with significant commercial 
premium, as shown opposite.
Amlin sources its commercial insurance mainly 
through Lloyd’s brokers and regional and 
local intermediaries in the UK and Continental 
Europe. In the Netherlands, ACI is also a major 
participant in the Beurs co-insurance market. Each 
of Amlin’s commercial lines businesses is focused 
on maintaining close relationships with key 
intermediaries in their respective markets and 
on providing high levels of service tailored to the 
needs of brokers and clients in specific industry 
and business sectors. 
Market commentary
During 2010 the commercial insurance markets 
in which Amlin operates remained generally 
competitive, with only UK motor fleet business 
seeing an obvious improvement in pricing. 
Competitive pressures in Continental European 
markets remained intense, driven by ample capacity 
from both international and local insurers and 
the continued impact of the economic downturn 
on demand. In the Benelux markets, favourable 
results in liability classes attracted additional 
capacity into the sector, resulting in significant 
rate reductions during the year. Property rates 
were stable but remained competitive, although 
there were some signs of greater discipline for 
high hazard property risks in France. Motor fleet 
also remained a soft market in the region.
In the UK market, anticipated improvements in 
pricing in the liability and property sectors were 
slow to emerge, although there were some signs 
of greater stability in the second half of 2010. 
Amlin’s book of business experienced largely stable 
pricing. However, motor fleet generated a rate 
increase of 3.1% for the year with a rising trend 
as the year progressed. This reflected continued 
withdrawal of capacity from the motor fleet 
segment as competitors reacted to losses  
on underpriced business.

Amlin’s market position
Amlin UK is a market leader in commercial 
fleet motor in Lloyd’s and also underwrites 
property and liability business for UK corporate 
entities together with some specialist lines 
for private individuals. The property account 
includes package products aimed at the SME 
sector which incorporate combined property 
and liability cover. All of Amlin UK’s business 
is underwritten through Syndicate 2001. The 
experience and technical expertise of Amlin 
UK’s underwriters and their ability to create 
and price unconventional programmes gives 
Amlin a competitive advantage. The business 
focuses on non-standard and complex risks 
and works closely with brokers to create niche 
products which meet client needs across a 
wide range of business types and sectors. 
ACI is a leading provider of commercial 
property and liability insurance with a  
top three position by premium volume 
in these classes in both the Netherlands 
and Belgium, where it also underwrites 
commercial motor fleet insurance. ACI 
benefits from long-standing relationships  
with major international brokers operating  
in the Benelux region as well as with a broad 
range of local brokers and intermediaries.
Amlin France, formed by the combination 
of Anglo French Underwriters and ACI 
France during 2010, is the largest Lloyd’s 
coverholder in the French market by  
premium and writes a diverse range 
of business including property, cargo, 
professional liability and specie insurance. 
Its target market is small and medium sized 
corporate enterprises, focused on niche areas 
where its specialist underwriting and pricing 
skills can generate good returns. The majority 
of Amlin France’s business is underwritten on 
behalf of either Syndicate 2001 or ACI.

Business development
As described in the market reviews ( pp.22-25), 
the trading environment for Amlin London was 
variable. Despite the market losses generated 
by the Chile and New Zealand earthquakes 
and other major losses such as the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, pricing on much of Amlin 
London’s portfolio weakened during the year. 
Nevertheless, there were opportunities to write 
profitable new business, mainly in marine and 
property and casualty lines. We continued to 
invest in additional underwriting expertise, with 
the recruitment of Leading Class Underwriters in 
hull, specie and professional lines to the marine 
and property and casualty teams respectively. 
Reinsurance pricing, although under pressure, 
remained attractive, particularly for US risks 
where catastrophe pricing on Amlin’s portfolio 
was within 10% of peak levels. Reinsurance 
income consequently remained relatively  
stable. In line with our strategy to have balanced 
portfolios of risk within each class of business, 
Amlin has a substantial international reinsurance 
book alongside its US catastrophe exposures. 
The general pattern of the last decade has seen 
this profitable international catastrophe portfolio 
counterbalance large US catastrophe claims, 
for example in 2004, 2005 and 2008. A second 
quiet year for US catastrophe claims in 2010 
meant that the returns on the US catastrophe 
portfolio and the contribution of other profitable 
reinsurance lines such as risk excess of loss 
helped to mitigate the effects of the notable 
losses experienced on the reinsurance account.
In the marine market, the first part of the year 
saw a general softening of rates across the 
majority of marine business lines, but following 
the Deepwater Horizon loss this trend reversed 
for the offshore energy and energy liability 
accounts, where rates showed a strong upturn 
during the second half of the year reflecting 
substantially increased demand for liability 
insurance. Energy liability and control of well 
rates increased by up to 50%, in particular for 
deepwater drilling risks. The environment for 
underwriting energy business also benefited 
during 2010 from the improvement in both  
the economy and the oil price which led to  
an increase in drilling activity. 
The US property and casualty market remained 
highly competitive and rating across the majority 
of business lines continued to soften. As a result, 
we reduced exposures in areas no longer offering 
sufficient potential for profit, while looking to 
maintain the underlying quality of our core  
client base. The financial impact of the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes on Amlin’s property and 
casualty portfolio was modest and well contained 
within reserves. There was a tightening of terms 
and conditions for loss affected parts  
of the international book and we witnessed  
some withdrawals from the market. However  
we remain in the soft part of the insurance cycle. 
During 2010, although there were further 
significant airline losses, this failed to address 
the considerable over capacity within the aviation 
market, which again made it difficult to obtain 
adequate pricing, particularly for airline business. 
An exception was the general aviation market, 
where we cautiously expanded our participation 
to take advantage of improving pricing.
In November 2009 we acquired Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting Limited, a Lloyd’s coverholder which 
provides specialist insurance to the livestock 
industry. During 2010, the business was fully 
integrated and as anticipated has already proved

Client service 
Despite more competitive market conditions Amlin 
London maintained a high level of retention across 
the portfolio, at 86% (2009: 91%), reflecting the 
value placed on our expertise and high service 
standards by brokers and clients. During the 
year , we again participated in the annual survey 
conducted by Gracechurch Consulting
1
 of the 
attitudes of 200 UK-based brokers towards the 
claims services offered by insurers in the London 
market. Amlin ranked third overall, compared to 
second in 2009, but continued to perform above 
the market average across all the service attributes 
covered by the survey and led the market on  
broker perception of a ‘strong commitment to 
paying fair claims’.
As a result of the continued consolidation among 
the major brokers, 51% of the international 
insurance and reinsurance business handled  
by Amlin is generated by the three largest global 
brokers Aon, Willis and Marsh.

2010 Highlights
 
Profitable result overall and in reinsurance, despite international 
catastrophe claims 
 
Growth of 3.9% in GWP to £889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million)
 
Combined ratio of 80% despite £132.2 million of major catastrophe claims

 
New business growth in reinsurance, marine and property and casualty 
 
Continued investment in underwriting teams 
 
Further strengthening of relationships with key brokers.
A priority for 2010 was to further develop 
strategic relationships with key brokers and 
to identify and target business development 
opportunities. As part of this process we also 
entered into strategic partnerships with two 
brokers in order to secure high quality new 
business opportunities for the future. 
Underwriting performance
Gross written premium increased by 3.9% to 
£889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million). Much 
of the increase was due to net new business 
generated within the aviation, marine and 
property and casualty business units, following 
investment in underwriting teams and a focus on 
opportunities where rating conditions proved more 
attractive. Net earned premium was up by 16.8%, 
reflecting an increase in net written premium in 
2009 and 2010 and the earning of 2009 premium 
at more favourable exchange rates.
The average renewal rate decrease was 3.1%, 
driven by average reductions on reinsurance 
business of 4.7%. Average reductions of 2.2% 
and 5.0% were also evident for the property and 
casualty and aviation business units respectively. 
Marine rates were broadly stable. 
The division achieved a combined ratio of 80% 
(2009: 71%). The claims ratio at 44% (2009: 
28%) increased by 15% due to the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes. Prior period reserve 
movements were £80.8 million (2009: £95.1 
million). Across the division, reserves for 2003 
and prior years, which are well developed, have 
now been set at close to the actuarial best 
estimates, releasing £20.0 million at year end. 
This change has been made to avoid consistent 
increases in the reserving strength of the division. 
The expense ratio was 36% (2009: 43%). The 
decrease reflects a positive foreign exchange 
swing, with a weaker US dollar in 2009 relative 
to 2010.

Business development
During 2010 the anticipated upward trend in 
pricing across Amlin UK’s portfolio was less  
than expected. 
Despite this we were able to increase gross 
written premium on our fleet account by 26% 
and our property account by 186%. In the liability 
sector the market remained highly competitive 
and we focused on retaining the existing account 
on a profitable basis.
Rates in the fleet motor sector did not increase 
during 2010 to the extent which we had expected, 
although an improving trend towards the end of 
the year contributed to an average rate increase 
of 3.1% for 2010. Nevertheless, following price 
increases in 2009 and withdrawal of capacity by 
some competitors, the sector offered opportunities 
for profitable growth. Our disciplined approach 
through the bottom of the cycle positioned Amlin 
UK favourably to provide capacity and gain market 
share at favourable rates as others withdrew from 
the market. Consequently we achieved a 26% 
increase in premiums including £27 million of  
new business. Amlin UK’s specialist private car 
business also grew from £2 million to £12 million, 
mainly through meeting capacity shortages arising 
as a result of market distress in certain niche areas 
such as taxi operators.
Following investment in our property underwriting 
capabilities in 2009, growth in this area was a 
priority for the year and the property account 
grew by 186% to £88.1 million during the year . 
Growth was obtained through taking opportunities 
in niche areas, focusing on relationships with key 
intermediaries and from a number of new property/
commercial combined coverage schemes. 
During 2010, we continued to raise Amlin’s brand 
profile with regional and smaller intermediaries 
through targeted marketing. Awareness of 
the Amlin brand among target brokers and 
prospective clients was enhanced by the Amlin 
Group’s European rugby sponsorship and Amlin 
UK’s sponsorship of Essex County Cricket Club.  
Increased recognition of the Amlin brand, combined  
with Amlin’s strong financial position, contributed 
to the success of the property team in developing 
their account and to the overall ability of Amlin 
UK to generate new business during the year.
The UK liability market remained at the bottom of 
the pricing cycle during 2010 although modest  
rating increases were achieved on Amlin’s portfolio.  
The acquisition of profitable new business was  
difficult in competitive market conditions, although  
there were more opportunities towards the end 
of the year when the volume of new business 
written increased. 
During 2010, we made an investment in 
Manchester Underwriting Management Ltd, 
a new managing general agent specialising in 
UK professional indemnity business, which has 
already begun to generate business for Amlin 
from its expanding network of brokers. 
Insolvency Risk Services (IRS), which was acquired 
at the start of 2010, is a specialist intermediary 
which provides insurance coverage for Insolvency 
Practitioners. IRS acts as broker to the Insolvency 
profession and places business with a variety  
of carriers. 
In January 2011 we acquired JR Clare Underwriting 
Agencies Limited, a managing general agent 
which sources approximately £30 million of 
household and commercial insurance premium 
income. Amlin UK will underwrite 100% of JR 
Clare’s business. This acquisition will provide 
attractive new business in an area of the market 
where prices are rising.
Client service
Delivering high standards of service to both 
policyholders and intermediaries remains a 
priority for the business and we have continued to 
invest in our claims handling resource. Our claims 
department now provides support to major

and other motor lines. Net earned premium 
has increased by 34.5%, reflecting net written 
premium growth in 2009 and 2010.
The average rate increase for the division was 
1.5%, with fleet business achieving an average 
increase of 3.1%. 
The combined ratio was 95% (2009: 81%), with 
a claims ratio of 64% (2009: 53%). The increase 
in the claims ratio partly reflects lower reserves 
releases of £17.1 million, compared to £38.7 
million last year. Releases in 2009 included  
£16.0 million from a change in reserving approach 
on fleet and liability business. Importantly, the 
underlying claims ratio improved 7% year on  
year as the division increased its property 
underwriting and grew its motor business  
in an improving environment. 
The expense ratio was 31% (2009: 28%), 
reflecting investment in resource and business 
infrastructure required to support growth plans.

Business development
In spite of increasing competition driven by a 
greater market appetite for international business, 
Amlin Bermuda’s strong market position and 
significant capacity helped to maintain our 
share of desirable accounts. The absence of 
US catastrophe losses for a second year and 
limited impact from the Chile and New Zealand 
earthquakes on the wider international market, 
meant that the competitive pressures which  
Amlin Bermuda started to experience in the 
second half of 2009 continued throughout 
2010. Rate reductions were experienced in the 
U.S. property catastrophe account, particularly 
in Florida and Texas with only the North East 
showing improvement.
However, there were opportunities for increased 
lines on existing programmes and new business 
was written on the international property 
catastrophe book, notably in Denmark and also 
Chile, where greater capacity was offered in the 
light of improved terms after the earthquake as 
some competitors withdrew from the market. 
Specialty lines growth in 2010 was ahead of 
target due to the addition of short term trade 
credit reinsurance business, which presented an 
attractive opportunity given the much improved 
terms and conditions for this class in the wake of 
the global economic downturn and the in-depth 
expertise of our specialty lines underwriters in 
this field.
In market segments where rating levels trended 
downward such as US and International risk 
excess of loss business, lines were trimmed 
as terms deteriorated. Similarly, we decided 
to postpone the development of a facultative 
reinsurance account, which was one of our 2010 
priorities, due to the poor rating environment for 
this class. However, we will continue to monitor 
this situation and Amlin Bermuda is positioned 
to move swiftly into this area following a market 
changing event. 
During 2010 we continued to build Amlin 
Bermuda’s senior underwriting team with the 
addition of a specialty lines underwriter and the 
transfer of a casualty reinsurance underwriter 
from Amlin London. It is intended that the 
casualty reinsurance account written by Amlin 
Bermuda will mirror that written with success 
in Amlin London. The main classes written are 
expected to be medical malpractice, general 
casualty and automobile liability, with a strong 
geographical focus on the US.
As in prior years, Amlin Bermuda continued to 
write a whole account quota share of Syndicate 
2001 to provide balance to the overall account.  
In 2010, the quota share was maintained at 
17.5% except for reinsurance, where the quota 
share was reduced to 10%. In addition, Amlin 
Bermuda wrote variable quota shares on a 
number of classes including marine, aviation, 
property and other specialist classes.
Client service
All of Amlin Bermuda’s direct business is sourced  
through global brokers operating in the London 
market. The business retention ratio of  
90% demonstrates the strong established 
relationships built by providing first class service. 
Amlin Bermuda is committed to efficient and 
timely responses in both premium processing 
and settlement of claims and our experienced 
claims team strives to ensure that turnaround 
times on claims payments are minimised. We 
were able to demonstrate this when dealing 
with the substantial claims arising from the 
Chile earthquake, when the excellent claims 
service we delivered alongside Amlin London 
for a major client has led directly to increased 
business ( pp.23).
In October 2010, Amlin Bermuda Limited was 
re-domiciled to Zurich to become Amlin AG and 
Amlin Bermuda now operates as a Bermuda-
based branch of Amlin AG. Amlin Bermuda

Underwriting performance
Gross written premium was $676.4 million 
(2009: $628.3 million), of which $438.6 million 
was directly generated business (2009: $381.6 
million). Growth was aided by a healthy retention 
ratio (90%), new business successes, favourable 
exchange rate movements and reinstatement 
premiums. The average rate movement for 
the year was a reduction of 4.5%, with US 
catastrophe business experiencing a reduction 
of 6.3% and international catastrophe business 
a reduction of 1.0%. Development on the direct 
account was partially offset by reduced inter-
company quota shares for 2010.

Business development
During 2010 the main focus for ACI remained the 
continued re-underwriting of underperforming 
parts of the marine portfolio together with 
managing the separation from the Fortis  
Group and full integration with Amlin. 
The re-underwriting made considerable progress 
during 2010 although there remains more work 
to be done in 2011. Our marine business in 
Rotterdam, which accounts for 85% of ACI’s 
marine gross written premium, was the main 
focus of attention in 2009 and the first half of 
2010. The re-underwriting of the international 
hull account, (approximately 40% of ACI’s total 
marine premiums in 2010) continued and the 
loss ratio on this account has improved as a 
result. Re-underwriting of the Rotterdam cargo 
account (approximately 29% of ACI’s total marine 
premiums in 2010) had been hampered in 2009 
by insufficient staff, the complexity and size of  
the book, and some longer term agreements.  
The team was brought up to strength in 2010 and 
much of the portfolio was re-underwritten during 
the year, although increased competition in the 
cargo market meant that a significant amount of 
business was declined due to inadequate pricing.
In Antwerp, ACI underwrites a much smaller 
portfolio which is predominantly commodity cargo 
business (approximately 13% of ACI’s total marine 
premium in 2010) with a relatively small number 
of large clients. During 2010, as claims developed 
on business written from 2008 to 2010, worse 
than anticipated performance was recognised 
and the business required significant repricing. 
Good progress has been made, with re-rating and 
improved loss prevention measures achieved on a 
number of key accounts in the second half of the 
year. This reflects the long-standing relationships 
between ACI and these key clients and their 
recognition of the expertise and high standard of 
service provided by ACI in this specialised sector 
of the market.
ACI’s liability and fleet accounts continued to 
perform satisfactorily in competitive market 
conditions. The property book suffered from 
soft prices and some weather related events, 
principally windstorm Xynthia, summer storms 
and floods in Belgium, the biggest for over sixty 
years, leading to a reduction in profitability.
The integration of ACI into the Amlin Group  
and the management of the separation from  
the Fortis Group are discussed in more detail  
( pp.42). This major project continued to make 
substantial demands on ACI’s management 
resource during the year. The management 
team was strengthened by the recruitment 
of a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Operating 
Officer and further investment was made in 
establishing a local human resources presence 
and strengthening the local finance team. 
Work on the Platform Replacement Programme 
to replace ACI’s legacy systems continues to 
progress well and the project target remains to 
migrate ACI’s underwriting onto Amlin’s existing 
IT platform in mid-2011.
Significant progress was also made in implementing 
key aspects of Amlin’s underwriting, financial 
and risk management practices. For underwriting 
these include tracking of rate movements on 
ACI’s portfolio and greater individual underwriter 
accountability, supported by line guides, peer 
review and other controls already employed 
elsewhere in the Group. Underwriter incentives 
have also been brought more into line with 
the profit-focused structures in Amlin’s other 
businesses for 2011. On the marine portfolio, 
measures were put in place for sharing of relevant 
pricing and market information between the 
London and ACI marine teams and to ensure  
a consistent response to brokers on new marine 
business opportunities. 
In risk management, ACI was brought into the 
Group’s Solvency II programme and work begun 
to bring reserving into line with Amlin’s approach.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 34 Performance Business review: Amlin Corporate Insurance
With ACI’s principal markets remaining soft 
during the year, efforts were focused on the 
existing underwriting portfolios and less on 
new business development. However, client 
service remained a priority across the business 
and the initially positive reaction of clients and 
brokers to ACI’s acquisition by Amlin in 2009 
was borne out by a retention ratio of 84% and 
approximately €41 million of new business 
written during the year. ACI continues to access 
business through a broad spread of brokers and 
intermediaries. Approximately 45% of its 2010 
business was obtained from the largest global 
brokers, Aon, Marsh and Willis and the balance 
produced through national and regional brokers. 
Underwriting performance
Gross written premium was €768.2 million  
(2009 from acquisition: €236.1 million).  
On a like for like basis, the underlying reduction

The reduction reflects the non-renewal

the identified re-underwriting strategy. This fall 
was partially offset by €43.5 million of income 
from the Raets Marine agency account, which 
was regained at the end of 2009 following 
Amlin’s acquisition of ACI.
Rate movements were broadly flat relative to 
2009. The retention ratio was 84%.

(2009 from acquisition: 72%) is disappointing 
given the effort that has been deployed to

Amlin France
“ Being part of the Amlin  
group continues to bring  
new business opportunities. 
Our market position has 
been further strengthened by 
the addition of ACI’s French 
business and by the higher 
profile we have achieved as 
Amlin France.” 
Business development
In 2010 Anglo French Underwriters (AFU) merged 
with ACI’s French business and the combined entity 
was re-named Amlin France. The merger brought 
together two complementary businesses: ACI had 
successfully started to build a property and liability 
co-insurance business, targeting larger brokers and 
clients, reaching premiums of approximately €14 
million since it commenced business in April 2007, 
while AFU (which Amlin had acquired in 2008) 
was the foremost managing general agent serving 
Lloyd’s in France with 2010 premium income of 
some €36.3 million focused on the SME market. 
Much of 2010 was spent on the successful 
integration of ACI’s French business into AFU 
and the re-branding of the combined business 
as Amlin France. The combined business made 
further progress in adopting Amlin’s underwriting, 
finance and risk management procedures and 
a new remuneration structure more closely 
aligned with Amlin’s profit-focused underwriting 
philosophy was designed for introduction in 2011. 
The combination of the two businesses broadened 
the scope of Amlin France. The combined business 
continued to be led by Francois Martinache, the 
previous President of AFU, and to operate as 
an underwriting agency, underwriting business 
on behalf of both Syndicate 2001 and ACI. The 
merger was well received by the French market. 
As a consequence, Amlin France saw an increase 
in the number of new business opportunities. The 
retention ratio for the combined business was 
reduced in 2010 to 75% by the non-renewal of 
a major account following changes to terms and 
conditions which meant that it no longer met Amlin 
France’s profit focused underwriting criteria.
In tandem with the ability of the combined 
business to offer a broader business proposition to 
the market, efforts were made to raise the profile 
of the Amlin France brand with target brokers 
through active marketing and the successful 
development of the Lyon office following its 
launch in 2009. Amlin’s sponsorship of European 
rugby proved particularly valuable to Amlin France 
and generated substantial interest among target 
brokers and their clients. During the year 124 new 
producing brokers were added to Amlin France’s 
intermediary network and new business generated 
in 2010 across all classes was €18.8 million.
Underwriting performance
Amlin France generated gross written premium  
of €56.9 million (2009: €31.4 million
1
). The 
increase includes €19.4 million of premium 
attributable to ACI France. Despite competitive 
market conditions, underlying growth was 
delivered by increasing the share of business 
underwritten by Syndicate 2001.
The combined ratio was 93% (2009: 87%
1
). The 
claims ratio deteriorated to 59% (2009: 50%
1
) 
reflecting the inclusion of relatively higher claims 
for ACI France. It also reflects the impact of 
natural losses in 2010 including Winter Storm 
Xynthia and the European storm in the summer 
of 2010. The expense ratio improved to 34% 
(2009: 37%
1
), due to the inclusion of ACI France, 
which has a relatively lower cost base.

Amlin Re Europe
“ We believe that a focused 
and well capitalised European 
reinsurer will provide a strong 
partner for European brokers 
and clients.”

Finance Officer, Philippe Regazzoni Chief Executive 
Amlin AG was established in 2010 as an 
independently capitalised, full service 
reinsurance operation with the objective 
of providing European reinsurance buyers, 
especially small and mid-sized companies, 
with a meaningful alternative for high quality 
reinsurance capacity. After a decade of 
consolidation in the European reinsurance 
market and recent turbulence in global financial 
markets, reinsurance buyers are increasingly 
looking to diversify their insurance risk and to 
spread their counterparty risk.
Solvency II is further expected to increase demand 
for reinsurance as it is the most accessible source 
of extra capital for small and mid-sized insurers 
who may need to source additional capital. Also, 
it is expected to reinforce the desire to spread 
counterparty risk. This presents an attractive 
opportunity for a new and strongly capitalised 
entrant to offer improved choice to existing 
European cedants. 
In October 2010 Amlin Bermuda Limited was 
redomiciled from Bermuda to Switzerland and  
a new Zurich-based Swiss company named 
Amlin AG was created. The existing operations 
of Amlin Bermuda now trade as a Bermuda-
based branch of Amlin AG and the Zurich-based 
underwriting unit trades as Amlin Re Europe.
Capitalised at $1.4 billion and with excellent 
ratings, Amlin AG will be a leading reinsurer 
in the European market in terms of financial 
strength, and will also benefit from Amlin’s 
existing broker relationships and reputation  
as a leading international reinsurer. 
Amlin Re Europe commenced underwriting 
in October 2010, having received approvals 
from the Swiss Financial Market Authority and 
the Bermuda Monetary Authority. As much 
European reinsurance business is renewed at  
1 January, little business was written in the latter 
part of 2010. The new business started 2011 
well with approximately 150 clients, around 250 
programmes, and €65.6 million of gross written 
premium. This was ahead of expectation and 
represents a well diversified initial portfolio. 
The Amlin Re Europe team is headed by Philippe 
Regazzoni, CEO of Amlin AG, and formerly 
CEO of Swiss Re UK. At the end of 2010 the 
team comprised a staff of 23, including 10 
underwriters mainly recruited from other major 
European reinsurers. These underwriters have 
long-standing experience of the European market 
and the skills to underwrite all major non-life 
reinsurance classes and products. 
Amlin Re Europe will focus on non-life treaty 
reinsurance for European insurance companies. 
A key objective is to be a preferred reinsurance 
partner for brokers, although in line with market 
practice in Continental Europe, the Zurich 
operation will conduct both brokered and direct 
business. Over a four to five year timescale the 
objective is to acquire around a 1% share of the 
overall European reinsurance market, equating 
to approximately €400 million of gross written 
premium. The progress towards this goal will  
to a degree depend on market conditions.
The business mix is expected to comprise 
proportional and non-proportional reinsurance 
business, with the majority in property and 
casualty and some special lines business,  
mainly marine and engineering. The portfolio  
will include some catastrophe exposures as  
part of an overall client and market approach. 
We believe that continuity in client relationships 
and a clear and transparent underwriting approach 
offer an excellent value proposition for clients in 
this segment. A key feature of Amlin Re Europe’s 
approach will be a focus on developing close 
relationships with clients, as well as delivering 
Amlin’s first-class service standards.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Risk management
Risk and reward
“ During 2010 we focused on the continued 
development of Enterprise Risk Management 
within Amlin as part of our preparation for 
Solvency II. The improvements already 
achieved are delivering real business benefits.”
James Illingworth 
Chief Risk Officer
Setting our risk strategy
Amlin recognises that delivery of shareholder 
value comes from actively seeking and accepting 
risk while managing that risk within acceptable 
bounds. We are committed to maintaining 
and developing a sustainable enterprise risk 
management process as an integral part of our 
business model. We aim to provide transparency 
to our stakeholders on how risk strategy is set, 
implemented and periodically reviewed. Our 
risk management policy clearly articulates the 
importance given to active management of risk 
within the Group. 
The Risk Assessment and Monitoring team 
(RAM) is responsible for the process design and 
coordination associated with the identification, 
analysis and monitoring of the major risks faced 
by each Division and function. Also for reporting 
the status of risks to executive management, the 
Risk and Solvency Committee and the Amlin plc 
Board. The Group Risk team within RAM achieves 
this by maintaining effective risk assessment and 
reporting processes and delivering management 
information capable of supporting key decisions. 
Effective risk management and governance are 
fundamental to the regulatory regime which will 
be implemented under the Solvency II Directive 
and RAM continues to be closely involved with 
the development of Amlin’s Target Operating 
Model ( pp.41). 
As part of this process, during the year we 
made further progress in developing our risk 
governance to support a larger international 
Group and to prepare for Solvency II. A 
formalised framework for risk reporting and 
oversight has been rolled out across the Group, 
although each entity is at a different stage of 
detailed implementation. Risk committees 
and Boards at Group and entity level receive 
regular risk reports which highlight where 
categories of risk sit compared to agreed risk 
appetite and tolerance levels, as well as areas 
of control weakness which need addressing. At 
the end of 2010 a new Group Risk and Solvency 
Committee was created to support the Board 
in the discharge of its responsibilities under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and Solvency 
II regulation. This Committee takes over the risk 
governance responsibilities of the Amlin plc Audit 
Committee and its role is further described in the 
Corporate Governance section on ( pp.62). 
Defining our risk appetite and standards
The Group’s risk appetite is set by the Amlin plc 
Board and drives appetite and risk decisions 
within all Group entities. The appetite articulates 
the risk bearing desire and capacity of the Group, 
with a clear risk appetite statement for each risk 
category. The appetite statements are supported 
by risk tolerance limits, which are practical 
measures put in place to ensure risk appetites 
are not exceeded. These tolerances are then 
allocated among the Group’s operating entities, 
with each entity reporting its status against 
appetite on a quarterly basis. 
Risk standards define how this framework will  
be implemented in practice across the Group in  
a Solvency II environment, and plans are in place 
to adopt them in each Division during 2011.
Creating our Own Risk and  
Solvency Assessment
The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) 
is a key business process required under 
Solvency II that brings a coordinated view of  
risk and solvency together for management. This 
information helps to ensure that management 
and Boards are fully aware of risk and capital 
implications when making decisions and that 
appropriate mitigation plans are developed 
to support the successful delivery of business 
strategies and priorities. 
During 2010, a reporting process and infrastructure 
to support the delivery of the ORSA was piloted 
with extensive management consultation to 
ensure that it develops into a key business tool.
The Group and operating company Boards and 
risk committees now receive quarterly ORSA 
reports which consolidate existing analytical 
data on risk exposures for each regulated entity 
and the Group as a whole. The process captures 
current risk exposures as well as identifying 
emerging risks. Risk events and near misses are 
captured for the purposes of learning and to help 
prevent recurrence.
The reports highlight the status of each key 
risk relative to approved tolerances using 
both deterministic and stochastic modelling 
techniques. These reports rely on consistent  
risk assessment processes that were rolled out 
across all business units and support functions 
during 2010. In particular, these processes  
have supported the embedding of Amlin’s  
risk framework in ACI.
We made significant investment during the year 
in the development and roll out of enterprise  
risk management training to staff to assist with 
the adoption of new practices and reinforce  
a common risk culture across the Group. 
Modelling and exposure management
Amlin aims to deliver an attractive cross-cycle 
return on capital through the maintenance of  
a diversified portfolio of business combined 
with excellent capital management. Diversification 
across different business lines and geographies 
provides an effective balance of catastrophe 
and non-catastrophe exposures and reduces 
the risk of any one event, or series of events, 
causing unacceptable impairment to the 
Group’s balance sheet. 
During 2010 we continued to develop our 
Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) model which 
is our principal tool for analysing the range 
of possible outcomes, in terms of expected 
profitability, for the Group and each regulated 
entity. This modelling provides the principal 
support for assessment of our economic and 
regulatory capital requirements. We are further 
enhancing this as part of an Internal Model for 
Solvency II purposes ( pp.41). We refined our 
evaluation of counterparty credit risk through DFA 
modelling techniques and further developed our 
use of market risk modelling to assist and provide 
information to the Investment Management

Executive in support of their decision making  
( pp.52). In addition w e completed an external 
review of our investment risk model. 
2010 also saw significant development of our 
operational risk modelling capability. We joined 
the Association of British Insurers operational risk 
database, ORIC (Operational Risk Consortium 
Limited). This has given us access to a risk event 
database and the ability to create a stochastic 
model for operational risk, which is now 
integrated into our overall DFA model.
Amlin’s DFA modelling is integrated into 
the ORSA report to support the Board and 
management in determining appropriate  
risk strategies, setting and monitoring use  
of risk appetite. 
Our actuarial modelling provides a critical 
ingredient to our risk management approach 
but is ultimately used to inform underwriters 
and management, on whose judgement and 
experience we ultimately rely and who remain 
accountable for exercising prudent judgement. 
We have focused during 2010 on strengthening 
the use of our Internal Model within key business 
processes such as business planning, assessment 
of reinsurance purchase, investment decisions 
and strategic business decisions. This work has 
been conducted to support Amlin London, Amlin 
UK, Amlin France, ACI and Amlin Bermuda in  
a consistent manner. 
Amlin has carefully defined a regime of governance 
and oversight of its Internal Model to ensure that 
management is able to review and challenge the 
use of the model. In due course, these processes 
will include clear validation and change control 
techniques to meet our regulatory obligations.

Focus on Solvency II
Solvency II is an EU directive aimed at 
overhauling the regulation of life and non-life 
insurers. The key objective of Solvency II is 
to introduce a more risk-based approach to 
regulation, with strong incentives for firms to 
assess their own capital requirements internally. 
The directive goes beyond existing regulation 
by aiming to instil a high standard of risk 
management and governance within each insurer. 
Implementation is scheduled for 2013 although 
transitional provisions are now being considered.
Amlin’s approach 
Under Solvency II, there are two prescribed 
methods for assessing an insurer’s regulatory 
capital requirements – using either a standard 
formula set by the regulator or an Internal 
Model specific to that insurer which is subject to 
regulatory approval. We believe that obtaining 
approval for Amlin’s Internal Model will give the 
business greater capital flexibility and competitive 
advantage over insurers operating under the 
standard formula. Embedding its use in our 
decision making will improve risk management 
and lead to enhanced risk adjusted returns.
Amlin has invested in developing its own capital 
model using Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA), 
which has been operational for several years. 
We are focused on using the DFA model within 
the business, recognising that judgement should 
continue to play a major part in our decision 
making. This will help with Solvency II compliance 
and should also allow significant benefits to be 
extracted for the business. 
T o help to provide a vision for wider Solvency 
II compliance, beyond use of the DFA model, 
management agreed a T arget Operating Model at the 
start of the Solvency II programme.
The Target Operating Model is business focused 
and designed to protect our successful underwriting 
culture. By further embedding actuarial analysis 
and a more formal risk management process into 
Amlin’s operations it will reinforce risk, return and 
capital management at the heart of our decision 
making. It assists Amlin in three key areas:
  Assessment of capital requirements
  Assessment of risk appetite and tolerances
  Informing and challenging key business 
decisions such as reinsurance purchasing.
Effective management of risk and capital is a key 
strategic priority. The risk framework currently 
being embedded as part of the Target Operating 
Model will further enhance definition of the risk 
standards and risk tolerances which guide our 
day-to-day business processes and ensure that 
we do not breach our risk appetite. 
We will calculate economic capital for the complete 
spectrum of risks identified by our risk framework, 
ensuring that our capital requirement reflects our 
risk profile and enabling capital to be allocated and 
returns measured on a risk adjusted basis.
Progress during 2010
During 2010 Amlin completed the important 
pre-application preparation for Solvency II 
on schedule. We made significant progress 
with the development of the Target Operating 
Model, embedding various aspects of the 
Model into the day to day operation of the 
business, such as improved reporting tools, 
using output from the Model for the business 
planning process and in defining risk appetite 
and tolerances and measuring activity against 
these. This development is providing improved 
understanding of the risk profile of each class 
and assisting underwriting management in 
understanding the balance between risk and 
reward for each class. 
Other important achievements during the year 
included the development of an improved and 
consistent governance structure across the 
Group and Group policies to support international 
expansion. A Group-wide management 
information framework has developed.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements 2010 was another year of change and development 
for the Group which required some short term 
solutions as well as continued work towards 
longer term strategic goals. We continued to 
invest in our change management capabilities in 
order to position the Group for future growth, as 
well as to enable us to meet the needs of Amlin’s 
Solvency II programme.
ACI Platform Replacement Programme
The Platform Replacement Programme (PRP) for 
ACI was again an important focus during the year. 
The primary objective of the PRP is to migrate 
ACI’s business operations from the Fortis Group 
systems environment to a new platform based 
on existing Amlin Group systems components. 
Further objectives are to enable ACI business 
processes to be rationalised across product lines, 
the adoption of a number of key Amlin standards 
and improved operational efficiency. 
The platform replacement is a complex endeavour 
in which all ACI’s systems will be replaced together. 
This includes policy and claims administration 
systems, operational accounting and the general 
ledger, document production and scanning, 
market and broker interfaces and other components. 
The transition to the replacement systems platform 
also requires migration of approximately 100,000 
live policies, open claims and histories.
Insurers rarely replace their entire systems platform 
in one event. Typically, the platform would be 
replaced component by component over a period 
of several years, in order to reduce complexity 
and cost. 
Due to the unusual circumstances of the acquisition 
of ACI, our initial planning assumption was that 
we should aim to complete the transition within 
two years, rather than the three or four years 
that might more typically be planned. We also 
concluded that step by step transition was not 
possible, since it was not practical to establish 
temporary new interfaces between existing Fortis 
systems and new ACI systems during transition.
Planning work was completed by the end of 2009 
and the main software solutions were selected 
early in 2010, prior to the design and build phase, 
to ensure that ACI’s specific business needs are met. 
By the end of 2010, a number of the major 
development activities within the Programme 
were well advanced. Most of the software 
construction had been finished and testing  
was underway. The design and build of the data 
migration processes was also in progress and 
the initial migrated products were available for 
testing. Initial systems training material was also 
developed to enable users to understand how 
the new systems will operate within the wider 
business processes they support.
Over the course of 2010 we rationalised the ACI 
product range to provide similar features and 
benefits for policyholders, but with less than half 
the number of products, enabling lower cost and 
more rapid deployment, by for example, reducing 
unnecessary differences between countries or 
similar products within a country.
We also established how key controls will be 
deployed within ACI’s underwriting, claims and 
technical accounting, through which Amlin’s 
standards for these activities will be achieved.
Key activities planned for the early part of 2011 are:
  Finishing the remaining software development, 
representing less than 10% of the required 
enhancements to vendors’ base software – 
and the testing of the systems
  User acceptance testing to ensure that  
the processes that use the systems are  
fully operable
  At least two full dress rehearsals of the 
transition event will be scheduled before  
the live cutover is undertaken
  Training preparation and delivery to ACI staff. 
The target date for the deployment of PRP remains 
mid 2011, with the remainder of the year as the 
planned contingency period. From the point of 
cutover, ACI will be operating wholly within the 
Amlin environment. Whilst we continue to target 
a complete cutover for both the Netherlands and 
Belgium, we may move the date of the transition 
later in 2011 in order to incorporate more features, 
reports and controls and to allow ACI’s people 
more time to become familiar with the new 
systems and processes.
When Amlin purchased Fortis Corporate Insurance 
from the Dutch state, existing transition services 
agreements between entities within the Fortis 
Group stated that the Fortis provision of systems for 
ACI would terminate on or before 30 June 2011. 
We have since agreed with Fortis Insurance 
Belgium (now AG Insurance) to extend the 
systems support further so that we do not face a 
risk of loss of systems support. An extension has 
been purchased and further periods of extension 
can be bought if necessary.
Supporting the development  
of the business
Integrating all Amlin businesses (new and existing) 
into Amlin’s Core Systems Architecture remains 
a priority, supporting our continuous data 
improvement agenda. During the year we 
fully integrated acquisitions Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting and Lockton’s Insolvency Risk 
Services, while the integration of Amlin France 
continued. With further work to come to complete 
this project, we are pleased with the progress that 
was made in the year. 
In May 2010 the Group announced the 
establishment of Amlin Re Europe. By leveraging 
existing Amlin infrastructure, such as the core 
policy and claims management systems, and 
basic financial reporting and accounting systems, 
we were able to create the infrastructure for 
Amlin Re Europe to commence underwriting 
in the fourth quarter of 2010 with 23 staff fully 
supported. Further enhancements to the Amlin 
Re Europe infrastructure and capabilities will 
continue through 2011 as the business develops.
During the year we further developed an 
operational risk framework for the Group. The 
framework includes operational event analysis 
(both internal and external operational events) to 
ensure that the causes are understood, potential 
weakness in the control environment identified 
and appropriate management action taken.

Industry best practice benchmarks for IT controls 
and management practices have been defined. 
The framework will be rolled out across Divisions 
in 2011. 
As part of an ongoing review of efficiency, as 
Amlin becomes a larger and more international 
business, it was decided during the year to adopt 
a shared services approach for IT across the 
Group. This will allow the formation of centres  
of excellence in the operation of IT infrastructure, 
supplier management, and procurement that  
can be leveraged throughout the Group and  
will enable Group synergies in terms of data 
centres and IT development. During the year  
we appointed a Chief Information Officer

Enhancing oversight and risk

A key role for Operations is in developing 
operational governance standards within the 
Amlin operating businesses, in order to provide 
assurance to the Board on the performance of 
operational controls and to assist the Group in 
meeting legal and regulatory expectations over 
operational risk and integrity of data. At a local 
level within the business, operational oversight 
will assist businesses in monitoring and reporting 
performance against agreed operational standards 
and help to ensure consistency of measurement 
and data, as shown in the chart below. 
We are developing a Group-wide ‘Operational 
Dashboard’ that will allow operating Divisions to 
report key client service metrics, and internal 
efficiency and risk measures on a common basis. 
This will facilitate the meeting of Solvency II data 
quality requirements as well as allowing the 
sharing of best practice across the Group.

Developing and investing in talent
“ People remain the core of Amlin’s success. 
A key objective of the Group is to be seen 
as ‘the place to work’ in the industry and 
our continued focus on attracting and 
retaining high calibre professionals across 
the business during 2010 reflects the 
importance of this goal.”
Mark Farrow 
Human Resources Director
Organisational development
2010 was a year of change and organisational 
development for the Group, both in terms 
of structure and people. During the year we 
invested further in management and underwriting 
resource, both to support current growth within 
the Group and in preparation for an improved 
trading environment. Amlin employed a total  
of 1,391 people at 31 December 2010 and  
the number of new staff joining the Group  
during 2010 was 328, of which 55 joined  
through acquisitions.
One of our objectives for 2010 was to support 
Group-wide organisational development including 
the integration of acquisitions, large or small, and 
the establishment of new ventures. Secondly, as 
the Group continued its expansion during 2010 
in the UK, Continental Europe and Bermuda, we 
further strengthened our Group and divisional 
management resource to support the broader 
scope of the business. 
The establishment of a new European reinsurance 
division, based in Zurich, involved the single largest 
recruitment programme for a senior underwriting 
team ever undertaken by Amlin. During 2010, 
the initial team was supplemented by further 
underwriting talent and support staff and at year 
end, Amlin Re Europe’s staff totalled 23. We intend 
to expand the team further as the business grows 
over the next few years. These new reinsurance 
specialists bring substantial experience of the 
European market which adds significantly to 
Amlin’s existing reinsurance expertise, which has 
focused on the US and global markets.
A major focus for 2010 was the successful 
integration of ACI’s staff in the Netherlands, 
Belgium and France. Initiatives included the 
integration of management information, the 
harmonisation of job evaluation and salary 
administration structures and the development 
of new bonus arrangements including a more 
performance related incentive plan. The ACI 
management team was also strengthened 
with two key appointments, being a Chief Risk 
Officer and Chief Operations Officer, to align its 
structure and expertise in these areas with other 
business divisions within the Group. 
During 2010 we made senior external and internal 
appointments across the Group, both in support 
of business growth, to address the demands of 
Solvency II, and to support the development of 
our Target Operating Model. These appointments 
further strengthened our expertise in areas such 
as Underwriting, Risk Management, Operations, 
Finance and Tax. 
A global Succession Plan covering all areas of the 
Group was also established in 2010 furthering the 
development and integration of all business areas. 
Recruitment and retention
In addition to the Amlin Re Europe recruitment, 
we were also successful in attracting three 
senior underwriters from leading competitors 
to join Amlin London in classes targeted for 
expansion, these being marine hull, specie  
and professional indemnity. 
In March, Amlin UK completed the transfer 
of AUA (formerly Lockton’s) Insolvency Risk 
Services business, increasing headcount by 40 
employees and enhancing Amlin’s capabilities in 
this specialist market segment. 
We continued to focus on the retention of Amlin’s 
existing team of skilled and experienced 
underwriters, many of whom have been with 
Amlin for more than 15 years. Continuity of 
business relationships is a key strength of our 
team and our objective remains to maintain 
voluntary turnover, excluding retirements, of 
our senior underwriters below 10% per annum 
and our overall employee turnover below 
15%. During 2010 voluntary turnover of senior 
underwriters was 3.7% with overall voluntary staff 
turnover being 5.2%, as shown below. Our senior 
underwriters, including those joining the Group 
in 2010, have on average 23 years’ experience in 
the insurance industry and excluding newcomers 
in 2010, the senior underwriters have an average 
of 12 years’ service with the Amlin Group.
Developing new talent
Alongside our focus on retaining existing 
experienced employees we recognise the 
importance of investing for the future, through 
the training of graduates and other talented 
people within the business. Four graduates 
joined the inaugural Amlin London Graduate 
Development Programme in January 2010, which 
offers a two year rotational programme designed 
to provide experience of underwriting, claims, 
finance, operations and risk management across 
the Amlin’s UK business.

The programme is supplemented by regular 
development programmes to build their 
knowledge of insurance and develop interpersonal 
skills and all graduates study for the professional 
qualification of Associate of the Chartered 
Insurance Institute (ACII). 
ACI also has a two-year rotational Young 
Professionals Programme with eight graduates 
from The Netherlands and Belgium participating 
in 2010. The first class of Young Professionals to 
successfully complete their two year programme 
is now working within ACI. 
Amlin also supports the development of young 
people in overseas divisions. Amlin Singapore 
offers an annual internship programme, sponsored 
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which 
offers a student 12 weeks of training at Amlin 
Singapore including a two week placement with 
Amlin London. 
Amlin Bermuda funds two-year scholarships for 
Bermudian students which are offered through 
the Association of Bermuda International Companies 
Education Awards and The Bermuda Foundation 
for Insurance Studies. Three scholarship 
recipients worked with the company during 
college breaks in 2010. 
As an international business we increased the 
number of secondments and international 
assignments between Divisions throughout 2010 
enabling the sharing of best practice as well as 
developing the individuals.
Professional excellence 
During 2010 the Chartered Insurance Institute 
introduced Chartered status, granted by the 
Privy Council, for insurance companies. This 
gives Chartered Insurers parity with other 
professional firms and affords a powerful 
differentiator to distinguish Chartered Insurers 
from competitors and peers. 
In order to gain Chartered status, an insurer  
must ensure and demonstrate that staff members 
acquire and retain the knowledge necessary to 
be competent in their roles. It is a clear indicator 
of professional standing and demonstrates a 
commitment to excellence. In 2010, Amlin 
Underwriting Limited (AUL) became the first 
London Market insurer to be awarded corporate 
Chartered Insurer status. 
We believe that, as well as demonstrating to clients 
and brokers Amlin’s continued aspiration to 
provide the highest levels of skill and service, 
Chartered status will also enhance Amlin’s 
ability to attract top class graduates who might 
have previously only considered roles in more 
recognised professions.
In 2010 the number of Amlin staff studying  
for professional qualifications increased. In 
addition to ACII, these included actuarial, 
accounting, risk management and human 
resources qualifications. 
In addition to our focus on professional 
qualifications, the Amlin Academy continues  
to offer high quality management, personal and 
skills development programmes that aim to build 
on the existing skills of our staff. The choice of 
programmes has grown during 2010 and the 
offering is aimed at all levels of staff. 
In order to reach a wider audience and ensure 
consistent delivery of training across the Group, 
2010 saw the implementation of an online 
Learning Management System (LMS) which  
offers both internal and external courses. 
Remuneration and benefits
A Group Remuneration Policy was approved by 
the Board of Amlin Plc in 2010. This is discussed 
in more detail in the Director’s Remuneration 
Report on ( pp.77). 
During 2010, the Group’s reward and 
remuneration arrangements continued to  
be reviewed and a more performance related 
incentive plan was agreed for ACI. A new profit 
commission scheme will be also introduced in 
2011 ( pp.79).
As part of our employee contract, Amlin is 
supportive of flexible working and sabbaticals for 
long-serving staff, where local business conditions 
allow. We are working with our European divisions 
to implement these and other benefits across the 
wider Group.

Capital strength for our clients
“ A robust capital position is fundamental 
to our business model. As the cycle turns, 
we believe we are in a strong position to 
materially grow our business.”
Richard Hextall 
Group Finance Director
Active financial management is a key area of 
focus and has allowed us to consistently enhance 
the returns delivered to shareholders over a 
number of years. It also positions us to meet  
the future requirements of Solvency II.
The chart below shows the growth in gross and 
net assets over the past five years.

Determining our capital requirement
Understanding the level of capital required to 
operate is fundamental to our business. That 
understanding and its enunciation to stakeholders 
is important in providing our clients with 
confidence in our ability to pay their claims,  
to our regulators in allowing us to trade, to our 
financing partners in lending to us and to our 
shareholders in investing in the business. It also 
informs business planning and consequently 
affects our strategic direction.
Amlin uses Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) to 
model its capital.
The basic capital requirements are formed around 
the level of capital required in the business to 
contain the risk of insolvency to no greater than 
a probability of 0.5%. This is then uplifted to 
give a level of economic capital that the Group 
requires, or in the case of Syndicate 2001 that 
Lloyd’s requires, to support its financial strength 
rating and strategic needs. For example, we 
believe that the Group should retain a level of 
capital sufficient to permit material growth in the 
aftermath of a major insurance disaster and to be 
able to respond to other opportunities to enhance 
long term growth, including through acquisition.
The first table below sets out our assessed  
capital requirement by operating platform.

Adjusting the capital deployed to 
enhance returns
The form of capital deployed to meet short 
and long-term business needs is imperative in 
balancing the requirements of our stakeholders. 
Broadly, we have two choices: the provision of 
capital through equity or debt. When underwriting 
margins are sufficient to limit the impact of a 
large catastrophe loss to equity, debt capital will 
form a greater proportion of the overall capital 
deployed. When margins weaken, the level of 
debt capital used to support our underwriting  
will be reduced. 
In line with this philosophy, in recent years our 
debt to total capital ratio has fluctuated. For 
example, in 2005 debt increased in order to 
allow us to open Amlin Bermuda and increase 
our catastrophe underwriting risk. Margins were 
very strong and we believed that funding growth 
through debt was appropriate. Since 2006, the 
debt ratio has reduced as profits have increased 
net assets. At the end of 2010 the net debt to 
total capital ratio stands at nil (2009: nil). We 
believe this is an appropriate position at this point 
in the underwriting circle with pricing pressures 
evident across a number of our key classes. As 
the cycle turns, we believe we are in a strong 
position to grow materially.
Business focus
Active financial management is fundamental 
to delivering the financial strategy of the 
business.
We seek to:
1.  Understand the level of capital required.
2.  Adjust the level of equity and debt that is 
employed in order to enhance returns.
3. Enhance cashflow.
4. Effectively manage our investments.
5.  Effectively manage our currency exposures.
6. Prudently measure liabilities.

 
Return on equity of 13.9%, giving five year weighted average

Performance Financial management
We use subordinated debt as part of our capital 
management strategy. The debt is regulatory 
compliant, longer-term, unsecured and contains 
no financial covenants that could lead to early 
forced repayment. It is also recognised as capital 
by a number of the rating agencies. 
In addition, we have a £250 million unsecured 
revolving credit facility available by way of cash 
advances or letter of credit. This facility expires  
in September 2013 and is currently undrawn.
Managing equity capital for shareholders
Our financial performance management is centred 
on delivering a cross cycle return on equity of at 
least 15%. Given the Group’s cyclical underwriting 
approach, at certain points this will lead to the 
Group holding surplus equity capital. In order to 
enhance our return on equity, as actual levels of 
capital exceed our forecast capital requirements, 
we will look to return capital to shareholders.
The commitment to return of capital has 
been clearly demonstrated over recent years 
and we have employed a number of different 
mechanisms to do so, so as to appeal across 
the shareholder base. With the capital strength 
shown opposite we have allocated up to  
£75 million of cash for share buybacks over  
the coming year.
We have also continued to grow the dividend 
to our shareholders. We intend to increase our 
dividend per share consistently over the next few 
years. Our current capital strength should allow 
us to pursue this policy even if we suffer a major 
catastrophe loss.
After deducting the final dividend payment of  
£78.0 million and our share buyback authority  
of £75 million the core capital need largely 
matches the equity capital of the business.  
Our long term debt and banking facilities provide 
the scope for growth when the market turns.

Enhancing cashflow
At 31 December 2010, the Group’s cash and 
investments were £4.4 billion, an increase of  
£0.3 billion on the prior year (31 December 2009:  
£4.1 billion) reflecting net operating and 
investment cash inflows. Cash and investments 
are a multiple of 2.5x shareholders’ equity  
(2009: 2.6x).
The strength and liquidity of the balance sheet is 
critical to our proposition as an insurer of choice, 
providing us with the ability to respond quickly  
to claims in the event of a large catastrophic  
loss. Our capital strength and financial 
management approach mean that the Group  
can readily absorb the losses from the worst  
of our realistic disaster scenarios.
We use bank facilities to supplement the working 
capital strength of the Group. A $200 million 
secured LOC facility is available to Syndicate 
2001 to fund its US regulatory requirements 
and this reduces any potential funding pressures 
at times of catastrophic loss. If drawn, security 
is provided by a fixed charge over a portfolio 
of assets. Similarly, Amlin AG has a $200 million 
facility secured over three years in order to 
provide collateral to US cedants for their 
regulatory needs. At 31 December 2010 Amlin  
AG has issued LOCs amounting to $174.6 million.
ACI has an unsecured credit facility that provides 
a guarantee to a third party of up to €10.0 million 
and a guarantee/standby LOC for up to £22.5 
million. At 31 December 2010 €28.7 million  
of guarantees were issued. 
Efficient cash flow management is an important 
source of value to an insurer. We retain premium 
for an average of approximately three years 
before claims are settled. On large claims where 
reinsurance recoverables are due, we have 
to pay the claim before the recovery is made 
and rapid reinsurance response is important. 
Accordingly, strong credit management of 
premiums and reinsurance collectibles improves 
our performance.

Effective investment management
Our approach to investment management is 
directed by our investment risk appetite. This is 
based on, amongst other things, the perceived 
risk and returns of the different asset classes, the 
outlook for underwriting profits and the strength 
of our balance sheet. We do not simply target an 
absolute investment return. Rather, we seek to 
maximise returns for the level of risk that we are 
prepared to accept. This is achieved through:
1.  Setting appropriate strategic asset allocations 
using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
2.  Taking short-term tactical asset allocation 
positions around the strategic asset allocations.
3.  Identifying skilled external investment 
managers to manage the underlying assets.
We distinguish between policyholders’ funds, 
which are the premium received and used to 
meet future claims expenses, and capital assets, 
which support the underwriting business. 
For policyholders’ funds our risk appetite is 
relatively low, so they are held in a mixture  
of government and non-government bonds  
as well as LIBOR plus funds, whose underlying 
assets are bonds and currencies. The duration  
of these assets is referenced to the duration 
of the underlying liabilities which is reasonably 
short. However, we will from time to time reduce 
the duration of the assets if we believe that yields 
will rise. With increased interest rate risk in the 
second half of 2010 we have shortened the 
duration of the investment portfolio.

Effective currency management
The Group reports in sterling but manages a 
sterling business in the UK, a US dollar business 
in Bermuda and Euro businesses in Continental 
Europe. Amlin AG, which consists of Amlin Re 
Europe and Amlin Bermuda, reports in US dollars.
For our UK operations, we sell trading currency 
underwriting year profits into sterling as they 
crystallise, once we are materially through the 
Atlantic windstorm season. Amlin AG manages its 
US dollar trading position and holds its balance 
sheet mainly in US dollars reflecting its global 
underwriting profile. Similarly, ACI manages its 
Euro trading position and holds its balance sheet 
in Euros reflecting its European underwriting 
profile. At a Group level, we implement a policy to 
hedge up to 50% of the net dollar / Euro exposure 
of the Group to Amlin AG and ACI respectively. 
The Group’s hedges are achieved through the use 
of forward sales and other derivative contracts. 
In the year to 31 December 2010, the 
strengthening in the US dollar produced foreign 
exchange gains, before hedging, of £27.8 million 
on the dollar capital investment in Amlin AG.  
The hedges deployed reduced this gain by  
£4.1 million. For ACI, the movement in the Euro 
produced foreign exchange losses before hedging 
of £5.3 million. Hedges increased this loss by  
£0.1 million.
Estimating outstanding claims reserves
Estimation of claims reserves is a key aspect of 
financial management in that not only does it 
impact on overall profitability, but it also impacts 
investment mix as different approaches are 
taken for capital and policyholders’ funds. At 
31 December 2010 net claims reserves totalled 
£2,248.8 million (2009: £2,010.3 million).
Insurance is an inherently uncertain business and 
much of Amlin’s business is large commercial 
insurance or reinsurance, which can be volatile 
and difficult to estimate ultimate claims levels 
for. The subjectivities which must be considered 
when assessing the level of outstanding liabilities 
include the risk profile of an insurance policy, 
class of business, timeliness of notification of 
claims, validity of claims made against a policy 
and validity of the quantum of the claim. At any 
time there are a range of possible outcomes 
at which the claims reserves could ultimately 
settle, however, as time passes the uncertainty 
surrounding likely claims settlement reduces.
Given this uncertainty we follow a prudent 
approach to the assessment of liabilities. Our 
underwriting teams, in the UK and Bermuda,  
are responsible for proposing the level of 
reserves to be set in their business units. 
We believe that this ensures that they are 
accountable for the evaluation and uses their 
detailed knowledge of the underlying exposures 
underwritten, particularly as these change 
through time. Proposed reserves are compared 
with actuarial ‘best estimates’ set by the in-house 
actuarial team. Any required adjustments to 
the underwriters’ proposed reserves are then 
made and these are the accounted reserves. 
Consistency of reserving strength is our 
overall goal. 
For ACI, the local actuarial team produces full 
data on an accident year basis for review by 
the Group Actuarial team. This review involves 
production of an independent best estimate 
by class of business for comparison with the 
1 The efficient frontier represents the combinations of securities that produce the maximum expected return for a given level of risk
2  VaR is a statistical measure, which calculates the possible loss over a year, in normal market conditions. As VaR estimates are based on historical market data this should not be viewed as an absolute gauge of the level  
of risk to the investments 
proposed carried reserve. This process is more 
in line with our future Target Operating Model 
under Solvency II, although we envisage that the 
underwriting teams would present a benchmark 
reserve as well.
The only significant change in approach  
during 2010 has been to the reserves carried 
for the 2003 and prior underwriting years for 
Syndicate 2001, which are now mature in their 
development patterns. We have moved to 
carrying the actuarial best estimate, except  
for a small number of exceptions, to ensure  
that an inappropriate level of excess reserves  
do not build up over time. This has led to a 
release of £20.0 million through 2010.
We estimate that the Group as a whole holds 
reserves on an accident year basis of at least 
£175 million in excess of a strict 50:50 actuarial 
best estimate (2009: at least £200 million). 
However, it should be noted that the actuarial 
best estimate has largely followed underwriters’ 
estimates for major claims, including the Chile 
and New Zealand earthquakes. 
With significant catastrophe claims, downward 
rating pressures and volatile investment markets, 
2010 contrasted sharply with the relatively benign 
trading environment of 2009. Despite the 
challenging backdrop, Amlin delivered a  
robust performance.

Profit before tax was down 49.1% at £259.2 million 
(2009: £509.1 million), reflecting a significant 
increase in loss activity in the year, most notably 
from the Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, 
which generated combined losses of just in 
excess of £200 million. The return on equity was 
13.9% (2009: 37.0%). Over the longer term, the 
Group’s performance has been excellent, with a 
weighted average return on equity since 2006  
of 24.7%. This continues to materially exceed  
our cross cycle target of 15% and our estimated 
cost of capital over that period of around 10%.
For 2010 underwriting contributed £202.1 
million (2009: £365.8 million) to the pre-tax 
result. The key drivers were Amlin London and 
Amlin Bermuda contributing £125.6 million and  
£72.5 million respectively (2009: £155.0 million 
and £161.8 million). Amlin UK and Amlin France 
delivered lower returns of £9.4 million and  
£2.5 million respectively (2009: £27.5 million  
and £2.5 million), whilst ACI made a loss of  
£19.6 million (2009: profit £11.2 million). As 
noted above, underwriting conditions were much 
less benign than in 2009, with increased loss 
activity and downward pressure on rates. Given 
the notable increase in claims activity, the  
overall underwriting contribution represents  
a good result. 
Across the Group, claims development continued 
to be positive. Releases from reserves amounted 
to £156.5 million (2009: £174.1 million), of 
which ACI contributed £42.4 million. For 2010, 
our reserving methodology for Syndicate 2001 
has been adjusted such that for 2003 and prior 
underwriting years booked reserves have been 
taken as the actuarial best estimate, except where 
justified otherwise. This change in approach 
added £20.0 million to reserve releases at the 
year end. Releases in 2009 were boosted by  
a change of approach to UK commercial claims, 
which generated an additional release of  
£16.0 million. 
Financial markets continued to be volatile. The 
contribution from investments was £175.0 million 
(2009: £207.5 million), reflecting an investment 
return of 4.0% (2009: 5.9%) on increased average 
funds under management of £4.2 billion (2009: 
£3.4 billion). The natural weighting of the 
investment portfolios towards bonds, which 
generated low yields compared to 2009,  
held the overall return down, despite a  
strong equity performance. 
Net foreign exchange losses in the income 
statement amounted to £12.3 million  
(2009: net gain of £5.4 million). In addition,  
a net gain of £13.4 million on our subsidiary  
net assets exposures was taken to reserves 
(2009: net loss of £63.5 million).
Underwriting performance
In the context of significant catastrophe claims 
for our international reinsurance account and 
downward pressure on rates persisting in many 
lines of business, the combined ratio of 88% is a 
sound result (2009: 72%); 12% was added to the 
claims ratio from the Chilean and New Zealand 
earthquakes alone. 
Gross written premium was £2,172.5 million, 
an increase of 40.7% on the prior year (2009: 
£1,543.9 million). ACI, which was acquired on 
22 July 2009, added £656.6 million of written 
premium (2009: £225.2 million). Gross written 
premium for Amlin UK binder business was 
uplifted by £42.3 million following improvements 
in estimates of business written under binding 
authorities. This change primarily relates to 
the timing of income recognition and does not 
materially impact profit in the period.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 50 Performance Financial management
The underlying increase in written premium, 
excluding ACI, was £197.2 million, from the 
addition of new business across Amlin London, 
Amlin UK and Amlin Bermuda, offset by an 
average rate decrease of 1.8% across the 
portfolio (2009: increase 4.4%). The retention 
ratio was 86% (2009: 90%).
Amlin London wrote gross premium of  
£889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million), with 
growth achieved within the aviation, marine 
and property and casualty business units. 
Amlin UK’s gross written premium increased 
to £291.9 million (2009: £190.9 million). The 
uplift includes the aforementioned adjustment 
of £42.3 million, reflecting improvements to 
estimated premium for binder business, which 
is an increasing component of the property 
account. Underlying growth was supported by an 
average rate increase of 1.5%, but also net new 
business generated largely in fleet, other motor 
and package lines.
Amlin Bermuda contributed £439.0 million  
of income, an increase of 9.7% (2009: £400.2 
million). This included direct income  
of £282.9 million (2009: £243.1 million).  
The retention ratio was a healthy 90%. 
Selective new business success and a 
favourable foreign exchange movement  
also contributed to growth.
For 2010, reinsurance expenditure was  
£262.2 million, representing 12.1% of gross 
written premium (2009: £221.3 million and 
14.3%). The inclusion of ACI accounted for  
£98.3 million of the overall expenditure. The core 
reinsurance programmes, covering our insurance 
businesses, were renewed with structures largely 
unchanged from 2009. The retrocessional 
programme in London was restructured in the 
period, following a review of the value offered 
by the previous programme. Greater retention 
of the first major catastrophe loss is now borne 
by the Group, but cover was purchased which 
responds in the event of a series of medium sized 
catastrophes. Amlin Bermuda also purchased 
similar cover.
Growth in gross premium over 2009 and  
2010 and favourable exchange movements  
drove net earned premium 32.7% higher to 
£1,748.1 million (2009: £1,317.3 million). 
The Group claims ratio for the year increased to 
60% (2009: 43%), reflecting Chilean and New 
Zealand earthquake claims (adding 6% each), a 
number of individual large risk losses and the 
inclusion of ACI. Natural catastrophe activity was 
higher in the year, with overall insured market 
losses estimated at $37
1
 billion compared to  
$22 billion for 2009.
The Chilean earthquake, which occurred on  
27 February 2010, was the largest insured  
event in the year, with an estimated loss of  
$8 billion
1
. Amlin’s exposures are mainly within 
the international catastrophe account, where 
our current estimated claims have been reduced 
modestly from $132.3 million disclosed in our 
interim results to $127.5 million, following receipt 
of further information from reinsured clients. Claims 
from our other classes are more limited at an 
estimated $28.0 million. 
The New Zealand earthquake, which occurred on 
3 September 2010 has an estimated insured loss 
of $3.3 billion
1
. Amlin’s estimated net claims are 
$160.0 million again predominantly within the 
international catastrophe account.
The scale and damage arising from both these 
events continues to be uncertain but, given the 
size of the earthquakes, our current loss estimates 
are intended to be conservative. Also, given the 
caps for exposed policies, there is scope for only 
limited deterioration to our estimates.
Exposure to Australian flood losses is currently 
uncertain and depends on how losses develop 
and the availability of reinsurance and 
retrocession cover. This is dependent on the 
ultimate scale of claims, whether the three 
identified flood losses are considered a single 
or multiple events, and which underwriting year 
or policy losses are declared upon. The net loss 
estimate for the 2010 result is £16.0 million.
There were several large risk losses in the year, 
in particular the loss of the Deepwater Horizon 
oil rig in April. While there are a number of 
complex and unresolved issues regarding liability, 
coverage and quantum, we continue to estimate 
that our net exposure resulting from the loss is 
approximately $15 million. 
ACI incurred approximately €13 million of  
claims from natural catastrophe activity, with  
€6.3 million of marine claims caused by the 
Chilean earthquake, largely from damage to 
shipbuilding yards, and €6.6 million of large 
losses from flooding affecting the Belgian 
property book.
Investment performance
The Group investment return for the year was 
4.0% and, with average funds under management 
of £4.2 billion, investments contributed £175.0 
million to the 2010 result (2009: 5.9%, £3.4 
billion and £207.5 million respectively). The table 
below shows the breakdown of asset allocation 
and returns.
Investors’ risk appetite varied during the year. 
In the first half, a number of negative factors, 
including the European sovereign debt crisis, 
Chinese policy action aimed at economic 
slow down and the reversal of global leading 
economic indicators, led to investor concerns 
regarding the possibility of a return to recession. 
Safe haven assets out performed risk assets as 
investors made the flight to quality. Lower yields 
were evident for US, UK and core European 
government bonds. 
From the summer, anticipation of further quantitative 
easing (QE) boosted demand for US and UK bonds. 
In the US, this proved to be a classic case of ‘buy 
the rumour, sell the fact’ and bond yields rose 
once QE started. In the UK, stronger than expected 
third quarter GDP data meant that QE was off the 
agenda, but gilt yields rose. 
In the first part of the year we continued our 
strategy of allocating more Group assets to 
LIBOR plus funds, so as to widen the opportunity 
set available to managers and to give them scope 
to produce positive returns when bond yields 
increase. However, mid year, key personnel 
departures at one of our managers meant that 
we moved some of these funds into cash as we 
searched for alternatives. Post August we have 
looked to reduce the level of interest rate risk in 
our bond portfolios. The average bond weighting 
during the year was 80%.
Risk assets produced solid returns during 2010. 
The average equity weighting was 7% although 
market returns and increased allocations took the 
weighting to 8% at the end of the year.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Financial management continued
The insurance linked securities portfolio continues 
to be managed by Leadenhall Capital Partners in 
the form of two standalone investment funds. The 
risk profile remained constant over the year, with 
Amlin’s investment increased to $111.9 million 
across both funds. The return on $109.9 million 
of average funds under management was  
$11.4 million or 10.4% (2009: $68.8 million,  
$8.3 million and 12.4%).
Expenses
Total expenses, including underwriting and non-
underwriting costs, increased to £610.5 million from 
£461.6 million in the prior year. Underwriting 
expenses, excluding foreign exchange movements, 
amounted to £481.1 million (2009: £360.0 
million). Non-underwriting expenses, excluding 
foreign exchange movements and finance costs, 
were £89.7 million (2009: £84.0 million).
Underwriting costs represent costs relating to 
the acquisition and administration of insurance 
business and claims payments. Non-underwriting 
expenses include employee incentives, 
investment management fees, ACI separation 
and integration costs and corporate expenses not 
directly attached to underwriting businesses. 
Within underwriting costs, acquisition costs 
accounted for £71.7 million of the increase, 
due to growth in income. Acquisition costs have 
remained reasonably stable at 16.9% of gross 
earned premium (2009: 17.3%). The remaining 
variance is largely driven by the addition of  
£32.4 million of expense from a full year of ACI.
ACI separation and integration costs, amounting 
to £16.6 million, included within non-underwriting 
expenses are not considered ongoing costs of 
the business. In addition to items expensed in 
the period, ACI expenditure on a replacement IT 
platform of £17.4 million has been capitalised at 
31 December 2010. It is anticipated that further 
expenses of approximately £10 million will be 
incurred in completion of ACI separation and 
integration.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the period is 14.4% 
(2009: 10.7%). It is below the UK rate of 
corporation tax primarily due to Amlin Bermuda, 
which operates locally with no corporation tax. 
The increase in the effective rate compared to 
2009 is due to the lower relative profit generated 
by Amlin Bermuda, which was impacted by the

Dividends
The Board proposes a final ordinary dividend of

provides total dividends of 23.0 pence per share 
(2009: 20.0 pence per share), an increase of 15.0%. 
Net tangible assets
In addition to the £221.9 million profit after  
tax recognised through the consolidated

an £85.1 million decrease in net assets,  
bringing total equity and reserves to  
£1,729.9 million (2009: £1,593.1 million).  
The key movements are: 
  Dividends totalling £102.5 million  
(2009: £83.8 million).
  £17.6 million of gains from the currency 
retranslation of overseas operations (2009: loss 
£92.8 million) offset by £4.2 million of losses 
recognising the revaluation of associated 
hedge instruments (2008: gain £29.3 million) 
in accordance with hedge accounting rules  
of IAS39 “financial instruments, recognition 
and measurement”.
  Actuarial gains of £5.9 million (2009:  
loss of £23.7 million) on Group defined 
benefit pension schemes.
Intangibles have increased by £21.7 million to 
£184.5 million (2009: £162.8 million) following 
the acquisition of AUA Insolvency Risk Services

the ACI IT platform replacement programme. 
As a result, net tangible assets have risen by  
8.0% to £1,545.4 million at 31 December 2010, 
(2009: £1,430.3 million).
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 52 Performance Financial management
Outlook
Rating environment
The rating environment in which our businesses 
are operating remains varied which, given the 
diversity of our business across classes and 
platforms, provides us with the opportunity to 
continue to allocate capacity where margins are 
most attractive.
This is illustrated at 1 January 2011 renewals. The 
overall Amlin portfolio saw a fall in rates of 1.3% 
on renewal. Underlying, the reinsurance accounts 
of London and Bermuda saw an average renewal 
rate reduction of 3.7% but the UK fleet motor 
account had a rate increase of 7.4%. However, 
rate movements do not provide the whole picture. 
For example, our reinsurance accounts are under 
pricing pressure but continue to offer strong 
margin potential. We are therefore likely to seek to 
hold our position. By contrast, the UK fleet motor 
account rate increase is from the bottom of the 
pricing cycle and after a period of retrenchment, 
we expect to materially increase our underwriting  
if the upward pricing trend continues. 
It is therefore important to consider the various 
business units separately in order to get a 
complete picture of our trading outlook.
Reinsurance pricing overall is softening under the 
weight of surplus capacity following two benign 
years for US catastrophe claims. The major 
earthquakes of 2010 caused an immediate uplift 
to regional pricing in the loss affected areas, but 
we do not anticipate any broader market impact 
in 2011. While newsworthy, the impact of the 
Australian floods at the end of 2010 and at the 
start of 2011, look likely to be modest events for 
reinsurers. However, as we have observed before, 
the reinsurance market has been disciplined 
in recent years and this was evidenced in 
2010 by nearly $12 billion
1
 of capital returned 
to shareholders through share buybacks and 
dividends across the industry, a trend we expect 
to see continued in 2011. 
Amlin’s 1 January reinsurance renewals, which 
account for approximately 40.6% of reinsurance 
business expected to be written for the year, 
showed reinsurance rates down by 3.2% for Amlin 
London and 4.4% for Amlin Bermuda. Margins 
after these modest reductions remain attractive, 
particularly for US catastrophe business, and 
Amlin again retained strong support from brokers 
on more competitive placements. 
For the US property and casualty and aviation 
sectors the return potential remains unattractive 
despite poor market returns. Property and 
casualty business in Continental Europe also 
remains competitive with both local and 
multinational insurers competing fiercely for 
market share in the sectors where ACI and 
Amlin France operate. Competition has been 
heightened by lower demand in many classes 
as a result of the economic slowdown. Given 
the abundance of capacity in these markets, 
an upturn in pricing seems unlikely in the short 
term. However ACI’s property and casualty 
performance remains solid and a disciplined 
approach will through time provide a different 
trend to a market that has lost discipline. In these 
sectors of the market, this discipline is often 
the factor that ensures survival and prosperity 
through the trough of the cycle.
The marine market offers better prospects for 
selective underwriting. Rates for our London 
business were relatively stable and ACI at the  
1 January renewals achieved a 2.5% rate increase. 
The re-underwriting process for Rotterdam and 
Antwerp continued, which should also lead to 
an improvement in performance. While it is 
disappointing to report that a significant amount 
of business that was deemed by the team in 
Rotterdam to be unsatisfactorily priced was 
ultimately lost, the historic performance  
of the business renewed was significantly  
better. Following the Deepwater Horizon oil  
spill, there are good opportunities to expand  
our energy underwriting. 
In the UK, we saw an improving rating trend for 
fleet motor at the end of 2010 following a more 
competitive market than expected earlier in the 
year. This was reflected in an overall rate increase 
of 7.4% for fleet motor in January. In motor 
fleet, as elsewhere in the UK commercial market 
there is increasing evidence of financial distress 
as competitors withdraw or reduce capacity on 
unprofitable business. With similar trends in the 
personal lines market exacerbated by the impact 
of the severe winter weather in 2010, we expect 
to see improvement in pricing for UK commercial 
lines in 2011. 
Loss activity
As always the level of natural catastrophe 
activity in the year will influence our financial 
performance and the future rating environment. 
The beginning of 2011 has continued with the 
active pattern that we saw last year. Australia 
was battered by cyclone activity, bringing heavy 
flooding to Southern Queensland and cyclone 
Yasi followed in February. These events are 
likely to fall within our normal expectations for 
natural catastrophe activity. The Christchurch 
earthquake in February 2011 is a major 
catastrophe loss with current insured loss 
estimates ranging from NZ$5 billion to NZ$11.5 
billion
2
. At this stage, it is difficult to quantify the 
potential claims arising from this earthquake, 
which is exacerbated by its occurrence in the 
same city as the 2010 event. While we would 
expect a material level of claims, it is important 
to recognise that they will not necessarily be 
proportionate to the claims incurred for the 
September earthquake. This is partly due to 
damage overlapping and also due to the non-
proportional nature of reinsurance contracts and 
their finite financial limits.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Investment markets
Our investment performance has in recent years 
been a differentiator against our peers. Our 
approach has been risk focused and flexible. In 
volatile markets this has allowed us to continue 
to make a strong absolute contribution to the 
business. The economic background to 2011 
appears to be more positive than we have seen 
in recent years. While there may be some further 
volatility, for example from the European debt 
crisis, the outlook for economic growth in the US 
and much of Europe as well as in the developing 
world, appears good. This should prove beneficial 
for equities and we increased our equity 
weighting to 8% in December 2010. 
However, we expect that our overall return for 
2011 will be held back by low yields on our bond 
portfolios and low interest rates which limit the 
returns on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, 
if interest rates rise faster than the market expects 
this will further subdue the investment returns 
from bonds in 2011 although this will also naturally 
lead to better prospects into the medium term.
We will review our risk appetite against returns 
on offer but do not believe that we will be able 
to substantially improve returns without taking 
undue risk. 
Summary
In a more challenging underwriting environment 
Amlin’s underwriting discipline and broad 
portfolio should ensure that we continue to 
generate healthy underwriting returns. We 
expect to remain in a lower investment return 
environment but our proactive approach to 
investments will seek to optimise that return  
for the risk taken. We are confident of being  
able to trade successfully through this stage  
of the pricing cycle and are in a strong position  
to grow when conditions are more appropriate.
Outlook continued
Benefiting from diversity, investments 
and new initiatives
The trading environment in 2011 is likely to 
be unsupportive for general organic growth. 
However we will find attractive opportunities 
where pricing has reacted to loss experience, 
such as in energy and fleet motor. 
In addition we can achieve growth by disciplined 
and selective underwriting, particularly where we 
have made investment in new people or through 
acquisitions. For example, the expansion in the 
UK property book achieved in 2010 resulted from 
previous investments in the underwriting and 
claims teams, enhanced marketing and small 
acquisitions which have positioned the Group 
well. We expect to continue to take advantage of 
niche acquisition opportunities such as J R Clare 
and Lead Yacht, acquired in respectively January 
and February 2011. 
Amlin Re Europe got off to a very strong start 
at 1 January renewals, writing €65.6 million of 
gross premium. This confirmed client and broker 
support for their proposition as a high quality 
long term business partner in the European 
reinsurance market and augers well for the future 
development of this new venture. The successful 
launch was assisted by Amlin’s higher profile in 
Europe following the acquisition of ACI and the 
continued development of Amlin France. We are 
mindful of the weak rating environment in this 
market and do not expect to record a substantial 
contribution to profit in the current year. However, 
the longer term growth prospects offered by this 
business and the build up of a modest footprint 
gives us great flexibility to pursue opportunities as 
this market improves through time.

57 Directors’ report
The directors of Amlin plc (the Company) present 
their report, the audited accounts of the Company 
and the consolidated accounts of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the year 
ended 31 December 2010.
Principal activity, Business Review and 
key performance indicators
The Group’s principal activity is non-life insurance 
and reinsurance underwriting in the Lloyd’s 
market, Bermuda and Continental Europe. A 
review of the Group’s business, and developments 
during the year, is set out in the Annual Report 
(Overview, Strategy and Performance sections)  
( pp.2-54). Further information is provided in 
the risk disclosure note and in this Governance 
section of the Annual Report ( pp.103 and  
pp.60 respectively). The Review and Performance 
sections, risk disclosure note and Governance 
section together include the information and 
analysis required by section 417 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to be included in a Business Review, 
including information on key performance 
indicators and on the Group’s financial and other 
risk management and policies. Such information 
and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference 
into this report.
Share capital, treasury shares and dividends
The Company’s share capital during the year 
consisted of ordinary shares of 28.125p  
each (Shares).
There were 502,076,006 Shares in issue, at  
the year end (2009: 502,076,006), including 
Shares held in treasury, throughout the year.  
No Shares were bought back into treasury during 
the year (2009: also nil). 1,270,343 Shares were 
transferred out of treasury during the year to 
service exercises of employee share options 
(2009: 1,599,228), leaving 5,875,701 Shares 
in treasury at the year end (2009: 7,164,424). 
There have been no issues of shares or further 
share buy backs or transfers into treasury since 
the year end but a further 17,550 Shares had by 
25 February 2011 been transferred from treasury 
to satisfy employee share options, leaving 
5,858,151 Shares in treasury at that date.
An interim dividend of 7.2p per Share (2009: 6.5p) 
was paid on 7 October 2010 to shareholders on 
the register on 10 September 2010. The directors 
now propose a final dividend of 15.8p per Share 
(2009: a second interim of 13.5p), to be paid on 
19 May 2011 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 25 March 2011. 
This makes total dividends for the year of 23.0p 
per Share (2009: 20.0p). Those shareholders 
wishing to use any of these dividends, other than 
the 2009 second interim dividend, to purchase 
further shares were, and are, able to participate 
in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Details of the 
Plan are available on the Company’s website  
and shareholders are being reminded of the  
Plan as this Annual Report is being published. 
Directors
The directors’ biographical details are set out 
immediately before this report ( pp.56). All of 
the current directors served throughout the year. 
All directors will offer themselves for election  
or re-election at the Annual General Meeting  
on 12 May 2011 (AGM), in accordance with the 
new UK Corporate Governance Code provision 
for annual re-election of all FTSE 350 companies’ 
directors, save for Mr Holt who is not offering 
himself for re-election but will retire at the 
conclusion of the meeting. As will be detailed in 
the separate Notice of AGM, and as referred to  
in the Board Corporate Governance Statement, 
Mr Simon Beale is being proposed for election  
at the AGM as a new Director of the Company.
Directors’ interests
The interests of those directors and their related 
parties who have interests in the shares of the 
Company, all of which are beneficial except 
where indicated otherwise, are set out above.
In the cases of the three executive directors, 
Messrs Carpenter, Hextall and Philipps, the above 
holdings include beneficial interests held through 
the Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and 
details of their interests in share options and long 
term incentive plans are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report later in this Governance 
section of the Annual Report, as are details of the 
total interests of the trustees of the SIP and of the 
Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust. Details 
of transactions between the Group and directors 
who served during the year are set out in note 37 
to the Accounts.
No directors have any other interests in the shares 
or any other securities of the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries. 
Substantial shareholdings
At 25 February 2011 the Company had been 
notified of the holdings of 3% or more of its 
issued ordinary share capital set out at the  
top of the opposite page.
Corporate governance and Directors’ 
remuneration
The Board Corporate Governance Statement 
and reports from the Board’s Nomination and 
Audit Committees are set out with other reports 
later in this Governance section. Details of 
the Company’s rules on the appointment and 
removal of directors, and on how the Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended, are set 
out in the section entitled ‘Articles of Association’ 
in the Board Corporate Governance Statement  
( pp.69). Details of Directors’ remuneration and 
of the Board’s Remuneration Committee are set 
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, also 
later in this Governance section.
Employment policies
The People section of the Review provides 
commentary on the Group as an employer, 
including its commitment to training and 
professional development. The Group recognises 
the importance of employee engagement and 
therefore operates the Amlin Consultative Forum 
in the UK and Amlin Corporate Insurance Works 
Councils in the Netherlands and Belgium as 
frameworks for discussion and consultation 
between staff and management in these three 
countries where the great majority of Group 
employees work. In addition to engagement 
through line managers, employee communication 
is also facilitated by intranet communication and 
a monthly Group e-newsletter. 
The Group’s equal opportunities policy aims 
to ensure that no employee, in application for 
initial employment or as an existing employee 
(including in the event of a change in his or 
her circumstances), receives less favourable 
treatment because of his or her gender (including 
gender reassignment), marital or family status, 
actual or perceived sexual orientation, age, 
ethnic origin, race, colour, nationality, national 
origin, creed, political affiliation, part-time status, 
disability, or any other condition, unless differing 
treatment can be shown to be legally justifiable.

Copies of the Group’s policies, some applying 
to the whole Group and some to the UK with 
local variations outside the UK, on professional 
qualifications, family leave, flexible working, 
sabbaticals, staff harassment and equal 
opportunities are available on the Company’s 
website or from the Secretary on request. The 
Group’s health and safety policy and details of its 
local application are publicised to staff, including 
by intranet. Its operation in the UK is monitored 
by a staff Health and Safety Committee. The 
Chief Operations Officer, Mr Andrew Grant, 
who reports to the Group Chief Executive, is 
responsible for oversight of health and safety 
throughout the Group.
Corporate responsibility and charitable 
donations
A Corporate Responsibility report is set out later 
in this Governance section ( pp.73-75). The 
Group Chief Executive is responsible at Board 
level for leading, and reporting to the Board on, 
the Group’s initiatives on corporate responsibility 
related matters. Relevant policies and terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s website.
As part of a wider corporate responsibility and 
community budget, the Group made charitable 
donations during the year of £147,287 (2009: 
£133,668). The charities budget in the UK 
is managed by a Community and Charities 
Panel chaired by a senior underwriter. Non-UK 
subsidiaries’ community and charities budgets 
are managed locally under the direction of  
their boards.
Political donations
The Group made no political donations during  
the year (2009: nil). 
Supplier payment policy and performance
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers in 
accordance with agreed terms of business. 
Whenever possible, purchase orders are placed 
on the basis of the Group’s standard terms 
and conditions which include provision for the 
payment of suppliers within 30 days of the end of 
the month in which the Group receives the goods 
or in which the services are provided. Average 
trade creditors of the Group during 2010, which 
excludes insurance creditors, represented 
approximately 30 days (2009: 27 days), based on 
the ratio of Group trade creditors to the amounts 
invoiced during the year.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of AGM, to be held at noon on 
Thursday 12 May 2011 at the offices of the 
Company at St Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London, 
EC3A 8ND, is contained in a separate circular 
to shareholders which is being mailed or 
otherwise provided to shareholders at the  
same time as this report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made third party indemnity 
provisions for the benefit of its directors and 
certain directors of the Company’s subsidiaries. 
The current indemnities of the directors of the 
Company were entered into during 2008,  
with the exception of Mrs Bosse (2009). All  
of such indemnities remain in force at the  
date of this report.
Authorisation of directors’ conflicts  
of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit 
the authorisation of a director’s potential conflict 
of interest or duty, for instance arising from a 
director’s appointment as a director of another 
company which may have a business relationship 
with the Group. Such authorisations may be given 
by the remaining directors who are independent of 
the potential conflict. A number of authorisations 
have been approved by the Board in this manner. 
Such authorisations do not remove a director’s 
duty to ensure that any actual conflict of interest 
or duty, should it arise, is dealt with appropriately, 
usually by the director taking no part in the relevant 
Board or Committee decision.
Directors’ statement on the disclosure of 
information to the auditors
Each director at the date of the approval of this 
report confirms that:
  so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
  the director has taken all the steps that he 
or she ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish  
that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions  
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern 
The Group’s business, risk and financial 
management, performance and position, 
together with factors that are likely to affect 
future development, are described in the 
Performance section of this Annual Report  
( pp.28-54). Capital management strategy, 
which covers how regulatory and economic 
capital needs are measured and how capital 
is deployed, is described under Financial 
Management on pages ( pp.46-52). The 
financial position of the Group, including 
commentary on cash and investment levels, 
currency management, insurance liability 
management, liquidity and borrowings, is also 
covered in that section. 
In addition note 2 to the accounts describes 
capital management needs and policies, and  
note 3 covers underwriting, market, liquidity  
and credit risks which may affect the financial 
position of the Group. 
The Group has considerable financial resources 
to meet its financial needs and, in much of the 
Group, manages a mature portfolio of insurance 
risk through an experienced and stable team. The 
directors believe that the Group is well positioned 
to manage its business risks successfully in the 
current uncertain economic environment.
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts. 
Auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting for the re appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and  
ito authorise the Audit Committee to determine 
their remuneration.

culture and values.”

Board composition and independence 
Throughout the year and up to the date of this 
report the Board of Amlin plc (the Board or 
plc Board) comprised: the Chairman, who is 
non-executive, five independent non-executives, 
one non-independent non-executive (Mr Holt) 
and three executive directors. Their biographical 
details are set out earlier ( pp.56).
All of the directors with the exception of Mr Holt 
will be offering themselves for re-election at the  
forthcoming AGM. Mr Holt asked not to be 
considered by the Nomination Committee  
for re-election as he has decided to retire  
as a director at the conclusion of the AGM. 
The Chairman was independent on his 
appointment in 1998 but, as Chairman, is  
not classified as independent. Five of the other 
non-executive directors, all of whom have tenure 
of between two and seven years, have been 
determined by the Board as being independent 
in character and judgement with no relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to affect, or 
could appear to affect, the director’s judgement. 
Mr Holt is classified as a non-independent non-
executive as he was an executive (Underwriting 
Director) until 2008. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and as permitted by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Board has authorised a number 
of potential conflicts of interest regarding the 
independent directors. 
Mr Buchanan, the senior independent non-
executive director, who retired as a partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) in 2001, 
receives a pension annuity from that firm that 
can vary if PwC’s financial results do not meet 
a certain threshold. The Board believes that 
Amlin is not a material enough client to a firm 
of PwC’s size for this to affect whether such 
threshold is met. Therefore, following PwC’s 
appointment in 2009 as auditors, the Board 
authorised the potential conflict involved in 
Mr Buchanan continuing to serve as Audit 
Committee chairman, allowing him to be 
involved in all aspects of the Committee’s work, 
save that he would step aside from involvement 
in any financial dispute or litigation between the 
Group and PwC were it ever to arise. 
During the year both Mrs Bosse (until 31 January 
2011) and Mr Feinstein (to date) were directors of 
overseas insurance companies which, like many 
insurers around the world, purchase reinsurance 
from the Amlin Group on normal commercial 
terms. These transactions are not material either 
to Amlin or , the Directors believe, to the other 
companies and in both cases the reinsurance 
relationship is independent of, and pre-dates, their 
Amlin directorships. The Board remains robustly 
of the view that such inter-company transactions 
are an inevitable consequence of engaging 
non-executive directors with relevant current 
insurance industry experience (which, in view of

Governance Board corporate governance statement
Regulated subsidiaries within a Group 
management framework
During the year the organisational and 
governance arrangements of the Group  
have continued to evolve. 
Each of the Group’s business platforms 
come under its own regulated board: Amlin 
Underwriting Limited (AUL) for the Group’s 
Lloyd’s operations (for Amlin London and Amlin 
UK); Amlin AG (AAG), domiciled in Zurich, 
Switzerland (for Amlin Re Europe and Amlin 
Bermuda); Amlin Corporate Insurance NV (ACI), 
operating in the Netherlands and Belgium; 
and Amlin France Holdings SAS (AF) for the 
Group’s French business. AAG is the previous 
Amlin Bermuda Limited, redomiciled and 
reincorporated in Zurich on 7 October 2010, and 
now operates with both a Swiss business and a 
Bermudian branch. AF includes both the previous 
Anglo French Underwriters (AFU) and ACI in 
France, sourcing business for both the Lloyd’s 
syndicate and ACI. 
AUL’s executive governance is split between an 
Amlin London management committee and an 
Amlin UK management committee. They each 
hold quarterly review meetings with Group and 
AUL executives, in addition to AUL executive 
directors reporting to the AUL Board. AAG, 
the other subsidiary containing two business 
platforms, is run by a unitary board but with 
underwriting and other management decisions 
delegated to the local teams in each location.
In parallel with the corporate structure, there 
are management accountabilities of particular 
functions, for example finance, operations and 
risk management, which help embed Group 
standards and seek to ensure that there is good 
two way communication between functional 
management at the centre and each local entity. 
The relationship between the corporate and 
management structures is illustrated in  
the ‘Corporate and management structure’  
chart below.

Separate entity management with  
a strong Group governance input
Each regulated subsidiary has its own executive 
management separate from that of the Group, 
with Group executives including the Chief 
Executive (Mr Philipps), Finance Director (Mr 
Hextall) and/or Chief Risk Officer (Mr Illingworth) 
sitting as non-executives on subsidiary boards 
along with the relevant business’s executive 
management either on the board or on a 
management board. 
One of the main ways in which the Company 
ensures that there is sufficient Group influence 
and control within this delegated structure is 
through overlapping board memberships (the 
year end position is illustrated in the ‘Board 
memberships’ chart below. 
In the UK the Chairman and, at present, three 
other non-executive directors of the Company 
also serve as non-executives on the AUL Board  
in addition to the Group Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director. The latter perform 
“internal non-executive” roles within AUL, which 
is managed by its own Managing Director, 
Finance Director and the Underwriting Directors 
of Amlin London and Amlin UK. Mr Illingworth, 
a director of AUL and other subsidiaries, is Chief 
Risk Officer at both Group and AUL levels.
The AAG board has four executive directors from 
its own businesses (two from Amlin Re Europe 
and two Amlin Bermuda) and, at the year end, its 
non-executives were three members of the Amlin 
plc Board, Messrs Hextall, Holt and Philipps. 
ACI has a two tier board structure comprising a 
Supervisory Board made up of two independent 
directors and three plc/Group executives and a 
Management Board (whose members usually 
attend Supervisory Board meetings) presently of 
six ACI executives. AF’s board comprises three 
Group executives, one executive from each of 
the Group entities to which it provides business 
(AUL (for the Lloyd’s syndicate) and ACI) and 
three Amlin France executives. 
In terms of plc Board reporting, key indicator 
reports on each business unit are made to the 
plc Board in addition to consolidated reports at a 
Group level, enabling the Board to concentrate on 
its key strategic and control roles. Presentations 
are also made to the Board periodically by each 
business unit.
Board Committee structures
As the plc Board has overall responsibility to 
shareholders and other stakeholders for the 
Group’s operations, it is necessary not only for 
the plc Board to direct the overall strategy, values 
and standards for the Group but for its Board 
Committees to be able effectively to oversee 
the aspects of the whole Group relevant to their 
responsibilities. As with board governance, 
the distinction between Group and subsidiary 
responsibilities is reflected in committee structures.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 62 Governance Board corporate governance statement
The plc Audit Committee leads the process of 
review and makes recommendations to the Board 
regarding the external auditors, financial reporting, 
internal control and internal audit, and regulatory 
and compliance matters. The process is designed 
to ensure that significant risks are identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled. AUL and ACI 
each have their own Audit Committees, which 
make reports to the plc Audit Committee as well 
as to their respective boards. In January 2011 a 
separate Board level Risk and Solvency Committee 
was established, taking over some of the Audit 
Committee’s responsibilities. It will lead the process 
of reviewing risk and make recommendations 
to the Board for risk management, risk appetite, 
solvency, economic and regulatory capital matters 
(all matters that during 2010 were reviewed by the 
Audit Committee). Both the Group and the major 
subsidiaries will continue to have executive  
risk committees. 
The Nomination Committee reviews succession 
planning for key roles within the whole Group, 
reporting the conclusions of its reviews to the  
Board and, when appropriate, to relevant subsidiary  
boards. The Remuneration Committee also 
reports to the Board and, on occasion, reports 
the conclusions of its reviews and makes 
recommendations on matters within the control 
of regulated subsidiaries to such subsidiaries’ 
boards and/or remuneration committees. 
This new committee structure from 1 January 
2011 is illustrated in the chart below.
Executive, as well as Board,  
corporate governance
Amlin regards Board level corporate governance 
as only the most visible aspect of a review and 
decision-making structure that goes much 
deeper. It remains the philosophy of the Group 
that key decisions and processes, including purely 
executive ones, take place within an objective 
governance framework, whether they be at 
Group, subsidiary or divisional level. 
Formation of Group Management Committee  
in early 2010 
The Group Executive, consisting of the Group 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Chief 
Operations Officer and Chief Risk Officer, is 
responsible, through the Chief Executive and 
directly, to the plc Board. Its members also join 
the Board for its annual planning and strategy 
session at which the Group strategy is determined 
or refined. The heads of each business area and 
each area’s chief financial, operations and risk 
officers report both to the relevant member of 
the Group Executive and to their operational 
boards and management committees. In addition 
to the Group Executive, a Group Management 
Committee (GMC), including representatives from 
each of the main business divisions, was formed 
in early 2010 and meets ten to twelve times a 
year, assisting the Group Chief Executive and 
acting as a forum for resolving management  
and strategic issues. 
The business functions themselves are all 
described in more detail in the Review section of 
the Annual Report. Summaries of the governance 
arrangements for some key functions now follow. 
Reserving
Responsibility for reserving is that of the regulated 
boards and, at Group consolidated level, the 
plc Board but it is important that the process 
through which executive management reach their 
reserving decisions is objective and robust. This 
role is performed by their respective quarterly 
review or board meetings, which review and 
finalise the preliminary reserving conclusions for 
their businesses, reporting at subsidiary board 
level each quarter and, twice-yearly, to the plc 
Audit Committee. Quarterly review meetings 
receive actuarial assessments from the Group Risk 
Assessment & Monitoring department reviewing 
the consistency of the key reserving judgements.
Risk management
In 2010 the Audit Committee had specific 
responsibilities for risk, as outlined in more detail 
in that committee’s report. That committee, as 
well as the plc Board, receives quarterly reports 
from the Chief Risk Officer on the whole Group.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements
63 For 2011 the Risk & Solvency Committee will take 
over this role. A dedicated Group Risk Assessment 
and Monitoring Department (RAM) oversees 
the management of risk to ensure that each 
operating entity manages its risk in accordance 
with Group policies and allocated risk tolerances. 
As well as the Chief Risk Officer reporting to the 
Board and its relevant committee, reports from 
RAM are reviewed and appropriate executive 
actions considered by a Group Executive Risk 
Committee. In addition each regulated entity’s 
board is responsible for the entity’s risk, supported 
by executive risk committees or other executive 
reporting arrangements. Further details of the 
Group’s risk management, and its development 
during the year, are set out in the Review section 
of the Annual Report. 
Investments
The setting and execution of the Group’s 
investment strategy has its own hierarchy 
of responsibilities. The relevant boards are 
responsible for setting and monitoring their own 
investment risk appetites within the overall Group 
investment appetite. Investment advice and 
many elements of management are outsourced 
to the Group Investment function headed by 
the Chief Investment Officer. An Investment 
Management Executive consisting of the Group 
Finance Director, Group Chief Executive and Chief 
Investment Officer has responsibility for strategic 
asset allocation decisions and advice, with 
operational and tactical asset allocation decisions 
being taken by the Group Investments team. The 
executive is assisted in its decision making and 
recommendations to the boards by an Investment 
Advisory Panel (IAP) consisting of the members 
of the Investment Management Executive plus 
three external investment experts. Investment 
management itself is outsourced to external 
managers. The whole process is governed by both 
Group and regulated subsidiaries’ investment 
frameworks, which document what decisions may 
be taken at what level. 
Board and Committee meetings and 
attendance
The plc Board held six regular Board meetings 
in 2010 (2009: six) and one two-day planning 
and strategy session (2009: one). No additional 
special Board meetings were necessary in 2010 
(2009: two). The subsidiary operating boards met 
quarterly. The attendance of each director at plc 
Board meetings (out of seven possible meetings, 
including the planning and strategy session) are 
shown below. The committee attendances of 
those directors who were members of any of the 
principal board committees for all, or any part of, 
the year are shown in the same table.
The Combined Code and UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the 
Company complied with all of the provisions 
of section 1 (companies) of the Combined 
Code. From 29 June 2010 this became the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the new Code) 
which took effect for Amlin on 1 January 2011. 
The Company participated in the consultation 
process for the new Code. Since its publication 
in final form the Board has considered the extent 
to which the Company already satisfies the new 
Code and the actions that may be taken  
to comply fully:
  The Board is satisfied as to the balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company possessed by  
the directors, and of their diversity, to satisfy 
the new Code;
  Director appointments are made on merit, 
against objective criteria and with due regard to 
diversity on the Board, to ensure a satisfactory 
balance amongst directors;
  The Board is mindful of the new Code’s 
requirement for the annual evaluation to be 
externally facilitated at least every three years 
and is currently considering the nature and 
timing of such facilitation;
  In accordance with the new Code’s 
requirement for the annual re-election of 
FTSE 350 companies’ directors, all of the 
Company’s directors nominated and wishing 
to continue will, beginning with the 2011 
AGM, offer themselves for re-election each 
year. While it is not proposed to change the 
Company’s Articles, non-executive directors’ 
appointment letters have been re-issued in 
early 2011 to take account of the new Code 
including annual re-election.
This report, the following Committee reports  
( pp.70-72), the Directors’ Remuneration  
report ( pp.76-87), and Annex 1 to this report  
( pp.66-68) together describe how the Company 
applied the Main and Supporting Principles of the 
Combined Code during the year. Annex 2 to this 
report ( pp.69) summarises certain governance-
related aspects of the Company’s Articles of 
Association (Articles) and is incorporated by 
reference into the Directors’ Report.
Board internal control statement 
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and has complied with Principle C.2 
of the Combined Code and the new Code by 
establishing a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks the 
Group faces. This process has been in place from 
the start of 2010 to the date of approval of this 
report and is in accordance with the Combined 
Code (in respect of 2010) and the new Code (in 
respect of 2011 to date). The process includes 
risks arising from social, environmental and 
ethical matters. 
The Board is also responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of established systems of internal 
control and the directors are aware that any 
such system is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or financial loss. 
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the 
Combined Code (also C.2.1 of the new Code), 
the Audit Committee reviews regularly, on 
behalf of the Board, the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal 
control. Monitoring covers all controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management processes (the latter of 
which will have the additional input, from 2011 
onwards, of the newly established board Risk 
and Solvency Committee). We can confirm that 
necessary actions have been or are being taken to 
remedy any significant identified control failings 
or weaknesses and the Audit Committee has 
received regular reports from management  
to assist with this process.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 64 Governance Board corporate governance statement
Control framework
The Board has put in place a management 
structure with defined lines of responsibility 
and clear delegation of authority. This structure 
cascades down through the business units and 
central functions with clear responsibilities for 
ensuring that appropriate controls are in place  
at an operational level, including those in relation 
to the financial reporting process. A reporting 
mechanism to monitor how these initiatives are 
working has also been established. Key elements 
of the overall control environment are the various 
executive governance bodies discussed earlier 
in this Board Corporate Governance statement, 
including the Group Executive, which meets 
regularly and is responsible for strategic and 
operational activities on a day-to-day basis,  
and the wider Group Management Committee. 
These bodies receive oral and written reports  
from Amlin’s businesses and support departments. 
The other key control elements are the subsidiary 
boards (including where applicable their Audit 
and/or Risk Committees) and review committees. 
These boards and review committees are 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of 
Amlin’s individual subsidiaries or business units, 
including relevant aspects of internal control. 
Business planning
The Group has developed a formal structured 
business planning process which operates for all 
business elements. This operates on an annual 
cycle with proposed plans being presented to 
and agreed by relevant subsidiary boards prior 
to being consolidated and approved by the plc 
Board. Monitoring processes operate monthly 
and Board reporting quarterly. The Group’s 
financial performance monitoring includes 
detailed reporting against budgets and the 
preparation of longer-term projections.
Risk assessment
Amlin’s Risk Assessment process includes output 
from a system for reporting on all the significant 
identified risks to the achievement of Group 
objectives and on the nature and effectiveness  
of the controls and other management processes 
to manage these risks. Risk appetites are set for  
key categories of quantifiable risk, for example 
catastrophe, reserving, investment and operational  
risk. The system encompasses self assessment of 
controls by risk owners throughout the business 
coupled with independent challenge of these 
assertions by the Group Risk team. Significant 
risks, their potential impact on the Group’s financial 
position, any variations from the agreed risk 
appetites, and the actions taken to manage 
those risks, are reviewed regularly by the Group’s 
Risk Committee of senior executives and by the 
Audit Committee (during 2010) or the Risk and 
Solvency Committee (from 2011).
Amlin has continued to develop its Group Internal 
Model during 2010 with the intention that it 
captures all the key economic and risk factors 
which could impact the performance of the 
Group. It has also developed a process to collate 
and report information from the internal model 
consolidated into an Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA) which both the Audit 
Committee and the Board have reviewed.  
This process and the ORSA document will  
be developed further in 2011.
Internal audit and compliance
Internal audit and compliance monitoring work 
is carried out by the Group’s Internal Audit and 
Risk Assessment & Monitoring departments 
respectively. The latter also provides compliance 
advice. The heads of both departments report 
to the Group Chief Executive and to the Audit 
Committee. The Group has established risk  
based audit and compliance programmes for 
reviewing and evaluating the internal controls  
and compliance procedures used in the 
management of risk.
Assessment
The plc Board receives regular reports from 
the Audit Committee which reviews the main 
processes established by the Group, including  
the matters which are the regulatory responsibility 
of the boards of AUL, ACI, AF and AAG. These 
processes are designed to ensure that significant 
risks are identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled. They also permit the Audit Committee 
to determine whether any significant weaknesses 
are promptly remedied or indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. 
The Audit Committee has also performed a 
specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual 
Report. This assessment considers all significant 
aspects of internal control arising during the period  
covered by the report, including the work of 
internal audit. The Audit Committee assists the 
Board in discharging its review responsibilities. 
The review for this Annual Report has for the first 
time included the Amlin Re Europe division of 
Amlin AG (ARE). The Committee reviewed a report 
on the design of ARE’s underwriting controls that 
were put in place from when it started writing 
business in September 2010, which indicated that 
the design is appropriate. The Board has received 
regular reports during the year on operational 
issues at ACI, which has been engaged in a 
programme of finance, information technology 
and risk management process changes. The 
internal control environment at ACI does not 
yet meet the high standards to which the Group 
aspires. However, good progress in implementing 
key controls was made in 2010 and there are 
plans in place to address further internal control 
weaknesses, leading to further improvements in 
the control environment.
The Audit Committee has additionally reviewed 
and is satisfied with the Group policy whereby 
arrangements are made for staff in confidence 
and if they wish via an external reporting line, 
to raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other 
matters. The Committee is satisfied with such 
arrangements for the longer standing parts of 
the business and is assured that appropriate 
arrangements are being made in certain of the 
Continental European jurisdictions where such 
arrangements are not yet fully in place.

Annex 1 to Board Corporate Governance statement: Summary of compliance with the Combined Code
Area of section 1 of the Combined Code Commentary
A. Directors
A.1 The Board 
“an effective board…collectively responsible for 
the success of the company”
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its own and its committees’ decisions provides that 
the Board’s primary obligation is to lead and control the Company and its business, with exclusive 
decision making powers over such matters as: overall strategy and resources; risk appetite; investment 
strategy; remuneration policies; accounting policies; capital expenditure, acquisitions and debt facilities 
over certain thresholds; and certain key Group policies, appointments and categories of public 
announcements. The detailed implementation of all these matters, and day-to-day business, are  
left to management, which reports formally to the Board at least quarterly on underwriting, financial,  
risk and other operational matters and objectives. The current schedule of matters reserved  
to the Board is available in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of ‘Investor Relations’ on the  
Company’s website. 
The Board meets regularly, usually at full strength, as demonstrated in the ‘Board and Committee 
meetings and attendance’ section and table ( pp.64). The NEDs met during the year without 
executive directors or other executive management present, including at least once without the 
Chairman. The Chairman chairs full NED meetings and the senior independent director chairs  
meetings when the Chairman is not present.
A.2 Chairman and chief executive 
“clear division of responsibilities”
There is a division of responsibilities on the Board between the Chairman, who is responsible for 
leading and running the Board and related matters such as Board induction and evaluation, and the 
Group Chief Executive, who has executive responsibility for running the Group’s business. A statement 
detailing this division of responsibilities, which includes provision for the Chairman’s role in ensuring 
accountability of the Chief Executive to him and to the Board, in shareholder relations and in ensuring 
constructive relations between executive and non-executive directors, has been approved by the Board.
A.3 Board balance and independence 
“a balance of executive and non-executive 
directors (…in particular independent NEDs)”
The balance of the Board, its strong independent representation and the sharing of Committee work 
is set out in earlier sections of this Board Corporate Governance statement. Mr Buchanan is the senior 
independent director designated as an appropriate director to whom shareholders’ concerns may be 
conveyed if contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director  
has failed to resolve them or is inappropriate.
A.4 Appointments to the Board 
“formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors…expected 
time commitments of NEDs”
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) set out clear powers of removal, appointment,  
election and re-election of directors. 
The process for nomination to the Board and for considering succession planning is set out in the 
Nomination Committee report below. 
The Board continues to satisfy itself that the Chairman has sufficient time available to devote to his 
duties as non-executive Chairman of the Company (and of AUL). The letters of appointment of the 
Chairman and the other NEDs, which are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, 
set out the following expected minimum annual time commitments to the Company and AUL:
  Chairman of the Company (also of AUL): 75 days
  Senior independent, including chairing Audit Committee (Mr Buchanan): 30 days 
  Chairmen of Remuneration Committee and Risk and Solvency Committee (Sir Mark Wrightson and 
Mr Davey respectively): 25 days
  Member of both a Board Committee and of the AUL Board (Mr Feinstein): 25 days
  Others (including either a Board Committee or membership of the AUL Board): 20 days.
Mr Holt’s time spent as a non-executive director of ABL/AAG is not included in the above.

A. Directors
A.5 Information and professional development 
“timely quality information…induction on 
joining… regular update (of) skills  
and knowledge”
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate information to enable it to discharge its 
duties, including providing constructive challenge to, and scrutiny of, management. Further information 
is obtained by the Board from the executive directors and other senior executives as appropriate. All  
directors are provided with written materials on their responsibilities as directors of a public company 
and on other relevant regulatory, legal, accounting and insurance industry matters. Updating information  
on technical and/or industry matters is provided to the Board with opportunities for discussion. During 
2010 special sessions were held on a number of aspects of risk management and solvency, particularly 
those associated with the advent of Solvency II for insurers within the EU, and on the Bribery Act and 
competition law. A Board visit was also made to ACI’s head office and Netherlands operations. In 
addition, the Company encourages and facilitates other professional development for both executive 
and non-executive directors as is required for their particular roles. 
The Company maintains a model director induction programme but this was not operated during  
the year as there were no new directors. Procedures are in place for directors and Board Committees 
collectively to take independent professional advice, when necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board and its committees are supported by the Company Secretary and his team who, under the  
direction of the Chairman, advise the Board on governance matters and help to ensure good communication 
and information flows within the Board, including between executive and non-executive directors and 
between the Board and its Committees. The Secretary also facilitates the Board updating and induction 
work outlined above. Subsidiary Boards (other than ABL which, until it became a branch operation of 
AAG, had its own local arrangements in Bermuda) and executive level committees are also serviced, 
attended and minuted by the Secretary or another member of his team.
A.6 Performance evaluation 
“formal and rigorous annual evaluation  
of its own performance”
Since the last annual report the Board has completed an annual evaluation of the performance of the 
Board, its Committees and each director. The annual evaluations were initiated by a questionnaire 
completed by each director giving his assessment of both collective and individual performances. 
The results of the latest internal Board evaluation were summarised by the Chairman at its meeting in 
February 2011 and the Board agreed its conclusions. Each Board Committee evaluated its performance 
at the turn of the year, and the conclusions were also reported to the Board in February 2011. 
The Chairman discusses any issues arising from the evaluation of each individual director, including the 
performances of executive directors in respect of their boardroom as opposed to executive roles (which 
are evaluated as part of the Group’s regular Performance Development Review process), with the 
director concerned. The Chief Executive’s total performance is reviewed by the Chairman.
The Chairman’s own evaluation was conducted by the non-executive directors led by the senior 
independent director, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The senior independent 
director discussed and agreed the conclusions with the Chairman. 
A.7 Re-election 
“re-election at regular intervals…planned  
and progressive refreshing of the board”
The Articles of Association of the Company provide for re-election at regular intervals, as more fully 
described in the next section of this report.
Details of the procedures whereby appointments and re-appointments to the Board are considered 
are set out in the Nomination Committee report ( pp.70). Board and individual directors’ evaluations 
are taken into account by that committee when considering specifications for new NEDs, succession 
planning and nominations for re-election at AGMs. Further details of the terms of appointment of both 
the non-executive and executive directors are also set out in the Directors’ Remuneration report.

B. Remuneration
B.1 The level and make-up of remuneration 
“levels…sufficient to attract, retain and 
motivate directors…avoid paying more than is 
necessary…significant proportion (of executive 
remuneration) linked to performance”
The Directors’ Remuneration report ( pp.76-87) sets out the policies and practices which 
demonstrate the Company’s implementation of this Code principle and provisions.
B.2 Procedure 
“formal and transparent procedure”
The above sections entitled ‘Board composition and independence’ and ‘Board and Committee 
meetings and attendance’ demonstrate the appropriate membership and meeting frequency of the 
Remuneration Committee. There are generally around five main meetings each year with a varying 
number of other meetings to give formal approvals or to deal with urgent or unscheduled matters. 
Further details of the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference and the Board’s policy and 
practices regarding NED remuneration and terms of office are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration

The Audit Committee’s role in ensuring that the Group’s financial reporting meets the standards of 
transparency and balance that are required and in monitoring reporting to regulators is set out in more 
detail in the Audit Committee report following this report. A ‘going concern’ statement is included in 
the Directors’ report ( pp.59).
C.2 Internal control 
“sound system of internal control”
The Board’s statement and commentary on its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system  
of internal control is set out in the ‘Board internal control statement’ ( pp.64-65).
C.3 Audit Committee and auditors 
“formal and transparent arrangements for…
(applying) financial reporting and internal  
control principles”
The role of the Audit Committee and the conduct of the relationship with the auditors is set out  
in the Audit Committee report ( pp.71-72).
D. Relations with shareholders
D.1 Dialogue with institutional shareholders 
“dialogue based on mutual understanding  
of objectives”
The Company is committed to a process of continuing dialogue with its shareholders, including making 
appropriate contact with institutional investors and their representative bodies when there are specific 
matters to discuss. Other details of the dialogue, and its reporting to the Board, are set out in the 
‘Investor relations’ section of the Annual Report ( pp.75).
D.2 Constructive use of Annual General Meeting 
“use AGM to communicate with investors  
and encourage their participation”
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM by the Chief Executive making a presentation there on 
the Group’s progress. The voting participation at its last three AGMs was proxies representing 68%, 77% 
and 77% of its shares in issue in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Electronic proxy voting, details of 
which are included in the 2011 AGM circular and Notice of Meeting, is made available. The totals of 
proxy votes on each resolution, including details of any votes withheld, are announced at the meeting 
after each resolution has been dealt with on a show of hands and the full proxy voting results are 
always announced through a regulatory news service and on the Company’s website. In the event  
of a close result as indicated by the proxies held by the chairman of the meeting, the chairman would 
call a poll but this did not prove necessary at any of the AGMs referred to. The Board believes that the 
immediacy of voting on a show of hands with the proxy votes immediately being announced, rather 
than a laborious process of conducting a formal poll on every resolution,  
is appreciated by the shareholders who attend the meeting. 
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 68 Annex 2 to Board Corporate Governance statement: Summary of Director and shareholder governance provisions in the  
Articles of Association
Area of section 1 of the Combined Code Commentary
Directors
Appointments to the Board The Company’s Articles set out clear powers of removal, appointment, election and re-election of 
directors. A director may be removed either by a unanimous resolution of fellow directors or by an 
ordinary resolution of the Company in general meeting. As regards appointments, the Board may 
appoint additional directors at any time but such appointees must, if they wish to continue, be elected 
by shareholders by an ordinary resolution at the AGM following their appointment. Directors may 
also be appointed by election at the AGM. The Articles also provide that no term of office may exceed 
the period between election or re-election by shareholders and the AGM in the third year following 
such election or re-election. Although the Board intends to comply from the 2011 AGM with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code annual re-election provision for FTSE 350 companies, it is not intended  
to amend the Articles in this respect. 
Re-election to the Board The Articles of Association of the Company provide that, following a director’s election by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting immediately following his or her initial appointment by the Board, each 
director’s term of office before being required to submit himself or herself to shareholders for re-election 
is three years. This term has historically been shortened to one year for any NED who has served on 
the Board for nine years or more. As referred to immediately above, from 2011 it is intended that all 
directors will generally submit themselves for re-election annually.
Relations with shareholders
Procedure at Annual General Meeting Voting at the Annual General Meeting is conducted on a show of hands unless a poll is called for (which the 
Chairman himself would do if the proxies he held indicated any sort of close result). Advance voting on a 
poll is not offered. However , Shareholders’ proxy votes can be submitted electronically through the CREST 
settlement system and the Company’s Registrar’s website and a proxy may cast his vote on a show of 
hands or on a poll in different ways in respect of different blocks of shares within the same holding.

69 Nomination Committee report
Leadership and succession
The Nomination Committee seeks to ensure 
that the Board, its committees, and those 
filling other leadership positions, have the 
right balance of experience and qualities 
to deliver the strategic leadership, values, 
management and framework of controls 
required for the Group’s success. 
Roger Taylor 
Chairman
Terms of reference
The Nomination Committee (the Committee) is 
responsible for identifying, and nominating for the 
approval of the Board, all candidates for Board 
appointment and proposed election or re-election 
to the Board, whether non-executive or executive, 
and for assisting the Board in its oversight of 
succession planning, including for key executives 
throughout the Group. 
Re-nomination of directors to the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) is considered on  
a case by case basis before recommendations 
are made. This remains the case now that the 
Board, from the 2011 AGM, has adopted annual 
re-election of all directors. The Committee’s terms 
of reference require it to give full consideration to 
succession planning, in respect of both the Board 
and senior executive roles, taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing the  
Group and what skills and expertise are needed  
in the future. They also require the Committee  
to keep under review the leadership needs of the 
organisation, both executive and non-executive, 
with a view to ensuring the continued ability of 
the organisation to compete effectively in the 
marketplace. The Committee also recommends 
to the Board the appointment of, and changes  
in, members of the Board’s main Committees.  
No director may participate in any decision regarding 
his or her own position. The Committee’s terms 
of reference are available in the ‘Corporate 
Governance’ section of ‘Investor Relations’  
on the Company’s website.
Membership, meetings and attendance
The Committee’s membership, number of meetings 
and attendance during the year are set out in the 
‘Board and Committee meetings and attendance’ 
section of the Board’s Corporate Governance 
statement. 
Activities
During the year the Committee reviewed the 
general structure, size and composition of the 
Board and concluded that the present Board 
balance and the composition of each main Board 
Committee, now increased in number by the Risk 
and Solvency Committee, remained appropriate 
but that an additional independent non-executive 
director to share the increasing Committee work 
would be appropriate during 2011. Accordingly, 
late in the year, the Committee approved an 
appropriate specification and appointed search 
consultants. The recruitment process is ongoing 
at the date of this report. 
In reviewing the make-up of the seven present 
non-executive members of the Board (including 
the Chairman), the Committee noted the balance 
illustrated opposite, which demonstrates an 
appropriate balance of insurance and other 
financial sector knowledge to enable the non-
executives collectively to perform their role of 
overseeing a complex insurance business. All but 
the Chairman have served as non-executives for 
seven or fewer years. 
The executive members of the Board also bring 
skills and experience to the Board that are 
complementary to each other. Its membership 
is kept under review and, following the year end, 
the Committee recommended the proposal to  
the Annual General Meeting of the election of  
an additional executive director, Mr Simon Beale, 
the Underwriting Director of Amlin London, as 
detailed in the notice of meeting published at the 
same time as this report. There is also regular, 
formal and direct reporting to the Board by  
other senior Group executives, most frequently 
in 2010 from Mr Beale and from the Chief Risk 
Officer (Mr Illingworth) and the Chief Investment 
Officer (Mrs Styles). 
In October the Committee concluded its 
regular review of the succession plan regarding 
senior executive roles in the Group. With a few 
exceptions, the plan continues to identify short term 
contingencies for fulfilling each role at short notice 
as well as one or more potential internal candidates 
as permanent successors. The Committee was 
satisfied that the overall plan is well conceived and 
effectively managed. The Committee paid particular 
attention to the few roles in respect of which the 
plan is less well developed. 
Non-executive director succession plans, 
including in respect of the Chairman led by the 
senior independent director, were also reviewed 
by the Committee during the year.
Board and Committee evaluation
The Committee took account of the conclusions 
of the recently concluded annual Board evaluation 
when considering the nomination of directors 
for re-election at the 2011 AGM. The Committee 
has also recently conducted its own annual self-
evaluation and concluded that it had during 2010 
fulfilled its duties effectively. The conclusions of 
the Committee evaluation were reported to the 
Board early in 2011.

Audit Committee report
Monitoring and challenge
The Audit Committee provides independent 
monitoring, guidance and challenge to 
executive management. Its aim is to ensure 
high standards of reporting, controls and 
compliance, in the belief that excellence  
in these areas enhances the effectiveness, 
and reduces the risks, of the business.
Nigel Buchanan 
Committee Chairman
Terms of reference, relationship with 
subsidiaries and independent advice
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
(the Committee) are designed to enable it to take 
an independent view of the appropriateness of 
the Group’s: accounting policies, practices and 
reporting; risk management, compliance and 
internal control processes; and internal audit 
process and effectiveness. The terms of reference 
also place responsibility on the Committee to 
consider the appointment and fees (both audit 
and non-audit) of the external auditors, who have 
unrestricted access to it. They were reviewed 
twice during the year, first in February 2010  
when the following main changes were made:
  The previous joint Committee of the Company 
and the main UK operating subsidiary, 
Amlin Underwriting Limited, was split into 
separate committees. Two of the principal 
regulated subsidiaries operate their own audit 
committees, of which the Group Finance 
Director is a member alongside non-executive 
directors of such subsidiaries (with the 
membership of the Company’s Committee 
remaining exclusively independent non-
executives of Amlin plc).
  Greater emphasis was placed in the early 
2010 changes on the Committee’s role in 
understanding and monitoring risk, including 
review of the outcomes of the ‘Own Risks and 
Solvency Assessment’ prepared by the Chief 
Risk Officer. 
  An explicit authority was added for the 
Committee to engage its own independent 
external advice at the Company’s expense 
should it deem it necessary. During 2010 no 
member of the Committee, nor the Committee 
collectively, found it necessary to obtain such 
separate advice beyond the advice that is 
directly provided to the Committee by the 
external auditors.
The terms of reference were reviewed again in 
November 2010 as a result of certain of the risk 
review duties of the Committee being taken out 
and re-allocated to the new Risk and Solvency 
Committee that was instituted on 1 January 2011.
The Committee’s new terms of reference, which 
continue to take full account of the Smith Report 
on the role of audit committees, are available in 
the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of ‘Investor 
Relations’ on the Company’s website. 
Membership, meetings and attendance
The Committee’s membership and number of 
meetings and attendance during the year are set 
out in the ‘Board and Committee membership 
and attendance’ section of the Board Corporate 
Governance statement. Both the Nomination 
Committee in making its recommendations 
to the Board, and the Committee in its own 
self-evaluation, reviews the Committee’s 
membership. All of the Committee’s members 
(Messrs Buchanan, Davey and Feinstein) have, 
in the Board’s view, recent and relevant financial 
experience. Mr Buchanan, the Committee 
Chairman, is a former senior audit partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), responsible 
before his retirement from the firm for the audits 
of several major UK based financial services 
organisations. Mr Davey’s banking career included 
service on executive management and risk 
committees as well as corporate finance advice to 
major insurance companies. He currently serves 
on the Audit Committee of a major UK Building 
Society and was also at one time Finance Director 
of an international financial group. Mr Feinstein, 
a former CEO of one of the largest property and 
casualty insurers in the USA, has over 35 years’ 
commercial experience of the insurance industry. 
This combination of audit, wider financial services 
and insurance executive experience provides, 
in the view of the Board, an appropriate group 
of experienced professionals to fulfil the duties 
of the Committee. Mr Davey (as its chairman) 
and Mr Buchanan also serve on the new Risk 
and Solvency Committee, retaining a strong link 
between the risk and audit review processes. 
The Chairman of the Company, the Group Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director usually 
attend the Committee’s meetings, as does the 
Chief Risk Officer and the Head of Internal Audit. 
The Committee received and considered detailed 
papers and information sufficiently in advance 
of its meetings for its members to consider 
them appropriately, making suggestions for 
improvements when required. At least once a 
year the Committee meets, both on its own and 
with the external auditors, without any executive 
management present. The Committee also meets 
privately with the Head of Internal Audit, who has a 
private line of communication with the Committee 
Chairman. His executive reporting line is to the 
Group Chief Executive and he is appointed, and 
may only be dismissed, by the Committee. 
Activities
The Committee’s activities may be divided into four 
interlinked areas: financial reporting and external 
audit; risk; internal control; and internal audit. 
Financial reporting and external audit
The prime financial reporting focus of the 
Committee during the year was, as ever, on 
the integrity of the Company’s interim and 
preliminary results statements and its Annual 
Report. In addition to the usual consideration of 
the appropriateness of the accounting policies 
being adopted, the Committee particularly 
concentrated on: accounting for acquisitions 
(Amlin Corporate Insurance (ACI)); the basis of 
the Group’s pension fund accounting; taxation 
provisioning; and the consistency and robustness 
of the Group’s insurance reserves. On the latter 
both the reserving process and its results were 
reviewed, including comparisons of actuarial 
estimates and actual reserves held, and, 
where necessary, challenged. The Committee 
was satisfied that the significant assumptions 
underlying the reported figures, including 
those relevant to determining fair values and 
to the recoverability of reinsurance debt, were 
justified and that there was appropriate and 
meaningful disclosure of the critical judgement 
and key estimates made, which took account 
of the volatile nature of the markets to which 
the Group is exposed. In addition, each Interim 
Management Statement of the Company was 
reviewed by the Committee.
71
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements The Committee reviewed the external auditors’  
engagement and service plans, their independence 
and the extent and reasons for them providing 
non-audit services (a breakdown of the fees for 
which is set out in note 13 to the Accounts). 
A new policy governing the types of non-audit 
services for which the external auditors may be 
appointed was adopted by the Committee in 
early 2010 and operated thereafter during the 
year. The Committee remained satisfied that the 
provision of such non-audit services by PwC has 
not compromised their independence as auditors. 
Reports were received from the external auditors 
in respect of each set of financial statements, 
highlighting the material judgemental areas, 
which were then discussed by the Committee with 
the auditors alongside reports from management.
Risk 
As referred to above when describing changes 
to the Committee’s terms of reference, the 
Committee’s involvement in reviewing the 
Group’s risk management processes deepened 
during the year with the further development 
of the Group’s risk management processes as 
set out in the Risk section of the Review in this 
Annual Report. 
The Chief Risk Officer (and occasionally other 
members of the Risk Assessment & Monitoring 
department as appropriate) attended each 
Committee meeting to report on the overall  
work of the department.
In addition to detailed quarterly reporting by 
the Chief Risk Officer to the Committee, the 
Committee held several special meetings on risk 
during the year, sometimes in conjunction with the 
Audit Committee of AUL and also often attended 
by non-executives who are not members of the 
Committee. Management made presentations 
on risk management, its governance and the 
processes for recommending risk appetite and 
for reviewing both existing and emerging risks 
for the Group, particularly linking these to the 
forthcoming requirements of Solvency II. The 
meeting also reviewed the main components of 
the Group’s Dynamic Financial Analysis model, 
which is a key component in setting Group’s 
risk management framework and the Group’s 
Individual Capital Assessment.
As referred to in the Board Corporate Governance 
Statement, responsibility at Board committee 
level for risk and solvency passed on 1 January 
2011 to a separate committee. The Audit 
Committee retains overall responsibility for 
recommending the annual control statement.
Internal control
Details of the Committee’s role regarding  
internal control issues are set out in the  
‘Board internal control statement’ ( pp.64-65)  
within the Board Corporate Governance statement. 
Internal audit
The Committee reviewed the plans and work 
undertaken during the year by the Group’s Internal 
Audit department, including reports relating to 
overseas subsidiaries, and the consequential 
actions agreed with management. Reporting to the 
Committee includes summaries of the findings of 
all internal audit reports, enabling members of the 
Committee to question the Head of Internal Audit 
on any report. The Committee closely scrutinised 
management’s progress in addressing the relevant 
issues, challenging management to move more 
quickly when it considered it appropriate. During 
the year the Committee has been mindful of the 
need to ensure that internal audit focus is aligned 
with the areas of greatest risk facing the Group. 
The Committee also monitored the Group’s 
compliance with Financial Services Authority, 
Lloyd’s and other regulatory requirements and 
recommendations, and reviewed the main 
‘whistle blowing’ procedures operated  
by the Group. 
Committee evaluation and reporting
During the year the Committee conducted its 
annual self-evaluation of its terms of reference, 
composition, procedures, contribution and 
effectiveness. The Committee concluded that 
during 2010 it had received sufficient, reliable, 
and timely information from management to 
enable it to fulfil its responsibilities and that it had 
fulfilled the duties placed upon it by its terms of 
reference. The conclusions of its evaluation were 
agreed and reported to the Board early in 2011.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 72 Corporate responsibility
Valuing our relationships
“ Amlin aims to build a sustainable business 
through the consistent application of our 
values in relationships with shareholders, 
employees, clients and other stakeholders. 
We seek to make a positive contribution to 
the communities in which we operate, placing 
integrity and professional excellence at the 
heart of our business practice.” 
Charles Philipps 
Chief Executive
Governance Corporate responsibility
Our Vision to be the “reference point for quality in 
each of our markets” is underpinned by a set of 
core values which both determine and reflect the 
way in which all employees of the Amlin Group 
engage with our stakeholders, both internal and 
external to the business. 
Marketplace
Amlin remains one of the largest participants 
in the Lloyd’s market, although the volume of 
our premium written through Lloyd’s dropped 
from 75% in 2009 to 58% in 2010. Our focus 
in 2010 was predominantly on the integration 
and development of our non-Lloyd’s European 
platform ( pp.18). 
Nonetheless, we value the opportunities presented 
through the Lloyd’s markets worldwide and 
participated in feasibility studies of potential 
new markets in Asia and South America. Amlin 
professionals continue to work with the Lloyd’s 
market associations, boards and committees  
to improve market operations, governance  
and technology. 
Summary results of the ethnographic study of 
the London and Bermuda reinsurance markets, 
commissioned by the Insurance Intellectual 
Capital Initiative, were presented at the 2010 
Monte Carlo Rendezvous in September. Amlin 
specific feedback has provided us with a useful 
operational benchmark against our peers in two 
of our most important markets. This study is  
due to be extended into the European market  
in 2011. 
Amlin Corporate Insurance is a member of the 
Dutch Insurance Association Exchange (VNAB) 
which accounted for €1,146 billion of industrial 
and commercial gross written premium in 2009. 
The insurers and brokers within VNAB operate in 
accordance with the so-called “Beursprinciples” 
and the majority of ACI’s business is written 
under this code. Executive Vice President,  
Michiel Verlivet is Chairman of the insurer 
membership and ACI underwriters play  
an active role in various technical subgroups.
Richard Hextall, Amlin’s Group Finance Director, 
has joined the UK Insurance Forum run by  
HM Treasury and charged with shaping the future 
of our industry. 
Raising industry standards
Amlin recognises the importance of raising 
professional standards in our industry if it is 
to attract and retain high calibre new talent. 
Chief Executive, Charles Philipps served on 
the Chartered Institute of Insurance Task 
Force, charged with improving standards of 
professionalism across the industry. The resulting 
Aldermanbury Declaration was signed by a large 
number of market participants. 
In 2010, Amlin became the first London market 
insurer to achieve Corporate Chartered Insurer 
status. All 420 frontline underwriting and claims 
staff from Amlin London and Amlin UK were 
included in this submission ( pp.45).
Amlin is also supporting a new risk management 
course for the financial services industry which 
was launched in January 2011 by the Institute of 
Risk Management, chaired by Amlin’s Head of 
Group Risk, Alex Hindson. 
Attracting new talent
We participated in the City of London Business 
Traineeship programme for the first time in 2010. 
The programme aims to foster links between 
the financial and business services sector and 
talented individuals from local boroughs who may 
seek a career in the City. We were impressed with 
the quality of the candidates put forward and 
will participate again in 2011. Our engagement 
was recognised as Amlin Plus General Manager, 
Simon Hepworth was awarded Project Champion 
of the Year. 
Employees
Amlin’s Vision includes being recognised as “the 
place to work”, with staff who understand our 
strategy and their role in delivering and exceeding 
our goals. An important element in achieving this 
is being a responsible employer, operating first 
class employment practices and actively engaging 
with our employees ( pp.44-45).
Our core values
Professional excellence
We are professional in all we do, continually developing our skills and expertise.
Integrity
We are fair and honest and we deliver on our commitments.
Leadership
We take clear and considered views of the future. We communicate our 
objectives and empower our team to achieve them.
Superior performance
We seek to excel in both the levels of service and the results we achieve.
Teamwork
We work together to deliver excellent performance, taking responsibility, holding 
ourselves accountable and respecting the contribution of others.  
We communicate effectively and give each other the space to do the job.
Focus on sustainability
We take a measured approach in our business strategy and in our acceptance 
and management of risk to secure the long-term viability of the business.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements The 2009 acquisition of Amlin Corporate 
Insurance increased employee numbers by over 
50% and presented us with new challenges in 
relation to European working practices, languages 
and aligning ACI’s employee offering with that  
of the remainder of the Amlin Group. 
We encourage employee engagement through 
the intranet, a regular e-zine and via a quarterly 
Consultation Forum for UK employees and a 
Works Council representing the ACI employees. 
Since the Group’s combined workforce now 
exceeds 1,000 in more than four European 
countries, we will be examining options for a 
Group-wide employee representative group. 
Amlin seeks to align employee interests further by 
awarding shares to all eligible employees under 
the Share Incentive Plan. The 2010 award means 
that those employed since the middle of 2007 
could now have a stake in the Company equity 
valued in excess of £10,000 at  
31 December 2010.
The good conduct of employees in their 
management of business relationships and with 
colleagues is critical to creating pride in the 
Company and to our aspiration to be a socially 
responsible company. Amlin’s core corporate 
values are an important part of the Code of 
Conduct (available on our website) to which  
all employees are expected to adhere.
Community
In the UK
Amlin’s UK charity and community activities 
are guided and facilitated by a panel which 
meets at least quarterly and comprises senior 
representatives from each UK business area.
In 2010, we delivered a second successful 
Community Action Learning project at Newlands 
Bishop Farm, near Solihull. The farm is run 
as a commercial enterprise and offers people 
with learning difficulties the opportunity to gain 
practical skills with which to work in the local 
community centre. This unique programme 
within the Lloyd’s market again met our 
objectives, both in terms of community benefit 
and as a management development opportunity. 
We retained Macmillan Cancer Support as the 
Group corporate charity in 2010. Following our 
2009 support of their special patient grant fund, 
we reverted in 2010 to funding a Clinical Nurse 
Specialist at Imperial College Healthcare  
NHS Trust. 
In 2010 Amlin UK staff raised over £20,000  
for Farleigh Hospice, a local adult hospice  
with centres in Chelmsford, Maldon and 
Braintree, Essex. 
Our major fundraising event in 2010 was an 
Amlin Go-Karting day for teams of brokers. This 
generated a profit of £34,000, which was split 
equally between Macmillan and Farleigh Hospice. 
Amlin sponsored Art for Youth London for a 
second year and it once again proved a highly 
successful event. The three-day sale in the  
Royal College of Art yielded a profit in excess  
of £83,000 for the charity, UK Youth, in their 
centenary year. 
In Bermuda
Philanthropy is an important part of corporate 
life in Bermuda and, despite its relatively small 
size, Amlin Bermuda plays an active role in the 
local community. With a continued focus on 
organisations involved in youth, education and 
sport, the charity committee developed multi-
year strategic partnerships with three charitable 
organisations - WindReach, YouthNet and the 
Youth Athletic Organisation - each of whom were 
allocated $20,000 in 2010.
Amlin Bermuda’s $75,000 budget for its 
scholarship programme for Bermudian students 
funded new two-year scholarships in 2010,

Senior Amlin executives support the ABICEA 
through board, committee, interview panel and

Other locations
Amlin Singapore has supported the General 
Insurance Association’s Global Internship 
Programme from the outset and is now in its 
fourth year of sponsorship. The division also 
provided speakers for the Association’s Talent 
Outreach Project.
Amlin’s three European divisions do not yet  
have formal charity and community policies,  
but are considering corporate social responsibility 
initiatives in their local markets.
Environment
2010 saw an unprecedented volume of weather 
related events which, despite not being market 
changing catastrophes, cumulatively generated  
a large volume of insured losses. Amlin evaluates 
the risks and opportunities presented by 
climate change through the Climate Change 
& Environmental Panel, which is composed of 
senior underwriters, chaired by the Chief Risk 
Officer and which meets on a quarterly basis.
The role of insurance
Amlin is a member of ClimateWise, an insurance 
industry collaboration which aims to improve 
understanding of climate change risk and 
contribute to the reduction of these risks over 
the longer term. Our comprehensive report on 
environmental activities for the year to 31 May 
2010 under the six ClimateWise principles is 
available on our website. The Lloyd’s market 
consolidated report was the highest scoring 
ClimateWise participant in 2010 according to 
PriceWaterhouseCooper’s Independent Review.
Amlin’s CEO and Chief Risk Officer are members 
of the Geneva Association and participate in their 
discussions. The objectives of the Association’s 
climate-linked research have been to identify and 
analyse issues of specific relevance to the insurance 
industry, such as the likely range of future claims 
costs, and the political, educational and social 
challenges to be addressed. 
Amlin continues to engage with the Risk 
Predication Initiative organised by the Bermuda 
Institute of Ocean Sciences, notably in research in 
forecasting extreme weather events. We propose to 
organise a symposium in 2011 to raise awareness 
of this research among our London market peers 
and align it with Lloyd’s emerging market risk 
research. We have also requested that RPI broaden 
their research to include European windstorm 
which will complement other work in this area by 
the modelling agencies and large reinsurers. 
Our carbon footprint
We measure our annual carbon footprint including 
data from all Group companies over which financial 
control was exercised and for whom financial 
results were published in that year. 
We include employee commuting (determined by 
an online survey which yielded an 81% response 
in 2010), waste/recycling and water usage to give 
a full picture of our corporate impact. Amlin’s 
footprint was 5.64 tonnes per employee inclusive 
of these factors (or 4.57 tonnes if compared with 
the scope of most FTSE calculations). The average 
CO
2
 range for a UK financial services company is 
between 5.0 and 5.5 tonnes per employee. 
Business air travel is a major contributor to our 
carbon emissions impact and, following extensive 
testing, we are installing video conferencing 
systems in our major office locations during 
2011. We therefore anticipate reduced 
requirement for business travel between these 
locations in 2012.
Our recycling achievement was again recognised 
with a tenth successive Gold Award from the 
City of London Authority under their Clean City 
Awards Scheme 2010.
Reporting
Deloitte LLP carried out limited assurance in 
accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3000 on both the 2008 
and 2009 Carbon Footprint. The independent 
assurance statement, together with the basis of 
reporting and results summary, is published on 
our website. 
We were placed in the top three of all FTSE 
companies for the assurance of carbon emissions 
in a 2010 report undertaken by Carbon Smart in 
conjunction with an independent advisory panel, 
institutional investors and accountancy firms.
Amlin also ranked as the leading UK organisation 
for the transparent reporting of carbon emissions 
and carbon intensity by the Environmental 
Investment Organisation. This is the first of a 
series of global and regional rankings that are 
intended to be the basis for a new Environmental 
Tracking Carbon Index Series designed to impact 
share price.
Corporate responsibility continued
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 74 Governance Corporate responsibility
Investor relations 
Amlin continues to enjoy the support both 
of a strong institutional investor base and of 
private investors. Analyst coverage also remains 
extensive with some 18 equity analysts and 
several credit analysts following Amlin’s progress. 
A key objective of Amlin’s investor relations 
is to be open, transparent and accessible in 
communications about our business and its 
performance, so that Amlin’s business model and 
investment proposition are well understood by the 
investment community and investors and other 
stakeholders can make informed judgements 
about the Company. As part of our investor 
relations strategy, we seek to identify and engage 
with suitable prospective long term institutional 
investors to broaden Amlin’s investor base, as 
well as maintaining positive dialogue with our 
existing investors and taking account of their views 
and concerns. 
An important part of this strategy was the 
programme of contact with institutional investors 
through formal road-shows and individual meetings 
undertaken by the Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and Head of Investor Relations during the year . 
Amlin’s expansion into the Continental European 
market through ACI, Amlin France and the start-up 
of Amlin Re Europe has raised Amlin’s profile 
among European investors. We continued to take 
advantage of this interest through meetings with 
target investors in Paris, Frankfurt and Scandinavia, 
as well as presenting Amlin’s investment case at 
selected investor seminars. Amlin also attracted 
increased attention from investors focusing on 
value relative to long term performance, particularly 
in North America. The proportion of shares held 
by both European and North American institutions 
increased during 2010.
Financial Dynamics continued to assist with 
Amlin’s Investor Relations strategy. Among 
other services, Financial Dynamics supports 
the feedback we receive from regular informal 
dialogue with analysts by providing detailed 
analysts’ feedback based on formal ‘no 
names’ interviews before and after results 
announcements on the issues analysts perceive 
as relevant to Amlin, as well as broader 
commentary on market sentiment and trends. 
These reports are used to inform Amlin’s 
communications with the stock market and 
ensure that relevant issues and concerns raised 
by analysts are addressed. We also actively 
seek feedback from institutional investors both 
informally on a direct basis and through formal 
reviews conducted by Financial Dynamics and 
RBS Hoare Govett, Amlin’s stockbroker. 
The Preliminary and Interim results presentations 
for analysts are web cast so that all investors 
can access them simultaneously and slide 
presentations are also made available on Amlin’s 
website. As part of maintaining a productive 
dialogue with analysts and the wider investment 
community we also hosted a presentation on 
ACI and a reception for analysts and investors 
attended by senior Amlin managers and 
underwriters. 
Shareholder profile
A substantial proportion of Amlin’s shares is held 
by supportive long term institutional investors. As 
shown in the chart below, the proportion owned 
by US institutions at the end of 2010 was 16.8%, 
compared to about 18% for the UK market as a 
whole and around 14% for the UK non-life insurer 
peer group. The proportion held by Continental 
European insurers was 6.1%, compared to about 
8% for the UK market as a whole. 
At the year end an estimated 1.6% of the 
Company was owned by directors and staff, 
including shares held on their behalf by trustees 
of the Employee Share Ownership Trust and 
the Share Incentive Plan (SIP). An estimated 9% 
(2009: 15%, excluding the newly acquired ACI) 
of Group employees were shareholders and 76% 
(2009: 84%) held shares through the SIP at the 
year end. Excluding the SIP , 40% (2009: 41%) of 
staff had outstanding options or conditional share 
awards under one or more of the Company’s 
share plans. 
Sector profile
The two principal stock market indices of which 
Amlin shares were a constituent over the last 
five years are the FTSE 350 index and the FTSE 
All Share Non-Life Insurance index. The total 
shareholder return generated by Amlin has 
outperformed both these indices in the past  
five years. 
At the year end Amlin was ranked 124 in the 
FTSE 350 index by market capitalisation (2009: 
116). The average volume of shares traded daily 
on the London Stock Exchange was 1.2 million 
shares per day, equivalent to approximately 
0.25% per day, compared with a daily average of 
2.1 million or 0.42% in 2009.
Reporting
We aim to continually improve the quality and 
transparency of our corporate reporting. In 2010 
we received the ICSA Hermes Transparency in 
Governance awards for Best FTSE 250 report and 
Best Audit Disclosure in the FTSE 250.

Overview
Executive remuneration structure in 2010
The structure of the various elements of senior 
executive remuneration is summarised in the 
chart below. Senior executives participate in  
a Long Term Incentive Plan measured over a 
three year performance period (the L TIP) and 
through one of two other long term plans with  
the potential to earn significant rewards by 
reference to five year performance periods, 
thereby incentivising the longer term sustainability 
of the business (the Capital Builder Plan for 
underwriters and the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) for non-underwriters).
The splits of annual remuneration (i.e. excluding 
long term incentive plan payments) of each 
current executive director in 2009 and 2010 are 
summarised in the chart on the opposite page. 
The splits between fixed and annual performance 
payments show that a significant proportion of 
directors’ remuneration in respect of both years 
was performance related and that the annual 
performance rewards represented a lower 
percentage of total remuneration for all directors 
in 2010 than in 2009. In the case of the non-
underwriting directors this was in response  
to lower financial returns against the targets  
set for bonus purposes and, in the case of the  
underwriter who is a director, in response to 
lower absolute levels of underwriting profitability 
in the relevant underwriting years compared 
with a year earlier. The splits between the 
categories of reward, together with the longer 
term performance rewards described later in 
this report, reflect the Committee’s objective of 
aligning management and shareholders’ interests.
Further details of each element of the above 
components of 2010 remuneration are set out in 
later sections of this report.
External background
2010 continued the increased public and regulatory 
focus on senior executive and financial services 
remuneration set off by the 2008 banking crisis. 
During the year the Committee continued to 
monitor and consider the actual and potential 
implications for Amlin of external developments, 
including those initiated by the European Union, 
the Financial Services Authority and, through 
the new UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Financial Reporting Council. The Committee’s 
approach, as well as complying with the principles, 
Codes and regulations that apply to Amlin, 
continues to be to consider the rationale and 
analysis behind other proposals, that may not 
strictly apply to Amlin, on their merits and to 
consider voluntary application when appropriate. 
Committee review activities in 2010
In parallel with considerations spurred by external 
developments, the Committee has continued to 
review a number of aspects of the Company’s 
remuneration structures, policies and practices, 
seeking to ensure that they continue to support 
the strategic objectives of the Company and that 
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 76  
To secure the maximum possible alignment between the interests and long 
term career development of executive directors and other senior employees 
with the ambitions of the Group and the creation of value for shareholders.
 
To have first class employment practices, contributing to Amlin being “the place 
to work” for high quality people in its sector. This requires levels and structures 
of remuneration that are appropriate to attract, retain, incentivise and reward 
the high calibre talent that is required for the success of the Group.
 
To reward management focus both on immediate financial measures, such as 
return on equity and underwriting returns, and on longer term objectives such as 
underwriting cycle management and the long term sustainability of the business.
stated remuneration objectives are being delivered. 
The only significant change in remuneration 
arrangements since those described a year ago 
is the Committee’s recently agreed changes to 
the basis of the underwriters’ annual incentive 
arrangement (the Profit Commission scheme). 
These changes, which have commenced from 
the 2011 underwriting year, recognise that 
Amlin’s traditional basis of rewarding Lloyd’s 
underwriters needs to adapt both in response 
to the changing structure of the Group and to 
the views of shareholders. For the first time all 
Profit Commission payments will be subject to an 
annual monetary cap expressed as a percentage 
of salary and parts of the overall reward will be 
based on Group return on equity targets and on 
meeting personal objectives, rather than the whole 
reward being determined merely as a percentage of 
relevant underwriting profits. Whilst the previous 
helpful features of PC, such as an extended 
payment period based on three year accounting, 
are being retained, the Committee believes that 
these reforms will create a better balanced overall 
reward structure for underwriters and increase 
the alignment of their interests with those of 
shareholders. Further details of the changes  
are set out in the description of the PC scheme 
later in this report ( pp.79).
Towards the end of the year the Committee also 
conducted its first specific remuneration risk 
review, which identified a few desirable minor 
changes in procedure but otherwise confirmed 
the Committee’s view that the risks from the 
Company’s remuneration arrangements are 
acceptable and subject to appropriate controls.
Remuneration policies
Overall remuneration levels
During the year the Committee re-affirmed the 
Group Remuneration Policy, comprising guiding 
principles and policies applicable to the Group as 
a whole, which was discussed and agreed by the 
Board. The key policy, that base salaries across 
all categories of staff will be determined by job 
size, market rate and personal performance (with 
the market rate having regard to the median for 
the appropriate market) and that variable pay 
will be designed so that top quartile performance 
will be rewarded with top quartile remuneration, 
was re-affirmed. This and the other principles and 
policies adopted are reflected in this report. 
In determining individuals’ remuneration, the 
Group takes account of remuneration statistics 
for the non-life insurance sector in which the 
Group operates and, where applicable for certain 
roles, wider remuneration statistics. This policy of 
aiming to encourage and reward superior rather 
than merely average performance is considered 
the most appropriate to support the success of 
the Group. Salaries are generally reviewed as at  
1 April each year. 
In the UK remuneration for underwriters and 
those performing other technical insurance-
related roles is strongly influenced by the 
Lloyd’s sector in which most of the Group’s 
UK employees operate. Lloyd’s underwriting 
businesses tend to relate a significant proportion 
of the potential rewards of underwriters to the 
absolute profitability of the relevant underwriting 
unit, often on an uncapped basis. Similar 
remuneration structures and policies have applied 
for staff in Amlin Bermuda. As noted above, from 
the 2011 underwriting year Amlin’s PC scheme 
has been reformed.
The remuneration policies applied in the Group’s 
businesses in the Netherlands, Belgium and France 
(ACI and Amlin France), acquired by the Group in 
2008 and 2009, have been integrated with those 
of the Group on the basis of an appropriate balance 
between local and existing Amlin practices. In all 
spheres of operation, the Committee aims to keep 
the market practices of its competitors for staff 
under review and believes that, as market and 
Amlin’s own practices evolve, it is always important 
to ensure that remuneration structures support the 
Group’s competitive advantage. 
Structure of directors’ and employees’ 
remuneration
The remuneration of all executive directors 
consists of three principal elements: (1) base 
salary, benefits and pension contributions; (2) 
shorter term performance rewards (on an annual 
or underwriting year basis); and (3) longer term 
performance rewards (measured over three or five 
year performance periods). This is also the case 
for other senior executives throughout the Group 
although the balance between the three elements 
varies according to seniority and location.
Excluding all long term incentive plans, in 
2010 an estimated average of 51% of the three 
executive directors’ remuneration received 
was performance related (2009: 62%), with a 
markedly higher proportion for the director who 
is an underwriter (54% compared with 79% in 
2009) than for the two non-underwriters (49% 
compared with 54% in 2009). Details of the long 
term incentive plan participations are set out 
below. Underwriters and other senior executives 
below main Board level are also eligible to receive 
significant proportions of their total remuneration 
as performance related benefits.

Governance Directors’ remuneration report 77
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Following the review of senior non-underwriters’ 
remuneration reported in last year’s report, the 
Committee believes that the overall balance 
between fixed and performance rewards is 
appropriate and no further changes were  
made in this respect in 2010.
Non performance-related rewards: benefits
Non performance-related benefits to which 
executive directors and other employees are 
generally entitled are private health insurance, 
cover for death in service and permanent 
disability and a choice of other benefits, such 
as subsidised gym membership, private dental 
costs, etc. Senior staff, including executive 
directors, also receive a car allowance. 
Non performance-related rewards: employer 
pension contributions
The Company pays a percentage of base salary 
into either a Group occupational or stakeholder 
Shareholding targets
An objective was set when the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (L TIP) was introduced in 
2006 that executive directors would retain 
or build up shareholdings in the Company 
to the value of at least 125% of their base 
salaries and other senior executives to the 
value of at least 50%. The shareholdings 
of all the executive directors were above 
the target throughout 2010, mostly by a 
substantial margin. Of the other senior 
executives covered by the policy (the 
Group Management Committee), all those 
who have been with the Group since 2006 
have met their shareholding targets and 
the rest are expected to do so as incentive 
plans vest. The targets were reviewed 
by the Board during the year and re-
affirmed as remaining appropriate. The 
Committee believes that the combination 
of these shareholdings and the structure 
of performance incentives continue to 
ensure that the interests of management 
and shareholders in the success of the 
Company are closely aligned.
pension plan. Executive directors serving during 
the year participate in the relevant Group 
pension plans on the same basis as other senior 
employees. Pensionable salary is base salary only. 
The Group has both defined contribution (DC) 
and defined benefit (DB) schemes. At the year 
end, 415 out of the Group’s total employees of 
1,330 were accruing any element of DB pension. 
These included 66 out of 844 staff in the UK and 
Bermuda (2009: 66 out of 790) and 349 out of 
382 at ACI. DB participants included one of the 
three executive directors (2009: one). 
In respect of DC pensions, the Group contributes 
a percentage of base salary depending on 
seniority, age and the percentage of salary  
(if any) that the employee chooses to contribute. 
The maximum total DC employer contribution 
made for any director in 2010, for a director 
with only DC contributions and aged over 50, 
was 20.9% of base salary (2009: 20.5%). In 
January 2011 a salary sacrifice option was 
introduced for UK employees in respect of 
employee DC pension contributions, with the 
consequential employer NIC saving being shared 
equally between the Group and an additional 
payment into the employee’s DC pension. From 
April 2011, those Directors and other UK staff 
who would otherwise exceed the new lowered 
£50,000 UK annual pension tax relief allowance 
will be given the option to convert the excess into 
a non-pensionable taxable allowance.
The Group’s DB schemes for UK and, when 
applicable, UK-originated staff working overseas 
have been closed to new entrants since 1998 
and the scheme for ACI Belgian employees since 
September 2010. The ACI Netherlands DB scheme 
remains open for qualifying new employees. 
Remaining active DB members of the UK scheme 
continue accruing additional years’ service under 
the schemes but generally only based on 2006 
pensionable salaries, with salary increases from 
April 2006 onwards being pensioned through 
DC arrangements. Further details of the Group’s 
commitments in respect of DB pensions are  
set out in note 28 to the Accounts.
The DB employee contribution rate in the 
UK is 5% of DB pensionable salary (6% in the 
Netherlands and nil in Belgium). DB employer 
contribution rates vary according to actuarial 
advice in order to deliver the promised levels  
of pension. The employer contribution rate  
for the main UK scheme is currently 19%. 
The present normal retirement age for UK staff 
is 65. Non-UK retirement and pension ages vary 
according to local law and practice.
Shorter term performance rewards: annual 
bonus scheme for non-underwriting directors and 
employees (Group Bonus Scheme)
For those executive directors and other employees 
who are not directly involved in underwriting 
or claims settlement, the Group’s shorter term 
performance incentive is a cash bonus scheme 
(the Group Bonus Scheme for all other than 
Continental European staff, who have separate but 
broadly similar arrangements with those operated 
by ACI having been reviewed by the Committee 
during the year). The senior sections of the Group 
Bonus Scheme reward and incentivise participants 
against a mixture of business performance, 
measured by reference to the Group’s return on 
equity (ROE) compared with target returns set 
by the Committee at the beginning of each year, 
and the individual’s performance against agreed 
stretching personal objectives. The mix of business 
and individual bonus elements varies by seniority, 
with 70% of the potential target reward at the most 
senior role levels, including participating executive 
directors, being rewarded on Group business 
performance and 30% on personal performance. 
The total ‘on-target’ and maximum bonus levels 
also increase with seniority. 
In respect of 2009, 50% of base salary was 
payable to executive directors for ‘on-target’ 
performance, rising to a potential maximum 
payment of 120% of base salary. In 2009 the 
Committee reviewed the level of the potential 
maximum payment and concluded that the 
Committee’s policy of “top quartile remuneration 
for top quartile performance” was not being 
fulfilled. From 2010 the executive directors’ 
scale was therefore changed for 2010 to 75% 
for ‘on-target’ performance, rising to a potential 
maximum of 165% of base salary if both the 
Group business and personal performance 
elements were to reach their maxima. Similarly 
proportional increases were made to the scales 
applying below director level. The same scales 
apply for 2011. 
For directors and those at other senior 
management levels, any element of payment of 
annual bonus in respect of 2010 and subsequent 
years that is above the base salary maximum 
percentage for the relevant management level for 
2009 (for example, 120% for executive directors) 
will be deferred for three years from the usual 
date of payment. Total or partial claw-back of 
such deferred cash bonus will also apply in 
the event either of the Committee finding that 
a participant has not complied with internal 
standards or controls or has caused reputational 
damage to the Company, or of any results or 
accounts on which the bonus was based proving 
to be incorrect or requiring to be re-stated. 
Provisions also apply whereby a leaver during the 
three year deferral period will forfeit the deferred 
bonus unless they leave for one of a number 
of specified “good leaver” reasons, including 
circumstances agreed by the Committee to  
be exceptional. In view of the material potential 
long term share-based incentive component in 
all senior executive remuneration, the Committee 
believes that this degree of deferment and potential 
clawback of annual cash bonus payments 
provides an appropriate overall balance between 
immediate and deferred performance related 
pay, and between payment in cash and in shares.

Applying core values
The Remuneration Committee, comprising 
wholly independent non-executive 
directors, seeks to perform its role 
consistently with Amlin’s stated core 
values, which include:
  Integrity (independence, objectivity);
  Professional excellence (proper process 
and governance, on the basis of full 
information and professional advice); and
  Leadership (being aware of market 
trends, but shaping Amlin’s policies  
to its own specific needs).
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 78 Shorter term performance rewards: profit share 
for underwriting directors and employees (Profit 
Commission (PC) Scheme)
Shorter term incentives for underwriters 
(whether or not they are executive directors of 
Amlin plc) in the UK and Bermuda businesses, 
and for certain other underwriting division staff, 
have consisted until the 2010 underwriting 
year principally of a cash profit share relating 
to underwriting profits in respect of each 
underwriting year (known as profit  
commission or PC). 
For 2010 and prior years PC is paid on an 
underwriting year basis, usually partly related 
to the part of the business in which the relevant 
participant works and partly to wider Syndicate 
2001 and Amlin Bermuda underwriting 
performance. Rewards are also divided between 
those which are purely calculated as a percentage 
of underwriting profit and, for a few senior 
underwriters, those which are also related to 
underwriting performance relative to external peers 
and/or other objectives. The maximum percentage 
of each business unit’s underwriting profit which 
may be paid out under the 2010 and earlier years’ 
scheme in respect of each underwriting year is 
4.5% unless the business unit has achieved a 
superior result to its market peers in which case the 
highest maximum applying to any division is 4.83%. 
Around 3% of each underwriting year’s profit of 
Amlin Bermuda is also made available to a parallel 
scheme for those contributing to that subsidiary’s 
results, with further discretionary payments 
intended to be managed so that up to around  
4.5% of its underwriting profit over the long term is 
paid out under the scheme. 
Significant structural changes have been made 
to the scheme for the 2011 and subsequent 
underwriting years, as follows:
  Participation will be restricted to underwriters 
with underwriting authority, with other 
underwriting division staff moved onto the 
Group Bonus Scheme (GBS); 
  The scheme will now consist of two elements, 
both the previous underwriting profit basis 
(PC element) and an element of GAAP based 
performance award similar to the GBS. 
The latter is split 50:50 between a Group 
ROE-based award and an award based on 
performance against personal objectives;
  Profit pools have been rationalised so they 
more closely align to the present divisional 
structure of the business rather than by 
reference to historic structures; and
  All payments will be capped as a percentage 
of annual salary, based on job role. These 
caps have been set at sufficiently high levels 
not to harm the competitiveness of Amlin’s 
position in the market, recognising that an 
incentive structure for underwriters with a 
high potential proportion of variable pay is 
critical to the continuing success of the Group.
In addition, provisions have been introduced so 
that a loss in one year will be offset against profits 
in another. 
The new arrangements involve an allocation 
of 4% of relevant underwriting profit to the PC 
element, compared with up to 4.83% previously. 
The performance award element has been 
modelled to cost an estimated further 1% 
of profit over an underwriting cycle, making 
estimated total potential rewards of 5% of 
relevant underwriting profit overall.
For all underwriting years, rewards will continue 
to crystallise at the end of 36 months from 
the start of an underwriting year with, at the 
Committee’s discretion (which it has exercised 
in recent years), the possibility of payments on 
account of up to 30% of the forecast reward a 
year earlier. In this way, despite it being an annual 
scheme, rewards are based on an assessment of 
liabilities, and hence underwriting profits, struck 
between two and three years after business is 
written, by which time the uncertainty over the 
level of those liabilities has materially reduced. 
Longer term performance rewards: long term 
incentive plan for non-underwriting directors and 
other senior management (Performance Share Plan)
The Amlin Performance Share Plan 2004 (PSP) 
is intended to aid the recruitment, retention, 
motivation and reward of a small number of 
key senior executives who are not underwriters, 
including relevant executive directors. Awards 
have been made each year since 2004. During 
the year awards were made to a total of 24 
participants (2009: 22) over an aggregate of 
661,558 shares (2009: 435,181), including both 
nil cost share options (over shares to be provided 
by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(‘ESOT’) for UK and Bermuda based participants) 
and conditional awards to be met by shares in 
treasury (for those based in Continental Europe).
The Committee intends to continue making 
similar discretionary annual awards, although 
the criteria for inclusion may vary. The rules of 
the PSP provide that no individual may receive 
an annual award over shares valued on grant 
at more than 100% of base salary. In 2010 
the maximum such value was awarded to two 
Directors of the Company eligible for the Plan, 
the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. 
Once the vesting level is determined after five 
years in accordance with the performance 
condition (see box above), and provided the 
relevant participant is still employed by the 
Group, an award can be exercised within the 
following 30 months. In certain restricted or 
exceptional circumstances, including redundancy 
and early retirement with the agreement of 
the Committee, an early leaver may be able 
to exercise early on a pro rata basis (subject 
to a performance condition measurement 
over the shorter period to the leaving date). 
The Committee can make adjustments to take 
PSP performance condition
The extent to which PSP awards vest 
depends on a sliding scale of the Group’s 
average annual post tax return on net 
tangible assets (Return on NTA) over the 
ensuing five years. The Committee believes 
that such a Return on NTA measure most 
appropriately aligns participants’ and 
shareholders’ interests. This absolute 
performance measure balances the 
relative measures of the Group’s Long 
Term Incentive Plan. The average return  
is calculated after five years, with no 
re-testing. The targets and scales may  
vary with each grant at the discretion  
of the Committee but the scale for all  
of the grants to date has been as follows:
Average Return on  
NTA per annum

account of variations in capital and similar 
matters. In the event of the Company being 
subject to a takeover or similar event before the 
normal vesting date, vesting will take place early 
to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that 
the performance condition has been satisfied up 
to that date, with the proportion of the award 
which vests also depending on the time that has 
elapsed since the award was made.
Longer term performance rewards: long term 
incentive plan for underwriting directors and 
other senior underwriters (the Capital Builder 
Plan or Plan)
The Amlin Capital Builder Plan 2006 is designed 
to reward senior underwriters if they exceed 
long term target underwriting returns over 
rolling five year performance periods. The 
Committee believes that the Capital Builder 
Plan is a significant retention and recruitment 
tool for those underwriters who are likely to 
be most significant in determining the Group’s 
underwriting profitability and development over 
each performance period. Awards have been 
made under the Plan to between 50 and 60 
participants from Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
Amlin Bermuda in 2006 to 2010 inclusive and are 
intended to be made on a similar basis in 2011. 
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements
79 a market value on grant in excess of 100% of 
annual base salary (or, exceptionally, 200% for 
a senior new recruit). In 2010 the maximum 
such value awarded was 100% of base salary 
to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. 
Once the vesting level is determined after three 
years, and provided the relevant participant 
is still employed by the Group, awards are 
exercisable within the following 30 months. The 
L TIP’s provisions are similar to those of the PSP , 
as referred to above, on such matters as early 
leavers and variations in capital. 
Longer term performance rewards: executive 
share options (Executive Option Schemes)
Executive share options were granted at the 
discretion of the Committee under the Approved 
and Unapproved Amlin Executive Share Option 
Schemes each year from 1997 to 2006 to 
executive directors and other staff (whether 
underwriters or not) above a certain level of 
seniority. Grants were subject to performance 
conditions which are summarised in respect of 
directors’ outstanding options in the notes to the 
table ‘Directors’ PSP , L TIP and share options held’ 
later in this report. No further grants can be made. 
All-employee share plans
The Company offers HM Revenue and Customs 
approved Sharesave options, the current plan 
having been adopted in 2008 with a ten year 
life for new grants. An annual offer was made 
in September 2010. Sharesave offers are made 
under the plan to staff in all jurisdictions where 
local tax and regulation makes this practicable 
without amending the plan, which does not 
include Continental Europe. Sharesave offers are 
open to all applicable employees who have been 
employed for more than a specified number of 
months at each grant. Exercises are not subject 
to any performance condition. The Committee 
considers that the plans are successful in 
encouraging staff at all levels to build up interests, 
and subsequently shareholdings, in the Company 
at an acceptable accounting and administrative 
cost to the Company.
Since 2007 the Company has also operated 
an HM Revenue and Customs approved all 
employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) allowing 
offers of shares at no cost to employees. Such 
free shares are offered or allocated to all Group 
staff meeting an employment qualification period 
of around nine months, if necessary in some 
jurisdictions by adopting similar local plans. The 
Committee has a policy of making an award of 
free shares each year, on an equal basis to all 
eligible executive directors and staff (subject 
to a pro rata adjustment, where permitted, for 
part time employees), subject to the annual 
results. The quantum, between nil and the annual 
maximum level of £3,000 worth of shares per 
employee, is decided in the light of the return  
on equity achieved in the previous year. In March 
2010, the level was £3,000 (2009: £1,000) with a 
take-up of 98% of eligible employees (2009: 98%). 
Reflecting 2010’s lower return on equity than in 
2009, the Committee has decided to make an 
offer of £1,000 worth of Free Shares in March 
2011. The SIP also allows offers of Partnership 
Shares whereby employees may buy shares  
on a tax deductible basis but it is not intended 
generally to make such offers and no such offer 
was made in 2010. 
Policy on service agreements and their termination
The Group does not offer service agreements with 
notice periods in excess of six months, except in 
the case of executive directors of the Company 
and the most senior level of management for 
whom up to a 12 month notice period may apply. 
The Company is mindful of the need to balance 
the potential contractual advantages of longer 
notice periods against the potential cost in the 
event of termination at the Group’s initiative.
In cases of early termination by the Group, the 
Group observes the guidance on best practice 
issued in December 2002 by the Association 
of British Insurers and the National Association 
of Pension Funds. In such circumstances, the 
Group seeks to reduce, where practicable, the 
compensation payable by taking account of the 
duty of the employee to mitigate his or her loss. 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
L TIP performance condition
The L TIP’s primary performance condition 
is a relative Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) measure, providing a balance to the 
absolute performance measures used in 
the Capital Builder Plans for underwriters 
and the PSP for non-underwriters. 
The precise performance conditions are 
set by the Committee at each award. For 
all the awards made to date the extent 
to which awards vest depends on the 
Company’s TSR over the ensuing three 
years relative to an unweighted index of 
TSRs for a comparator group of insurers, 
on the following scale: 
The Company’s TSR compared
with the comparator group index Vesting percentage
Below index Nil
Equal to the index 25%
Between index and 
index plus 25% on a 
straight line basis 25% to 100%
Index plus 25% 100%
The constituents of the index for the 
2010 awards were: Beazley Group, 
Brit Insurance, Catlin Group, Chaucer 
Holdings, Hiscox, Lancashire Holdings 
and Novae Group. Irrespective of relative 
TSR, no award will vest unless the 
Committee is satisfied that the Company’s 
financial performance over the 
performance period has been satisfactory. 
The performance period is always a single 
three year period with no provision for  
re-testing the performance conditions.
Capital builder performance 
condition
The basis of the Plan is that participants 
benefit to the extent that demanding 
underwriting return targets, for the class 
or classes of business that they write or 
oversee, are exceeded over a five year 
performance period. The targets are set 
at levels consistent with the Company 
achieving an overall average return on 
equity of at least 15% per annum over 
the insurance cycle. Excess returns 
are defined as those resulting from 
the achievement of underwriting loss 
ratios (i.e. the level of claims, net of 
reinsurance recoveries, as a percentage 
of premiums) below (i.e. better than) 
demanding target claims ratios set for 
each class that the participant writes 
or oversees. The maximum permitted 
excess profit percentage that may be paid 
out to Plan participants is 10% (i.e. 2% 
in respect of each overlapping five year 
performance period), although in most 
business classes this is lower. Variations 
in each class’s target claims ratio and 
excess profit percentage depend on the 
Committee’s assessment of the risk, 
historic experience and long term market 
prospects of the class. 
Payments under the Plan may be made at the 
Company’s discretion in either cash or shares 
and have a cap of £1 million on the total amount 
that may be paid to a participant in respect 
of each rolling five year performance period. 
Payments will be made over the two years after 
the end of each performance period. Hence the 
first payment under the current Plan, in respect 
of the performance period 2006 to 2010, will 
shortly be payable in 2011 based on results to 
the end of 2010. This payment will be of up to 
70% of each pool allocated, with the balance of 
each award being paid a year later. 
Longer term performance rewards: the Amlin 
Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 (the L TIP)
The L TIP replaced grants of executive share options 
from 2007 onwards. Both senior underwriters 
and senior non-underwriters, including executive 
directors, participate in the L TIP . Awards were  
made in 2010 to 86 participants in all parts of  
the Group (2009: 61), over a total of 1,274,498 
shares (2009: 747,533). 
The basis of the performance condition is  
set out in the ‘L TIP performance condition’ 
box above. As with the PSP , awards are either 
made in the form of nil cost share options to 
be satisfied by shares held in the ESOT or, to 
participants in Continental Europe, as conditional 
awards of shares to be provided from treasury. 
Awards may be made each year at the discretion 
of the Committee, based on seniority and with 
no individual receiving awards over shares having

In particular, consideration is given to structuring 
a proportion of termination payments on a phased 
payment basis pending the executive finding new 
employment. The need to take a robust view in 
settling cases involving poor performance is  
also recognised.
Details of each executive director’s service contract 
applicable during the year are set out in the 
section entitled ‘Executive directors’ service 
contracts’ below.
Policy on outside appointments
The Group’s policy is to allow executive directors 
and other appropriate senior employees to  
accept one substantive non-Amlin related  
outside non-executive appointment, subject  
to permission being obtained in each case  
and to acceptable procedures for managing any 
potential conflicts of interest. Such appointments 
are in the public interest and can often provide 
useful experience for the executive concerned. 
Suitable outside appointments, including limited 
term secondments, relating to Amlin’s business, 
such as market bodies, are encouraged on the 
additional ground that such appointments are 
often directly in the Group’s interest. Fees from 
outside appointments related to Amlin’s business 
are generally payable to the Group rather than 
retained by the employee concerned. In other 
cases, the Committee has a policy that the first

Executive directors’ service contracts
The dates of the service or employment contracts 
of each director who served as an executive 
during the year, all of which are with the 
Company’s subsidiary, Amlin Corporate Services 
Limited, are as stated below. Salaries have been 
periodically reviewed since the original contract 
dates, with the current annual base salaries as at 
the date of this report being as stated below.

R A Hextall 26 November 1999  £400,000 
C E L Philipps 20 February 1997 £548,000
All of the contracts, as amended where 
applicable, remain in force at the date of this 
report and are on a full time basis, provide for 
12 months’ notice of termination on either side 
and automatically terminate on the director’s 
contractual retirement date. There are no special 
provisions for compensation on termination 
in any director’s contract other than that the 
employer has the right to pay salary in lieu of  
any required period of notice. Executive directors’ 
service or employment contracts, including 
amendments, are available for inspection  
at the Company’s registered office. 
Remuneration received
The remuneration received in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2010 by each of the 
directors in respect of their periods of service as 
directors, excluding pension contributions and 
long term incentive plan payments, is shown in 
the above table. In addition, Mr Hextall received 
and retained a non-executive director’s fee of 
£24,000 from the City of London Investment 
Trust PLC (2009: £23,000). Where applicable, 
the amounts shown as paid to non-executive 
directors include fees paid by or on behalf of the 
Company’s subsidiaries. The total base salaries 
received in 2010 by Messrs Carpenter, Hextall 
and Philipps increased by 3.1%, 11.2% and 3.0% 
respectively over 2009. The level of Mr Hextall’s 
year-on-year increase largely reflects a special 
10% salary increase from October 2009 awarded, 
as explained in this report last year, as it had 
become clear to the Committee that, in the  
light of his experience and performance in the 
role, his previous salary was not competitive.
The annual bonuses and/or profit commission 
amounts shown are those paid or payable in 
respect of the year. Messrs Hextall and Philipps 
received performance bonuses under the Group 
Bonus Scheme, in respect of which they had 
the business performance ROE targets and 
percentage payments set out on the next page:
Advice to the Committee 
The Committee is assisted by the Group’s 
HR Director (Mr Farrow) and by advice 
and recommendations from the Chief 
Executive (Mr Philipps). The Chairman of 
the Company (Mr Taylor) is also invited to 
attend meetings for most agenda items. 
The Company Secretary (Mr Pender) acts 
as secretary to the Committee and advises 
it on governance and related matters.
The Committee’s independent 
remuneration adviser is Hewitt New 
Bridge Street (HNBS), which advises it 
on the structuring and utilisation of the 
Group’s performance related incentives 
and on remuneration policy generally. 
The Committee has reviewed HNBS’s 
performance during the year and in 
January 2011 re-appointed it to continue 
as the Committee’s independent adviser. 
On occasion HNBS also advises HR on 
remuneration matters which may not be 
within the direct purview of the Committee 
and advises the Board as a whole on 
the remuneration of the non-executive 
directors. The HNBS business operates 
independently within the Aon Corporation 
group of companies, which also has certain 
trading relationships with the Company’s 
subsidiaries. A statement regarding the 
Company’s relationship with HNBS is

As previously reported, the Committee agreed in 2008 that Mr Holt would be treated as a “good leaver” as a result of his early retirement from executive 
office on 31 December 2008. He received no compensation for loss of office but, in consideration for Mr Holt agreeing not to take up any position with 
a competitor, he is permitted to receive his PC entitlements in respect of the years of account up to and including 2008 as they fall due for payment. The 
payments falling due as at 31 December 2010 are included above. Other than any final performance uplift payment in respect of the 2008 year of account, 
these will be his final PC payments. He will also receive any payments due to him under the Capital Builder Plan, apportioned for the relevant periods up to 
his retirement from executive office, as they fall due. Other than in accordance with these arrangements, no payments were made during the year in respect 
of any director leaving the Board or ceasing to be employed as an executive by the Group, and nor were any such arrangements agreed.

Executive directors’ pensions 
Pension details, as applicable for each executive 
and former executive director who served as a 
Director during the year (non-executives not being 
eligible), are shown in the table on the previous 
page. The total DC employer contributions for 
the directors were £194,269 (2009: £184,936). 
Mr Holt’s total accrued DB pension as at the year 
end is shown on the basis of him drawing his 
pension from his normal retirement age. Since 
the year end but before the date of this report he 
has exercised his right to draw his pension early, 
subject to an actuarial adjustment. He accrued no 
pension during the year and the only changes to 
his DB pension during the year were as a result 
of inflation and market changes affecting transfer 
values. The decrease during the year shown in 
Mr Carpenter’s accrued pension is before its 
increase due to inflation. The changes in total 
transfer values during the year are shown before 
the effects of inflation and, in Mr Carpenter’s 
case, after deduction of his own DB contributions 
during the year. The inflation measure used for the 
purposes of this disclosure is the change in RPI. 
Transfer values are calculated in accordance with

Schemes (Transfer Values) Regulations 1996, as 
amended. Only base salary is pensionable. 
Executive directors’ Capital Builder Plan 
participations and estimates to date
The applicable classes of business which will 
determine the rewards payable to each of the 
directors of the Company participating in the 
Capital Builder Plan are the classes which they 
themselves underwrite (or underwrote) or the 
classes over which they had direct influence at 
the relevant time and the underwriting results of 
Syndicate 2001 (the part of the business in which 
both directors are or were principally engaged) 
as a whole. There was no material change in 
the classes in which Mr Carpenter participates 
between the 2009 and 2010 awards. Mr Holt 
participates on a time apportioned basis in 
underwriting years up to his retirement as an 
executive at the end of 2008. 
Awards were made in each of the years 2006 to 
2010 inclusive, in respect of performance periods 
of five underwriting years commencing in the 
year each respective award was made. Forecasts 
of rewards in respect of all performance periods 
are subject to change, particularly materially so in 
respect of later performance periods. Subject to 
that caveat, the forecast rewards based on earned 
premium and reserving as at 31 December 2010, 
for the periods stated to date, are as set out below. 
Where a positive result on the syndicate is less than 
a shortfall against the demanding return targets on 
individual classes, no payment will be due (as in 
the case of Mr Carpenter on each of the years as 
estimated to date).

Executive directors’ Performance Share Plan, Long Term Incentive Plan and share options participations
As described earlier in this report, all of these incentive plans involve options being granted to relevant UK-based participants over shares in the Company, 
whether at exercise prices determined in relation to the market price at the date of grant (executive options), a discount to such price (Sharesave) or at a 
nominal exercise price of £1 in total per exercise (PSP and L TIP). 
As at 31 December 2010 the options held under these plans by executive directors, all of whom were directors throughout the year, and their changes 
during the year, are set out in the tables on the next two pages. In addition each executive director was awarded 772 free shares in the SIP in April 2010 
(2009: 284). SIP shareholdings are included in the directors’ shareholding interests set out in the Directors’ report. The share price on the date of directors’ 
2010 PSP and L TIP awards (5 March) was 415.5p.

Notes
1 Grants shown in the table opposite as being over new shares may also be satisfied from treasury shares.
2  The potential profit as at 31 December 2010 shown in first table above are based on a year end share price of 408.9p (2009: 358.7p). The high and low closing market share prices during the year were 433.0p and 358.7p 
respectively (2009: 396.9p and 301.7p). These calculations are before tax and are theoretical as most PSP and L TIP awards were not exercisable at the year end, and some may not meet their performance conditions in full. 
3  The primary performance conditions of each of the grants of directors’ executive options included in the tables above related to TSR against a comparator group of companies, with a secondary condition that the Company had 
returned a satisfactory overall financial performance, both measured over a three year performance period. They were not subject to re-testing and, to the extent that an individual’s annual grant was over shares valued at over  
50% of salary, the Company’s TSR had to be upper quartile for the options to be exercised in full. All of such options met their performance conditions in full at the end of the relevant periods. 
4 Changes in directors’ entitlements during the year resulted from the grants during the year indicated in the table opposite and from the exercises set out in the second table above. 
Performance conditions measurements of PSP and L TIP awards
Measurements against PSP performance conditions were determined by the Committee in early 2010 and early 2011 respectively and are summarised 
below. For each of the 2005 and 2006 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuring five year period exceeded the threshold for 
maximum vesting of 20%.
PSP performance conditions measurement
Award Vesting date Performance period
Average return

2005 March 2010 2005-09 32.5% 100%
2006 March 2011 2006-10 28.5% 100%
Measurements against L TIP performance conditions were similarly determined. In this case the primary performance condition was 100% met for the 2007 
awards but for 2008 only partial vesting has been achieved, as Amlin’s TSR over the relevant three year period only outperformed the index by 15.5% 
compared with the maximum vesting threshold of 25% outperformance.

Use of unissued and existing shares for incentive plans
The rules of all those of the Company’s incentive plans which can result in the issue or transfer of shares to participants include limits on the overall 
number of unissued shares over which options may be granted. The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed 
to be issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans and the schedules to the PSP and L TIP applying to awards to participants in 
Continental Europe. New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares but in subsequent years such shares 
were purchased in the market. Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased, by the Group’s 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise. 
Grants of options over new and/or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the 
issued share capital in any 10 year period. Grants over new/treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over 10 years. The percentages  
of the year end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.

shares bought in the market each year since 2008, was 1,447,529 shares (2009: 1,034,459). 
In addition, the shares set out in the table below were committed to be transferred to participants by the trustee of the ESOT, subject, where applicable,

Of the total potential commitment of the ESOT as 
at 31 December 2010 (which is presented on the 
basis that all awards vest in full), it then held (and 
holds as at the date of this report) 2,811,679 
shares (2009: 1,056,440 against a commitment 
of 4,000,626). It is intended that the balance will 
be purchased in the market by the ESOT, using 
funds advanced by the Company, before they are 
required. The changes in the shares held by the 
ESOT during 2010 resulted from the exercises 
of options and vesting of awards over a total of 
980,244 shares and the purchase by the ESOT in 
the market of 2,735,483 shares principally using 
the funds advanced to the ESOT by the Group for 
the purpose. 
Total shareholder return performance
The graphs opposite illustrate the total 
shareholder return performance of the 
Company’s ordinary shares relative to the FTSE 
350 and the FTSE All Share Insurance indices 
respectively (Amlin’s shares are a constituent 
of both) over the five years to 31 December 
2010. Comparisons are shown with both these 
indices as the performance of Amlin’s shares is 
affected both by the general UK stock market in 
companies of its size and by its insurance sector. 
The graphs show the values, at each year end 
from 2006 to 2010 inclusive, of £100 invested 
in the Company’s shares on 31 December 2005 
compared with the values of £100 invested in the 
relevant index on the same date. To produce a 
fair value, each point on the graphs is the average 
of the relevant return index over the 30 days 
preceding the relevant year end.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 86 Governance Directors’ remuneration report
Non-executive directors’ fees, 
appointment and removal
The fees paid during the year to non-executive 
directors of the Company are included in the 
‘Directors’ remuneration received’ table earlier 
in this report ( pp.81). Such fees, other than 
those of the Chairman, are determined by the 
full Board. The Board receives recommendations 
in this respect from a committee chaired by 
the Chairman, with the Chief Executive and two 
other directors (one executive and one non-
executive member of the Committee, each of 
which rotates each year) as the other members. 
Recommendations and decisions are made 
taking account of professional advice and other 
information on the level of such fees paid by 
comparable companies for comparable services. 
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined 
by similar criteria, but by the Remuneration 
Committee. The minimum time commitments 
given by each director, as detailed in Annex 1 to 
the Board Corporate Governance statement, are 
also taken into account. The Board’s policy is that 
non-executive fees should be set by reference 
to the fees paid by financial services companies 
and listed companies generally of a similar size 
and complexity. Each non-executive director is 
paid a basic fee and is paid further for additional 
services, such as committee or subsidiary Board 
responsibilities. 
Non-executive directors have contracts for 
services rather than employment contracts. They 
are not eligible for any of the Group’s pension, 
share or incentive schemes but may, by the 
agreement of the Board, be paid additional 
fees (calculated on an appropriate day rate) 
in the event of exceptional levels of additional 
time being required, for instance in response to 
corporate developments. No such fees were paid 
in 2010 (2009: nil). Their terms of appointment 
are formalised in letters of appointment, copies 
of which are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and which are 
updated from time to time. Non-executive 
directors are appointed on the recommendation 
of the Nomination Committee and they may 
be removed, or not nominated for re-election, 
in each case in accordance with the Articles of 
Association of the Company. The commencement 
and expected year of expiry of each of the 
non-executive directors’ current terms, without 
taking account of the intended adoption of annual 
re-election, are set out in the table opposite.
If at the end of a term of office a non-executive 
director is not nominated to continue, the 
director is not entitled to any extra payment 
on termination. In other circumstances three 
months’ notice of termination may be given 
by either side or, in the case of notice by the 
Company, three months’ fees in lieu of notice.
Status of report 
As required by the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) 
Regulations 2008, in accordance with which 
this report has been prepared, the sections 
entitled ‘Remuneration received’, ‘Executive 
directors’ pensions’, ‘Executive directors’ Capital 
Builder Plan participations and estimates to

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements
87 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have elected to prepare the 
group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors 
are required to: 
  select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently; 
  make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable;
  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standards Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, each 
of the directors, whose names and functions are 
listed in the section of the Annual Report entitled 
“Board of directors”, confirm that, to the best of 
each person’s knowledge and belief: 
  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and the Company; and 
  the Director’s Report contained in the Annual 
Report includes (by reference) a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and 
the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 88 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Amlin plc
We have audited the Group financial statements 
of Amlin plc for the year ended 31 December 
2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 39. 
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities set out on ( pp.88), 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
  give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s affairs as at 31 December 2010 and 
of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended; 
  have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
and 
  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the group financial statements; and
  the information given in the Board Corporate 
Governance Statement set out on  
( pp.60-69) with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems and about 
share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
  a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the parent company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
  the directors’ statement, set out on ( pp.59) , 
in relation to going concern; 
  the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions  
of the June 2008 Combined Code  
specified for our review; and
  certain elements of the report to shareholders 
by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent 
company financial statements of Amlin plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2010 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the accounts

1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates 
Amlin plc (the Company) is a public limited 
company registered in England and Wales.  
The address of the registered office is St 
Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London EC3A 8ND. 
The basis of preparation, basis of consolidation 
and significant accounting policies adopted in 
the preparation of Amlin plc and subsidiaries’ 
(the Group) consolidated financial statements 
are set out below. 
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted for use in the European Union (EU). 
The consolidated financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation and 
Companies Act 2006.  
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for cash and cash equivalents, financial 
assets and liabilities, share options, and pension 
assets which are measured at their fair value.  
Except where otherwise stated, all figures 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
are presented in millions of British Pounds 
Sterling (sterling) shown as £m rounded to  
the nearest £100,000. 
The accounting policies adopted in preparing 
these financial statements are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the Group’s 
annual financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2009, unless otherwise stated. 
In accordance with IFRS 4, the Group has 
applied existing accounting practices for insurance 
contracts, modified as appropriate, to comply with 
the IFRS framework and applicable standards. 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements consolidate the accounts 
of the Company and subsidiary undertakings, 
including the Group’s underwriting through 
participation on Lloyd’s syndicates. Subsidiaries 
are those entities in which the Group, directly or 
indirectly, has the power to govern the operating 
and financial policies in order to gain economic 
benefits and include the Company’s employee 
benefit trusts. The financial statements of all 
subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Consolidation 
adjustments are made to convert subsidiary 
accounts prepared under different accounting 
standards into IFRS so as to remove the effects 
of any different accounting policies that may 
exist. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
that control is transferred to the Group and cease 
to be consolidated from the date that control is 
transferred out.  
All inter-company balances, profits and 
transactions are eliminated. 
Details of material subsidiaries included within 
the consolidated financial statements can be 
found in note 35. 
As part of our process to improve the presentation 
of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, 
certain changes have been made to the 
presentation of Financial assets and Financial 
liabilities, Insurance liabilities and reinsurance 
assets, Other payables, and Loans and 
receivables in order to better reflect the nature 
of underlying transactions. In addition, changes 
have also been made to the presentation of the 
effects of tax in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity. These changes 
in presentation have no effect on the previously 
reported net income, shareholders’ equity or 
net assets. Comparative information has been 
amended to reflect this change.  
Adoption of new and revised standards 
(a) Standards, amendments to published 
 standards and interpretations effective  
on or after 1 January 2010 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent 
with those of the previous financial year, except 
for the following new and amended IFRS  
and IFRIC interpretations effective as of  
1 January 2010: 
• IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’; 
• IAS 27 (amended), ‘Consolidated and 
separate financial statements’; 
• Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial 
instruments: recognition and measurement 
– eligible hedged items’; 
• Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Group cash-settled 
share-based payment transactions’; 
• IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from 
customers’; 
• IFRIC 17, ‘Distribution of non-cash assets  
to owners’; and 
• Annual improvements to IFRSs 2008-2009. 
Adoption of these revised standards and 
interpretations did not have any material  
effect on the financial performance or position 
of the Group.  
The effects of these changes are as follows: 
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ and 
IAS 27 (amended), ‘Consolidated and separate 
financial statements’  
IFRS 3 (revised) introduces significant changes 
in the accounting for business combinations 
occurring after 1 January 2010. Changes affect 
the valuation of non-controlling interests, the 
accounting for transaction costs, the initial 
recognition and subsequent measurement of 
contingent consideration and business 
combinations achieved in stages. These changes 
will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, 
the reported results in the period that an 
acquisition occurs and future reported results.  
IAS 27 (amended) requires that a change in the 
ownership interest of a subsidiary (without loss 
of control) is accounted for as a transaction with 
owners in their capacity as owners. Therefore, 
such transactions will no longer give rise to 
goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss. 
Furthermore, the amended standard changes 
the accounting for losses incurred by the 
subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a 
subsidiary. The changes by IFRS 3 (revised) and 
IAS 27 (amended) will affect future acquisitions or 
loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions 
with non-controlling interests. The changes were 
applied prospectively and had no material impact. 
IAS 39 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
recognition and measurement – eligible  
hedged items’ 
The amendment was issued in July 2008. It 
provides guidance on certain hedged items. On 
the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged 
item, IAS 39 concludes that a purchased option 
designated in its entirety as the hedging 
instrument of a one-sided risk will not be 
perfectly effective. Additionally, the designation 
of inflation as a hedged risk or portion is not 
permitted unless in particular situations.  
There is no material impact on the Group  
or Company’s financial statements. 
IFRS 2 (amended), ‘Group cash-settled share-
based payment transactions’ 
The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 that 
clarified the scope and the accounting for group 
cash-settled share-based payment transactions. 
The Group adopted this amendment as of  
1 January 2010. There is no material impact on 
the Group or Company’s financial statements. 
IFRIC 17, ‘Distribution of non-cash assets  
to owners’ 
The interpretation provides guidance on 
accounting for arrangements whereby an entity 
distributes non-cash assets to shareholders 
either as a distribution of reserves or as 
dividends. IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held  
for sale and discontinued operations’ has  
also been amended to require that assets are 
classified as held for distribution only when they 
are available for distribution in their present 
condition and the distribution is highly 
probable. This interpretation does not  
have a material impact on the Group or 
Company’s financial statements.  
IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’ 
This interpretation was issued in January 2009. 
It clarifies how to account for transfers of items 
of property, plant and equipment by entities 
that receive such transfers from their 
customers. The interpretation also applies  
to agreements in which an entity receives   Financial statements Notes to the accounts

cash from a customer when that amount of 
cash must be used only to construct or acquire 
an item of property, plant and equipment and 
the entity must then use that item to provide 
the customer with ongoing access to supply  
of goods and/or services. The Group is not 
impacted by the adoption of IFRIC 18. 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2008-2009 
In April 2008 and 2009, the IASB issued its 
annual amendments to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the related 
Bases for Conclusions and guidance made. The 
IASB uses the annual improvements process to 
make necessary, but non-urgent, amendments to 
IFRSs that will not be included as part of a major 
project. The amendments primarily remove 
inconsistencies and clarify wording. The Group 
has adopted the amendments to standards as 
they come into effect for the reporting period 
beginning on 1 January 2010. However, these 
amendments have no material impact on the 
Group or Company’s financial statements. 
(b) Standards, amendments to published standards 
and interpretations early adopted by the Group 
In 2010, the Group did not early adopt any 
new, revised or amended standards. 
(c) Standards, amendments to published standards 
and interpretations that are not yet effective and 
have not been early adopted by the Group 
Standards issued but not yet effective up to  
the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are listed below. The Group intends 
to adopt these standards when they become 
effective. 
IAS 24 (amended), ‘Related party disclosures’ 
The amended standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.  
It clarified the definition of a related party to 
simplify the identification of such relationships 
and to eliminate inconsistencies in its application. 
The revised standard introduced a partial 
exemption of disclosure requirements for 
government-related entities. The Group does 
not expect any impact on its financial position 
or performance.  
IAS 32 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Presentation – classification of rights issues’ 
The amendment to IAS 32 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010 
and amended the definition of a financial 
liability in order to classify rights issues  
(and certain options or warrants) as equity 
instruments in cases where such rights are 
given pro rata to all of the existing owners of 
the same class of an entity’s non-derivative 
equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed 
number of the entity’s own equity instruments 
for a fixed amount in any currency.  
This amendment will have no impact on the 
Group after initial application.  
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments: Classification 
and measurement’ 
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the 
Board’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and 
applies to the classification and measurement 
of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. The 
standard is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. In 
subsequent phases, the Board will address 
hedge accounting and derecognition. The 
completion of this project is expected in early 
2011. The adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect 
on the classification and measurement of the 
Group’s financial assets. However, the Group 
determined that the effect shall be quantified in 
conjunction with the other phases when issued 
to present a comprehensive picture. 
IFRS 9 amendments to incorporate financial 
liabilities 
The amendments to IFRS 9 issued in October 
2010 incorporate the classification and 
measurement of financial liabilities and are 
mandatory for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013. The amendments only 
affect the measurement of financial liabilities 
designated at fair value through profit or loss 
using the Fair Value Option (FVO). All other 
requirements in IAS 39 in respect of liabilities 
are carried forward into IFRS 9.  
For FVO liabilities, the amount of change in  
the fair value of a liability that is attributable  
to changes in credit risk must be presented  
in other comprehensive income (OCI). The 
remainder of the change in fair value is 
presented in profit or loss, unless presentation 
of the fair value change in respect of the 
liability’s credit risk in OCI would create or 
enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or 
loss. The amendments are deemed to have no 
impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
IFRIC 14 (amended), ‘Prepayments of a minimum 
funding requirement’ 
The amendment to IFRIC 14 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 
with retrospective application. The amendment 
provides guidance on assessing the recoverable 
amount of a net pension asset. The amendment 
permits an entity to treat the prepayment of a 
minimum funding requirement as an asset. The 
amendment is deemed to have no impact on 
the financial statements of the Group.  
IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with 
equity instruments’ 
IFRIC 19 is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2010. The interpretation 
clarifies that equity instruments issued to a 
creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify 
as consideration paid.  
The equity instruments issued are measured at 
their fair value. In case this cannot be reliably 
measured, they are measured at the fair value 
of the liability extinguished. Any gain or loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. The 
adoption of this interpretation will have no 
effect on the financial statements of the Group.  
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009-2010 
The IASB issued Improvements to IFRSs, an 
omnibus of amendments to its IFRS standards. 
The amendments have not been adopted as 
they become effective for annual periods on  
or after either 1 July 2010 or 1 January 2011.  
The Group however, expects no significant 
impact from the adoption of the amendments 
on its financial position or performance. 
IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Disclosures – Transfers of financial assets’ 
The amendment to IFRS 7 is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 
2011 and comparative disclosures are not 
required for early adoption. The amendment 
will introduce more extensive quantitative and 
qualitative disclosures about the transfer of 
financial assets to assist users in understanding 
the implications of transfers of financial assets 
and the potential risks that may remain with the 
transferor. The amendment is deemed to have 
no material impact on the Group or Company’s 
financial statements. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of financial statements requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge of 
current events and actions, actual results may 
ultimately differ from those estimates. 
Insurance contract liabilities 
The most significant estimate made in the 
financial statements relates to unpaid insurance 
claim reserves and related loss adjustment 
expenses of the Group.  
The estimated provision for the total level of 
claims incurred changes as more information 
becomes known about the actual losses for 
which the initial provisions were set up. The 
change in claims costs for prior period insurance 
claims represents the claims development of 
earlier reported years incurred in the current 
accounting period. In 2010, there has been  
a net positive development of £156.5 million 
(2009: £174.1 million) for the Group, reflecting 
favourable experience in the 2009 and prior 
reported years. Note 3 provides further details 
of the method the Group applies in estimating 
insurance contract liabilities.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 98

1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates continued 
Financial investments 
The methods and assumptions used by the 
Group and Company in estimating the fair value 
of financial assets are described in note 3. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are recognised on the 
acquisition of a subsidiary, on the purchase of 
specific rights to renew a particular underwriting 
portfolio and on computer software. 
The value of such intangibles arising from the 
acquisition of a subsidiary or specific renewal 
rights is largely based on the expected cash 
flows of the business acquired and contractual 
rights on that business. Certain key assumptions 
are used to assess the value of the intangible 
such as past underwriting performance and 
past renewal values of underwriting business. 
These are the subject of specific uncertainty 
and a reduction in underwriting profitability  
or renewal patterns of business acquired may 
result in the value of the intangible being 
impaired and written off in the current 
accounting period. Note 22 provides  
details of any current impairments. 
Goodwill impairment  
The Group determines whether goodwill is 
impaired at least on an annual basis. This 
requires an estimation of the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill is allocated. Details of the key 
assumptions used in the estimation of the 
recoverable amounts are contained in note 22. 
The Group has allocated the goodwill to three 
single cash generating units equivalent to three 
operating segments of the Group. Note 22 
provides further details. The carrying value at 
the reporting date of goodwill is £61.8 million 
(2009: £63.9 million).  
Taxation  
Uncertainties exist with respect to the 
interpretation of complex tax regulations  
and the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. The wide range of international 
business relationships and the long-term nature 
and complexity of existing contractual agreements, 
could necessitate future adjustments to tax 
income and expense already recorded. The 
Group establishes provisions, based on 
reasonable estimates, for possible consequences 
of audits by the tax authorities of the respective 
countries in which it operates. The amount of 
such provisions is based on various factors, 
such as experience of previous tax audits and 
differing interpretations of tax regulations by the 
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. 
Such differences of interpretation may arise  
on a wide variety of issues depending on the 
conditions prevailing in the respective Group 
company’s domicile. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all 
unused tax losses to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets 
that can be recognised, based upon the likely 
timing and the level of future taxable profits 
together with future tax planning strategies. 
The carrying value at the reporting date of  
the deferred tax asset is £14.7 million (2009: 
£29.1 million), and of the deferred tax liability  
is £87.8 million (2009: £125.0 million).  
Staff incentive plans 
The Group recognises a liability and expense for 
staff incentive plans based on a formula that 
takes into consideration the underwriting profit 
after certain adjustments. Underwriting profit  
is estimated based on current expectation of 
premiums and claims and will change as more 
information is known or future events occur. 
Where estimates change, related staff incentive 
plan liabilities may also change. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group participates in the Lloyd’s 
Superannuation Fund defined benefit scheme 
and also operates defined benefit schemes  
in the Netherlands and Belgium.  
The amounts included in these financial 
statements are sensitive to changes in the 
assumptions used to derive the value of the 
scheme assets and liabilities.  
A gain of £5.9 million (2009: £23.7 million  
loss) has been recognised in the Statement  
of Comprehensive Income and a debit of  
£1.9 million (2009: £2.3 million) has been 
recognised in the Income Statement.  
Note 28 provides further details on the  
Group’s retirement benefit obligations.  
Significant accounting policies 
Foreign currency translation 
The Group and Company present their accounts 
in sterling since it is subject to regulation in the 
United Kingdom and the net assets, liabilities 
and income of the Group and Company are 
currently weighted towards sterling. US dollar 
and euro revenues are significant but the 
sterling revenue stream is also currently 
material. All Group entities are incorporated  
in the United Kingdom with the exception of 
Amlin Bermuda Holdings Ltd (incorporated  
in Bermuda), Amlin AG (Switzerland), Amlin 
France Holdings SAS (formerly known as Amlin 
France SAS), Amlin France SAS (formerly 
known as Anglo French Underwriters SAS) (both 
France), Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (the 
Netherlands) and Amlin Singapore Pte Limited 
(Singapore). All Group entities conduct business 
in a range of economic environments, although 
these are primarily the United Kingdom, United 
States of America and Continental Europe. Due  
to the regulatory environment and the fact that 
the Group trades through the Lloyd’s market,  
all Group companies incorporated in the United 
Kingdom have adopted sterling as their 
functional currency, although Amlin (Overseas 
Holdings) Limited’s Netherlands branch has 
adopted the euro as its functional currency. The 
Group company incorporated in Bermuda and 
Amlin AG’s Bermudian branch (Amlin Bermuda) 
have adopted the US dollar as their functional 
currency. Amlin Singapore Pte Limited has 
adopted the Singaporean dollar as its functional 
currency. The Group companies incorporated  
in France and the Netherlands and Amlin  
AG’s Swiss operation (Amlin Re Europe) have 
adopted the euro as their functional currency. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities are translated at the rates of 
exchange at the balance sheet date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities are translated  
at the rate prevailing in the period in which the 
asset or liability first arose. Exchange differences 
are recognised within other operating expenses. 
The results and financial position of those Group 
entities whose functional currency is not sterling 
are translated into sterling as follows: 
• Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet 
presented are translated at the closing 
exchange rate at the date of the balance 
sheet; 
• Income and expenses for each income 
statement are translated at average 
exchange rates during the period (as  
an approximation to the exchange rates  
at the dates of each transaction); and 
• On consolidation all resulting exchange 
differences are recognised as a component 
of equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated  
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing rate.  
Where contracts to sell currency have been 
entered into prior to the year end, the contracted 
rates have been used. Differences arising on the 
translation of foreign currency amounts on such 
items are included in other operating expenses. 
Product classification 
Insurance contracts are defined as those 
containing significant insurance risk if, and only 
if, an insured event could cause an insurer to 
make significant additional payments in any 
scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial 
substance, at the inception of the contract.  
The significance of insurance risk is dependent 
on both the probability of an insured event  
and the magnitude of its potential effect. Any   Financial statements Notes to the accounts
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements

contracts not considered to be insurance 
contracts under IFRS are classified as  
investment contracts.  
Based on the current assessment, all of the 
products sold by the Group’s insurance entities 
are insurance contracts within the scope  
of IFRS 4.  
Insurance contracts premium 
Gross written premium comprises premium  
on insurance contracts incepting during the 
financial year together with adjustments to 
premiums written in previous accounting 
periods. The estimated premium income in 
respect of facility contracts, for example binding 
authorities and lineslips, is deemed to be written 
in full at the inception of the contract. Premium 
is disclosed before the deduction of brokerage 
and taxes or duties levied on them.  
The proportion of gross written premium, gross 
of commission payable, attributable to periods 
after the balance sheet date is deferred as a 
provision for unearned premium. The change in 
this provision is taken to the income statement 
in order that revenue is recognised over the 
period of the risk. 
Premium is earned over the policy contract 
period. The earned element is calculated 
separately for each contract on a 365ths basis 
where the premium is apportioned over the 
period of risk. For premium written under 
facilities the earned element is calculated based 
on the estimated inception date and coverage 
period of the underlying contracts. 
Acquisition costs 
Acquisition costs comprise brokerage incurred 
on insurance contracts written during the 
financial year. They are incurred on the same 
basis as the earned proportions of the premium 
they relate to. Deferred acquisition costs are 
amortised over the period in which the related 
revenues are earned. Deferred acquisition costs 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and are written off where they are  
no longer considered to be recoverable. 
Reinsurance premium ceded 
Reinsurance premium ceded comprises the 
cost of reinsurance arrangements placed and 
are accounted for in the same accounting 
period as the related insurance contracts. The 
provision for reinsurers’ share of unearned 
premium represents that part of reinsurance 
written premium which is estimated to be 
earned in following financial years.  
Insurance contracts liabilities 
Claims paid are defined as those claims 
transactions settled up to the balance sheet 
date including internal and external claims 
settlement expenses allocated to those 
transactions.  
Unpaid claims reserves are made for known or 
anticipated liabilities under insurance contracts 
which have not been settled up to the balance 
sheet date. Included within the provision is an 
allowance for the future costs of settling those 
claims. This is estimated based on past experience 
and current expectations of future cost levels. 
Unpaid claims reserves are estimated on an 
undiscounted basis. Unpaid claims reserves 
acquired through a business combination are 
measured at fair value, using an applicable  
risk-free discount rate and having regard  
to the expected settlement dates of the claims. 
Provisions are subject to a detailed quarterly 
review where forecast future cash flows and 
existing amounts provided are reviewed and 
reassessed. Any changes to the amounts held 
are adjusted through the income statement. 
Provisions are established above an actuarial 
best estimate, reflecting a risk premium relating 
to the uncertainty of the actual level of claims 
incurred. There is therefore a reasonable chance 
of release of reserves from one underwriting year 
to the next. 
The unpaid claims reserves also include, where 
necessary, a reserve for unexpired risks where, 
at the balance sheet date, the estimated costs 
of future claims and related deferred acquisition 
costs are expected to exceed the unearned 
premium provision.  
Reinsurance contracts held 
Contracts entered into by the Group  
with reinsurers under which the Group is 
compensated for losses on contracts issued  
by the Group and that meet the classification 
requirements for insurance contracts are 
classified as reinsurance contracts held. 
Insurance contracts entered into by the Group 
under which the contract holder is another 
insurer (inwards reinsurance) are included 
within insurance contracts. 
The benefits to which the Group is entitled under 
its reinsurance contracts held are recognised  
as reinsurance assets. These assets consist  
of short-term balances due from reinsurers,  
as well as longer term receivables that are 
dependent on the expected claims and benefits 
arising under the related reinsured insurance 
contracts. Amounts recoverable from or due  
to reinsurers are measured consistently with the 
amounts associated with the reinsured insurance 
contracts and in accordance with the terms  
of each reinsurance contract.  
Where there is objective evidence that a 
reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount of the reinsurance 
asset to its recoverable amount and recognises 
that impairment loss in the income statement. 
Salvage and subrogation reimbursements  
Some insurance contracts permit the Group  
to sell (usually damaged) property acquired  
in settling a claim (for example, salvage). The 
Group may also have the right to pursue third 
parties for payment of some or all costs (for 
example, subrogation).  
Estimates of salvage recoveries are included  
as an allowance in the measurement of the 
insurance liability for claims, and salvage 
property is recognised in other insurance assets 
when the liability is settled. The allowance is the 
amount that can reasonably be recovered from 
the disposal of the property.  
Subrogation reimbursements are also considered 
as an allowance in the measurement of the 
insurance liability for claims and are recognised 
in other assets when the liability is settled. The 
allowance is the assessment of the amount that 
can be recovered from the action against the 
liable third party. 
Net investment income 
Dividends and any related tax credits are 
recognised as income on the date that the 
related listed investments are marked ex-
dividend. Other investment income, interest 
receivable, expenses and interest payable  
are recognised on an accruals basis. 
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, which is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing the 
performance of the operating segments,  
has been identified as the Board of Directors  
of the Company.  
Business combinations 
i. Business combinations before 1 January 2010 
The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted  
for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group at the date of 
exchange, plus any costs directly attributable to 
the business combination. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of 
any minority interest. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. 
ii. Business combination after 1 January 2010 
The Group policy is to apply IFRS 3 (revised)  
to all acquisitions which take place on or after  
1 January 2010. Business combinations are 
accounted for using the acquisition method.   Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 100
Notes to the accounts continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2010 
 
1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates continued 
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the 
Group at the date of exchange. Under IFRS 3 
(revised), with the exception of the costs of 
registering and issuing debt and securities  
that are recognised in accordance with IAS 32 
and IAS 39 (i.e. as a reduction in proceeds),  
all other acquisition-related costs are to be 
expensed as incurred. 
When the Group acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual 
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions at the acquisition date. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised at 
their fair value at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest. The excess of the fair value of 
consideration transferred over the fair value  
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
For each business combination, the Group 
measures any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets.  
Interests in associate entities 
Investments in associates are accounted for 
using the equity method. 
Associates are all entities over which the Group 
has significant influence but no control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. The Group’s share 
of its associates’ post-acquisition profits and 
losses after tax is recognised in the income 
statement each period, and its share of the 
movement in associates’ net assets is reflected 
in the investments’ carrying values in the 
balance sheet. 
Interests in jointly owned entities 
Investments in jointly owned entities are 
accounted for using the equity method. 
Operations held for sale 
Assets and liabilities held for disposal as part  
of operations which are held for sale are shown 
separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The relevant assets are recorded at the lower  
of their carrying amount and their fair value, 
less the estimated selling costs. Operations held 
for sale are being actively marketed to external 
investors. After one year of where in excess of 
50% of the operation is held by the Group, the 
assets and liabilities are consolidated unless the 
delay in attracting sufficient external investment 
is due to circumstances beyond the Group’s 
control and previously considered unlikely. 
When the Group ceases to hold a 50% interest 
in the assets and liabilities, it shall be re-designated 
as fair value through profit and loss. 
Intangible assets 
i. Syndicate capacity 
The cost of Lloyd’s syndicate participations that 
have been purchased in the Lloyd’s capacity 
auctions is capitalised at cost. Syndicate capacity 
is considered to have an indefinite life as it will 
provide benefits over an indefinite future period 
and is therefore not subject to an annual 
amortisation charge. The continuing value  
of the capacity is reviewed for impairment 
annually by reference to the expected future 
profit streams to be earned from Syndicate 
2001, with any impairment in value being 
charged to the income statement.  
ii. Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to  
1 January 1999 was written off to reserves. 
Goodwill recognised between 1 January 1999 
and the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004) 
was capitalised and amortised on a straight line 
basis over its estimated useful life. Following 
the transition to IFRS this goodwill is stated at 
net book value at 1 January 2004. Goodwill that 
was recognised subsequent to 1 January 2004 
is capitalised. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually, or when events or changes in 
circumstance indicate that it might be impaired, 
by comparing the net present value of the 
future earnings stream from the acquired 
subsidiary, against the carrying value of the 
goodwill and the carrying value of the related 
net assets. 
iii. Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets comprise costs directly 
attributable to securing the intangible rights  
to broker, customer relationships and costs 
directly attributable to internally-developed 
software. Costs are recognised as intangible 
assets where they can be identified separately 
and measured reliably and it is probable that 
they will be recovered by directly related future 
profits. Other intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment losses annually or whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that  
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
Other intangible assets are carried at cost  
less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-
line basis based on the estimated useful 
economic life of the assets, which is estimated 
to be between five and fifteen years. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at historical 
cost less accumulated depreciation and provision 
for impairment where appropriate. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and  
the costs attributable to bringing the asset  
to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight line 
method to write down the cost of such assets to 
their residual values over their estimated useful 
lives as follows: 
Leasehold land  
and buildings 
Over period 
of lease
Freehold buildings 5% per annum
Motor vehicles 33% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Furniture, fixtures and 
leasehold improvements 20% per annum
The carrying values of property and equipment 
are reviewed for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. If any such 
condition exists, the recoverable amount of  
the asset is estimated in order to determine  
the extent of impairment and the difference  
is charged to the income statement. 
Gains and losses on disposal of property and 
equipment are determined by reference to their 
carrying amount and are taken to the income 
statement. Repairs and renewals are charged to 
the income statement when the expenditure is 
incurred. The freehold land is not depreciated. 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets at fair 
value through profit and loss (FV) or available for 
sale. The classification depends on the purpose 
for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification  
of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
Other than investments in certain unlisted 
insurance intermediaries (see below), the Group 
classifies its financial investments as FV. This 
classification requires all fair value changes to 
be recognised immediately within the investment 
return line in the income statement. Within the 
FV category, fixed maturity and equity securities 
are classified as ‘trading’ as the Group buys with 
the intention to resell. All other securities are 
classified as ‘other than trading’ within the  
FV category. 
The Group has investments in certain unlisted 
insurance intermediaries which are treated as 
available-for-sale and are measured at fair value. 
Changes in fair value of investments are included 
in Other Comprehensive Income in the period in 
which they arise. They are tested for impairment 
annually, or when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that impairment might 
have occurred. When securities classified as 
available for sale are sold or impaired, the 
accumulated fair value adjustments recognised  
in equity are included in the income statement  
as ‘gains and losses from investment securities’. 
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised 
on the trade date, which is the date the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the assets. These 
are initially recognised at fair value, and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value based  Financial statements Notes to the accounts

on quoted bid prices. Transaction costs are 
recognised directly in the income statement 
when incurred. Changes in the fair value  
of investments are included in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise.  
The uncertainty around bond valuation is 
discussed further in note 3. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into. Fair values for over the counter 
derivatives are supplied by the custodian and 
checked to the relevant counterparty and 
Bloomberg. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments are recognised 
immediately in the income statement unless  
the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument. As defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, 
the Group designates certain foreign currency 
derivatives as hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations. The Group documents at  
the inception of each hedging transaction the 
relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various 
hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether 
the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values of hedged items. 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
related to the effective portion is recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The fair values of derivative instruments 
used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 
17. Gains and losses accumulated in equity  
are included in the income statement when the 
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised 
cost using an effective interest rate. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
are recognised in the income statement when 
there is evidence that the asset is impaired. 
These are reversed when the triggering event 
that caused the impairment is reversed. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are stated initially at the consideration 
received net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Any difference between amortised  
cost and the redemption value is recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings. Transaction costs on borrowings 
are charged through the income statement  
over the period of the borrowings. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs mainly comprise interest 
payable on subordinated loans and 
commissions charged for the utilisation of 
letters of credit. These costs are charged to the 
income statement as finance costs, as incurred. 
In addition, fees paid for the arrangement of 
debt and letter of credit facilities are charged  
to finance costs over the life of the facility. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value. For the purposes  
of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits 
held on call with banks and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments which are believed  
to be subject to insignificant risk of change  
in fair value. 
Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are deducted from equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the treasury shares. Any 
consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in equity. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever 
the terms of the lease transfer substantially all 
the risks and rewards to the Group. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to income in the period in which they 
become payable in accordance with the terms 
of the lease. 
Employee benefits 
i. Pension obligations  
The Group participates in a number of pension 
schemes, including several defined benefit 
schemes, defined contribution schemes and 
personal pension schemes. 
The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund scheme is a 
multi-employer defined benefit scheme. Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) participates in 
two defined benefit schemes.  
The defined benefit obligation and associated 
pension costs are calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. This method sees each period  
of service as giving rise to an additional unit  
of benefit entitlement and measures each unit 
separately to build up the final liability. The cost 
of providing these benefits is charged to the 
income statement to spread the pension cost 
over the service lives of employees. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from the recognition 
and funding of the Group’s pension obligations are 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income during the period in which they arise. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in 
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the 
present value of the fair value of plan assets 
less the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date, together with adjustments 
for unrecognised past-service costs and for 
restrictions on the recognition of a defined 
benefit asset due to an asset ceiling. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension 
liability. In respect of ACI’s defined benefit scheme 
in the Netherlands, the fair value of the plan assets 
reflects the benefits that accrue to ACI under the 
insurance policy taken out to meet its obligations. 
Pension contributions to defined contribution 
plans are charged to the income statement 
when due.  
ii. Equity compensation plans (equity-settled) 
The Company operates a number of executive 
and employee share schemes. Options issued 
after 7 November 2002 are accounted for using 
the fair value method where the cost for providing 
equity compensation is based on the fair value 
of the share option or award at the date of the 
grant. The fair value is calculated using an 
option pricing model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised in the income statement 
over the vesting period. The accrual for this 
charge is recognised in equity shareholders’ 
funds. When the options are exercised, the 
proceeds received net of any transaction costs 
are credited to share capital for the par value 
and the surplus to share premium. 
iii. Equity compensation plans (cash-settled) 
The Group operates the Amlin Capital Builder 
Plan which is deemed a cash-settled share-
based payment arrangement. The cost of cash-
settled transactions is measured initially at fair 
value at the grant date. Further details are given 
in note 24. The fair value is expensed over the 
period until the vesting date with recognition  
of a corresponding liability. The liability is 
remeasured at each reporting date up to and 
including the settlement date with changes in 
fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
iv. Other benefits  
Other employee incentive schemes and long-
term service awards, including sabbatical leave, 
are recognised when they accrue to employees. 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for 
long-service leave as a result of services rendered 
by employees up to the balance sheet date. 
Other income  
Fee income from providing information services

1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates continued 
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of  
the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from 
net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years  
or that are never taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s and Company’s liability for current  
tax is calculated using tax rates that have  
been enacted or substantively enacted by  
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities in the financial statements  
and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities  
in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates,  
and interests in joint ventures, except where  
the Group and Company is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will  
be available to allow all or part of the asset  
to be recovered, or to the extent that it has 
been utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates  
that are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit  
or loss, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case  
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax is recognised on the profits of 
overseas subsidiaries where it is reasonably 
foreseeable that distribution of the profit back 
to the UK will take place and the UK dividend 
exemption is not expected to apply. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s and Company’s financial statements in 
the period in which the dividends are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. 
Other payables 
Other payables are those incurred in the normal 
course of business and measured at amortised 
cost. They represent liabilities to pay for goods 
or services that have been received or supplied, 
and have been invoiced by the supplier before 
the period end, but payment has not yet  
been made.  
2. Capital 
The capital structure of the Group consists  
of equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and note 23, and subordinated debt as 
disclosed in note 27. For business planning 
purposes, account is also taken of the Group’s 
undrawn debt facilities as disclosed in note 27. 
The Amlin corporate member, which supports 
Syndicate 2001, is required to hold regulatory 
capital in compliance with the rules issued by 
the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA).  
In addition, being a Lloyd’s operation it is also 
subject to Lloyd’s capital requirements. Under 
FSA rules, the corporate member must hold 
capital in excess of the higher of two amounts. 
The first is the Pillar 1 requirement, as 
prescribed by EU directives, calculated by 
applying fixed percentages to premiums and 
claims. The second, Pillar 2, is an Individual 
Capital Assessment (ICA) calculated internally 
by the firm. The ICA is defined as the level of 
capital that is required to contain the probability 
of insolvency, over a one year timeframe, to no 
greater than 0.5%. The ICA calculation basis is 
generally considered to be broadly equivalent to 
a BBB insurance financial strength rating. The 
ICA calculation considers all ultimate losses 
incurred over a one year business planning 
horizon, and any prior year reserve movements. 
For the purposes of setting Lloyd’s capital 
requirements, Lloyd’s currently uplifts all ICAs 
by 35% (2009: 35%) to bring the capital to a 
level to support a higher financial strength 
rating. The final capital requirement is then 
subject to a minimum of 40% (2009: 40%)  
of the syndicate’s agreed regulatory  
premium capacity limit. 
The Syndicate also benefits from mutualised 
capital within the Lloyd’s Central Fund, for which 
a variable annual levy, for 2010 of 0.5% (2009: 
0.5%) of Syndicate gross premium, is payable. 
The ICA is reviewed annually by Lloyd’s and 
periodically by the FSA. The FSA expect 
management to apply their rules continuously.  
If a firm breaches its Pillar 1 capital it must 
cease trading; if Pillar 2 capital is breached 
steps must be taken urgently to restore capital 
to the required level. Due to the nature of the 
Lloyd’s capital setting process, Funds at Lloyd’s 
requirements are formally assessed and funded 
twice yearly at discrete periods and must be 
met for the Syndicate to continue underwriting. 
At 31 December 2010 the level of capital held 
on behalf of the Amlin corporate member was 
more than £250 million (2009: £200 million)  
in excess of the Pillar 1 requirement and more 
than £25 million (2009: £20 million) in excess 
of the Pillar 2 requirement. 
The Group does not seek to retain any assets in 
excess of the Lloyd’s capital requirement within 
the Lloyd’s framework and any surplus is paid 
to the corporate entities in the Group. 
Amlin AG is supervised by the Swiss Financial 
Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the 
Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). 
The FINMA supervision is composed of  
various qualitative assessments, governance 
requirements and minimum solvency levels. 
Amlin AG provides regulatory solvency 
reporting to FINMA under the rules of Solvency 
I and the Swiss Solvency Test (SST). Solvency I 
is based on the Swiss statutory financial 
statements and required capital is calculated  
as a fixed percentage of premiums, claims 
reserves and/or net amount at risk. The SST  
is based on an economic view and required 
capital is derived from an internal Dynamic 
Financial Analysis (DFA) model.  
The internal model as well as the 2011 SST  
is still subject to approval by the FINMA. We 
calculate available and required capital under 
the SST using the aforementioned model. The 
minimum ratio for Solvency I as well as for the 
SST is set at 100% (the SST minimum ratio will 
become legally binding in 2011). For both ratios 
Amlin AG exceeds the 100% minimum ratio. 
Under BMA regulations, Amlin AG is licensed  
as a Class IV insurer and the minimum solvency 
margin is the greater of US$100 million, 50%  
of net premiums written in the current financial 
year, 15% of claims reserves and the Enhanced 
Capital Requirement (ECR). The ECR is calculated 
on an annual basis through either the Bermuda 
Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) model or 
an approved internal model. In addition, as a 
Class IV insurer, the company is required to 
maintain a minimum liquidity ratio such that the 
value of ‘relevant assets’ is not less than 75% of 
its ‘relevant liabilities’. Amlin AG met this 
requirement at 31 December 2010. 
For trading purposes, Amlin AG believes that  
it is necessary to hold at least US$1 billion  
of capital, which is currently in excess of the 
minimum required by the BMA and FINMA.  Financial statements Notes to the accounts

Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI)  
is required to hold regulatory capital in 
compliance with the rules issued by its 
regulator and as prescribed by EU directives.  
Regulatory capital is calculated by applying 
fixed percentages to premiums and claims. At 
31 December 2010, ACI’s available regulatory 
capital was €341.9 million (2009: €308.0 
million) compared to a minimum requirement 
of €112.4 million (2009: €111.0 million).  
For wider commercial reasons, ACI’s capital  
is managed so as to support its financial 
strength ratings. 
The method by which the Group manages  
its capital base is described on page 46  
of the Performance section under Financial 
Management. 
In addition to regulatory capital requirements, 
the Group believes that it should retain a level 
of capital within the Group to allow it to grow its 
exposures materially in the aftermath of a major 
insurance disaster, but also to respond to other 
opportunities to enhance long-term growth, for 
example through acquisition. The overall capital 
held by the Group is driven by the business mix, 
nature and objectives of each business unit and 
its context within the wider Group. 
3. Risk disclosures  
3.1 Underwriting risk 
The Group accepts underwriting risk in a  
range of classes of business through Lloyd’s 
Syndicate 2001, Amlin Corporate Insurance 
N.V. (ACI) and Amlin AG (including the latter’s 
branch operation, Amlin Bermuda). Syndicate 
2001’s portfolio is underwritten by Amlin 
London, Amlin UK and through the Group’s 
wholly owned French coverholder, Amlin France 
(formerly known as Anglo French Underwriters 
SAS). Amlin France also writes business on 
behalf of ACI. The bias of the Group’s portfolio 
is towards short-tail property and accident risk 
but liability coverage is also underwritten. 
In underwriting insurance or reinsurance 
policies the Group’s underwriters use their skill, 
knowledge and data on past claims experience 
to evaluate the likely claims cost and therefore 
the premium that should be sufficient (across  
a portfolio of risks) to cover claims costs, 
expenses and to produce an acceptable profit. 
However, due to the nature of insurance risk 
there is no guarantee that the premium charged 
will be sufficient to cover claims costs. This 
shortfall may originate either from insufficient 
premium being calculated and charged or may 
result from an unexpected, or unprecedented, 
high level of claims.  
A number of controls are deployed to limit the 
amount of insurance exposure underwritten. 
Each year a business plan is prepared and 
agreed which is used to monitor the amount of 
premium income, and exposure, to be written  
in total and for each class of business. Progress 
against this plan is monitored during the year. 
The Group also operates under a line guide that 
determines the maximum liability per policy 
that can be written for each class (on a gross  
or net of facultative reinsurance basis) and for 
each underwriter. These limits can be exceeded 
in exceptional circumstances but only with the 
approval of senior management. Apart from  
the UK and international comprehensive motor 
liability portfolios, which have unlimited liability, 
all policies have a per loss limit which caps the 
size of any individual claim. For larger sum 
insured risks facultative reinsurance coverage 
may be purchased. The Group is also exposed 
to catastrophe losses which may impact many 
risks in a single event and again reinsurance  
is purchased to limit the impact of loss 
aggregation from such events. These reinsurance 
arrangements are described in the reinsurance 
arrangements section on page 109. 
Insurance liabilities are written through 
individual risk acceptances, reinsurance treaties 
or through facilities whereby Amlin is bound by 
other underwriting entities. Facility arrangements 
delegate underwriting authority to other 
underwriters, or to agents acting as coverholders, 
that use their judgement to write risks on our 
behalf under clear authority levels. 
The insurance liabilities underwritten by the 
Group are reviewed on an individual risk, or 
contract, basis and through review of portfolio 
performance. Claims arising are reserved upon 
notification. Each quarter the entire portfolio  
of business is subject to a reserving process 
whereby levels of paid and outstanding (advised 
but not paid) claims are reviewed. Potential 
future claims are assessed with a provision for 
incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims being 
made. This provision is subject to review by 
senior executives and an independent internal 
actuarial assessment is usually carried out by 
the in-house actuarial team to determine the 
adequacy of the provision. Whilst a detailed and 
disciplined exercise is carried out to provide for 
claims notified, it is possible that known claims 
could develop and exceed the reserves carried.  
Furthermore, there is increased uncertainty  
in establishing an accurate provision for IBNR 
claims and there is a possibility that claims may 
arise which in aggregate exceed the reserve 
provision established. This is partly mitigated  
by the reserving policy adopted by the Group 
which is to carry reserves in excess of the 
actuarial best estimate. 
The review of claims arising may result in 
underwriters adjusting pricing levels to cater for 
an unexpectedly higher trend of claims advices 
or payments. However, this may not be possible 
in a competitive market and underwriters may 
respond either by accepting business with lower 
expected profit margins or declining to renew  
policies and thus reducing income. Also, there 
is a portfolio of risk already underwritten which 
cannot be re-priced until renewal at the end of 
the policy period. 
The Group is exposed to the impact of large 
catastrophe events such as windstorms, 
earthquakes or terrorist incidents. Exposure  
to such events is controlled and measured 
through loss modelling, but the accuracy of  
this exposure analysis is limited by the quality of 
data and the effectiveness of the modelling. The 
Group’s broad risk appetite guidelines are set 
out on page 38. It is possible that a catastrophe 
event exceeds the maximum expected event 
loss. This is particularly the case for the direct 
property proportion of the loss exposure where 
models are used to calculate a damage factor 
representing the amount of damage expected 
to exposed aggregate insured values from  
a particular scenario. Errors, or incorrect 
assumptions, in the damage factor calculation 
can result in incurred catastrophe event  
claims higher, or lower, than predicted due to 
unforeseen circumstances or inadequacies in 
the models used. As explained on page 109 
reinsurance is purchased to protect against  
the impact of any individual or series of  
severe catastrophes. However, the price and 
availability of such cover is variable and the 
amount of loss retained by the Group may 
therefore also increase or reduce. The Group will 
alter its insurance and reinsurance exposures  
to take account of the change in reinsurance 
availability in order to remain within the risk 
appetite guidelines.

Catastrophe reinsurance protects insurance 
companies against catastrophic losses, such  
as windstorm or earthquake, which may impact 
more than one risk written by the client.  
This portfolio is a key part of the insurance risk 
written by the Group. Programmes are placed 
on a layered or excess of loss basis. Territorial 
exposures, from a number of programmes, are 
much higher, but are carefully recorded and 
analysed through loss simulations or realistic 
disaster scenarios.  
Per risk property reinsurance is also written  
on an excess of loss basis but covers loss or 
damage to any single risk within the reinsured’s 
portfolio. This portfolio protects insureds against 
large individual property losses and will also be 
affected by large catastrophes. 
Proportional reinsurance covers a proportional 
share of a reinsureds portfolio of business 
subject to payment of commission and/or  
profit commission. Almost all proportional 
reinsurance written by the Group in this class  
is property business and risk exposure is limited 
to US$7.5 million for any one risk.  
The portfolio of reinsurance business is written 
with the aim of achieving territorial diversification. 
However, a severe catastrophe to a major 
economic zone in Europe, Japan, Australasia  
or the USA is likely to result in an overall loss to 
the portfolio prior to retrocessional reinsurance. 
Amlin London operates to a maximum loss limit 
applicable to refined scenarios which is an 
allocation of a total Group tolerance.  
A. (ii) Other reinsurance risks

(3) Premium stated gross of acquisition costs. 
Property cover is provided to large commercial 
enterprises with high value locations and/or 
many locations, and also for small commercial 
property. The perils covered include fire, flood, 
wind and earthquake damage. Business 
interruption cover is also provided for loss  
of earnings sustained due to the perils and 
properties covered but may also be extended to 
connected enterprises. Terrorism cover is given 
on a limited basis particularly where required by 
local regulation, but nuclear and bio-chemical 
coverage is excluded in most territories.  
Direct and facultative property insurance is 
written for the full value of the risk, on a primary 
or excess of loss basis, through individual 
placements, or by way of delegated underwriting 
facilities given to coverholders (binding 
authorities). Binding authority arrangements 
delegate the day to day underwriting to 
underwriting agents working on our behalf and 
therefore, for these contracts we are reliant on 
coverholders exercising underwriting judgement 
on our behalf. Coverholders must have local 
regulatory approval, be Lloyd’s registered and 
also approved by the Amlin Binding Authority 
Committee. For all binding authorities facilities 
we receive a monthly or quarterly bordereau 
which is checked by our underwriting staff. We 
control the underwriting by setting clear authority 
levels for coverholders stipulated within the 
binding authority agreement, regularly monitoring 
performance and periodically carrying out 
underwriting visits and/or commissioning third 
party audits. The coverholder is incentivised  
to produce an underwriting profit through the 
payment of profit commission. However, with  
the day to day underwriting not controlled by  
the Group, there is a risk that coverholder 
underwriting or claim decisions are made  
which would not have been made by Amlin 
underwriters or claims staff. The maximum value 
insured under the Binders class is currently 
limited to US$3 million at any one location.   Financial statements Notes to the accounts

The property portfolio is also exposed to an 
above average frequency of individual fire, 
explosion or weather related claims. The 
premium charged for the coverage given may 
not be sufficient to cover all claims made in any 
year, particularly in a year in which there is an 
abnormal frequency of claims. This account is 
mainly situated in the USA and is therefore 
exposed to large catastrophe events such as 
California earthquake and hurricane losses.  
A. (iv) US casualty risks 
The US casualty portfolio of business provides 
insurance and reinsurance cover to individuals, 
or companies, in order to indemnify them 
against legal liability arising from their activities 
and actions or for incidents occurring on their 
property. The account is currently written to a 
maximum liability of US$6 million on any one 
claim but average lines are US$0.8 million  
on any one claim. 2010 gross premium  
was £47 million.  
The portfolio is made up of specialist general 
casualty, professional indemnity, medical 
malpractice and errors and omissions cover. 
Small amounts of directors’ and officers’ 
liability and auto liability are also written. The 
class is mostly written on a claims notified basis 
(responding to all claims made during a defined 
period) except for small amounts of general 
liability business which may be written on a 
losses occurring basis (the policy responds to 
losses which occur during the period even if 
reported after the policy has expired).  
Claims from this class emanate from 
professional error, negligence or an accident 
which causes injury, damage or financial loss. 
The account is vulnerable to a high frequency  
of claims, but not individual large losses as  
the cost to the Group of any individual claim  
is small. Claims frequency may be impacted  
by a generic claim type which impacts many 
individuals and (re)insurance policies such as 
poor housing design or bad medical practice. 
The size of many individual claims is subject to 
the decisions arising from the US court system 
which can be higher than anticipated. There is 
also the potential for US courts to impose a 
‘bad faith’ judgement on insurers if it is deemed 
that the insurer has acted improperly in trying 
to avoid contractual obligations. Such awards 
can, in exceptional circumstances, be much 
higher than the value of the insurance claim. 
A. (v) Accident and health, auto and special risks 
Syndicate 2001 also writes other property and 
casualty classes which contribute diversified 
exposure to the portfolio.

(3) Premium stated gross of acquisition costs. 
The accident and health class is written through 
medical expense schemes in the USA and direct 
personal accident cover, or personal accident 
reinsurance, worldwide. Medical expense cover 
is subject to a high frequency of claim and 
significant medical cost inflation. Personal 
accident insurance and reinsurance could be 
impacted by a single or series of accidents to 
high value insured individuals or from a multiple 
death and injury event such as an air crash or 
natural catastrophe.  
The auto class covers property damage  
only (fire, theft and collision) in the USA  
and property damage and third party motor 
liability combined cover in other international 
territories. This class could be impacted by 
unexpected claim frequency, a multi vehicle 
event such as a severe flood and also large 
bodily injury award claims emanating from  
an accident.

The hull and cargo account is worldwide, 
covering property damage to ships and loss, or 
damage, to a large variety of cargo or goods in 
transit. The hull account can include machinery 
breakdown and the account written has 
historically been targeted towards lower value 
tonnage, smaller ‘brownwater’ vessels and 
fishing boats. However, as anticipated following 
the employment of a new leading class 
underwriter in December 2009, larger ‘blue 
water’ ocean hull risks such as cruise liners, 
tankers and bulk carriers have also been 
written. These accounts can be impacted by 
attritional claims of a small size as well as a 
single individual large claim. The cargo account 
in particular could also be involved in a major 
natural catastrophe loss. In an economic 
recession, it is expected that premium income 
will fall from these areas as trade reduces and 
hull values are impacted by reduced freight 
rates. This trend has occurred in 2010 with 
reductions in the quantity and value of cargo 
shipments. It is also possible that claims 
frequency could increase due to increased 
economic pressures affecting fraud and  
theft claims. 
The energy portfolio is mainly offshore rig and 
construction policies which may be impacted by 
large individual claims from construction fault 
or property damage such as fire or explosion, 
but is also exposed to severe catastrophe losses 
in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The account 
includes control of well to limit loss of oil and 
avoid pollution and also some business 
interruption cover which indemnifies companies 
for loss of production. 
War business includes aviation, marine and  
on land terrorism coverage. The account is 
exposed to single incidents or a series of losses 
arising from concerted action. Political risk, 
confiscation and contract frustration business 
is also written.  
Specie business consists of the insurance 
against damage or theft to fine art, the contents 
of vaults and other high value goods including 
jewellers’ block and cash in transit. The fine art 
may be shown at exhibitions which have very 
high aggregate values at risk. The class is 
therefore exposed to the potential for a 
frequency of small claims and also large 
individual losses. Some specie is written in 
catastrophe zones e.g. California. 
The bloodstock account provides coverage for 
death, illness or injury to horses mainly in the 
UK. Business from the USA, Australia and 
South Africa is also written. This covers racing 
or eventing horses and breeding studs. The 
average value insured is below £1 million but 
there is the potential for an aggregate loss,   Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 106

Crowe Livestock, a leading Lloyd’s coverholder 
for the insurance of livestock, was acquired in 
November 2009. This agency writes a broad 
portfolio of protection for livestock and specialist 
products such as zoo animals, with a maximum 
line of any one policy of US$10 million. The 
company also writes employers’ liability cover for 
livestock business up to a limit of £10 million. 
Again, an event affecting several animals across 
many policies such as disease could result in a 
loss significantly higher than this.  
Yacht business covers property damage and 
third party injury for small leisure boats and 
craft. The bulk of the account is smaller value 
yachts in the UK and Europe, although there 
are a number of binders written by coverholders 
elsewhere, such as Scandinavia, Canada and 
Australia. There is an expectation of a large 
number of small claims, as average values are 
low in comparison to other claims written in  
the Group. Third party liability yacht claims 
arise from injury or damage caused by one  
of our policyholders to third parties. There is 
also the potential for a large catastrophe loss 
such as a UK windstorm where there are large 
aggregate sums insured in coastal regions  
such as southern England.  
The marine liability portfolio is written to protect 
ship-owners, harbours, charterers and energy 
companies against damage or injury to third 
parties. This includes the potential for pollution 
damage and clean up claims. The account 
could suffer a large catastrophe incident from a 
collision causing death of crew and passengers 
or an oil, or chemical, spill which could incur 
large clean up costs.  
A. (vii) Aviation risks  
The Group, through Syndicate 2001, underwrites 
direct and facultative aviation business domiciled 
in most parts of the world. Maximum lines are

limits. 
(2) Maximum line size is after business written and ceded by 
specific proportional treaties to Amlin Bermuda. 
(3) Premium stated gross of acquisition costs. 
The airline account is exposed to large claims 
arising from property damage, death or injury 
arising from aircraft accidents. The domicile  
of the airline and passengers has a notable 
influence on the cost of claims, for example  
US court awards are generally higher.  
The general aviation account covers smaller 
aircraft or cargo and covers owners or 
operators, against loss or damage and third 
party injury. The risk excess account is a book 
of general aviation reinsurance business written 
to protect a small number of insurers against 
large general aviation claims. 
Airport liability insurance covers airport 
operators, refuellers and air traffic controllers 
against losses arising from injury caused by 
their activities or occurring on their premises. 
Product liability covers manufacturers against 
accidents arising from faulty parts or equipment, 
or poor servicing of aircraft. Both airport and 
product liability coverage is written on a losses 
occurring basis meaning that claims advices 
can be made after the policy has expired. Space 
insurance covers property and liability during 
launch and the operation of satellites whilst in 
orbit for a limited period, normally of one year.  
The aviation account is subject to both small 
and large claims. Claims involving loss of life  
or serious injury to high earning passengers or 
third parties are subject to the ongoing inflation 
of court awards particularly in the US. Large 
accidents involving the potential death of 500 
or more passengers are feasible and could 
potentially result in a gross claim to the business 
of more than the vertical reinsurance 
programme if, for example, two large aircraft 
were to collide. Space losses are generally large 
single claim amounts caused by launch failure 
or operational failure in orbit. The principal 
aviation accounts are protected by a 
reinsurance programme on both a risk sharing 
(proportional) and excess of loss basis. The 
Group reinsurance arrangements are discussed 
on page 109. The space account is written with 
risks shared with Amlin Bermuda but is not 
protected by excess of loss reinsurance.

Amlin UK writes three classes of UK liability. 
The vast majority of the business emanates 
from the UK with the balance mainly from 
Ireland and Canada.  
Employers’ liability insurance protects employers 
against accident or injury to employees. This is 
written on a losses occurring basis (covering 
events that occurred in the policy period even if 
they are not notified until after expiry) for limits 
up to £27 million per employer.  
Public liability insurance provides coverage, 
often written in conjunction with employers’ 
liability, for accident or injury occurring to 
clients, customers or another third party as a 
result of contact with the insured’s personnel, 
property or products. This is written on a losses 
occurring basis currently, for limits up to  
£12 million per assured.  
Professional indemnity covers liability which 
may arise from services provided by the assured, 
for example as a result of negligence or error 
which may lead to financial or physical loss. 
This includes, but is not limited to, services 
from architects, engineers, surveyors, 
advertising firms, medical professionals and 
financial advisers and is written on a claims 
made basis (covering losses notified in the 
policy period). 
Amlin UK package policies combine one  
or more of the liability coverages, mainly 
employers’ and public liability with motor 
and/or property damage protection. Stand 
alone property protection is also written within 
this class, mainly on a 100% basis for small and 
medium commercial and household properties. 
The property owners account has continued to 
develop since the recruitment of a specialist 
underwriting team in June 2009.  Financial statements Notes to the accounts

Through AUA Insolvency Risk Services Ltd,  
an FSA registered broker, Amlin UK writes a 
portfolio of UK insolvency practitioners which 
provides protection against fraud or negligence 
committed by the practitioners and also 
protects the property assets under their 
management.  
The Group also writes a small account of 
financial institutions policies covering fidelity, 
professional indemnity and directors’ and 
officers’ liability for companies providing 
financial services. The current maximum line  
is £6 million. Approximately half of the income 
is from Western European financial institutions 
with the balance spread broadly by territory. 
Coverage is given on a claims made basis. 
The expected claims costs from these lines  
of business may be impacted by larger than 
anticipated damage awards to injured parties as 
well as due to an unforeseen increase in generic 
claims such as industrial disease or other health 
hazards. It is expected that claims frequency 
will increase during an economic downturn as 
unemployment leads to an increase in action 
against employers and people are more likely to 
seek redress for third party advice or behaviour 
which may have led to financial loss or injury.  
It is also possible that many claims could arise 
under many policies from a common cause 
such as financial advice or generic building 
defect. The financial institutions account could 
be affected by a major fraud or a series of 
related liability claims arising from banking, 
investment activity, stockbroking or other 
practices. The property portfolio could sustain  
a large loss from the effects of a UK windstorm 
or flood event. 
B. (ii) UK motor insurance risks 
Syndicate 2001’s motor insurance risk is 
predominantly UK business covering fire, theft, 
collision and third party property and bodily 
injury liability. 2010 gross premium was  
£126 million. Under the requirements of UK  
law third party liability coverage is unlimited, 
but matching reinsurance is purchased. The 
account is biased towards commercial clients 
such as coach operators, haulage companies, 
commercial vehicle fleets and company 
executive fleets. The Syndicate leads two 
facilities for fleets involved in the transportation 
of hazardous waste. A small UK agriculture and 
a specialist private car account is also written.  
Claims frequency has improved in recent years 
due to car and road safety measures but can 
fluctuate due to factors such as weather 
conditions. UK inflation is a key factor in 
determining the size of motor claims. Car 
values affect the size of theft claims and for 
physical damage claims size is linked to repair 
costs. Inflationary pressure on court awards 
within the UK and Irish legal systems impacts 
liability claim values. Government intervention 
such as liability award limit changes or expense 
recoveries for government bodies, including the 
National Health Service, will also impact claim 
size. For the motor account, severe bodily injury 
and catastrophe damage claims (e.g. UK flood) 
are limited through the purchase of a 
reinsurance programme, the highest layer  
of which is unlimited.  
Motor insurance is a highly competitive area  
of insurance and pricing levels fluctuate.  
Whilst underwriters accept business subject  
to sufficient rates per vehicle, in a year where 
there is an unexpectedly high level of claims  
the total premium may not be sufficient to 
cover all the claims. There is also a risk that 
legal changes impact bodily injury payments 
and result in a requirement to increase reserves 
for outstanding claims. 
C. Amlin France 
In May 2010 Anglo French Underwriters SAS 
(AFU) and the French operations of ACI were 
merged to form Amlin France. Prior to the 
merger AFU was the foremost managing 
general agent serving Lloyd’s in France and ACI 
had started to build a property and liability co-
insurance business in France. The merger has 
created a business with increased critical mass 
with greater recognition in the French market.  
Drawing business from a large network of 
brokers across France, Amlin France is able  
to offer a wide range of direct and facultative 
insurance products designed to respond to  
the needs of both individuals and corporate 
clients. Amlin France’s business is situated 
predominantly in France.  
Amlin France writes a diverse book of business 
on behalf of Syndicate 2001 including property, 
cargo, professional liability and specie through 
a network of more than 1,350 independent 
retail brokers. Although the vast majority of 
these risks have been written on behalf of 
Syndicate 2001, there continue to be a limited 
number of policies which do not involve the 
Group. The portfolio consists of the following 
classes with maximum and average line sizes:

In respect of property, Amlin France acts as 
both a leading underwriter and co-insurer for 
industrial high hazard risks providing material 
damage insurance for the industrial and 
commercial premises of small and medium 
sized enterprises. Amlin France also provides  
a comprehensive package, including liability 
cover for discotheques, bowling alleys, 
restaurants, bars and casinos. Perils offered 
include fire, lightning and associated risks, 
electrical damage, water damage, storm, 
tempest, hail, snow and glass breakage. 
Optional coverages include business 
interruption, indirect losses, theft from 
individuals and theft from break-ins. Building 
insurance is also offered for owners who are  
not occupiers. 
In the marine field, Amlin France provides yacht 
insurance which includes cover for damage, 
theft and liability as well as for the costs of 
marine assistance and marine personal accident. 
Worldwide stock and transit insurance is also 
provided with All Risks coverage granted on a 
start to finish basis from the point of supplier to 
the point of delivery. Transit cover includes all 
periods when the goods are stocked, in whatever 
location and without any break in coverage. 
Jeweller’s block cover is provided for high value 
contents. All risks coverage is given for stock 
within the premises, including for break-in, hold-
up, fire and water damage. Cover is also given 
for commercial retail premises such as gunsmiths, 
perfume and clothing shops and art galleries, 
including damage caused to art while on show 
at exhibitions and damage to art kept in private 
residences. A comprehensive multi-risk product is 
provided for retailers which includes an extension 
for fire and water damage within the premises, 
liability coverage and the preservation of goodwill 
or business interruption following a loss.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 108

Professional indemnity and financial guarantee 
insurance is provided to insurance and banking 
intermediaries as well as financial advisers, real 
estate agents and financial and investment 
consultants. This is a multi-layered package 
which responds to the particular needs of 
several regulated professions which may 
require differing types of cover. 
Amlin France also offers insurance for events, 
including cancellation cover, organisers’ 
liability, all risks exhibition cover and all risks 
coverage on equipment belonging to, hired by 
or installed by the assured. Amlin France also 
provides personal accident insurance for 
professions involving risk and the practice of 
sporting activities which are deemed hazardous. 
For ACI, Amlin France writes a portfolio of large 
property and liability risks. The property book  
is mostly written on a co-insurance basis for 
commercial or industrial premises. The liability 
account provides general liability coverage for 
French industrial and commercial enterprises. 
D. Amlin AG  
In October 2010 the Group re-domiciled its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Amlin Bermuda Ltd, 
from Bermuda to Switzerland following approval 
from the Swiss Financial Market Authority and 
the Bermuda Monetary Authority. The new 
Zurich-based underwriting business (trading  
as Amlin Re Europe) writes all major non-life 
reinsurance classes.  
Amlin Bermuda Ltd, which was established in 
December 2005, has become a Bermuda-based 
branch of Amlin AG. 
D. (i). Amlin Re Europe  
Amlin Re Europe underwrites property 
catastrophe, property risk, marine, liability  
and motor business on a proportional and  
non-proportional basis. The maximum line for  
all classes is €20m (20% for unlimited motor 
policies). Business is sourced from Europe  
and Israel. By January 2011 Amlin Re Europe 
had written €3.1m of income attaching to  
the 2010 underwriting year and a further  
€66m in respect of 2011.

Notes: 
(1) Premium stated gross of acquisition costs. 
Amlin Bermuda’s direct business has strong 
similarities to the portfolio of the Reinsurance 
business unit of Syndicate 2001. All of the 
business written emanates from London broker 
markets and is frequently seasoned business 
already underwritten by Syndicate 2001. Risk 
balance is provided by a whole account quota 
share of Syndicate 2001. This is further 
supplemented by a number of specific  
variable quota share treaties on short tail 
classes such as property and energy.  
Property reinsurance is written through treaty 
arrangements on a proportional, individual risk 
excess of loss, or catastrophe excess of loss 
basis. The catastrophe reinsurance portfolio  
is the largest class of insurance risk written by 
Amlin Bermuda. Exposures to each programme 
are currently limited to US$12.5 million per  
risk and US$75 million any one catastrophe 
programme. Overall catastrophe loss limits are 
applied in relation to specific scenarios as an 
allocation of total Group tolerances. The current 
highest modelled loss is US$239 million at  
1 January 2011. 
The special risks account includes small 
premium classes mostly relating to terrorism 
reinsurance but also includes nuclear, short-
term trade credit and contingency which is 
written in all parts of the world.  
The accident and health class is written through 
medical expense schemes in the USA and provides 
personal accident reinsurance worldwide. Personal 
accident reinsurance could be impacted by a 
single or series of accidents to high value insured 
individuals or from a multiple death and injury 
event such as an air crash or natural catastrophe.  
To date Amlin Bermuda has written risks with 
limited reinsurance protection and therefore it 
has higher net retained exposures to individual 
risk losses or catastrophe than the Syndicate 
currently bears. 
E. Amlin Corporate Insurance  
In July 2009 Amlin acquired Fortis Corporate 
Insurance N.V., subsequently renamed Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI), a leading 
commercial insurer operating in the Benelux. As 
described in Section C, ACI’s French operation 
was merged with Amlin France in May 2010. 
ACI writes four main classes of business:  
motor, liability, property and marine, mainly  
for commercial clients locally. Exposures are 
predominantly in Belgium, the Netherlands and 
France apart from marine transportation risks  
or where an insured has exposures overseas.  Financial statements Notes to the accounts

ACI’s property account is mainly large schedules 
of properties (e.g. for municipalities) written on 
a coinsurance basis in the Netherlands and 
larger commercial industrial clients in Belgium 
and France. The company is a leader in both 
territories. Overseas exposure is written mainly 
from the large commercial industrial portfolio 
where there are client operations overseas.  
The engineering book includes contractors  
all risks, machinery breakdown and some 
computer equipment. 
The marine portfolio covers general cargo,  
a large commodities book for Belgian trading 
corporations, hull, land equipment, builders’ 
risk (where ACI are a recognised market leader), 
inland hull and large yachts. This portfolio is 
being re-underwritten due to high loss ratios  
in some sub-classes and the mix of business  
is therefore likely to change.  
ACI also underwrites a range of marine products 
via an agency agreement with Raets Marine 
including marine liability, cargo and hull. 
The non-marine liability portfolio in the 
Netherlands is professional indemnity and 
general liability written on a claims-made basis, 
particularly for property related professions  
and miscellaneous professions such as travel 
operators. In Belgium, ACI are a recognised 
leader in medical liability and general liability  
is written on a losses occurring form. 
Across the portfolio maximum and average  
line sizes are higher for ACI than those written 
in Amlin London. This reflects the leading 
position of the company in the local industrial, 
commercial and marine markets. Furthermore, 
there is limited aggregation between this 
portfolio and catastrophe reinsurance business 
written elsewhere in the Group and all of ACI’s 
book is protected by reinsurance on a per risk 
and catastrophe excess of loss basis.  
The commercial motor account comprises  
of domestic company fleets including a large 
leasing and rental fleet written in the Netherlands 
and a smaller portfolio in Belgium. Over 70% of 
the book is cars, vans or commercial vehicles. 
There is a large underwriting agency book in  
the Netherlands. 
Captive business is written in Belgium as fronting 
for captive reinsurers of large industrial companies. 
ACI retains small amounts of these risks but 
receive a fronting fee. Analysis is carried out  
on captives to manage potential credit risk. 
Reinsurance arrangements  
Syndicate 2001 purchases proportional 
reinsurance to supplement line size and to 
reduce exposure on individual risks, notably for 
aviation and large property risks. A part of the 
premium ceded under such facilities is placed 
with Amlin Bermuda and for risks incepting 
during 2009, a separate proportional facility  
is placed for the excess of loss reinsurance 
portfolio through a Special Purpose Syndicate 
at Lloyd’s, Syndicate 6106. Syndicate 2001 
also purchases a number of excess of loss 
reinsurances to protect itself from severe 
frequency or size of losses. The structure of  
the programme and type of protection bought 
will vary from year to year depending on the 
availability and price of cover.  
On large risks, individual facultative reinsurance 
may be bought which protects against a loss to 
that specific risk. 
Specific risk excess of loss reinsurance is 
purchased for each class of business. The 
amount of cover bought depends upon the line 
size written for each class. The deductibles or 
amounts borne prior to recovery vary from class 
to class as do the amounts of co-reinsurance or 
unplaced protection. Specific programmes are 
purchased to deal with large individual risk 
losses, such as fire or large energy losses,  
and these programmes may be combined  
at a higher level into a general programme  
for larger losses. 
UK and French direct property business is now 
protected by a European wind programme 
which also protects ACI’s Dutch and French 
exposures. 
The combined claims to Syndicate 2001 from 
several losses which aggregate in a single 
catastrophe event are protected by catastrophe 
cover. A separate excess of loss on excess of 
loss programme is purchased to protect the 
excess of loss reinsurance portfolio against  
such losses. Since 2006, the amount of excess 
of loss reinsurance purchased is lower and for 
the first loss only responds to losses in excess 
of US$135 million. However, in 2010 combined 
aggregate and catastrophe protection was also 
purchased to provide some lower level cover  
in the event of multiple losses to the portfolio. 
Amlin Bermuda purchased combined aggregate 
and catastrophe excess of loss protection in 
2010 to protect its non-proportional and 
proportional treaty portfolio in excess of 
US$175 million for the first loss, although 
aggregate cover is also provided at a lower  
level for the third and additional loss excess  
of US$100 million retention. 
ACI buys a comprehensive programme for each 
class of business. Specific cover is placed for 
engineering, personal accident, motor, liability, 
energy and builders’ risks. A general programme 
is placed for the remaining marine exposures 
and the property account is protected by both 
per risk and catastrophe excess of loss, which  
is now combined with the Group’s other UK  
and French exposures. 
There is no guarantee that reinsurance coverage 
will be available to meet all potential loss 
circumstances as, for very severe catastrophe 
losses, it is possible that the full extent of the 
cover bought is not sufficient. Any loss amount 
which exceeds the programme would be retained 
by the Group. It is also possible that a dispute 
could arise with a reinsurer which reduces the 
recovery made. The reinsurance programme  
is bought to cover the expected claims arising 
on the original portfolio. However, it is possible 
for there to be a mismatch, or a gap in cover, 
which would result in a higher than expected 
retained loss. 
Many parts of the programme also have limited 
reinstatements and therefore the number of 
claims which may be recovered from second or 
subsequent major losses is limited. It is possible 
for the programme to be exhausted by a series 
of losses in one annual period and it may not be 
possible to purchase additional reinsurance at 
all or for an acceptable price. This would result 
in the Group bearing higher losses from further 
events occurring. It should also be noted that 
the renewal date of the reinsurance programmes 
does not necessarily correspond to that of  
the business written. Where business is not 
protected by risk attaching reinsurance (which 
provides coverage for the duration of all the 
policies written) this reinsurance protection 
could expire resulting in an increase in possible 
loss retained by Syndicate 2001 if renewal  
of the programme is not achieved.  
Amlin Bermuda purchased combined aggregate 
and catastrophe excess of loss protection in 2010 
to protect its non-proportional and proportional 
treaty portfolio. 
ACI buys a comprehensive programme for each 
class of business. Specific cover is placed for 
engineering, personal accident, motor, liability, 
energy and builders’ risks. A general programme 
is placed for the remaining marine exposures and 
the property account is protected by both per risk 
and catastrophe excess of loss.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 110 Amlin plc Annual Report 2010

Realistic Disaster Scenario (RDS) analysis 
The Group has a defined event risk appetite 
which determines the maximum net loss that 
the Group intends to limit its exposure with 
respect to major modelled catastrophe event 
scenarios. Currently these are a maximum of 
£165 million for Syndicate 2001 and US$330 
million for Amlin Bermuda any one zone or 
£180 million for Syndicate 2001 and US$360 
million for a multi-zonal loss. ACI operates with 
a maximum event limit of €30 million for the 
modelled European storm event and Amlin AG 
has a potential maximum of €100 million for a 
European windstorm. The Group Catastrophe 
risk team are responsible for aggregating 
potential scenarios and as at 1 January 2011 
levels of exposure are significantly below  
the potential maximum tolerances, loss from 
European windstorm scenario being £286 million 
for the Group. At present the Group is not 
utilising the full extent of its risk appetite. 
These scenarios are extraordinary events – with 
an estimated occurrence probability of less than 
1 in 100 years estimated for the natural peril or 
elemental losses. The Group also adopts risk 
appetite maximum net limits for a number  
of other non-elemental scenarios, including 
aviation collision and North Sea rig loss. 
The risk appetite policy recognises that there 
may be circumstances in which the net event 
limit could be exceeded. Such circumstances 
include changes in rates of exchange, non 
renewal or delay in renewal of reinsurance 
protection, reinsurance security failure,  
or regulatory and legal requirements.  
A detailed analysis of catastrophe exposures is 
carried out every quarter and measured against 
risk appetite. The following assumptions and 
procedures are used in the process: 
• The data used reflects the information 
supplied to the Group by insureds and 
ceding companies. This may prove to be 
incomplete, inaccurate or could develop 
during the policy period; 
• The exposures are modelled using a mixture 
of stochastic models and underwriter input 
to arrive at ‘damage factors’ – these factors 
are then applied to the assumed aggregate 
exposure to produce gross loss estimates. 
The damage factors may prove to be 
inadequate; 
• The reinsurance programme as purchased 
is applied – a provision for reinsurer 
counterparty failure is included in the 
analysis but may prove to be inadequate; 
and 
• Reinstatement premiums both payable  
and receivable are included.  
There is no guarantee that the assumptions and 
techniques deployed in calculating these event 
loss estimate figures are accurate. 
Furthermore, there could also be a loss which 
exceeds these figures. The likelihood of such a 
catastrophe is considered to be remote, but the 
most severe scenarios modelled are simulated 
events and these simulations could prove to  
be unreliable.  
Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets: 
Calculation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) 
and claims development 
Amlin adopts a rigorous process in the calculation 
of an adequate provision for insurance claim 
liabilities. The overriding aim is to establish 
reserves which are expected to be at least 
adequate and that there is consistency from 
year to year. Therefore, the level of reserves are 
set at a level above the actuarial ‘best estimate’ 
position. However, there is a risk that, due to 
unforeseen circumstances, the reserves carried 
are not sufficient to meet insurance claim 
liabilities reported in future years on policy 
periods which have expired. 
Process and methodology 
The reserving process commences with  
the proper recording and reporting of claims 
information which consists of paid and notified 
or outstanding claims. For the London market 
business information is received through 
Xchanging (the London market bureau) and,  
in the case of Amlin UK business, service 
companies, ACI and Amlin Bermuda, directly 
from brokers and policyholders. Claims records 
are maintained for each class by the underwriting 
year to which the policy incepts. For notified or 
outstanding claims, a case reserve is established 
based on the views of underwriting management 
and claims managers, using external legal or 
expert advice where appropriate. This reserve  
is expected to be sufficient to meet the claim 
payment when it is finally determined. For some 
classes of business, particularly liability business, 
settlement may be several years after the initial 
notification of the claim, as it may be subject to 
complexities or court action. For claims received 
from Xchanging, the market reserve is generally 
set by the lead underwriter, but there are 
circumstances on larger claims where Amlin  
will post higher reserves than those notified.  
To establish a provision for IBNR claims,  
the underwriting and claims teams in the UK, 
Bermuda and France use their experience and 
knowledge of the class of business to estimate 
the potential future development of each class 
for every underwriting year. ACI adopts a different 
approach with Group Actuarial producing a set 
of best estimate reserves to which local 
management add additional prudence based on 
their knowledge of the business. Statistics are 
used in all cases to fully recognise the different 
potential development of each class of business. 
The development period varies by class, by  
method of acceptance and is also determined 
by the deductible of each policy written. For 
casualty business, the policy form will determine 
whether claims can be made on a claims made 
(as advised) or on a losses occurring (determined 
by date of loss) basis. This has a significant 
impact on the reporting period in which claims 
can be notified. In setting the IBNR provision 
estimates are made for the ultimate premium 
and ultimate gross claims value for each 
underwriting year. Allowance is then made for 
anticipated reinsurance recoveries to reach a 
net claim position. Reinsurance recoveries are 
calculated for outstanding and IBNR claims, 
sometimes through the use of historical 
recovery rates or statistical projections, and 
provisions are made as appropriate for bad debt 
or possible disputes. The component of ultimate 
IBNR provision estimates and reinsurance 
recoveries that relates to future events 
occurring to the existing portfolio is removed in 
order to reflect GAAP accounting practice. 
To assist with the process of determining  
the reserves, triangulation statistics for each class 
are produced which show the historical 
development of premium, as well as paid and 
incurred losses, for each underwriting year, from 
inception to the date of review. ACI has similar 
statistics based on the date of premium receipt 
and claim advice rather than policy inception. 
Each class triangulation is also independently 
analysed by the internal actuarial team using 
actuarial software as appropriate. The aim of the 
actuarial exercise is to produce ‘best estimate’ 
ultimate premium and claims amounts which can 
be compared to, or used to produce, the figures 
proposed by divisional management. Amlin 
London, Amlin UK, Amlin France and ACI 
meetings are held in which executive 
management, actuarial staff and business 
management discuss claims issues and analyse 
the proposed and independently generated 
reserves to conclude the provision to be carried.  
For Amlin Bermuda, which commenced 
underwriting in 2005, historical statistics for 
Syndicate 2001’s relevant classes of business 
have been used as a guide for actuarial review 
in addition to Amlin Bermuda’s own data and the 
review discussion is conducted in conference or 
by email correspondence. 
Final reserve submissions are provided for the 
approval of Boards, as required. 
Areas of uncertainty 
The reserves established can be more or less 
than adequate to meet eventual claims arising. 
The level of uncertainty varies significantly from 
class to class but can arise from inadequate case 
reserves for known large losses and catastrophes 
or from inadequate provision for IBNR. The 
impact on profit before tax of a +/- 1% variation 
in the total net claims reserves would be +/- 
£22.5 million (2009: £20.1 million).

Large loss case reserves are determined through 
careful analysis of the individual claim, often with 
the advice of legal advisers. Liability claims arising 
from events such as the 11 September 2001 
terrorist attacks in the US are examples of 
cases where there continues to be some 
uncertainty over the eventual value  
of claims.  
Property catastrophe claims, such as earthquake 
or hurricane losses, can take several months,  
or years, to develop as adjusters visit damaged 
property and agree claim valuations. Until all 
the claims are settled it requires an analysis of 
the area damaged, contracts exposed and the 
use of models to simulate the loss against the 
portfolio of exposure in order to arrive at an 
estimate of ultimate loss to the Group. There is 
uncertainty over the adequacy of information 
and modelling of major losses for a period  
of several months after a catastrophe loss. 
Account should also be taken of factors which 
may influence the size of claims such as 
increased inflation or a change in law.  
The long tail liability classes, for which a large 
IBNR has to be established, represent the most 
difficult classes to reserve because claims  
are notified and settled several years after  
the expiry of the policy concerned. This is 
particularly the case for US liability written  
on a losses occurring basis. 
The use of historical development data, adjusted 
for known changes to wordings or the claims 
environment, is fundamental to reserving these 
classes. It is used in conjunction with the advice 
of lawyers and third party claims adjusters on 
material single claims. 
The allocation of IBNR to the reinsurance 
programme is an uncertain exercise as there  
is limited knowledge of the size or number  
of future claims advices. The assumption over 
future reinsurance recoveries may be incorrect 
and unforeseen disputes could arise which would 
reduce recoveries made. 
Dynamic financial analysis (DFA) modelling of risk 
To improve our risk management capability, 
and our assessment of capital requirements, 
Amlin has developed a stochastic model covering 
all entities of the Group. This enables standalone 
modelling for each entity as well as a consolidated 
Group total position. Amlin is now currently 
working to incorporate Amlin Re Europe into 
this model. The output from the model includes 
a distribution of outcomes from reserves for 
prior written liabilities, investment performance, 
and new business underwriting performance. 
The result is a combined view of the expected 
best estimate mean profitability and the range 
of possibilities around it.  
The model requires the input of a large number 
of explicit parameters. Those inputs are based 
on many different sources of information 
including detailed historical data on premium 
and claims, forecast income and exposures, 
estimated rating levels and catastrophe loss 
data from proprietary models applied to Amlin’s 
portfolio. It enables projection of an estimated 
mean ultimate loss ratio and the distribution of 
results around it. The model explicitly recognises 
diversification credit, since class results are  
not all strongly correlated and thus individual 
classes are unlikely to all produce losses (or 
profits) in the same year. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty of predicting the key drivers of 
business performance, including in particular 
claims levels, any individual simulation of the 
model viewed in isolation cannot be relied upon 
as an accurate forecast. However, the output 
from many thousands of simulated results can 
provide a picture of the possible distribution of 
insurance business results. This output is useful 
in developing an understanding of the losses 
which may be borne by the business at varying 
levels of probability. 
There are a large number of uncertainties and 
difficulties in achieving accurate results from 
the model. Some of the key issues are: 
• The model is based on a best estimate view 
of business volumes and rate expectations, 
which may not be borne out in practice; 
• A significant change in the portfolio of 
business could result in the past not being  
a reliable guide to the future; 
• Changing external environmental factors 
may not be assessed accurately; 
• Model risk may be significant in such  
a complex and developing discipline; 
• Key assumptions over levels of correlation 
between classes may over time prove to  
be incorrect; and 
• Catastrophe model inputs, which estimate the 
severity and frequency of large catastrophes 
on the portfolio, may be incorrect. 
The result reproduced in the table below 
represents the modelled loss sustained by  
the business from a single 1 in 200 bad year 
i.e. at the 0.5 percentile. This probability is the 
calculation benchmark required by the FSA  
and Lloyd’s. However, it does not represent  
the level of capital required for Amlin to support 
current and expected business levels, which 
should be considered over a longer period of 
modelling. Furthermore, Amlin is required to 
carry higher levels of capital which are sufficient  
in the eyes of rating agencies and clients. This 
analysis includes our modelling of the Group, 
including the ACI portfolio of assets and 
liabilities. The parameterisation of the ACI 
portfolio is at a relatively immature stage and 
therefore the contribution of this element may 
develop as our understanding improves. For the 
new European reinsurance portfolio written by 
Amlin Re Europe, modelling is at an early stage 
and will develop significantly over the next five 
years.

The Group’s net aggregate reserve releases from all prior years amounted to £156.5 million (2009: £174.1 million). In part, this arises from the Group’s 
reserving philosophy which aims to make the most recent years, with the greatest uncertainty of result, prudently reserved leaving a potential for 
subsequent release. 
This differs from the £126.9 million stated in the claims development table above as the table above is on an underwriting year basis and the surpluses 
in this narrative are on an annually accounted basis. The table above excludes any net aggregate reserve releases from 2002 and prior years. Also the 
table above excludes ACI, which is accounted for on an accident year basis and for which net reserve releases are £43.4 million (2009: £16.4 million). 
The ACI table also excludes any net aggregate reserve releases from 2002 and prior years. 
Further details on these reserve releases and other aspects of the underwriting performance are included in the Performance Section of this Annual Report.

3.2 Financial investment risk 
Market risk 
Risk management 
The following section describes the Group’s investment risk management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  
The Group has two main categories of assets: 
• Underwriting assets. These are premiums received and held to meet future insurance claims.  
• Capital assets. These are the capital required by the regulators to support the underwriting business plus working capital and surplus funds. 
Apart from the outstanding borrowings, these assets do not have specific current liabilities attached to them.  
Investment governance 
The Group manages its investments in accordance with investment frameworks that are set by the Boards of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries. These 
frameworks determine investment governance and the investment risk tolerance. They are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the Boards’ 
fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities are being met. Day to day management of the investments is delegated to the Investment Management 
Executive or members of the relevant subsidiary’s executive, who are advised by the Chief Investment Officer.  
The Investment Management Executive comprises the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Chief Investment Officer, and meets at least 
quarterly to consider whether the strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation ranges are appropriate to optimise investment returns within 
the risk tolerances set by the Boards. Group Investments, led by the Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for tactical asset allocation and the 
appointment of external investment managers and custodians. 
The Investment Advisory Panel, which consists of external investment professionals as well as members of the Investment Management Executive, 
meets quarterly. The Panel provides challenges to the Group’s view of future economic activity and asset class performance. In addition, Group 
Compliance and external lawyers provide advice on investment regulations. 
Risk tolerance 
Investment risk tolerances are set by the Board of Amlin Plc and its subsidiaries. The investment process is driven from the risk tolerance which is 
determined by reference to factors such as the underwriting cycle and the requirements of the capital providers. In a hard underwriting market capital 
preservation is paramount in order to support the insurance business and, therefore, the risk tolerance for the capital assets will be low. Conversely, 
the risk tolerance for the underwriting assets under these circumstances will be relatively high due to the strong cash flow. In a soft underwriting 
market the opposite applies.  
Investment risk is independently monitored by the Risk Assessment and Monitoring department using a bespoke investment risk model. The Head of 
Investment Risk reports regularly to the Investment Management Executive and to the Group Risk Committee. 
Strategic asset allocation 
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries has its own strategic asset allocations which are set according to its risk tolerance and liabilities. 
The strategic asset allocation for capital assets are set by using a Value at Risk (VaR
(1)
) model, to determine the optimum asset allocation for the current 
risk tolerance which ensures that appropriate solvency levels are maintained.  
The expected timescale for future cash flows in each currency is calculated by the Group Actuarial team. The average durations are the neutral position 
for the strategic asset allocation for the policyholders’ funds.  
Tactical ranges around these strategic asset allocations provide flexibility to ensure that an appropriate risk/reward balance is maintained in changing 
investment markets.  
(1) VaR is a statistical measure, which calculates the possible loss over a year, in normal market conditions. As VaR estimates are based on historical market data  
this should not be viewed as an absolute gauge of the level of risk to the investments.

Investment management 
The investments are run on a multi-asset, multi-manager basis. Exposure to the asset classes is achieved using physical or derivative instruments and 
may be managed by Group Investments or by outsourced managers, on a segregated, pooled or commingled basis
(2)
. The manager selection is based 
on a range of criteria that leads to the expectation that they will add value to the funds over the medium to long-term. The managers have discretion to 
manage the funds on a day-to-day basis within investment guidelines or prospectuses applicable to their funds that ensure that they comply with the 
investment frameworks. The managers’ performance, compliance and risk are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Valuation risk  
The Group’s earnings are directly affected by changes in the valuations of the investments held in the portfolios. These valuations vary according to  
the movements in underlying markets. Factors affecting markets include changes in the economic and political environment, risk appetites, liquidity, 
interest rates and exchange rates. These factors have an impact on the Group’s investments and are taken into consideration when setting strategic 
and tactical asset allocations. The price of holdings can also vary due to specific risks, such as the corporate strategy and companies’ balance sheet 
structure, which may impact the value of individual equity and corporate bond holdings. This is mitigated by holding diversified portfolios.  
Group assets are marked to market at bid price. Prices are supplied by the global custodian whose pricing processes are covered by their published 
annual audits. In accordance with their pricing policy, prices are sourced from three market recognised pricing vendor sources including: FT Interactive, 
Bloomberg and Reuters. These pricing sources use closing trades, or where more appropriate in illiquid markets, pricing models. These prices are 
reconciled to the fund managers’ records to check for reasonableness. Mark to market valuations for over the counter derivatives are supplied by  
the custodian and checked to the relevant counterparty and Bloomberg. Property funds are based on the most recent price available, which in some 
instances may be a quarter in arrears. Where a property transaction has taken place the transaction price is used if it is the most recent price available.  
As an additional check, where available, prices as at 31 December 2010 have been verified by the Group using available quoted prices on Bloomberg 
to verify that the prices used are a good estimation for fair value. A month to month price check was completed to ensure that any stale prices, defined 
as prices which are one month old or more, are identified and investigated. As at 31 December 2010 no stale prices were identified. Further details on 
the fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities are included in note 3.3.

Interest rate risk  
Investors’ expectations for interest rates will impact bond yields
(3)
. Therefore, the value of the Group’s bond holdings is subject to fluctuation as bond 
yields rise and fall. If yields fall the capital value will rise, and vice versa. The sensitivity of the price of a bond is indicated by its duration
(4)
. The greater 
the duration of a security, the greater its possible price volatility. Typically, the longer the maturity of a bond the greater its duration. The maturity 
bands of the Group’s bond holdings at year end are shown below.

Capital Partners LLP. 
The duration of underwriting assets is set with reference to the duration of the underlying liabilities. It should be noted that the liabilities are not currently 
discounted and therefore their value is not impacted by interest rate movements. Cash is raised, or the duration of the portfolio reduced, if it is believed  
that yields may rise and therefore capital values will fall.  
The average durations of the bond and cash portfolios for the underwriting assets and associated insurance liabilities of Syndicate 2001, Amlin AG  
and ACI at year end were as follows:

Note: The table above includes pooled investments. 
The asset durations above are calculated by the custodian. Some differences occur between custodian durations and those reported by the fund 
managers due to the use of different prepayment assumptions. Using fund manager calculations for 31 December 2010, the following asset year 
durations would result: sterling 0.2; US dollars 0.4; euro 1.6; and Canadian dollars 2.5. As an additional check, where available, durations as at  
31 December 2010 have been verified by the Group using Bloomberg data. In all instances, the duration differences are within the ranges permitted  
by the investment guidelines. Liabilities durations are calculated by the Group actuarial team.

(3) The yield is the rate of return paid if a security is held to maturity. The calculation is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity and the market price. It assumes coupon interest  
paid over the life of the security is reinvested at the same rate. 
(4) The duration is the weighted average maturity of the security’s cash flows, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights.

Foreign exchange risk 
Underwriting assets are held in the base currencies of sterling, euros, US dollars and Canadian dollars, which represent the majority of the Group’s 
liabilities by currency, thus limiting the underwriting foreign exchange rate risk. However, foreign exchange exposure does arise when business is 
written in non-base currencies. These transactions are converted into sterling, euro, US dollars and Canadian dollars (depending where the business is 
written) at the prevailing spot rate once the premium is received. Consequently, there is exposure to currency movements between the exposure being 
written and the premium being converted. Payments in non-base currencies are converted back into the policy currency at the time a claim is to be 
settled, therefore, the Group is exposed to exchange rate risk between the claim being made and the settlement being paid. If a liability in a currency 
not listed above is considered to be sufficiently large following a major event, for example such as the 2010 New Zealand earthquake, that currency  
will be bought and held to cover the potential liability. 
Further foreign exchange risk arises until non-sterling profits or losses are converted into sterling. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by converting the 
subsidiaries’ non-base currency profits into the base currency. Given the inherent volatility in some business classes, a cautious approach is adopted  
on the speed and level of sales, but the Group seeks to extinguish all currency risk on earned profit during the second year after the commencement  
of each underwriting year. This approach avoids the inherent dangers of ‘lumpier’ sales. It is not the intention to take speculative currency positions  
in order to make currency gains.

At 31 December 2010 the investment managers held some forward foreign exchange contracts in their portfolios to hedge non-base currency investments. 
These were transacted with banks with a short-term rating of at least A1 and are marked to market in investment valuations.  
The Group is subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of the translation into sterling of Group companies balance sheets that have a non-sterling 
functional currency. At 31 December 2010 the material balance sheets that have a non-sterling functional currency were Amlin AG’s Bermuda branch 
with net assets of US$1,573.9 million and Amlin Corporate Insurance with net assets of €320.5 million (2009: US$1,580.6 million and €316.6 million). 
Foreign exchange gains and losses on investments in overseas subsidiaries are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. The gain taken to reserves for the year ended 31 December 2010 was £17.6 million (2009: £92.8 million loss). 
This reflects the movement in the US dollar rate from 1.61 at the start of the year to 1.56 at the balance sheet date and the movement in the euro rate 
from 1.13 at the start of the year to 1.17 at the balance sheet date. In order to mitigate the impact of these currency fluctuations, the Group adopts  
a policy of hedging up to 50% of the net currency exposure resulting from these subsidiaries using options that were accounted for as hedges of  
net investment in overseas subsidiaries in line with the hedge accounting rules of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
Consequently all realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on the hedging instruments are taken to reserves to match the underlying 
movement in the valuation of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries, which includes applicable fair value adjustments and goodwill. At the  
year end, hedges were in place for US$729.0 million and €204.0 million. These were in the form of long sterling calls/US dollar puts funded by  
short sterling puts/US dollar calls and long sterling calls/euro puts funded by short sterling puts/euro calls. The net valuation of these trades was  
a £1.4 million asset (2009: £7.0 million asset) at the year end. The net realised and unrealised loss from hedging options recognised in reserves  
was £4.2 million (2009: £29.3 million gain) at the year end.

If the USD/GBP exchange rate were to deteriorate/improve by 10%, the movement in the net underwriting assets and liabilities and borrowings of the 
Group, excluding overseas subsidiaries, would result in a £13.7 million foreign exchange gain or £12.5 million loss in the Group income statement at 
31 December 2010. If the EUR/GBP exchange rate were to deteriorate/improve by 10%, the movement in the net underwriting assets and liabilities 
and borrowings of the Group, excluding overseas subsidiaries, would result in a £3.9 million foreign exchange gain or £3.5 million loss in the Group 
income statement at 31 December 2010. 
In relation to translation of overseas subsidiaries, the same exchange rate improvement would result in a decrease of £127.3 million in exchange gain 
through consolidated reserves. This decrease would be offset by a valuation gain of £36.0 million on the hedges in place. The same exchange rate 
deterioration would result in an additional £128.2 million exchange gain through consolidated reserves. This gain would be offset by a valuation loss  
of £34.4 million on the hedges in place.  
Liquidity risk 
It is important that the Group’s companies can pay their obligations as they fall due. Levels of cash are therefore managed on a daily basis and buffers 
of liquid assets are held in excess of the immediate requirements. This is to reduce the risk of being forced sellers of any of the Group’s assets, which 
may result in realising prices below fair value, especially in periods of below normal investment market liquidity.  
The Group funds its insurance liabilities with a portfolio of cash and debt securities exposed to market risk. The following table indicates the contractual 
timing of cash flows arising from assets and liabilities for management of insurance contracts as of 31 December 2010:

Liquidity, in the event of a major disaster, is tested regularly using internal cash flow forecasts and realistic disaster scenarios. In addition pre-arranged 
revolving credit facilities are available from bank facilities (note 27). If a major insurance event occurs the investment strategy is reviewed to ensure 
that sufficient liquidity is also available in the assets.  
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that the Group becomes exposed to loss if a specific counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations in a timely manner 
impacting the Group’s ability to meet its claims as they fall due. Credit risk can also arise from underlying causes that have an impact upon the 
creditworthiness of all counterparties of a particular description or geographical location. The Group is exposed to credit risk in its investment portfolio 
and with its premium and reinsurance receivables. The table below shows the breakdown at 31 December 2010 of the exposure of the bond portfolio 
and reinsurance receivables by credit quality

Insurance and reinsurance 
The table also shows the total value of premium receivables, representing amounts due from policyholders. The quality of these receivables is not 
graded, but based on historical experience there is limited default risk relating to these amounts. Premium credit risk is managed through a number  
of controls that include broker approval, annual financial review and internal rating of brokers and regular monitoring of premium settlement performance. 
The reinsurance receivables represent the amounts due at 31 December 2010 as well as amounts expected to be recovered on unpaid outstanding 
claims (including IBNR) in respect of earned and unearned risks. Reinsurance receivables are stated net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.  
The credit risk in respect of reinsurance receivables is primarily managed by review and approval of reinsurance security by the Group’s Reinsurance 
Security Committee, prior to the purchase of the reinsurance contract. Guidelines are set, and monitored, that restrict the purchase of reinsurance 
security based on the Group’s own ratings for each reinsurer and Standard & Poor’s ratings. The Group holds collateral from certain reinsurers 
including those that are non-rated. At 31 December 2010 the Group held collateral of £124.5 million as security against potential default by reinsurance 
counterparties (2009: £75.8 million). Provisions are made against the amounts due from certain reinsurers, depending on the age of the debt and the 
current rating assigned to the reinsurer. The impact on profit before tax of a 1% variation in the total reinsurance receivables would be £4.4 million 
(2009: £4.7 million). The details of overdue reinsurance assets and insurance receivables are provided in notes 18 and 19. 
Investments 
As well as failure of a counterparty to perform its contractual obligations, the price of corporate bond holdings will be affected by investors’ perception 
of a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit risk within the investment funds is managed through: restrictions on the exposures by credit rating, as 
determined by the rating agencies, the credit research carried out by the investment managers and by holding diversified portfolios. £2.5 million  
of bonds held at 31 December 2010 were subject to downgrades during the year (2009: £26.5 million).  
The Group’s largest non-government counterparty as at 31 December 2010, excluding liquidity funds, was valued at £46.8 million.

3.3 Fair value methodology 
For financial instruments carried at fair value we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: 
• Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is one in which transactions for the 
asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide readily and regularly available quoted prices.  
• Level 2 – Inputs to a valuation model other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
• Level 3 – Inputs to a valuation model for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) and are 
significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable 
inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement 
date (or market information for the inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions it is considered that 
market participants would use in pricing the asset. 
Shares and other variable yield securities 
Listed equities traded on a primary exchange are classified as Level 1. Unlisted equities are valued using internal models, based principally upon 
management’s assumptions, and are classified as Level 3.  
Debt and other fixed income securities 
The fair value is based upon quotes from pricing services where available. These pricing services derive prices based on an average of quotes provided 
by brokers. Where multiple quotes are not available, the fair value is based upon evaluated pricing services, which typically use proprietary cash flow 
models and incorporate observable market inputs, such as credit spreads, benchmark quotes and other trade data. If such services do not provide 
coverage of the asset, then fair value is determined manually using indicative broker quotes, which are corroborated by recent market transactions  
in similar or identical assets.  
Where there is an active market for these assets and their fair value is the unadjusted quoted market price, these are classified as Level 1. This is 
typically the case for government bonds. Level 1 also includes exchange-traded bond funds, where fair value is based upon quoted market prices  
and the funds are actively traded. Where the market is inactive or the price is adjusted, but significant market observable inputs have been used  
by the pricing sources, then these are considered to be Level 2 inputs. This is typically the case for government agency debt, corporate debt,  
mortgage and asset backed securities and catastrophe bonds. Certain assets, for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable, are  
classified as Level 3. 
Property funds 
The fair value is based upon valuations provided by the fund manager. The inputs into that valuation are primarily unobservable and, as such, these 
assets are classified as Level 3. 
Participation in investment pools 
These are investment funds and the value is based upon unadjusted, quoted and executable prices provided by the fund manager. These are classified 
as Level 1, except where there is evidence these are not being actively traded at the fund manager’s price. 
 
Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 124 Financial statements Notes to the accounts
 
 
 
 
Derivatives 
Listed derivative contracts, such as futures, that are actively traded are valued using quoted prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as 
Level 1. Over-the-counter currency options are valued by the counterparty using quantitative models with multiple market inputs. The market inputs  
are observable and the valuation can be validated through external sources. These are classified as Level 2. Certain derivatives for which prices or  
other market inputs are unobservable, are classified as Level 3. This is typically the case for catastrophe swaps.

The presentation of the fair value hierarchy in 2009 has been improved to enhance comparability with 2010. This has resulted in a gross up of debt

are already shown separately in the notes to the accounts. This change in presentation has no impact on the primary financial statements.

The majority of the Group’s investments are valued based on quoted market information or other observable market data. The Group holds 2.2% 
(2009: 3.7%) of its assets at a fair value based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments. Where estimates are used, these are based on a 
combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. While such 
valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would 
not change the fair value significantly.

The majority of the Group’s investments are valued based on quoted market information or other observable market data. The Group holds 2.2% 
(2009: 3.7%) of its assets at a fair value based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments. Where estimates are used, these are based on a 
combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. While such 
valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would 
not change the fair value significantly.

4. Segmental reporting  
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the management information reviewed by the Board of Directors of the 
Company that are used to make strategic decisions. All operating segments used by management meet the definition of a reportable segment  
under International Financial Reporting Standard 8 ‘Operating Segments’ (IFRS 8).  
The Group is organised into six operating segments. Segments represent the distinct units through which the Group is organised and managed.  
These segments are as follows: 
• Amlin London, consisting of the Reinsurance, Property & Casualty, Marine and Aviation business units, underwritten via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin UK, underwriting commercial insurance in the UK domestic market, also via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin France, which writes a diverse book of specialty business in France, via Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Corporate Insurance; 
• Amlin Bermuda, which writes predominantly property reinsurance business, including reinsurance ceded by Syndicate 2001. 
• Amlin Corporate Insurance, a leading provider of corporate property and casualty insurance in the Netherlands and Belgium; and 
• Other corporate companies, comprising all other entities of the Group including holding companies. 
Transactions between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to the Board of Directors is measured  
in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. Revenues are allocated based on the country in which the insurance contracts are issued. 
Management considers its external customers to be the individual policyholders, and as such the Group is not reliant on any individual customer. 
Segmental information provided to the Board of Directors of the Company for the reportable segments of the Group is as follows:

Underwriting profits and losses are recognised in the technical account on an annual accounting basis, recognising the results in the period in  
which they are earned. UK corporation tax on Syndicate 2001’s underwriting result is charged in the period in which the underwriting profits  
are actually paid by the Syndicate to the corporate member subsidiary. 
Deferred tax is provided on the underwriting result with reference to the forecast ultimate result of each of the years of account. Where this is  
a taxable loss, deferred tax is only provided on the movement on that year of account to the extent that forecasts show that the taxable loss will  
be utilised in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax (before netting off) has been provided on the underwriting result for this accounting period of  
£68.9 million (2009: £96.5 million). 
Reconciliation of tax expense 
The UK standard rate of corporation tax is 28.0% (2009: 28.0%), whereas the tax charged for the year ended 31 December 2010 as a percentage  
of profit before tax is 14.4% (2009: 10.7%). The reasons for this difference are explained below:

The Group’s Bermudian reinsurance subsidiary, Amlin Bermuda Ltd, was re-domiciled to Switzerland during the year. The company was subsequently 
re-named Amlin AG, with a new division, Amlin Re Europe, operating in Switzerland and the Bermuda business operating as a Bermudian branch.  
The Group’s tax provision for 2010 has been prepared on the basis that both Amlin AG and Amlin Bermuda Holdings Ltd are non-UK resident for  
UK corporation tax purposes and are exempt from the UK controlled foreign company regime. The corporation tax rate for profits earned by Amlin 
Bermuda Holdings Ltd and the Bermudian branch of Amlin AG is currently nil% (2009: nil%). The combined rate which is applicable to profits arising  
for the Zurich operation only, of Swiss cantonal and federal taxes is 21.2%. 
Deferred tax has been provided for at the local tax rate in force when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The tax rates used are: 
• UK – 27% (2009: 28%), with the exception of temporary differences expected to reverse in 2011 for which a tax rate of 27.25% has been applied; 
• Netherlands – 25.0% (2009: 25.5%); 
• Bermuda – nil% (2009: nil%); and 
• Switzerland – 21.2% (2009: n/a). 
The UK tax rate applied for deferred tax purposes (27.0%) was enacted in July 2010. Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate have been 
announced, which will ultimately reduce the corporation tax rate to 24.0% on 1
 
April 2014. However, these subsequent reductions have not yet been 
enacted or substantively enacted and therefore the rate at which deferred tax is provided remains 27.0%. An estimate of the impact of the future 
reduction in the UK corporation tax rate can be found in note 39 Subsequent events. 
The Group is subject to US tax on US underwriting profits. No provision has been made in respect of such tax arising in 2010 (2009: £nil) as any  
net provision is likely to be immaterial.

15. Net foreign exchange (losses)/gains 
The Group recognised net foreign exchange losses of £12.3 million (2009: £5.4 million net gain) in the income statement during the year. 
The Group writes business in many currencies and although a large proportion of the Group’s balance sheet assets and liabilities are matched, 
minimising the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s result, it is not possible, or practical, to match exactly all assets  
and liabilities in currency. Accounting standards also require that certain classes of assets and liabilities be translated at different rates (see  
foreign currency translation accounting policy).  
Included within the Group’s foreign exchange (losses)/gains in the income statement are:

In connection with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of ACI, the Group adjusted claims reserves and related reinsurance recoveries to  
fair value on acquisition. The reduction to the original carrying value of £39.1 million and £6.4 million to claims reserves and reinsurance recoveries 
respectively is being recognised through a charge to the income statement over the period the claims are settled. This net charge is £3.3 million  
in 2010 (2009: net charge £0.6 million). 
The fair value was based on the present value of the expected cash flows with consideration for the uncertainty inherent in both the timing of, and  
the ultimate amount of, future payments for losses and receipts of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. The nominal amounts were discounted to 
their present value using an applicable risk-free discount rate.  
The total reinsurers’ share of claims reserves and unearned premium reserves is set out in the table below: 
 
2010
£m
2009

Reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities 454.4 481.5
Less provision for impairment of receivables from reinsurers (16.0) (7.6)
Reinsurance assets 438.4 473.9
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a quarterly basis by reviewing counterparty payment history and credit grades provided by 
rating agencies. The credit ratings of the Group’s reinsurance assets are shown in note 3.2. As at 31 December 2010 reinsurance assets at a nominal value 
of £4.0 million (2009: £3.1 million) were greater than 3 months overdue and provided for to the value of £4.0 million (2009: £3.1 million). The Group 
holds collateral of £124.5 million (2009: £75.8 million) in relation to reinsurance assets.  
The Group has recognised a total impairment loss of £20.0 million (2009: £25.6 million) on reinsurance assets and insurance receivables. 
The carrying amounts disclosed are reasonably approximate to the fair value at the reporting date.

Receivables arising from reinsurance contracts are comprised principally of amounts recoverable from reinsurers in respect of paid claims and premium 
receivables on inward reinsurance business, including reinstatement premium. 
The Group assesses its insurance and reinsurance receivables for impairment on a quarterly basis by reviewing counterparty payment history.  
As of 31 December 2010 insurance and reinsurance receivables at a nominal value of £117.2 million (2009: £108.5 million) were greater than  
3 months overdue and provided for on the basis of credit rating to the value of £24.2 million (2009: £5.5 million).  
The carrying amounts disclosed above are reasonably approximate to the fair value at the reporting date.

Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V Netherlands business does not currently produce an ageing report for insurance receivables due to the interaction of local 
market practice and the office’s internal systems. The total level of insurance receivables in the Netherlands is £68.1 million (2009: £65.0 million). 
Other receivables comprise principally of amounts receivable from investment managers for financial investments sold, input VAT and other sundry debtors.

Syndicate participations represent the ongoing rights to trade on Syndicate 2001 within the Lloyd’s insurance market.  
Goodwill and the asset in relation to Syndicate participations are considered to have an indefinite life. As such, they are tested for impairment annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation 
and business segment. The intangible asset relating to the syndicate participations supports the underwriting in Amlin London, Amlin UK and Amlin 
France. Given the nature of the participation rights, it is not practical to split this asset between the three CGUs. Accordingly, impairment testing has 
been performed based on aggregate Syndicate 2001 profit forecasts.  
The analysis of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU is shown below:

When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. Value in use is calculated for each 
CGU using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted at an 
appropriate discount rate. 
Key assumptions used in the calculation are: 
• Budgeted operating profit for an initial 5 year period for Amlin London and a 4 year period for Amlin France and Amlin Corporate Insurance 
represents the operating profit in the business plans. As such this reflects the best estimate of future profits based on historical trends and 
expected growth rates. The most significant assumptions used to derive the operating profit include our assessment of the market cycle, 
retention rates, claims inflation, outwards reinsurance expenditure and long-term investment return. 
• In order to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period, a long-term average growth rate of 2.5% has been assumed  
for all CGUs. 
• A risk adjusted post-tax discount rate of 8.0%, has been applied to each CGU’s cash flow projection. 
The results of this exercise indicate that the recoverable amount exceeds in each case the intangible’s carrying value and would not be sensitive  
to reasonable possible changes in assumptions.  
Computer software represents the costs that the Group has incurred on internally developed software relating to a new underwriting platform  
for Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. This software will be amortised over ten years from the date that it is completed. 
The Group acquired the trade and assets of a United Kingdom insolvency practitioners’ insurance business from Lockton, Inc during the year and 
capitalised the existing customer relationships of the business (see note 38). This intangible is being amortised over 13 years. Broker and customer

Assumptions 
The weighted average share price of Amlin plc throughout the year was 397.59 pence per share (2009: 358.15 pence per share).  
The ‘Black Scholes’ option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants and share awards listed above.  
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 
2010 2009
Weighted average share price on grant (pence) 249.63 227.19
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 194.21 189.09
Expected volatility 30.00% 30.00%
Expected life (years) 3.00 – 7.50 3.00 – 7.50
Risk free rate of return 2.00% – 5.00% 2.00% – 5.00%
Expected dividend yield 2.00% – 7.00% 2.00% – 7.00%
Volatility 
The volatility of the Amlin share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price. In estimating 
30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered. As a guide to the reasonableness of the volatility 
estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlin’s peer group. 
Interest rate 
The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields. 
Dividend yield 
The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year. 
Staff turnover 
The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades. Furthermore historical evidence suggests 
that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier. In addition, 
senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.  
Market conditions 
The Group issues options that include targets for the Group’s performance against a number of market and non-market conditions. Failure to meet 
these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable. In some circumstances no options may be exercised. Assumptions are made about the 
likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant. 
ii) Cash-settled scheme 
The Group rewards senior underwriters through payments under the Capital Builder Plan (the Plan) if they achieve performance below the target loss 
ratio for their class(es) of business or business area over the five year period of each award under the Plan. Under the scheme rules, the Group has the 
option to settle the awarded bonus in the shares of the Company as an alternative to cash payment. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, 
the Plan is deemed to be a cash-settled share-based payment arrangement.  
Provision for payments of an award under the Plan is calculated every year where actual profits exceed the target profit on a cumulative basis over the 
performance period to date under the Plan. The rate of accrual for each five year performance period is determined at the start of the period reflecting 
the share of the excess return payable and committed under the terms of the Plan. 
Under this approach, the services received and the related liability are recognised as the services are rendered, in that the liability at any point in time 
for the Plan reflects the level of actual performance by underwriters in relation to the target.  
The carrying amount and the intrinsic value of the liability under this Plan at the end of 2010 is £8.7 million (2009: £8.9 million) and included in note 
26 for other payables. 
25. Restricted assets 
At 31 December 2010, Syndicate 2001 holds gross assets of £2,821.0 million (2009: £2,705.6 million) which are held within individual trust funds  
and the Group cannot obtain or use them until such time as each Syndicate underwriting year is closed and profits are distributed, or an advance  
profit release is made.  
At 31 December 2010, US$181.7 million (2009: US$145.1 million) of Amlin Bermuda’s assets are restricted for use by the Group. These assets are 
collateral for the LOC facility drawn at the end of the year. Details are included in note 27 for borrowings. 
At 31 December 2010, Leadenhall Value Insurance Linked Investments Funds Plc and Leadenhall Diversified Insurance Linked Investment Funds Plc, 
hold a combined €5.0 million in money market funds. These assets are held as collateral for insurance-linked securities. The Leadenhall funds hold an 
encumbered cash balance of US$14.4 million as collateral for FX forward contracts and insurance-linked securities held.  
The market values at 31
 
December 2010 for the insurance-linked securities are a debit of US$49.2 million and a credit of €1.6 million. The market 
values at 31 December 2010 for FX forward contracts are a debit of US$36.8 million and a credit of €27.5 million.

The subordinated debt will be redeemed on the maturity dates at the principal amounts, together with any outstanding accrued interest. For the US 
dollar and sterling bonds, the Group has the option to redeem the bonds in whole, subject to certain requirements, on the reset dates or any interest 
payment date thereafter at the principal amount plus any outstanding accrued interest. The euro bond was acquired by the Group as part of the 
acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI).  
The directors’ estimation of the fair value of the Group’s borrowings is £384.6 million (2009: £380.2 million). The aggregate fair values of borrowings 
are based on a discounted cash flow model. This model uses a current yield curve appropriate for the remaining terms to maturity. The discount rate 
used was 2.80% (2009: 3.41%). 
On 3 September 2008 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a renegotiated debt facility with its banks which is available for five

a) Defined benefit schemes 
i) The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund funded defined benefit scheme 
Scheme description 
The scheme is operated as part of the Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund (the Fund).  
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyd’s market. As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, employers 
closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only 3 (2009: 3) employers with active members in the Fund. A large 
proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund. The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current  
active employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole. 
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustee has split the Fund into a number of notional sections. This is a notional split and 
has no legal force. Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employer’s active members and one combined section 
for non-employed members of all current and former employers. 
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustee altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, 
including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred 
pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities. A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer 
contribute to the Fund (Orphan Schemes). The Group is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes’ liabilities. 
Since this alteration and the exit of other employers the Group has been able to more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund 
and able to ascertain its share of the assets and liabilities with sufficient certainty to account for the pension as a defined benefit scheme and bring the 
assets and liabilities of the scheme onto the balance sheet of the Group.  
Fund contributions 
No additional contribution was made in 2010 (2009: £5.0 million) to reduce the size of the deficit in the scheme. 
Contributions are paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual. The rate of contribution agreed with the Trustee is 19% (2009: 19%) paid by the 
employer plus 5% (2009: 5%) member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings, and totalled £0.9 million (2009: £0.9 million).  
The expected contribution to the fund for the year ending 31 December 2011 is £0.7 million by the Group and £0.2 million by plan participants. 
The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund are analysed in the table below:

Contributions relating to:  
One off top up payment – Amlin scheme – 5.0
Ongoing funding 0.7 0.7
Group share of total payment 0.7 5.7
Funding assessment assumptions 
The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary. Contributions are made at the funding rates 
recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include 
adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period. Amounts paid under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other  
Group companies. Actuarial amounts quoted below are for the Group’s notional share of the scheme.

28. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
The last completed formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2007 and was carried out by Mr N Wharmby, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, 
and used the projected unit credit actuarial method. The formal valuation at 31 March 2010 will be completed in 2011. For the purpose of providing 
disclosure in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (IAS 19), the Group has requested the actuary to update the 
2007 valuation to 31 December 2010 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 
 
2010
% pa 
2009
% pa
Price inflation 3.6 3.7
Rate of increase in pensions payment: 
– LPI (maximum 5% pa) 3.5 3.5
– LPI (minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa) 3.8 3.9
– LPI (maximum 3% pa) 2.6 2.7
Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 2.9 3.7
Discount rate 5.4 5.6
During 2005 the Group reviewed its remaining defined benefit arrangements and made a number of changes to the schemes’ operations, which  
were implemented during 2006. In particular, in order to remove much of the risk associated with salary inflation, the scheme was changed to allow 
members to continue accruing additional years’ service under the schemes, but these accruals would be generally based on March 2006 pensionable 
salaries. Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes. Therefore the salary inflation assumption used for the 
ongoing valuation is now nil% (2009: nil%). 
In 2010 the UK Government announced that inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) would  
be used as the measure for minimum increases to occupational pensions. In accordance with the Fund’s revaluation rules, CPI has been used as  
an assumption in valuing the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2010. 
The mortality assumptions used in the latest valuation included the following life expectancies: 
31 December 2010 31 December 2009 
Life expectancy (years) at age 60 for a member currently: 
Male Female Male Female
Aged 60 25.5 28.5 25.4 28.4

ii) ACI defined benefit plans  
Scheme description 
ACI operates defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its employees. These plans are funded partly by means of employee contributions. 
Under these plans, benefits are based on years of service and level of salary. Pension obligations are determined based on mortality, employee 
turnover, wage increases and economic assumptions such as inflation, value of plan assets and discount rate. The discount rate is set on the basis  
of the yield (on the valuation date) of debt securities issued by blue-chip companies.  
In addition to pension charges, costs of defined benefit plans also include other post-employment benefits such as reimbursement of part of the  
health insurance premiums and favourable conditions on financial products (e.g. mortgage loans), which continue to be granted to employees  
after retirement. 
The assets and liabilities of the Netherlands pension plan were acquired as part of the ACI acquisition. Prior to acquisition, employees of the Belgian 
office were employed by another company within the Fortis group. Immediately following the acquisition, 109 ACI Belgian employees (from a total  
of 130) transferred their employment to ACI. Consequently the net pension obligation with respect to these employees was recognised by the Group 
immediately after the completion of the acquisition.

The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund is in surplus at 31 December 2010. The Fund’s rules do not allow the Group to receive a refund of contributions  
in any circumstances. As such, the recognition of the defined benefit asset is restricted and the surplus is reduced to £nil. Of the total liability of  
£15.3 million, £0.8 million is expected to be settled within 12 months from the balance sheet date.

The fair value of the plan assets reflects a more prudent assessment of the assumed benefits that accrue to ACI under the insurance policy taken out to 
meet its obligations. This is in line with a market-wide reassessment of assumptions. This movement is included in the actuarial loss in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year.

b) The stakeholder defined contribution scheme 
The defined contribution scheme operated by the Group is a stakeholder arrangement. The total contributions for the year ended 31 December 2010 
to the scheme were £5.4 million (2009: £4.1 million). 
The estimated amounts of contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme for the year ending 31 December 2011 are approximately 
£5.7 million (2010: £4.0 million). 
c) Amlin AG’s pension scheme 
In accordance with Swiss legislation, Amlin AG provides for occupational pension insurance, the regulations of which, as may be amended from time  
to time, apply to both Amlin AG and the employee. The insured salary is based on the agreed compensation exclusive of bonus and/or other benefits 
granted by Amlin AG. The employees carry the portion of the premiums determined in the applicable pension fund regulations.  
During 2010 Amlin AG commenced hiring employees based in Switzerland. Swiss employees are provided with a pension fund which meets the 
classification of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19. Due to the fact that the contributions were not material for 2010 Amlin AG has accounted for the 
plans as defined contribution plans. Once the amounts are material the appropriate accounting and disclosures will be made. The total contributions 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 to the scheme were £0.2 million. 
The estimated amounts of contributions to the scheme for the year ending 31 December 2011 are approximately £0.8 million.

d) Other arrangements 
Other pension arrangements include an occupational money purchase scheme which provides Death In Service protection for all employees. Regular 
contributions, expressed as a percentage of employees’ earnings, are paid into this scheme and are allocated to accounts in the names of the individual 
members, which are independent of the Group’s finances. There were no outstanding contributions at 31 December 2010 (2009: £nil). 
29. Earnings and net assets per share 
Earnings per share are based on the profit attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.  
Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) and treasury shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares. 
Basic  
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax by the weighted average number of issued shares during the year.  
Diluted 
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax by the adjusted average number of shares in issue. The adjusted average number 
of shares assumes conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being shares from the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP), Performance Share Plan (PSP), Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave scheme.  
Basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows. The comparative numbers have been amended 
to reflect revised information, resulting in an increase in future aggregate minimum lease payments of £13.5 million. This has no impact on reported 
profit before tax.

36. Other Group companies 
Jointly owned entity 
Amlin Corporate Services Limited has an investment of £1.7 million in a jointly owned entity, Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP (LCP). LCP  
was established as a new asset management company focused on insurance linked investments. LCP is incorporated in England and Wales.  
The Group holds 50% of the voting rights. The Group has committed to pay up to a further US$4 million to support the operations of the agency  
as part of the joint venture agreement. The Group’s share of LCP’s profit for the current and prior years is £nil.  
Summary financial information for LCP is as follows: 
 
2010
£m
2009
£m
Assets 4.8 2.6
Liabilities 1.9 1.8
Revenues 2.6 1.7
Profit for the year 0.6 0.4
All of LCP’s assets and liabilities are classified as current.  
During the year, LCP charged the Group management fees of £2.6 million (2009: £1.6 million). The Group charged LCP £0.4 million (2009: £0.2 million) 
under the terms of the service agreement. At 31 December 2010, the Group held a debtor of £1.2 million due from LCP. No amounts were provided 
for doubtful recovery of this debtor and no expense was recognised during the year in respect of bad or doubtful debts from LCP. 
Associates 
During 2010, Amlin Corporate Services Limited invested £0.5 million to acquire 25% of the voting rights in Manchester Underwriting Management 
Limited (MUM). MUM was established as a managing general agent and is initially underwriting professional indemnity insurance. The majority of the 
business written by MUM is underwritten by Amlin UK. 
Operations held for sale 
At 31 December 2009, the Group classified its controlling interest in Leadenhall Capital Partners’ two insurance-linked funds, the Leadenhall Diversified 
Insurance Linked Investments Funds and the Leadenhall Value Insurance Linked Investments Fund, totalling £63.7 million, as held for sale. The Group 
retained this controlling interest at 31 December 2010. Whilst the management of Leadenhall Capital Partners remains optimistic of attracting external 
investment to the funds over the next twelve months, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is highly probable the Group will dispose of  
its controlling interest by way of dilution in that time frame. As such, the Group’s investment in the Leadenhall funds was reclassified from operation 
classified as held for sale on 31 December 2010 and subsequently fully consolidated. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the funds at  
31 December 2010 is £73.1 million.

37. Related party transactions 
i) Transactions and balances with related parties 
Amlin Plus 
Amlin Underwriting Limited and Lycetts Holdings Limited, the owners of Lycett, Browne-Swinburne and Douglas Limited and Lycetts Hamilton Limited, 
own 60% and 40% respectively of the share capital of Amlin Plus Limited (Amlin Plus). The business of Amlin Plus (bloodstock insurance) is written 
under a binding authority agreement with Syndicate 2001, some of which is sourced through a single broker, Lycett, Browne-Swinburne and Douglas 
Limited. Syndicate 2001 is managed by Amlin Underwriting Limited. The capacity on Syndicate 2001 is underwritten by a fellow subsidiary in the Amlin 
Group. All transactions between Amlin Plus and its related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis. 
During the year Amlin Plus wrote £12.3 million (2009: £12.8 million) of premium under the binding authority agreement, of which £5.8 million (2009: 
£6.7 million) was produced by Lycett, Browne-Swinburne and Douglas Limited earning brokerage commission of £1.0 million (2009: £1.1 million) on 
this business. At the year end, Syndicate 2001 was owed £2.8 million (2009: £3.3 million) by Amlin Plus and Lycett Browne-Swinburne and Douglas 
Limited owed £1.6 million (2009: £1.5 million) to Amlin Plus. 
Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP 
At 31 December 2010, the Group had a balance receivable from Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP of £1.2 million (2009: £1.0 million). The Group 
enters into transactions with its joint venture in the normal course of business. The sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal 
market prices. Details of the Group’s joint venture are given in note 36. 
Syndicate 6106 
For the 2009 underwriting year of account, the Group commenced operating a Special Purpose Syndicate (S) 6106 to write a 15% quota share  
contract of the excess of loss reinsurance account of Syndicate 2001. The transactions provide external members’ capital to support 2009 
underwriting, enabling Syndicate 2001 to take advantage of strong opportunities in peak zones in the US, Japan and Europe. Brian Carpenter,  
a director of the Company, held a 0.07% share of capacity as a Name on S6106 for the 2009 year of account (2010 year of account: nil%). All 
transactions with S6106 are undertaken on an arm’s length basis. 
ii) Compensation of key management personnel 
Key management personnel are those directors and senior managers responsible for planning and control of the activities of the Group. Key 
management comprises eleven executive directors and employees and seven non-executive directors (2009: nine and seven respectively). 
Compensation during the year to key management personnel is analysed below: 
 
2010
£m
2009
£m
Short-term employee benefits 8.5 7.7
Post-employment benefits 0.5 0.4
Equity-settled share-based payments 1.0 0.7
Cash-settled share-based payments – 1.2
 10.0 10.0
Cash-settled share-based payments have been included in the above table, including the addition to 2009, to better reflect the total compensation paid 
to key management personnel. 
iii) Transactions with directors 
Certain directors of the Company are also directors of other companies, as described in the directors’ biographical details on page 74 of the Annual 
Report. Such other companies (and/or their subsidiaries) may, and in some cases do, conduct business with companies in the Amlin Group, including 
GeoVera Insurance Holdings Ltd (of which Mr Feinstein is a non-executive director) and TrygVesta A/S (of which Mrs Bosse was Chief Executive Officer 
until 31 January 2011), which both purchase reinsurance (or whose subsidiaries purchase reinsurance) from the Amlin Group. In all cases transactions 
between the Amlin Group and such other companies are carried out on normal arm’s length commercial terms. 
iv) Internal reinsurance arrangements 
During the current and prior year, there were a number of reinsurance arrangements entered into in the normal course of trade between various Group 
companies, i.e. the reinsurance contract between Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda, and that between Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Corporate 
Insurance N.V. 
The related results of these transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 
38. Business Combinations 
i) Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. 
Adjustments to the provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. acquired on 22 July 2009 total £2.3 million  
(net of tax), resulting in an increase in goodwill. The adjustments have been made to adjust the recoverable amount of reinsurance assets and loans 
and receivables. 
ii) AUA Insolvency Risk Services Limited 
On 22 January 2010, the Group acquired the trade and assets of a United Kingdom insolvency practitioners’ insurance business from Lockton, Inc.  
The purchase consideration was £13.0 million cash. AUA Insolvency Risk Services Limited introduces insurance business to the Group. 
The fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was £nil and the fair value of intangible assets acquired was £13.0 million, resulting in the recognition 
of no goodwill on acquisition. The intangible asset acquired related to the existing customer relationships of the business (see note 22). 
This acquisition has had no material impact on the revenue or profit or loss of the Group for the period.

39. Subsequent events  
i) Corporation tax rate 
The Emergency Budget in June 2010 announced a change in the main rate of UK corporation tax. A new rate of 27.0% will apply from 1 April 2011, 
with the rate falling to 24.0% by 1 April 2014. The rate of 27.0% was enacted in July 2010. Subsequent reductions of the rate from 26.0% to 24.0% 
have not yet been enacted or substantively enacted. The impact of the reduction from 27.0% to 24.0% will be a reduction in the net deferred tax 
liability of £2.6 million. 
ii) Business combinations 
The Group has completed the acquisition of two subsidiaries subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to the issue of the Annual Report.  
On 25 January 2011 Amlin Corporate Services Ltd acquired the entire share capital and voting rights of J R Clare Holding Company Limited and its 
subsidiary undertaking J R Clare Underwriting Agencies Limited, which is a managing general agent of UK household and commercial insurance. The 
purchase consideration was an initial £1.1 million with two further amounts of £1.0 million payable 24 months and 36 months after the acquisition 
date. The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was £2.1 million net liability and the fair value of the consideration was £2.8 million, resulting 
in the recognition of £4.9 million of goodwill on acquisition. The goodwill arose from the premium paid for acquiring a new book of household and 
commercial insurance business.  
On 3 February 2011 Amlin Corporate Services Ltd acquired the entire share capital and voting rights of Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited, an 
underwriting agency of yacht insurance. The total consideration was £16.0 million, consisting of an initial £10.0 million paid on completion and a 
further £6.0 million payable between 2012 and 2016, subject to the financial performance of Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited. The fair value of the 
net assets acquired was £4.2 million and the fair value of the consideration was £14.6 million, resulting in the recognition of £10.4 million of goodwill 
on acquisition. The goodwill arose from the premium paid for acquiring a platform to further develop the Group’s existing yacht business and diversify 
its underwriting portfolio.  
The consideration and net assets are stated at their provisional fair values and may be amended in 2011 when further evidence of the appropriate fair 
values is expected to be received.     
iii) Insurance claims 
The start of 2011 was marked by heavy flooding and tropical cyclone Yasi in Queensland, Australia, and the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
The Group is still in the process of estimating the impact of these events. Initial estimates indicate that the losses in Australia are within the Group’s 
expected claims levels for 2011. However, it is too early to be able to make a definitive statement concerning the event in New Zealand, given the 
timing and uncertainty of the losses arising. These are non-adjusting events and therefore are not reflected in the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2010.

The Company also charged SBA Underwriting Limited £11,250 for accounting and administration services up until 30 September 2010. During this 
period, AUT Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, held a 30% interest in the Parent Company and underwriting of SBA Underwriting Limited. 
On 5 November 2010 AUT Holdings Limited acquired the remaining 70% of the business and consequently the charges ceased as SBA Underwriting 
Limited moved in line with all other wholly owned subsidiaries. 
Year end balance with related parties 
Cash resources are held centrally within the Group. This eliminates the need for many of the Group’s subsidiary companies to maintain bank accounts 
and optimises the management of cash resources. As a result of this practice many transactions within the Group are accounted for through 
intercompany accounts.  
The following table shows the balances outstanding at the year end between the Company and its related parties. The balances are all unsecured and 
no provisions are required for bad or doubtful debts.

51. Parent Company risk disclosures 
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiaries. Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations of the 
Group itself and full details of the risk management policies are given in note 3.  
Its investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in accordance with International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’ (IAS 27) and are tested for impairment annually. Details of impairments are given in note 44. 
Financial investments are measured at fair value, details of which are given in notes 3 and 42.  
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and financial investments, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the balance 
sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. 
Financial liabilities owed by the Company are largely in respect of long-term borrowings (details of which are provided in note 27) and amounts due  
to subsidiaries. Amounts due to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date. 
Interest rate risk 
Loans to and from subsidiaries are at floating rates of interest. The Company is therefore exposed to fluctuations in these rates. 
Currency risk 
The Company has entered into derivative contracts on behalf of the Group to hedge the net currency exposure, which results from the translation of 
the net assets of Amlin Bermuda and Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. These derivative contracts in the form of options have been accounted for as 
hedges of net investments in overseas subsidiaries by the Group, under which fair value gains and losses are taken to reserves to match the underlying 
movement in the valuation of the net investment in the overseas subsidiaries. In the Company these gains and losses are taken to profit or loss.  
The Company’s amounts due from subsidiaries include a loan of €272.6 million (2009: €260.1 million) which forms part of the net investment in Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. referred to above and hedged at a Group level. The Company is exposed to gains and losses on this loan in its profit or loss.  
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through its borrowings. At 31 December 2010, the Company had two subordinated debts of 
US$50.0 million each. The resulting foreign exchange loss in the Company and the Group for the year was £2.0 million.

The UK capital gains tax position regarding 
the B Shares issue (2007/2008)
The detailed UK and US tax position of all aspects 
of the return of capital and share consolidation 
that was completed early in 2008 was set out in 
a circular to shareholders dated 16 November 
2007, copies of which are available from the 
Company Secretary and on the Amlin website. 
This involved the replacement of each nine 
ordinary shares of 25p each in the Company 
previously held by shareholders by nine B Shares 
of 22.4p each and eight consolidated ordinary 
shares of 28.125p each (New Shares). All of such 
B Shares have subsequently been redeemed.
Further to that circular, the market value of a 
New Share for UK tax purposes on the first day 
on which its price was quoted (17 December 
2007) was 302.125p. The market value on the 
same date of a B Share for UK tax purposes was 
considered to be 22.3p. As the B Shares were 
not be traded on any stock exchange, its value 
was calculated by reference to its redemption 
value of 22.4p on the first redemption date of 
14 January 2008, with a discount applied to 
take account of the minimum period prior to 
redemption. Accordingly, shareholders subject 
to UK taxation of capital gains may apportion the 
allowable expenditure in relation to their holdings 
of ordinary shares of 25p each prior  
to 17 December 2007 as follows: 
  Holdings of new ordinary shares of 28.125p 
each: 92.333%
  Holdings of B Shares: 7.667%

Overview Investment proposition
10 reasons to invest in Amlin

a proven and scalable business model which has 
delivered outstanding performance for shareholders 
across the insurance cycle. Key elements of this 
model are:

Profit focused underwriting 
Amlin’s underwriting approach is highly disciplined 
and focused on gross underwriting profitability (before 
investment income and reinsurance) across the 
insurance cycle, rather than on premium income or 
market share. This approach is underpinned by incentive 
structures which reward underwriters for both short and 
long term profitability.

Amlin Re Europe: investing for future growth
Amlin Re Europe represents Amlin’s second major start-up following the successful 
establishment of Amlin Bermuda in 2006. Continental European insurers do not readily 
buy treaty reinsurance from Lloyd’s or Bermudian reinsurers, preferring to deal with local 
reinsurers in their own language, although Amlin London already provides catastrophe 
reinsurance to some European companies. The local relationships of Amlin Re Europe’s 
experienced underwriting team, combined with Amlin’s existing reinsurance franchise, 
strong ratings and long-standing broker relationships, are already proving to be an 
attractive business proposition to the target client base. Amlin Re Europe will further 
diversify our reinsurance portfolio by geography and class and Amlin AG gives us a 
substantial European platform from which to further develop the business over time. 
Profitable underwriting across the insurance cycle, combined with a diverse and balanced 
portfolio, enhances capital efficiency and helps to offset volatility within higher margin 
catastrophe lines. This chart shows, in premium terms, how Amlin’s business mix has 
developed since 2002 and how the growth in catastrophe reinsurance underwriting since 
2005 has been offset by the less volatile commercial and specialty business lines of recent 
acquisitions, particularly ACI.
Amlin’s market position as a specialist 
international insurer and reinsurer remains 
advantageous. Our business is small enough 
to be flexible and opportunistic, able to shrink 
or grow individual lines according to market 
conditions, and we have excellent and long-
standing relationships with key brokers. 
Nevertheless we remain mindful of the long 
term global consolidation trend in insurance 
and the likelihood that this will be given further 
momentum by Solvency II. Major brokers are 
increasingly focused on streamlining their 
distribution and concentrating premium flows 
with the optimum carriers in each market 
segment. Amlin needs to have sufficient critical 
mass to count in this changing environment. 
During 2010, we continued to invest in the  
core business, extending our underwriting scope 
and expertise through targeted recruitment. 
Given that one of our strategic objectives is for 
Amlin to be seen as ‘the place to work’, it was 
pleasing that we were able to attract a very high 
quality cadre of senior underwriters to join the 
Group in 2010, mainly for Amlin Re Europe but  
also in London and Bermuda. We also further 
strengthened regional management and operational 
resources in ACI, Amlin France and Bermuda. 
We continue to see suitable acquisitions as 
important to our longer term growth. During 
2010 we reviewed our acquisition strategy in 
the light of valuable lessons learned from recent 
acquisitions. This is now informing our planning 
to ensure that we are fully resourced to integrate 
further acquisitions effectively in the future. 
The Group made further significant progress 
towards Solvency II with the pre-application 
preparation completed on schedule. This was 
a major achievement which reflects the hard 
work and commitment of a substantial team 
of colleagues across the Group. It is becoming 
increasingly clear that Internal Model approval  
will be crucial to the success of businesses such 
as Amlin in the future and we remain confident  
of achieving that objective. We continue to expect 
that Amlin’s Target Operating Model, which is at 
the centre of our preparations for Solvency II  
( pp.41), will deliver substantial benefits 
and enhance Amlin’s competitive position. In 
particular, we see leading edge risk management 
as a crucial competitive advantage for the future. 
People 
Once again turnover of total employees and 
senior underwriters was low at 5.2% and 3.7% 
respectively. The stability of our employee base 
is an important asset, particularly as the business 
grows and we meet the challenge of extending the  
‘Amlin DNA’, which has been the foundation of the  
Group’s success, across the broader business. 
Amlin’s attainment of the first Chartered Insurer 
status in the London Market was a resounding 
endorsement of the professionalism and expertise 
of our people and underlines our continued 
commitment to our Vision of becoming  
‘the global reference point for quality in  
each of our markets’.
Employees across the Group again showed 
teamwork, dedication and commitment to 
meet these varied demands and deliver value 
to shareholders and clients. I admire and thank 
them for their outstanding performance.

Business development
As described in the market reviews ( pp.22-25), 
the trading environment for Amlin London was 
variable. Despite the market losses generated 
by the Chile and New Zealand earthquakes 
and other major losses such as the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, pricing on much of Amlin 
London’s portfolio weakened during the year. 
Nevertheless, there were opportunities to write 
profitable new business, mainly in Marine and 
Property and Casualty lines. We continued to 
invest in additional underwriting expertise, with 
the recruitment of Leading Class Underwriters in 
Hull, Specie and Professional Lines to the Marine 
and Property and Casualty teams respectively. 
Reinsurance pricing, although under pressure, 
remained attractive, particularly for US risks 
where catastrophe pricing on Amlin’s portfolio 
was within 10% of peak levels. Reinsurance 
income consequently remained relatively  
stable. In line with our strategy to have balanced 
portfolios of risk within each class of business, 
Amlin has a substantial international reinsurance 
book alongside its US catastrophe exposures. 
The general pattern of the last decade has seen 
this profitable international catastrophe portfolio 
counterbalance large US catastrophe claims, 
for example in 2004, 2005 and 2008. A second 
quiet year for US catastrophe claims in 2010 
meant that the returns on the US catastrophe 
portfolio and the contribution of other profitable 
reinsurance lines such as risk excess of loss 
helped to mitigate the effects of the notable 
losses experienced on the reinsurance account.
In the marine market, the first part of the year 
saw a general softening of rates across the 
majority of marine business lines, but following 
the Deepwater Horizon loss this trend reversed 
for the offshore energy and energy liability 
accounts, where rates showed a strong upturn 
during the second half of the year reflecting 
substantially increased demand for liability 
insurance. Energy liability and control of well 
rates increased by up to 50%, in particular for 
deepwater drilling risks. The environment for 
underwriting energy business also benefited 
during 2010 from the improvement in both  
the economy and the oil price which led to  
an increase in drilling activity. 
The US property and casualty market remained 
highly competitive and rating across the majority 
of business lines continued to soften. As a result, 
we reduced exposures in areas no longer offering 
sufficient potential for profit, while looking to 
maintain the underlying quality of our core  
client base. The financial impact of the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes on Amlin’s Property 
and Casualty portfolio was modest and well 
contained within reserves. There was a tightening 
of terms and conditions for loss affected parts  
of the international book and we witnessed  
some withdrawals from the market. However  
we remain in the soft part of the insurance cycle. 
During 2010, although there were further 
significant airline losses, this failed to address 
the considerable over capacity within the aviation 
market, which again made it difficult to obtain 
adequate pricing, particularly for airline business. 
An exception was the general aviation market, 
where we cautiously expanded our participation 
to take advantage of improving pricing.
In November 2009 we acquired Crowe Livestock 
Underwriting Limited, a Lloyd’s coverholder which 
provides specialist insurance to the livestock 
industry. During 2010, the business was fully 
integrated and as anticipated has already proved 
a valuable complement to our well-established 
Bloodstock account. 
In January 2010, we acquired Lead Yacht 
Underwriters, one of the largest and most 
highly respected agencies servicing super and 
mega-yacht business, which compliments Haven 
Knox-Johnson, which operates at the smaller end 
of the market.
Client service 
Despite more competitive market conditions Amlin 
London maintained a high level of retention across 
the portfolio, at 86% (2009: 91%), reflecting the 
value placed on our expertise and high service 
standards by brokers and clients. During the 
year , we again participated in the annual survey 
conducted by Gracechurch Consulting 1 of the 
attitudes of 200 UK-based brokers towards the 
claims services offered by insurers in the London 
market. Amlin ranked third overall, compared to 
second in 2009, but continued to perform above 
the market average across all the service attributes 
covered by the survey and led the market on  
broker perception of a ‘strong commitment to 
paying fair claims’.
As a result of the continued consolidation among 
the major brokers, 51% of the international 
insurance and reinsurance business handled  
by Amlin is generated by the three largest global 
brokers Aon, Willis and Marsh.

2010 Highlights
  Profitable result overall and in reinsurance, despite international 
catastrophe claims 
  Growth of 3.9% in GWP to £889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million)
  Combined ratio of 80% despite £132.2 million of major catastrophe claims
  Improved risk reporting, expanded use of catastrophe models and 
calibration of technical pricing as part of preparation for Solvency II
  New business growth in reinsurance, marine and property and casualty 
  Continued investment in underwriting teams 
  Further strengthening of relationships with key brokers.
A priority for 2010 was to further develop 
strategic relationships with key brokers and 
to identify and target business development 
opportunities. As part of this process we also 
entered into strategic partnerships with two 
brokers in order to secure high quality new 
business opportunities for the future. 
Underwriting performance
Gross written premium increased by 3.9% to 
£889.4 million (2009: £855.7 million). Much 
of the increase was due to net new business 
generated within the Aviation, Marine and 
Property and Casualty business units, following 
investment in underwriting teams and a focus on 
opportunities where rating conditions proved more 
attractive. Net earned premium was up by 16.8%, 
reflecting an increase in net written premium in 
2009 and 2010 and the earning of 2009 premium 
at more favourable exchange rates.
The average renewal rate decrease was 3.1%, 
driven by average reductions on reinsurance 
business of 4.7%. Average reductions of 2.2% 
and 5.0% were also evident for the Property and 
Casualty and Aviation business units respectively. 
Marine rates were broadly stable. 
The division achieved a combined ratio of 80% 
(2009: 71%). The claims ratio at 44% (2009: 
28%) increased by 15% due to the Chile and 
New Zealand earthquakes. Prior period reserve 
movements were £80.8 million (2009: £95.1 
million). Across the division, reserves for 2003 
and prior years, which are well developed, have 
now been set at close to the actuarial best 
estimates, releasing £20.0 million at year end. 
This change has been made to avoid consistent 
increases in the reserving strength of the division. 
The expense ratio was 36% (2009: 43%). The 
decrease reflects a positive foreign exchange 
swing, with a weaker US dollar in 2009 relative 
to 2010.

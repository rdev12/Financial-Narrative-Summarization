Specialist Engineering Division
 Revenues from continuing activities were 
10.8% to £49.3m (2007: £44.5m). 
 Investment in the key businesses, the 
acquisition of Post Glover LifeLink, 
divestment and consolidation of non-core 
businesses provide the focal point for the 
progress made in Specialist Engineering 
during 2008.
 Post Glover LifeLink was acquired by 
the Group for £3.2m in January 2008 
and performed ahead of management 
expectations. 
 Revenues from continuing activities were 
down 0.8% to £25.5m (2007: £25.7m). 
 Businesses in this division are market 
leaders in bakeware and microwave 
cookware sold in the UK. The division’s 
major brands are Mermaid, Long Life, 
Progress, RTA and Microwise. 
 This market has remained strong as 
European consumers choose to eat at 
home rather than eat out.

16043 12/06/2009 Proof 10
The strategy set out in our Strategic Review is to build a business 
focused on specialist engineering products occupying niche positions in 
growth markets, supported by significant barriers to entry. In pursuit of 
this strategy the Group completed one acquisition, three disposals and 
three closures during the course of 2008. Additionally, three businesses 
were consolidated into other existing operations. As a consequence, 
the Group started 2008 with twenty-one operating businesses and 
finished the year with thirteen. Since the year end the Group has 
disposed of a further business. Exiting from underperforming sectors 
and the consequent avoidance of further potential losses and cash 
outflows significantly reduces the Group’s risk profile. 
The £3.2m acquisition of Post Glover LifeLink (PGL) takes us into 
the growing market for the supply of specialist medical equipment, 
perfectly fitting the strategic criteria outlined above. Acquired in January 
2008, PGL has exceeded management’ s expectations and significantly 
enhanced its operating profit in the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group’s strategic momentum has continued since the year end. 
In April 2009, we announced the disposal of BSC Diecasting. MRX 
China’s operations have also been consolidated into other operating 
businesses in 2009. 
Results
The resilience of our continuing businesses is demonstrated by their 
success in increasing revenues to £74.8m (2007: £70.2m) during 
an increasingly difficult year. Adjusted operating profit before 
exceptional items, goodwill impairment and share-based payments 
was £2.0m (2007: £2.6m). After exceptional items the Group 
incurred a loss before tax and discontinued operations of £2.2m 
(2007: £5.2m). Exceptional items including goodwill impairment and 
share-based payments amounted to £17.6m (2007: £12.2m) and 
were predominantly associated with the restructuring programme, 
with £14.2m relating to discontinued operations. Of this, £11.6m 
related to goodwill and asset impairment. The Group therefore 
incurred a loss after tax of £16.2m (2007: £7.0m). Adjusted Group 
earnings per share before exceptional items, goodwill impairment 
and share-based payments were 1.10p (2007: 4.36p) and basic loss 
per share was 13.55p (2007: loss of 5.83p note 8). 
Chairman’s Statement
John Crabtree
Chairman
“The resilience of our continuing 
businesses is demonstrated by their 
success in increasing revenues to 
£74.8m (2007: £70.2m) during an 
increasingly difﬁ cult year.”
Dividend
The Group’ s policy is to make dividend payments that are covered 
between 2.0 and 2.5 times by its earnings. In light of the current 
economic conditions and the Group’s performance in 2008, there will be 
no dividend payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008.
People
The year also saw considerable change to the Group’s Board as we 
positioned ourselves for growth under a talented and energetic 
new management team. As announced in last year’s annual report 
Michael Stock was appointed as Group Finance Director on 2 April 
2008, succeeding William Kelly who resigned by mutual consent on 
15 January 2008. In addition, Ian Paling joined the Group as Non-
Executive Director on the 4 April 2008. 
More recently, Andrew Pearson resigned as Non-Executive Director at 
the end of 2008 and John Adcock informed the Group that he will 
stand down as Non-Executive Director following the 2009 Annual 
General Meeting. The Board would like to record its thanks to Andrew 
Pearson and John Adcock for their significant contribution to Metalrax. 
The Group’s restructuring alone has created substantial challenges 
for our people, but the exceptional conditions presently affecting 
the economy impose additional burdens and discomfort. Many of 
our employees and other stakeholders have been personally and 
financially compromised by actions to assure the Group’s long term 
future. Our employees have been very supportive and I would like to 
record my thanks and those of the entire Board to all involved.
Outlook 
As announced in March 2009, trading in the first two months 
of 2009 was significantly below the levels experienced in 2008, 
although subsequent trading has shown a slight improvement. 
Against the current economic backdrop, visibility of future trading 
levels continues to be very limited and, in the Directors’ opinion, 
there is a wide range of potential outcomes for the Group in the 
current financial year. Although trading has improved slightly during 
the course of 2009, if this trend does not improve further over 
coming months, the Directors would expect the Group’s performance 
in the current year to fall below current market expectations. 
In the meantime, we will vigorously pursue organic growth 
opportunities within our continuing operations, continue to reduce 
costs and focus our business on markets that will deliver long-term 
Shareholder value.
Going concern
The Group has commenced re-financing discussions with its bankers to 
secure fully committed facilities. Whilst these discussions are significantly 
progressed, at the time of signing the accounts they had not yet been 
finalised, but I look forward to updating shareholders appropriately 
in due course. Further details of the Group’s liquidity position and 
going concern are given in the Financial Review and note 1 to the 
financial statements.

Strategy, objectives and actions
The key strategic objectives for the year announced by the Group 
were: to stop losses and exit non-core businesses; to turnaround 
and strengthen the strategic focus of existing core businesses and 
to further progress the acquisition strategy on businesses in target 
growth sectors.
Though the current economic situation has not fundamentally 
altered the underlying strategy, it has impacted the Group’s tactics 
and approach in a number of ways. Most apparent has been the 
acceleration of the closure and disposal programme for non-core 
businesses, which has moved apace. However, the inability to 
maximise asset sales, caused by weak market conditions, has brought 
challenges of its own. The overall result has been a significantly 
increased focus on cash conservation and cost reduction in lieu of 
business acquisitions. 
Despite the factors described above, the overall strategic goals of the 
Group remain to:
n Be a specialist engineering Group;
n Focus on businesses that operate in niche markets, have 
significant growth potential and barriers to entry, and that can 
each be expected to contribute meaningful profits; and
n Pursue organic growth and increased margins by focussing on 
innovation in products, services and distribution.
Chief Executive’s Review
Andrew Richardson
Chief Executive
“Current economic conditions reafﬁ rm 
the need for the Group’s repositioning 
into growing defensible niche sectors 
in line with the January 2008 strategic 
review”
Strategic achievements to date include the acquisition of US based 
PGL, a world leading manufacturer of isolated electrical power 
systems and electric raceways for the medical, laboratory and 
educational sectors. Acquired in January 2008 for £3.2m, PGL has 
exceeded management’s expectations and significantly enhanced its 
operating profit in the year ended December 2008. 
The Group has also successfully refocused its Consumer Durables 
division through the consolidation of its RTA Wineracks business into 
GW International, and by relocating its Samuel Groves operation to 
reduce costs and altering the focus of its business model. 
Specific accomplishments of the Specialist Engineering division 
include the streamlining of the Group’s coating operation through 
the consolidation of its Fabricote businesses into Cooper Coated 
Coil; the closure of three construction sector dependent businesses, 
Makespace Mezzanine Floors, Down and Francis, and Stackright 
Building Systems; and the stabilisation of the remaining construction 
sector reliant Premier Stairways business. 
All high volume automotive operations were exited during 2008, 
including the sale of Bacol Fine Blanking, MRX Automotive, and the 
Welland distribution businesses. As well as this, the Group ceased 
automotive manufacturing in Romania.
Alongside all these activities the Group’s net borrowings at the end of 
the year were £12.5m (2007: £12.6m) despite having acquired PGL 
for £3.2m. Cash generated in 2009 from business and property sales 
amounted to £1.2m.
The Group also transferred its listing from the Main Market to 
AIM on the 25 June 2008, thereby lowering compliance costs 
and enabling the more efficient and cost-effective execution of 
restructuring activities.

Case Study
COOPER COATED COIL
During 2008 the relocation and fit out of Cooper Coated Coil 
(CCC) began in earnest. The £5.0m expansion project, which was 
agreed upon following the integration of the former Fabricote 
business in 2006, involved the commission of what is believed to 
be the world’s widest and fastest high temperature coil coating 
line, providing additional speed and flexibility as well as the ability 
to handle much larger coils. 
 
The new line has been installed at the company’s 32,000 sq.ft 
fully refurbished and reorganised premises at Wednesfield in 
Wolverhampton where operations have already been transferred.  
A further relocation and upgrading of CCC’s finishing operation 
to an additional building on the Wolverhampton site is also under 
consideration.
 
The integration and expansion of the business is expected to lead 
to cost savings, space consolidation, reduction of manufacturing 
lead times and improvement in operating efficiencies. The 
ISO14001 accredited business has also ensured that a state-of-
the-art environmental abatement scheme is in place in the form 
of an innovative heat recycling process. What’s more energy 
consumption is expected to be reduced once the commissioning 
process is fully complete.
 
The investment has reinforced the capital intensive equipment 
and intellectual property, of a process that already possesses high 
barriers to entry. As a result the company has begun to develop a 
broad range of new and existing markets, including the export of 
product to China and its predominantly housewares and kitchen 
appliance-based markets.

Chief Executive’s Review
Review of 2008 performance
2008 was a year of substantial change and also saw the onset of the 
current financial crisis. Despite this, for the year ended 31 December 
2008 the Group reports revenues of £74.8m (2007: £70.2m) from 
continuing activities.
Adjusted operating profit before exceptional items, goodwill 
impairment and share-based payments was £2.0m (2007: £2.6m). 
After exceptional items, the Group incurred a loss before tax and 
discontinued operations of £2.2m (2007: Loss of £5.2m). Losses 
from discontinued operations amounted to £13.1m (2007: £4.8m), 
reflecting losses in the year and write-down in asset values as 
explained in the Financial Review, resulting in a Group loss for the 
year of £16.2m (2007: Loss of £7.0m).
Group adjusted earnings per share before exceptional items were 
1.10p (2007: 4.36p) and basic losses per share were 13.55p (2007: 
Losses of 5.83p). Further details are shown in note 8.
Net debt at 31 December 2008 stood at £12.5m (31 December 2007: 
£12.6m) representing gearing of 40.1% (2007: 24.8%).
The 2008 results are reported in line with the simplified divisional 
structure implemented during the year which comprises two divisions 
— Consumer Durables and Specialist Engineering.
During 2008 significant operational progress was made across both 
divisions through the strengthening of management competencies 
and through the restructuring of the Executive Board and the 
divisional organisation. We have also focused on developing and 
strengthening subsidiary managing Directors, which will facilitate 
the Group’s ongoing progress and further development of other 
senior staff has commenced. Focused investment is now being 
undertaken in Sales and Marketing to drive local growth initiatives. 
The repositioning of the Group, as outlined in my strategic review in 
January last year has made great strides with the acquisition of Post 
Glover LifeLink and the disposal, by closure or sale, of six trading 
entities during the year and one since the year end.
Consumer Durables
Revenues from continuing activities were down 0.8% to £25.5m 
(2007: £25.7m).
Operating profit before exceptional items was down 25.0% to £1.5m 
(2007: £2.0m). Operating profit after exceptional items has increased 
to £0.5m (2007: Loss of £0.2m) as a result of lower exceptional items 
in the period.
Businesses in this division are market leaders in bakeware and 
microwave cookware sold in the UK. The division’s major brands 
are Mermaid, Long Life, Progress, RTA and Microwise. In November 
2008, RTA won a trade award — “Innovative Product of the Year” 
for RTA Eco Chef Chopping Boards, made from recycled cardboard. 
Financial performance of this division was adversely affected by the 
weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar in the second half of the 
year. Increased steel prices in the latter part of 2008 and the start of 
2009 also affected short-term margins. This division also has potential 
exposure to retail business failures evidenced by the rapid demise of 
Woolworths, which was a major customer. However, management 
has minimised the risks of bad debts through careful credit control. 
In addition, the professional catering market has been affected by 
the downturn in investment by hotels, pubs and restaurants across 
the UK. 
However, the largest part of the division’s sales and margin comes 
from bakeware. This market has remained strong as European 
consumers choose to eat at home rather than eat out. As well as 
being motivated by the economic conditions, an increased awareness 
of healthy eating is encouraging consumers to return to home 
cooking instead of convenience foods. These products are ‘need 
to have’ rather than ‘nice to have’. The main adverse impact of the 
recession on bakeware products is in the UK where retailers have 
focused on lower margin promotions. Our response to this includes 
operational efficiency improvements enabled by the higher volume 
nature of such promotions.
A number of structural changes and investments were made to our 
Consumer Durables businesses during the year:
n Samuel Groves, our catering equipment business was relocated 
at the end of the year to new premises and remodelled, reducing 
operating and logistics costs. The relocation was completed in 
January 2009, enabling its management now to concentrate 
on sales growth, based around a more clearly focused product 
range, with high levels of service already being delivered to the 
customer. 
n Our wine rack business, RTA has transferred its administration, 
warehousing and distribution functions to the GW International 
site, reducing costs and improving economies of scale in terms of 
customer support.

The sales team across the division now has a wider range of products 
to sell to the existing customer base, to create more opportunities. 
We introduced exclusive Teflon
®
 bakeware made in China, in a 
worldwide exclusive arrangement negotiated with Du Pont, with 
the first shipments made to Lakeland Limited in September 2008. 
Further new product developments included the introduction of 
the Annabel Karmel licensed children’s bakeware range. Annabel 
Karmel is a world renowned specialist in advice and re-assurance 
to parents with children under 10. Moving into 2009 we plan to 
continue with further investment on automated processes in our 
bakeware manufacture to improve our competitive position. Tooling 
developments are underway in China to meet international customer-
specific demands for bakeware development.
2009 has begun with margins in this division still under pressure from 
the effects of the weakened Sterling and the impact of rising steel 
prices, although actions are ongoing to pass on these price increases 
wherever possible, whilst retaining the goodwill of our customers 
who are increasingly focused on promotions to create market share.
The medium-term outlook is favourable, as our investments and 
actions are aimed at producing progressive improvements to take 
advantage of the current trading climate and establish future profit 
improvements.
Specialist Engineering
Revenues from continuing activities were up 10.8% to £49.3m 
(2007: £44.5m).
Operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill impairment 
was up 81.0% to £3.8m (2007: £2.1m). Operating profit after 
exceptional items and goodwill impairment has increased to £2.2m 
(2007: loss of £2.5m) as a result of lower exceptional items in the 
period.
Investment in the key businesses, the acquisition of Post Glover 
LifeLink, divestment and consolidation of non-core businesses 
provided the focal point for the progress made in Specialist 
Engineering during 2008. 
Investment in new capital equipment at Cooper Coated Coil (CCC) 
allowed the consolidation of CCC with its sister company Fabricote 
to be completed. This investment programme has given us the most 
efficient coil coating bakeware line in the world. CCC now has the 
largest market share of pre-coated metal for the bakeware market 
within the European Community. Aggressive financial targets were 
met, allowing the business to double its profitability compared with 
the previous year. The business commenced the supply of coil coated 
products to China for resale back to Europe during 2008. The market 
for this business has remained reasonably strong during 2008 and 
early 2009, as European consumers move towards home cooking, 
motivated by the economic conditions and increased awareness of 
healthy eating benefits.
Post Glover Lifelink, which was acquired by the Group for £3.2m in 
January 2008 performed ahead of management expectations. PGL, 
which is based in Northern Kentucky, supplies medical electrical and 
safety equipment and is an increasingly strong force within its domestic 
and export markets. The business was successfully integrated into the 
Group and showed strong sales and profit growth under Metalrax’s 
first year of ownership. Investments have been made in new product 
development, restructuring of manufacturing operations and export 
growth. Whilst some of the benefits of these investments were seen in 
2008, further benefits will come through in 2009. These benefits will 
help counteract the effects of the US recession, from which PGL and its 
market are sheltered but not unaffected.
Weston Body Hardware is a specialist full service light assembly 
business focused on access control systems. It was impacted by 
the recession from Q4 2008 and this has continued into early 
2009. However, management are forecasting recovery in the 
second half of 2009 following new trading agreements in Europe, 
and will focus on developing opportunities in ‘green energy 
generating systems’ and medical assembly.
Toolspec is recognised as a specialist fabricator to the global vehicle 
market. Although the customer base is dominated by off-highway 
and specialist vehicle manufacturers, management dealt swiftly and 
effectively with the sudden downturn within this sector in late 2008. 
The business also secured orders to provide chassis components for 
the new Jaguar XJ vehicle to be launched in Q4 2009. The business is 
now well placed for a recovery in vehicle volumes.
Metalrax Storage launched a major drive in 2008 to increase market 
share through more focused marketing and sales activity. This 
culminated in securing two prestigious projects as well as a major 
UK government framework agreement. The market for its products 
declined sharply in Q4 2008 and underlying market demand in early 
2009 remains poor. However, the business has retained its major 
retail customers, some of which are continuing to increase the 
number of store refits during 2009.

Sections & Tubes manufactures rolled steel sections for UK 
manufacturers including Metalrax Storage. Such manufacturers were 
impacted by the recessionary climate during 2008 and early 2009. 
Management has concentrated on reducing costs, whilst developing 
the skills of the workforce to increase flexibility and make the 
changes demanded by the marketplace.
Advanced Handling offers bespoke materials handling solutions, 
mainly to the UK market. It launched a significant new product 
during 2008 — a specialist elevator for mezzanine floors. The 
business enjoyed growth in its niche products and new market 
sectors, offsetting the decline in the sales of standard products due to 
price pressures, which have continued into 2009. As a result of this 
change in product mix, sales remained static in 2008, with increased 
margins. The business is increasing its marketing emphasis to 
generate further sales into the healthcare, nuclear, military and food 
processing applications.
Premier Stairways, which was loss making in 2008, is now half way 
through a recovery programme. Its market for specialist architectural 
metalwork declined in the second half of 2008, specifically in the 
private housing, public housing, office and industrial sectors. Premier 
appointed a new Managing Director in late 2008 and now has a 
growing order bank and consistent factory throughput. It is focussing 
on building a solid and sustainable key customer base and improving 
factory productivity and customer service. 
A decline in demand at our Commercial Bearings business led to 
restructuring activity to reduce costs. This has proved insufficient 
to offset the drop in sales. The business is being run for cash 
while attempts are made to secure a sale of the business as a 
going concern.
Discontinued businesses
The strategy of the Group since January 2008 has been to stop 
losses and exit all non-strategic businesses. This strategy has proven 
even more appropriate as the economic environment has continued 
to deteriorate. A number of closures and disposals have been 
accelerated where markets have turned down very sharply or where 
there has been risk of significant cash costs (such as bad debts or 
future closure costs) arising from continuing operations.
Revenues for discontinued businesses for year ended 31 December 
2008 were £30.0m, 38.0% behind the prior year (2007: £48.4m). 
Losses after exceptional items and goodwill impairment relating to these 
businesses amounted to £13.1m (2007: £4.8m).
Bacol Fine Blanking traded in Metalrax ownership until February 
2008, when it was sold to Rical Limited. The business generated an 
operating profit of £1.0m from the beginning of the year until the 
point of sale, as a result of innovative management actions taken 
prior to transferring ownership. 
Down & Francis traded until June 2008 when it was closed. The 
operating loss in 2008 prior to closure was £0.2m. 
MRX Automotive (formerly Bacol Industries, Kenham Tools and 
Pressings and Prescott Powell) traded under Metalrax ownership until 
December 2008, when it was sold to Sertec Birmingham Limited. It 
generated an operating profit of £1.9m until the point of sale. We 
do not believe that it would have traded profitably in 2009. The 
significant costs of future closure were avoided by the disposal of 
this business. 
Stackright Building Systems suffered dramatically as a result of the 
downturn in the construction sector. It started the year strongly but 
was heavily exposed to price sensitive rental markets. The business 
traded until December 2008, when it was closed. The operating 
loss in 2008 was £0.9m, which rose to £5.0m, primarily goodwill 
impairment of £3.6m and closure costs of £0.5m.
Welland traded under Metalrax ownership until December 2008, 
when it was sold to a local businessman. The business generated a 
small operating profit until the point of sale, but exceptional costs on 
disposal reduced this to a loss of £0.2m. 
Makespace Mezzanine Floors was hit by cost pressures and bad debts 
within the construction downturn. It traded until December 2008, 
when it was closed. The operating loss in 2008 was £0.3m, which 
rose to £0.6m with closure costs.
BSC Diecasting was hit by the downturn in volumes within 
automotive and brewery trades. It traded until April 2009, when it 
was sold. The operating profit was £nil in 2008 with exceptional asset 
impairment charges of £0.6m. Potential closure costs of £0.5m were 
avoided by the disposal.
The Group retained the freehold properties from the business 
operations of Bacol Fine Blanking, MRX Automotive, Welland and 
BSC Diecasting. These properties are expected to generate rental 
incomes and will be available for disposal as and when appropriate. 
We have subsequently sold the freehold property relating to 
Makespace Mezzanine Floors and Stackright Building Systems. The 
freehold property formerly occupied by Samuel Groves has been 
retained and is currently being marketed for sale along with other 
vacant properties.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items in 2008 totalled £17.6m (2007: £12.2m), and 
were predominantly associated with the restructuring programme 
described above, with £14.2m (2007: £5.4m) relating to discontinued 
operations. Of the £17.6m charge, £11.6m is non-cash relating to 
goodwill and asset impairment. Further details about exceptional 
items is given in the Financial Review and in note 3 to the accounts.

Case Study
POST GLOVER LIFELINK
Post Glover LifeLink (PGL), which became part of Metalrax Group 
PLC at the beginning of 2008, is a world leading manufacturer of 
isolated electrical power systems and electrical raceways for the 
medical, laboratory and educational sectors and is the number two 
supplier in each of its primary product markets.
In 2008 PGL shipped or installed over 1270 orders, whilst achieving 
an exemplary overall on-time delivery performance of 98%. PGL’s 
quality rating during this period was also an impressive 95%. 
With statistics like these achieved post acquisition and during the 
integration period, PGL is already proving to be a valued member 
of the Metalrax Group of companies. The business is recognised as 
“one of the best in its field” by the American Society of Healthcare 
Engineers (ASHE), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and 
the National Electrical Code authority (NEC). During 2008 PGL 
again achieved Preferred Supplier standing from General Electric, 
a well deserved achievement for the company’s highly dedicated 
team of employees and a great source of pride for Metalrax Group. 
President, Judy Kathman, is relentlessly committed to the pursuit 
of excellence at PGL. Her team is also dedicated to providing the 
highest quality customer service, the reward for which is a loyal 
customer base including the top four electrical packagers in North 
America – General Electric, EATON, Siemens and Square D and the 
largest hospital purchasing organizations in the US.
As well as supporting existing patient critical environments 
with their renowned suite of products, the company recognises 
continuous innovation in power safety is essential for long 
term growth. In 2008 PGL released a number of new products, 
expanding their Laboratory Power System (LPS) product line; 
enhancing their Line Isolation Monitor suite of products and 
introducing Lim-Connect® software to provide true connectivity 
of all Line Isolation Monitors over a facility’s standard Ethernet 
network infrastructure.

People 
Since the Company embarked on implementing its new strategy, 
substantial management changes have taken place and we have 
invested significantly in people development amongst our continuing 
and new employees. This programme includes in-depth reviews of 
personal strengths, development opportunities, goals and objectives. 
Future development in 2009 will focus on commercial skills and 
strategies designed to support growth of profitable sales during 
the recession. All efforts are focused on building a strong and 
decentralised Group of companies.
During 2008 the number of Divisional Chief Executives was reduced 
from four to two, reflecting the restructuring of our businesses and 
the reduced number of operating subsidiaries.
The Executive Committee now comprises four executives: Group 
Chief Executive, Andrew Richardson; Group Finance Director, Michael 
Stock; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Smith, who is now responsible 
for both our Specialist Engineering and Consumer Durables 
Divisions; and Director of Corporate Development, Caroline Green, 
who is responsible for implementing business and asset disposals, 
acquisitions and corporate finance.
Working capital
Working capital remains a key area of focus for management. 
Throughout 2008, inventory reduced by £2.1m and trade and other 
receivables reduced by £5.8m, primarily as a result of the business 
closure and sale programme. Working capital in the continuing 
businesses declined slightly, notwithstanding the growth achieved by 
those businesses. Further detail is provided in the Financial Review. 
Current trading and prospects
Current economic conditions reaffirm the need for the Group’s 
repositioning into growing, defensible niche sectors in line with 
the January 2008 strategic review and we anticipate 2009 being a 
challenging year.
The Directors announced in March 2009 that trading in the first two 
months of 2009 was significantly below the levels experienced in 
2008 although subsequent trading has shown a slight improvement. 
However, against the current economic backdrop, visibility of future 
trading levels remains very limited and, in the Directors’ opinion, 
there remains a wide range of potential outcomes for the Group in 
the current financial year. Although trading has improved slightly 
during the course of 2009, if this trend does not improve further over 
coming months, the Directors would expect the Group’s performance 
in the current year to fall below current market expectations.
The Group has the benefit of having significantly reduced its exposure 
to the automotive and construction markets since the beginning of 
2008. However, parts of the Group remain exposed to these sectors. 
The Group has also moved into some market sectors related to British 
government spending. These market sectors now pose new risk 
due to the state of public finances in the UK. The lower technology 
businesses face continuing pressures on top line and margins. Our 
commercial catering business remains under pressure due to the lack 
of investment in hotels, restaurants and pubs.
However, there are a number of bright spots within our portfolio 
of businesses. The technology-led businesses within the Specialist 
Engineering division, such as Cooper Coated Coil and Post Glover 
LifeLink, possess proprietary technology and supply into defensible 
market sectors. The market for Post Glover LifeLink’s medical 
products in North America is defensible, as are its export markets, 
mainly in the Middle East. The European domestic bakeware market 
also remains strong, as consumers have switched from dining out to 
lower cost and healthier home cooking options. This is the largest 
market for our Consumer Durables business and it is also a significant 
sales driver for Cooper Coated Coil’s specialist steel coating products. 
Central and legacy costs have been a financial burden to the Group. 
However, as the Group reduces in complexity and reaches the final 
stages of its restructuring processes, it will be possible to reduce 
many of these costs. The benefits of these savings will start to appear 
in 2009 and will take on greater significance in 2010. 
Bank borrowings and overdrafts at the end of 2008 were at £12.5m 
(2007: £12.0m). During the first quarter of 2009 borrowings 
increased, as announced in March 2009. However, the Directors 
have instituted measures to preserve cash, which have resulted in 
borrowings reducing to a seasonal norm. 
The Group has enjoyed the benefit of an unencumbered balance 
sheet and well-priced borrowing facilities for many years. However, 
the current financing climate means that it is necessary for the Group 
to negotiate new, secured and committed refinancing. The Directors 
look forward to announcing progress with these negotiations in 
due course. Further details are provided in the Financial Review and 
note 1 to the financial statements.
In the short-term, the priority of the Board is to focus assiduously on 
cash conservation and cost reduction, creating the financial stability 
that will enable us to press ahead with our strategic plans.

Financial Review
Results summary
The results have been prepared under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
The Consolidated Income Statement reports the Revenue and 
Operating income and expenditure of the Group’s continuing 
businesses. The ongoing turnaround of the Group has resulted in 
a number of businesses being closed or disposed in the year under 
review. The trading results of the closed businesses that have been 
closed or sold are reported separately as discontinued operations at 
the base of the Income Statement. The above summary of results 
compares the Group’s continuing and discontinued results in 2008 to 
that previously reported in 2007.
Revenues
Revenue from continuing activities for the year ended 31 December 
2008 at £74.8m were 6.6% ahead of the prior year (2007: £70.2m). 
Total external revenues for the Group were £104.8m (2007: 
£118.6m). Further details of the divisional performances are set out in 
the Chief Executive’s Review and note 2 of the financial statements.
Operating profit/loss
Operating profits from continuing businesses before exceptional 
items and share-based payments at £2.0m (2007: £2.6m) were in line 
with the revised market expectations. Operating losses for continuing 
businesses before taxation were £1.4m (2007: Loss of £4.2m).
Cash generation
The Group has continued to focus on working capital management 
and cost control during the period. The cash outflow on discontinued 
activities represents the cash cost of reorganisation and the 
experienced downturn in trade prior to closure or disposal of these 
businesses. Total cash generated from operations was £5.2m (2007: 
£6.5m). Of this, £1.8m was generated from continuing operations 
(2007: £3.6m).
Exceptional items
The Group has incurred significant one-off exceptional costs 
including goodwill impairment and share-based payments in 2008 
totalling £17.6m (2007: £12.2m). The vast majority of this total 
was incurred in respect of discontinued businesses (£14.2m) as the 
Group continued to implement its strategy to reposition its focus on 
businesses that operate in niche markets, have significant growth 
potential and barriers to entry and that can be expected to contribute 
meaningful cash and profits. Of the £17.6m of exceptional items 
incurred in 2008, £11.3m relates to non-cash items resulting from 
the impairment of assets prior to business closure or disposal and to 
impairment of goodwill and the charge for the IFRS2 share option 
expense. 
The types of exceptional items incurred can be broadly categorised 
into the following types:
n Reorganisation costs incurred in restructuring various elements of 
the Group has resulted in a £4.4m charge to exceptional items 
(2007: £8.9m).

n A further £0.5m provision was charged in respect of the onerous 
contract in MRX Romania (2007: £0.7m);
n The closure and disposal of businesses has resulted in impairment 
provisions totalling £5.0m reflecting the realisation of fixed asset 
and working capital at less than book value (2007: £2.2m). An 
additional £0.3m asset impairment results from the relocation of 
Samuel Groves to Oldbury in December 2008 (2007: £nil);
n Onerous lease costs of £1.4m (2007: £nil) relate to future vacant 
property rentals payable following the closure Stackright Building 
Systems;
n The deterioration in the commercial property market in 2008 
resulted in the devaluation of our property portfolio. Of the 
£4.6m reduction in market value, £4.3m was taken to the 
revaluation reserve and £0.3m to exceptional, being the 
impairment below the original historic cost of 2 of our properties. 
In addition, the Group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill, 
and this has resulted in an impairment of £5.5m (2007: £nil), £4.7m 
of which relates to discontinued businesses.
The IFRS2 share option charge of £0.2m (2007: £nil) has been 
disclosed separately on the face of the income statement as this is 
considered to be a non-trading item. Future details on the share 
option valuations are disclosed in note 23. 
Net finance costs
Finance costs incurred in the year include bank interest of £0.7m 
(2007: £0.9m) and the pension finance cost of £0.2m (2007: £0.1m). 
Interest of £0.1m (2007: £nil) was received in respect of tax refunds 
collected from HMRC in relation to prior periods.
Taxation
The Group is not expecting to pay any UK cash tax in respect of its 
2008 trading results. Tax of £1.2m was refunded in respect of 2007 
losses carried back to prior tax periods.
The effective tax rate of the Group is 23.5% (2007: 29.8%) which 
is significantly lower than the standard rate of 28.5% (2007: 30%). 
The major reconciling items are due to the high level of expenses 
not deductible (mainly goodwill and asset impairments) and the 
additional deferred tax liability recognised for the first time in 2008 
following the change in the UK tax legislation in respect of Industrial 
Buildings Allowances (further details are provided in note 7).
Loss/earnings per share
The basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share were (13.55p) 
compared with (5.83p) in the previous year. There are no dilutive 
effects associated with share options granted under either the 
executive share option plans or the employee Sharesave scheme 
during the year since these options are currently out-of-the-money.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group is committed to its dividend policy announced in its 2007 
report and accounts. This progressive and sustainable policy aims to 
pay, when appropriate, 40% to 50% of net profit (before one-off 
items including goodwill impairment). 
In line with this policy, the Board does not propose to pay a final 
dividend for the year, and therefore there has been no dividend in 
2008 (2007: 5.40p). The Board believes that this is appropriate given 
the status of the turnaround plan and is fully consistent with its 
current focus on cash management. 
Financial position
The financial position at 31 December 2008 is summarised in the 
table below.
The reduction in net assets mainly results from the closure and 
disposal of businesses during the year and the devaluation in freehold 
property. The movement in the year has been split to show the 
impact on net assets of the businesses disposed or closed in the year.
Property, plant & equipment
A formal valuation exercise was commissioned at the end of 2008 
to update the market value of the commercial properties owned by 
the Group. This resulted in a devaluation of our properties of £4.6m 
which has been reflected in the financial statements. Of this £4.6m, 
£4.3m relates mainly to properties that were previously revalued 
upwards in 2007 and this has been taken against the revaluation 
reserve. The balance of £0.3m which is shown as an exceptional 
impairment relates to property values falling below historic cost. 
The Group has invested £3.4m (2007: £6.0m) in new capital, mainly 
the new paint line at Cooper Coated Coil (£1.6m) and the relocation 
of Samuel Groves to leased premises in Oldbury (£0.5m).

Goodwill and intangibles
In January 2008, the Group acquired Post Glover LifeLink Inc. (“PGL”) 
for a total cash consideration of £3.2m. PGL is based in Erlanger, 
Kentucky, USA and is involved in the manufacture of isolated 
electrical power systems and electric raceways for the medical, 
laboratory and education sectors. The PGL acquisition resulted in 
goodwill of £1.7m and intangible assets of £0.6m.
The annual review of goodwill resulted in a £5.5m impairment during 
the year (2007: £nil), relating primarily to businesses which were 
discontinued in the year (£4.7m). Of the remaining goodwill at the 
end of the year of £7.6m, £1.7m relates to PGL and £5.9m relates to 
the Consumer Durables division.
Movement in working capital
The Group maintained a clear focus on managing its working 
capital and achieved an overall net reduction in the year of £0.6m in 
continuing businesses in spite of building inventory levels at Samuel 
Groves in preparation for the relocation at the end of 2008. This 
results in higher stock days in the consumer durables at 31 December 
2008, compared to 31 December 2007.

The key performance indicators used in the business are reported 
above in respect of each reporting segment. They represent measures 
that enable management to monitor and drive the profit and cash 
generating performance of the businesses. 
Gross margins
Gross margins have improved year on year in Specialist Engineering 
partly as a result of the acquisition of PGL in January 2008. We are 
also seeing operational benefits in our Cooper Coated Coil business 
following our significant investment in the coating line in Wednesfield. 
Gross margins in the Consumer Durables Division were adversely 
affected by the strength of the US Dollar in the second half of 2008, 
which resulted in increased input prices. These increases were passed 
on to domestic customers to the extent that the market allowed.
Discontinued activities benefitted from increased sales prices to major 
automotive customers prior to the disposal of Bacol Fine Blanking 
and MRX Automotive.
Operating margins
Operating margins are stated before exceptional items and therefore 
year on year improvements are in line with gross margin movements.  
The Group continues to focus on cost management and where 
appropriate headcount and discretionary spend has been reduced to 
maintain operating margins.
Operating margins in the Consumer Durables Division are down 
year on year as a result of investment in sales and marketing at 
Samuel Groves as it transforms its business model and in establishing 
sourcing contacts and sales channels in China.
Stock days and debtor days
As mentioned above, working capital management has been a 
keen and a consistent focus for the Group during 2008. Good 
improvements were seen in the Specialist Engineering Division where 
stock days reduced year in year by 13 days to 57 days. Debtor days in 
this Division remained flat at 70 days.
The Consumer Durables Division saw an increase in stock days from 
68 to 102 due a planned stock build to cope with the resourcing of 
products from Far Eastern suppliers. Inventory levels will reduce during 
2009 but are planned to remain at slightly higher levels than 2007 to 
cater for the longer delivery lead times from these overseas sources. 
Debtor days within this Division deteriorated by 16 days to 67 days 
affected by the extended terms taken from our retail customers 
as their end markets softened during the last quarter of 2008. 
Woolworths were a major customer of our GW International business 
but good anticipatory credit control practices and regular contact 
with Woolworths operational management reduced our exposure 
significantly and minimized the incidence of bad debts.
Return of Capital Employed “ROCE”
Year on year improvements in ROCE within the Specialist Engineering 
Division result from improved operating margins noted above, and 
the reduction in property valuations and working capital. The Group 
continues to drive towards its Divisional target of 15% ROCE.
Pensions
The pension deficit over the year has decreased by £0.4m. Given the 
declines we have seen in investment markets over the last year, the 
reduction in the fair value of assets of £4.9m (30.0%) is not as bad as 
it could have been and justifies the position taken in 2007 to reduce 
the plan’s exposure to equities. The plan’s liabilities have also decreased 
by £5.3m (26.8%), principally due to the increased discount rate and 
lower inflation assumptions. The IAS19 deficit at 31 December 2008 is

£3.0m. The pension fund also concluded its triennial scheme specific 
valuation as at 1 January 2008 and the Group has agreed a deficit 
recovery plan and future contributions with the Pension Trustees based 
on this valuation. 
Treasury
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, whose primary 
responsibility is to manage cash flow and currency risk. The Group 
has transactional and translational exposure to overseas currencies, 
primarily the US dollar in PGL and purchases made by the Consumer 
Durables division.  
 
The Group has established a natural hedge for translational risk by 
denominating $6.0m of its net debt to cover its 2008 investment in PGL. 
The rapid devaluation of GBP Sterling against the US dollar in the 
second half of the year has resulted in a transactional exchange loss 
as our US dollar denominated purchases increased in GBP terms. 
Where markets allowed these increases were passed on to customers. 
As part of the Group’s hedging strategy forward cover is put in place 
to cover for currency volatility and is based on the Group’s forecast 
future currency cashflows.
Cash flow and borrowings 
Bank overdrafts and loans at 31 December 2008 stood at £12.5m 
compared with £12.0m for the previous year. The chart below 
categorises the main areas of cash movements during the year. 
The acquisition of PGL and the capital expenditure in the year were 
funded through cash generated from operations in the period.
The Group has committed bank facilities with HSBC, totalling £15.0m 
at 31 December 2008, of which approximately £9.0m has been drawn 
down. The Group also has uncommitted overdraft facilities with HSBC 
of £2.0m and with RBS of £14.0m, although the RBS facility was 
reduced to £7.0m following the renewal date in December 2008. 
Since that date, the overdraft facilities have continued to be provided 
by both banks is on an informal basis whilst refinancing discussions 
involving secured facilities continue to progress.
The Group’s bank facilities contain certain covenant tests relating 
to Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Borrowing costs; and 
Consolidated Net Borrowings to Consolidated EBITDA. The failure of a 
covenant test would render the facilities in default. The Group reports 
on these covenants to the providers biannually as part of the facility 
agreements. As at the year end, the terms of the facilities, including 
covenants, were met. The covenants are due to be tested next at 
30 June 2009. Due to the deterioration in market conditions since 
the year end it is likely that a covenant breach will exist at 30 June 
2009 and the Group is therefore negotiating to refinance its existing 
banking facilities. 
Going concern
The Group has commenced re-financing discussions with its bankers 
to secure fully committed facilities. The move to secured facilities will 
require the agreement of both the banks and the Pension Scheme 
Trustees. The Company is also seeking clearance from the Pensions 
Regulator. Whilst these negotiations are significantly progressed they 
are not yet complete and at the date of signing the accounts these 
facilities are not finalised. Without these facilities in place, there is a risk 
that the Group and the Company will be unable to continue as a going 
concern and therefore may be unable to realise its assets and discharge 
its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
The Directors have concluded that these circumstances represent a 
material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the Group’s and 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, 
based on the discussions to date with our current bankers, and 
considering the uncertainties described above, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The Directors have assumed that appropriate 
facilities with the current bankers will be available to the Company 
going forward. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Cautionary note
The Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review have been 
prepared solely to provide additional information to Shareholders to 
allow them to assess the Company’s strategies and the potential for 
those strategies to succeed. It should not be relied on by any other 
party or for any other purpose.
It contains certain forward-looking statements, made by the Directors 
in good faith based on the information available to them up to the 
time of their approval of this report. Such statements should be 
treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties, including both 
economic and business risk factors, underlying any such forward-
looking information.

Operating Environments, Risks and Uncertainties
The Group has identified a number of risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on its long-term performance. These 
risks together with the management policies and procedures put in 
place to mitigate them are set out below and are also discussed in 
the Corporate Governance Statement.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
successful in obtaining the necessary funding and for this reason 
believes it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. See the Financial Review 
on pages 14 to 17 for details on how the Group is mitigating this risk.
Macro-economic and competition
The Group operated in a number of sectors defined broadly by 
the two divisions: Consumer Durables and Specialist Engineering. 
It operates predominantly in the UK, USA and Europe. Thus the 
economic drivers for growth are reasonably well spread over a 
number of sectors with no over-reliance on any one. The Group 
has identified that the high-volume automotive sector is unlikely to 
meet future growth objectives and the Group has exited many of 
its operations in this sector. Future acquisition strategy (see below) 
takes account of the need to maintain a balanced approach to the 
economic drivers underlying the business performance. In the current 
economic conditions, financing acquisitions is not straightforward.
The markets in which the Group’ s businesses operate are highly 
competitive and there is a need to respond effectively to the demands 
of customers and the activities of competitors while maintaining a 
competitive cost base. In order to achieve a speedy response, the task 
of analysing threats and identifying appropriate mitigating actions is 
devolved to the divisional and operating business level. Competition from 
product sourced in China and other South-East Asian countries is seen 
as particularly significant for the Consumer Durables division and during 
2008 work has continued to strengthen that division’ s ability to access 
equivalent product and so maintain a competitive pricing/quality position.
Acquisitions
While organic growth is key to the future of the business the acquisition 
of new businesses may also help to drive growth; to improve overall 
return on assets; and to replace activities in areas where there are seen 
to be limited future prospects with those where the opportunities are 
greater and more in line with the Group’ s strategic thinking.
All acquisition brings with it risks, ranging from buying inappropriate 
companies, the diversion of management resource during the 
acquisition process, and post acquisition integration problems. The 
Group has put in place formal acquisition criteria and has improved 
the resource available to manage this process.
Financial and Treasury Risk
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
There are limited exposures to transactions in foreign currencies 
(predominantly US dollar and Euro) and, where significant, these 
are hedged by way of forward contracts. There is limited exposure 
to other treasury risks — this is discussed more fully in the Financial 
Review and in note 27.
Pensions Deficit
The Group has a defined benefit scheme which is closed to new 
members but which, in common with the vast majority of similar 
schemes in the UK, is operating with an IAS19 deficit. At 
31 December 2008 this deficit amounted to £3.0m (2007: £3.4m).
At the beginning of 2007 the Group increased its contributions 
substantially to help reduce the deficit more quickly and there is 
continuing discussion between the Board and the Trustees to ensure 
that all parties understand the risks. The Group’s cash flow allows the 
situation to be adequately managed.
The small decrease in deficit during the year, has arisen because 
of under performance of return on scheme assets together with 
changes to the underlying actuarial assumptions which drive the 
value of the scheme’s liabilities. These changes, including in particular 
a strengthening of the mortality assumption and changes to the 
discount rate, are in line with current actuarial recommendations.
Resources
The main resources available to the Group are:
n Employees who have an extensive knowledge of the markets 
in which their individual businesses operate and so can identify 
and react to opportunities and risk in a timely manner. There are 
policies in place to ensure that appropriate skills are attracted, 
trained and retained to maintain this skills base. 
n A strong portfolio of brands, each of which has a strong positive 
presence in its associated market.
Raw material prices
The Group’s principal raw material, across both divisions, is steel. 
Movements in steel prices are driven by global market conditions 
outside the control of the Group and substantial movements in these 
prices could have an adverse impact on the Group’s results. Where 
possible contracts are negotiated to include raw material escalation 
clauses to enable this risk to be transferred, at least in part, to the 
customer.

Report of the Directors
The Directors present the audited accounts of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2008.

Business review
The Company is required to set out in this report an enhanced 
business review of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2008 
which includes future developments. This can be found in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 6 to 12.
Substantial shareholdings

substantial holdings of ordinary shares at 9 June 2009 being 
not more than one month prior to the date of the notice of the 
Annual General Meeting.
Directors
The names of the present Directors are shown on page 21. They 
all held office throughout the year except for MJ Stock who was 
appointed Group Finance Director on 2 April 2008 and IH Paling 
(appointed 4 April 2008).
On 15 January 2008 WD Kelly resigned as a Director and as Company 
Secretary. DJ Farrimond was appointed Company Secretary from 
15 January 2008 to 16 July 2008. MJ Stock was subsequently 
appointed as Company Secretary on 16 July 2008.
Details of Directors’ shareholdings and service agreements are 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
At the Annual General Meeting the Director retiring by rotation will 
be JK Adcock, who will resign as a Non-Executive Director. 
 
 
Dividends
The Directors recommend that no dividend be paid in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2008.
The dividend per share paid in 2007 (comprising the 2006 final 
dividend and the 2007 interim dividend) was 5.40p.
Fixed assets
The Directors are of the opinion that, following the revaluation of 
freehold and leasehold properties as at 31 December 2008 (see note 
12) there is no significant difference between their market value and 
their carrying value. 
Payment of creditors
While not following any recognised code or standard, the Group 
policy on payment of all creditors is to abide by the terms of payment 
agreed with relevant suppliers. At 31 December 2008 the trade 
creditors represented 120 days (2007: 98 days) in relation to the 
average amounts invoiced by suppliers.
Charitable donations
Donations to charitable organisations consisted of £1,155 (2007: 
£5,618) for local charities, and £1,000 (2007: £1,000) for people 
with disabilities.

Directors’ Statement as to disclosure of information 
to Auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Report of the Directors are listed on page 21. Having 
made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s Auditors, 
each of these Directors confirms that:
n to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of their report of which 
the Company’s Auditors are unaware, and
n each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably 
be expected to have taken to be aware of the relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are 
aware of that information.
The above is in accordance with the provisions of S.234 ZA of the 
Companies Act 1985.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP are willing to continue in office as Auditors and a 
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Companies Act 1985 provides that Directors shall only allot 
unissued shares with the authority of shareholders in general 
meeting. The authority given to the Directors at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held in 2005 will expire on 22 May 2010.
Resolution 5 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution for the 
renewal of the Directors’ general authority to issue relevant securities 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,998,288, representing 
approximately one third of the current issued share capital of the 
Company. In addition, the resolution seeks authority for the Directors 
to allot up to a further one third of the unissued share capital by way 
of a pre-emptive rights issue. The Directors have no present intention 
of exercising either of these authorities. These authorities, if granted, 
will replace the Directors’ existing authority to allot shares.
The Companies Act 1985 also provides that any allotment of new 
shares for cash must be made pro rata to individual shareholders’ 
holdings, unless such provisions are disapplied under section 95 of 
the Companies Act 1985. The authority given to the Directors at 
the last Annual General Meeting to allot shares for cash pursuant to 
section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 expires on the date of this 
year’s Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 6 will be proposed as a special resolution for the renewal 
of the Directors’ authority to allot equity securities for cash, without 
first offering them to shareholders pro rata to their holdings. This 
authority facilitates issues made by way of rights to shareholders 
which are not strictly in accordance with section 89 of the Companies 
Act, and authorises other allotments of up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal amount of £299,743 (representing approximately 5% of the 
current issued ordinary share capital of the Company). The Directors 
have no present intention of exercising this authority.
The authorities granted under resolutions 5 and 6 will expire at the 
earlier of the next Annual General Meeting or on 13 October 2010.
Resolution 7 will be proposed as a special resolution for the renewal 
of the Company’s authority to purchase its own shares in the 
market during the period until the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company for up to 11,989,729 Ordinary Shares, representing 
approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company. The price payable shall not be more than five per cent 
above the average price of the middle market quotation as derived 
from the AIM Appendix to the Daily Official List of London Stock 
Exchange plc for ordinary shares of the Company for the five business 
days before the purchase is made and in any event not more than 
the higher of the price of the last independent trade and current 
independent bid as derived from the trading venue where the 
purchase was carried out or less than £0.05 per share, being the 
nominal value of the ordinary shares. It is the Directors’ intention only 
to exercise this authority where it would increase the earnings per 
share of those shares which are not re-purchased.
Shareholders are also being asked to approve a number of 
amendments to our articles of association primarily to reflect the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. If resolution 8 is passed, 
the new articles of association of the Company would be adopted 
effective from 1 October 2009 (when the remaining provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 come into force). A document containing an 
explanation of the main changes between the proposed and existing 
articles of association of the Company is enclosed with these reports 
and accounts.
Electronic Communications
Resolution 9 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to authorise 
the Company to send or supply documents or information to 
shareholders by making them available on a website. In order to 
communicate in this way with our shareholders we will also need to 
comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and obtain 
individual agreement from each shareholder. We are enclosing 
a consent letter with this notice of meeting to seek shareholder 
consent.
On behalf of the Board:

Corporate Governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance 
contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance that was 
issued in 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council (“the Code”) for 
which the Board is accountable to Shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code 
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2008, the Company has 
been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in section 1 of 
the Code.
Application of the principles
The Company has applied the main and supporting principles 
set out in section 1 of the Code in a manner the Board considers 
appropriate. The Group organisation, its business activities, and its 
financial structure are not complicated.
Direction of the Group relies not only on formal Board meetings but 
also on day-to-day contact amongst and between executive Directors 
and the management of operating divisions and businesses.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed to provide a balance 
at Board meetings and to bring their knowledge and experience 
to help in setting objectives and resolving problems. The Board 
considers that the Non-Executive Directors are independent and free 
from business and other relationships that could interfere with their 
exercise of independent judgement. The Board further believes that 
any shareholdings of the Non-Executive Directors serve to align their 
interests with those of the Shareholders. Each Non-Executive Director 
is subject to re-election at least every three years.
Composition of the Board 
The Board currently includes three independent Non-Executive 
Directors, being JRA Crabtree who is also the Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee; JK Adcock who is the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee; 
and IH Paling who was appointed on 4 April 2008. AP Pearson retired 
on 31 December 2008. JK Adcock has the role of senior independent 
Non-Executive Director. At 31 December 2008, there were two 
Executive Directors, AJ Richardson, Chief Executive, and MJ Stock, 
appointed Group Finance Director on 2 April 2008 and Company 
Secretary on 16 July 2008. WD Kelly resigned as Company Secretary 
on 15 January 2008 and DJ Farrimond resigned on 16 July 2008.
The Chairman, JRA Crabtree, has primary responsibility for running 
the Board and devotes such time to his role as is necessary to 
properly discharge his duties. The Chief Executive, AJ Richardson, 
has Executive responsibility for delivering the Group’s strategy and 
achieving operational and financial goals.
Board effectiveness
As required by the Code, the Board conducts annual evaluations of 
its own performance. The results of the process were analysed and 
evaluated by the Chairman. The conclusion drawn from the process 
was that the Board had performed effectively. The Board employed 
a similar process to review the performance of each individual 
committee. The Board reached the conclusion that each Board 
committee had performed effectively. During the year the Chairman 
met with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Operation of the Board
The Board meets at least 8 times per year and convenes additional 
meetings to consider matters that are time critical. Additional 
meetings are held annually to consider and review strategy and 
opportunities arising. Each meeting is supported by a full agenda and 
supporting papers distributed prior to the meeting.
The Board operates to oversee the Group’s activities and as a whole 
decides upon dividend policy, acquisition and disposal strategy and 
authorises major capital expenditure and other matters that affect the 
overall Group.
The Executive Directors review the day-to-day activities of the 
subsidiaries, manage Group finances, perform negotiations regarding 
acquisitions and disposals, recruit Directors of subsidiaries, and 
allocate resources to manage the risk environment.
The Non-Executive Directors are responsible for, but not restricted 
by, the duties as described in the terms of reference of the three 
committees, namely the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee. Details of the terms of 
reference for the committees can be found on the Group website.
The Executive Board oversees the day-to-day activities of the 
businesses and internal risk management as delegated to the 
management teams. Management decisions include the purchase 
of authorised capital expenditure, negotiating contracts or sales 
and purchases, recruiting and controlling employees as necessary to 
operate their respective businesses. 
The Executive Board meets at least monthly.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the Non-
Executive Directors of the Group. It is made up of JK Adcock, 
who chairs the Committee, and IH Paling. AP Pearson retired on 
31 December 2008. The Audit Committee’s terms of reference 
include all matters indicated by the Combined Code. The terms of 
reference are considered annually by the Audit Committee and are 
then referred to the Board for approval.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
n monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein;
n reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and, unless 
expressly addressed by the Board itself, the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems;
n making recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be 
put to the Shareholders for their approval in general meeting, 
in relation to the appointment of the external Auditors and the 
approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the 
external Auditors;
n reviewing and monitoring the external Auditors’ independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements; and
n developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of 
the external Auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into 
account relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, 
identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action or 
improvement is needed, and make recommendations as to the steps 
to be taken.
Meetings are held at least three times a year. Other Directors may 
be invited to attend and the Group Finance Director attended two 
meetings held in 2008. The Auditors attended all three meetings 
during 2008 and are also authorised to speak directly to any Board 
member whenever they wish.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up of JK Adcock, who chairs 
the committee, IH Paling and JRA Crabtree. AP Pearson retired on 
31 December 2008. The Committee meets whenever necessary and 
met three times in 2008. The prime function of the committee is 
to establish and review the remuneration, incentives and terms and 
conditions for the Executive Directors. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 30 to 32 shows how the principles regarding 
Directors’ remuneration have been applied.
Nomination Committee
The principal task of the committee is to ensure that the skills, 
experience and age of the Board is appropriate to the Group’s 
activities to ensure its future success.
JRA Crabtree chairs the committee which was made up of JK Adcock 
and AP Pearson throughout the year and AJ Richardson, subsequent 
to his appointment.
Having consulted with our professional advisers, the Nomination 
Committee met in 2008 in respect of the appointments of MJ Stock 
and I Paling and the consideration of Board succession. 
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and at least annually review the effectiveness of all 
controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and 
risk management systems. The Board confirms that the procedures 
which accord with the Guidance for Directors in the Combined Code 
have been in place for 2008 and up to the date of approval by the 
Board of the Directors’ report and accounts. They recognise that 
any system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.

The Group consists of a number of autonomous business units 
operating in a clearly defined divisional structure with clear lines of 
reporting. Each unit has the responsibility for identifying its own 
significant business risks and for putting in place an appropriate 
control environment and mitigation processes to reduce exposure. 
As such there is real limitation of the concentration of risk from a 
Group perspective.
The individual businesses operate under Group head office oversight. 
In particular:
n There are Group-wide policies for key areas of exposure such as 
Health and Safety.
n Some key business activities, such as providing insurance cover 
and employee retirement benefits, are managed centrally so 
allowing a level of expertise to be used which would be difficult 
to sustain at each operating unit. These areas are reviewed at 
least annually by the Board.
n Treasury functions are managed centrally and on a conservative 
basis to minimise risk.
n All major capital expenditure is subject to Board approval.
n A formal process of certification by the management of each 
business was introduced for 2007, covering control environment 
and compliance issues. This has continued in 2008.
n There is a formal budgetary process together with regular 
monthly reporting of financial and other performance against 
budget. This information is reviewed at each meeting of the 
Executive Board as well as at each Board meeting.
The Group’s external Auditors, Deloitte LLP , have audited the financial 
statements and have reviewed the internal financial control system to 
the extent they consider necessary to support their audit report. Their 
findings are reported to the individual units and also to the Audit 
Committee at least annually.
Internal reporting and control procedures have been strengthened 
to improve both quality and scope of business controls and 
financial information. This, together with a greater emphasis on the 
formalisation of strategic planning and risk review, will lead to a more 
robust position going forward.
The Group does not have a separate internal audit function, nor does 
the Board consider that the current scale of the operation requires 
one. The existing level of oversight is regarded as sufficient to provide 
the Board with reliable information. The Board is mindful to keep this 
situation under regular review.
“Whistleblowing”
Internal procedures are established to report grievances or 
suspected inappropriate behaviour that may cause detriment to 
other individuals or organisations. If it is not possible to deal with 
the matter locally because of the nature of the behaviour, any 
employee may email in confidence to the Group Chief Executive at 
whistleblow@metalraxGroup.co.uk stating the nature and location of 
the incident and this will be followed up appropriately. The Company 
will treat dishonest or spurious actions and accusations seriously; 
this may result in disciplinary action in accordance with Company 
rules and disciplinary procedures. Any employee raising any issue 
that proves to be genuine need have no fear of any reprisals and the 
Company will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure this.
This statement appears on the Group’s website.
Shareholder relations
Both Chairman and Chief Executive meet regularly with institutional 
Shareholders mainly in the periods following the announcement of 
interim and final results but also at other times, and the results of 
those meetings are communicated to the Directors.
Communication with private and other Shareholders is made both 
formally and informally at the Annual General Meeting which is 
usually attended by the full Board.
Directors’ responsibilities for financial statements The Directors are 
responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.

Our Business Our Governance Our Accounts

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS 
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial statements are also required by 
law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International 
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a 
fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
IFRSs. However, Directors are also required to:
n properly select and apply accounting policies;
n present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
n provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Auditors’ independence
The Audit Committee has responsibility for setting policy on and 
reviewing the external Auditors’ independence, a process which it 
performs at least annually. Day-to-day monitoring is delegated to the 
Group Finance Director.
The policy restricts the non-audit services which the external Auditors’ 
may perform to tax compliance work and other areas where the 
service will not conflict with their independence, either in terms of 
the scope or scale.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Introduction
We at Metalrax believe that the interests of our stakeholders: our 
customers, members of staff, shareholders and wider community 
shape the long term future of the Group. We are fully committed 
to our corporate and social responsibility activities and will continue 
to report on these in detail. To view our range of fully implemented 
policies please visit the Group website www.metalraxgroup.co.uk
Business Ethics
Our core values of empowerment, commitment, achievement, 
innovation and customer satisfaction were chosen by employees as 
part of a Group-wide survey. We use these values as a benchmark for 
our day-to-day business activities, which we insist are conducted with 
integrity in accordance with high standards. Our ethics policy provides 
a framework for the accomplishment of those standards. 
Our People
The Group firmly believes in and encourages equal opportunities 
and non-discrimination throughout the employment process for 
both new employees and existing personnel. We recognise that 
skilled and motivated teams of people are essential for our long-
term success, which is why our policies and procedures for dealing 
with recruitment, induction, conduct and personal development 
are designed to help us find the right people for our organisation. 
Primary objectives are to ensure fairness, consistency and opportunity 
in relationships between people at all levels of our organisation. In 
addition, we have published employee handbooks which are regularly 
reviewed and updated as appropriate.
We are fully committed to equal opportunities and non-discrimination 
throughout the employment process. In particular:
We ensure there is compliance with the obligations of the Disability 
Discrimination Act, meaning that applications for employment 
from appropriately qualified disabled candidates are given equal 
consideration for suitable vacancies. Should an existing member 
of staff become disabled every effort is made to enable them 
to continue their employment within the Group. Support in 
these circumstances includes training, adaption of the working 
environment and, where necessary, redeployment. In addition all 
property modification and development plans give consideration to 
their suitability for disabled personnel. 
We welcome job applications from all parts of the community 
irrespective of age, sex, ethnicity or gender orientation. Our main 
concern throughout the recruitment process and thereafter is to 
find the best applicant for a given role, possessing the most useful 
skills, ability and attitude to improve performance and help grow 
our business. We are proud of our team and where possible when 
vacancies arise, existing employees are considered for promotion 
before we embark on external recruitment. 
We recognise that skills are vital to the success of our Group and that 
training plays a crucial role in the development of our employees, as 
well as reinforcing and ensuring compliance with good standards and 
policies. 
We are currently in the process of reviewing management team 
members at every Group business. These reviews are supported by 
360° appraisals and primarily focus on business objectives, career 
development and associated training needs. 
As a result of the review, personal development plans are 
being constructed by each team member for agreement and 
implementation by their Managing Director, in addition these 
individuals have also received a performance scorecard detailing their 
objectives for 2009. 
In 2008 several Group companies, including Weston Body Hardware 
and Post Glover LifeLink, introduced new ‘purpose built’ training 
facilities at their offices, which are being used to educate employees 
as part of a continuous improvement programme. Other Group 
companies, including Sections and Tubes and Cooper Coated Coil, 
are working alongside dedicated local training providers to ensure 
that members of their teams are given the opportunity to work 
towards and achieve a nationally recognised NVQ qualification that is 
directly relevant to their skills base. 
The Group has a process of induction training throughout our 
businesses to ensure awareness of job requirements, key employment 
and policy issues; and Health and Safety processes. Such training 
policies and procedures are typically incorporated within businesses’ 
quality management systems. 
Communication
We hold divisional and Group meetings on a regular basis for 
the purpose of sharing information and seeking out mutual 
opportunities. We also hold executive management and finance 
conferences every six months to review progress, highlight successes, 
and ensure that strategic objectives are aligned. The Group issues a 
bi-monthly internal newsletter to keep employees informed about 
Group achievements, broader developments and other opportunities.

Customers
Customer Satisfaction is one of our core values and we believe the 
key to business success. Quality of product, delivery and overall 
service is paramount. The Group recognises the importance of formal 
quality management systems and has a rolling programme for all 
companies to achieve ISO9001 or enhanced standards.
Suppliers
Metalrax Group companies all observe strict guidelines when sourcing 
raw materials or products. Suppliers of imported materials are subject 
to additional controls regarding environmental and employment 
aspects of the business. Where required the Group employs 
independent third party bodies to monitor their activities.
Environment
We understand that our businesses have an effect upon the 
environment and consider environmental issues to be of high 
importance, which is why we endeavor to limit our impact insofar 
as is possible. Our operations for the most part use manufacturing 
processes, however, we make every effort to ensure that we meet 
and, where possible, exceed current legislation with regard to the 
processes we use. All UK sites are encouraged to work towards 
gaining ISO14001 accreditation where this standard has not already 
been attained and in 2008 our Metalrax Storage business gained 
ISO14001 certification. We are committed to responsible energy 
usage and strive to utilise both plant and equipment in the most 
environmentally friendly and cost effective way, enabling us to:
n Improve cost-effectiveness
n Reduce emissions in order to protect the environment
During 2008 our ISO14001 accredited business, Cooper Coated 
Coil, relocated to new premises in Wednesfield, installing a state-of-
the-art abatement technology solution in the form of an innovative 
heat recycling process. Furthermore this Company is expected to 
significantly reduce energy consumption following the final phase of 
the investment scheme in 2009.
The Group’s US based Company, Post Glover LifeLink, now uses 
entirely recyclable materials in the packaging of its products. In 2008, 
the business notably began using biodegradable packing peanuts, 
which are made from starch and dissolvable in water when they are 
no longer required.
Our respect for the environment means we comply with 
environmental legislation, associated regulations, authorisations 
and approved codes of practice. Our approach is one of sustainable 
development and we apply the following principles:
n Take account of the views of all stakeholders;
n Embrace continuous improvement methodology;
n Prevent unauthorised discharges to the environment and 
minimise the polluting effects of commercial activities;
n Comply with the conditions established by enforcing agencies;
n Develop an environmental management system that is acceptable 
to our stakeholders. This may require customer or third party 
approvals to a recognised scheme such as EMAS or ISO14001;
n Source raw materials and products from verifiable responsible 
sources;
n Provide resources to achieve environmental goals;
n Minimise the use of raw materials and conserve energy;
n Reduce waste wherever possible;
n Co-operate with customers and suppliers to promote 
environmental awareness at all levels within the supply chain;
n Review performance and communicate findings to stakeholders;
As we continue to implement our Group strategy environment 
will play an increasingly important role in the way we manage our 
businesses and the kinds of products we produce.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Directors’ Remuneration Report covers all the Directors, both 
Executive and Non-Executive. A resolution to approve the report will 
be proposed at the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 13 July 2009.
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration Committee
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee (the committee) is to 
determine policy for the remuneration and terms of engagement of 
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and senior Executives of 
the Company.
The committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company. The members of the committee during the year were:
JK Adcock (Chairman)
JRA Crabtree
AP Pearson (to 31 December 2008)
IH Paling (from 4 April 2008)
The committee members have no personal financial interest, other 
than as shareholders, in the Company. They have no conflicts of 
interest arising from other responsibilities outside the Company and 
are not involved in the day-to-day running of the Company. They do 
not participate in any bonus, share option or pension arrangements.
The committee operates under terms of reference available for 
inspection at the registered office or on the Company’s website. 
The terms of reference and constitution of the committee comply 
with the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance. The committee met four times during the period under 
review and there was full attendance on all occasions.
Remuneration policy
The Company is in a turnaround phase and operates in highly 
competitive markets. It is essential to the Company’s recovery 
therefore to recruit, retain, motivate and reward executives with 
the capability to devise and deliver a strategy that will return the 
Company to satisfactory levels of financial performance over time.
The committee seeks therefore to provide levels of remuneration 
that are consistent with this objective. In doing so, it sets salary levels 
which are appropriate for individual responsibilities having regard for 
the marketplace and sector generally and seeks to provide incentives 
to achieve strategic and operational goals and growth in shareholder 
value. Whilst the Company has remuneration policies and structures 
that should result in the majority of an Executive’s remuneration 
being performance related, the financial performance of the business 
during the past year has not generated performance related bonus 
payments. Mercer Limited provides independent advice on all aspects 
of Executive remuneration. Mercer does not provide any other 
material advice to the Company.
Remuneration of Executive Directors
The remuneration of Executive Directors consists of the following 
elements:
(i) Salary
Salary is determined at the beginning of each year and when 
a Director has a change of responsibility. The committee takes 
account of each Director’s performance in the light of its 
knowledge of rates of salary for similar responsibilities in other 
companies and of pay levels elsewhere in the Company.
(ii) Benefits in kind
These principally comprise benefits relating to the use of a 
vehicle (or cash equivalent), life assurance, membership of the 
Company’s healthcare insurance scheme and accident insurance. 
These benefits are not pensionable.
(iii) Annual bonus
Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme 
up to 100% of salary dependent upon the degree to which 
certain corporate and personal performance measures are 
achieved. No bonuses were paid in respect of the 2008 financial 
year performance. Certain individuals were, however, eligible 
for awards in respect of performance against agreed key 
performance indicators and personal development objectives. 
MJ Stock’s bonus represents an amount paid in March 2009 
which compensated him for loss of bonus from his previous 
employment as a consequence of joining the Company and was 
contractually committed at the time of his recruitment.
Bonus schemes are also in operation for senior Executives 
dependent upon pre-agreed corporate, divisional or business unit 
and personal objectives being achieved.
(iv) Share-based payments
The Directors believe that share options are an excellent method 
of aligning the interests of senior management with those of 
Shareholders. Executive Directors participate in the following plans:
2007 Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The Annual General Meeting held on 23 May 2007 approved the 2007 
Executive Share Option Plan. This enables the committee to also grant 
options, if it thinks fit, to any employee throughout the Company 
(including Executive Directors) to purchase shares at market value on 
the award date, subject to the achievement of Performance Targets.
Individual awards under the plan are limited to 100% of salary in a 
financial year. The committee has discretion to increase this award to 
200% of salary in a financial year in exceptional circumstances, for 
example, to support the recruitment of key personnel.
The performance targets attached to any awards are as follows: 50% 
of the awards will vest if the increase in earnings per share (“EPS”) 
equals the increase in Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3% per annum 
and 100% will vest if the increase in EPS equals the increase in RPI 
plus 5% or more per annum. Between these two points, awards 
will vest on a straight-line basis and there will be no vesting if the 
increase in EPS is less than the increase in RPI plus 3% per annum. 
The performance period will be three financial years starting from the 
financial year prior to that in which the awards are made. There will 
be no re-testing opportunity of the performance target.

Our Business Our Governance Our Accounts

Awards in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2008 
have been approved by the Remuneration Committee which will be 
granted later this year in accordance with the scheme rules. Options 
were granted under this plan in respect of the financial year ended 
31 December 2007 on 10 April 2008. Details of the grant prices and 
share options issued in respect of past awards are set out in note 
23 in the Group Accounts. Directors’ interests under this plan are 
included in this report. 
2007 Sharesave Plan
The Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2007 approved the 2007 
Sharesave Plan. This plan is open to all employees (including Executive 
Directors) who have completed six months’ continuous service. Under 
this plan the Company can, if it thinks fit, grant options at a price 
20% below the market price. Exercise of options under the Sharesave 
Plan is not subject to any performance condition. Details of Directors’ 
options under this plan are given in this report.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The 2006 LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting held 
on 23 May 2006 The plan provides that for each 1% increase in 
the Group’s pre-tax profits, participants will receive an option over 
shares worth 2% of their annual salary. Awards are only be made 
if Group profit before tax exceeds that for 31 December 2007 and 
subsequently the best Group profit before tax in excess of 2007. The 
performance target attached to the vesting of awards is the same as 
the ESOP above. At the present time, only AJ Richardson participates 
in this plan but no awards have been made to date.
One-off Long Term Incentive Plan for Chief Executive 
A one-off long-term incentive plan has been put in place for AJ 
Richardson to facilitate his recruitment and retention over the long 
term. Under this plan, he received a one-off award of 3,963,964 
phantom units on 10 April 2008. A phantom unit is equivalent to one 
ordinary share in the Company.
The award will vest after five years from the date of awards, subject 
to the achievement of a relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
condition. Performance will be measured over five financial years 
from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012. Therefore, 0% of 
the award will vest if the Company’s TSR is at the median of a 
comparator group consisting of companies in the FTSE All share Index 
and 100% will vest if the Company’s TSR is at the upper quartile or 
higher. There will be no vesting below median and the award will 
vest on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile. The 
vesting of the award will be satisfied in shares. 
The committee believes that EPS and TSR are both appropriate measures 
of performance: EPS measures the profit generated for our ordinary 
shareholders whilst TSR is a measure of shareholder value created.
(v) Pension benefits
The executive section of the Metalrax Group PLC Pension and Life 
Assurance Plan provides a pension at age 65 of two-thirds of final 
pensionable salary subject to completion of sufficient years of service. 
In accordance with Group policy, pensionable salary does not include 
any bonuses. If a member of the scheme dies while still in service the 
scheme provides life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary 
and a widow’s pension.
AJ Richardson and MJ Stock are not members of this scheme, but the 
Company contributes towards their personal money purchase schemes. 
They also receive death in service cover of four times basic salary.
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is decided by the Board 
following recommendations made by other members of the 
Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive. 
The remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Board following recommendations by the Chairman and after 
consultation with the Chief Executive.
Directors’ service agreements
No Director has a contract requiring more than 12 months’ notice. 
The Non-Executive Directors, whose remuneration is determined 
by the Board, do not have service agreements but are appointed 
for a fixed term expiring when they become due for re-election at 
an Annual General Meeting. They are not allowed to participate in 
share option schemes and are not eligible to join any of the Group’s 
pension schemes.
Compensation for loss of office 
Compensation for loss of office typically includes payments of salary, 
benefits, pension contributions and lump sum payments.
Directors’ other interests
No Director had an interest in any contract subsisting during the year 
which was significant in relation to the Group’s business.
Performance graph 
The Directors consider the AIM All share index to be appropriate for 
comparative purposes as it represents a broad equity index.

Report of the Independent Auditors 
to the Members of Metalrax Group PLC
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements’’) of Metalrax Group PLC for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements 
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes 1 to 34. 
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been 
audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in 
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific 
information presented in the Operating and Financial Review that 
is cross-referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ 
Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily 
chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the 
extent of their compliance with the July 2003 FRC Combined Code. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We 
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on 
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its 
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Operating and Financial Review and the Corporate Governance 
Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

Emphasis of matter — Going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not 
qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made 
in note 1 (see below) to the financial statements concerning the 
Company’s and Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Group is in the process of re-negotiating its banking facilities 
with its current providers. These conditions, along with other matters 
explained in note 1 to the financial statements, indicate the existence 
of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about 
the Company’s and Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would 
result if the Company and Group were unable to continue as a going 
concern.
Opinion
In our opinion:
n the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its 
loss for the year then ended;
n the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 1985, of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2008; 
n the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
n the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
Year Ended 31 December 2008
Stock Code: MRX Metalrax Group PLC  Annual Report 2008
Accounting policies 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Metalrax Group PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The 
consolidated and parent Company financial statements were authorised for issuance on 15 June 2009. These financial statements have been 
prepared to the nearest £0.1m. 
The address of the registered office is given on page 82. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 6 to 12, Report of the Directors on pages 22 and 23, and note 2 on pages 48 to 53. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the accounting policies below. 
Statement of compliance 
Both the Group and parent Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations adopted for use by the EU (”IFRS”). On publishing the parent Company financial statements 
here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not 
to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that freehold and long leasehold properties, derivative financial 
instruments and assets classified as held for sale are held at fair value. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, except 
for the accounting policy on intangible assets which is new in the Group in 2008.
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Intra-Group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for 
non-current (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.

Metalrax Group PLC  Annual Report 2008 www.metalraxgroup.co.uk
43
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Sales of goods are recognised when goods are 
delivered and title has passed. 
Construction contracts 
The Group undertakes long-term contracts for construction projects as a subcontractor. Where the outcome of a construction contract can 
be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet 
date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract 
costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are 
included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is 
probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost or valuation of the assets over the 
estimated useful lives after taking account of estimated residual values. Land is not depreciated. 
The principal rates and methods of depreciation used are as follows: 
n Freehold buildings, long leasehold property improvements and ground rents: 2% per annum on cost. 
n Short leasehold property improvement: over the period of the lease. 
n Plant, fixtures and fittings and office equipment: 10%–20% per annum on cost. 
n Motor vehicles: 25% per annum on cost. 
Leases 
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. These assets are 
included in the balance sheet and are depreciated accordingly. The capital element of the corresponding financing commitments is included in 
the balance sheet. 
Lease payments in respect of finance leases are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The 
finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
Year Ended 31 December 2008
Stock Code: MRX Metalrax Group PLC  Annual Report 2008
Financing income and costs 
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, and gains and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the Income 
Statement. 
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues. 
Interest payable on borrowings includes a charge in respect of attributable transaction costs, which are recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the 
income statement using the implicit interest rate method. 
Taxation 
The tax on the profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; the following temporary differences are not provided 
for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted on the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. 
Segment reporting 
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services (business segment) or in providing 
products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different 
from those of other segments. 
The Group primarily analyses its activities based on class of business. Its operational activities are undertaken mainly within the UK, with a newly 
acquired US business and a Romanian business and accordingly the Group’s secondary segments are derived by geographical activity. 
Impairments 
The carrying amounts of all the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement unless 
the asset is recorded at a revalued amount in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined 
using fair values at the balance sheet date. 
Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of land and buildings is credited to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it 
reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised as an expense, in which case the increase is credited to the income 
statement to the extent of the decrease previously charged. A decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and buildings 
is charged as an expense to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of 
that asset. 
Depreciation on revalued buildings is charged to income. On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property, the attributable 
revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable overheads. 
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of acquisitions since April 2004, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired. In respect of 
acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP . 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate any cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Any goodwill with an indefinite useful life is 
tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those 
regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The 
growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of 
future changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and 
extrapolates cash flows to perpetuity excluding any growth. 
If the recoverable amount of goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Other Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired on the acquisition of a business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives as 
follows:
Brands: indefinite
Beneficial customer contracts: 10 years
Computer software is stated at cost and is amortised over its useful life of 3 years.
Amortisation 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Other intangible assets are amortised 
from the date that they are available for use. The Group has identified intangible assets in respect of its customer base. The values of these 
contracts are recognised as part of the net identifiable assets acquired, and are amortised over the unexpired period of the contract, which is up 
to five years. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, overheads that have 
been incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

Financial instruments 
(a) Financial assets 
The Group’s financial assets fall into the categories discussed below, with the allocation depending to an extent on the purpose for which the 
asset was acquired. Although the Group occasionally uses derivative financial instruments in economic hedges of currency rate risk, it does not 
hedge account for these transactions. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity. Unless otherwise indicated, the 
carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets are a reasonable approximation of their fair values. 
(a) (i) Loans and receivables 
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables) and deposits held at banks, but may also incorporate 
other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. The effect 
of discounting on these financial instruments is not considered to be material. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or 
default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount 
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated 
with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised 
within distribution expenses in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value 
of the asset is written off against the associated provision. 
(a) (ii) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only ‘in the money’ foreign exchange derivatives to the extent that they exist (see (b)(ii) for ‘out of the money’ 
derivatives). They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or expense. Other than 
these derivative financial instruments, the Group does not have any assets held for trading nor has it designated any financial assets as being at 
fair value through profit or loss. 
(b) Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the liability was incurred. Unless 
otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values. 
(b) (i) Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
These liabilities include the following items: 
n Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. 
n Bank borrowings and loan notes are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest is 
recognised as a finance expense in the income statement. 
The fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash 
flow analysis using market rates of interest. 
(b) (ii) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only ‘out of the money’ derivatives to the extent that they exist (see (a) (ii) for ‘in the money’ derivatives). They are 
carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or expense. Other than these derivative 
financial instruments, the Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
The methods used for calculating the fair value of the Group’s interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives have been described in 
(a) (ii) above.

(c) Share capital 
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. Share 
capital includes the nominal value of the shares and any share premium attaching to the shares. 
Assets held for sale 
Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. 
Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances with less than three months 
maturity from the date of acquisition. 
Employee benefits 
Pension Schemes 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are 
equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted 
for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based incentives under four separate schemes, all previous schemes having lapsed: 
Executive bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
This was introduced during 2006 for certain key executives. To date no awards have been made under this plan. 
One-off Long Term Incentive Plan for Chief Executive
This award was introduced in 2007 to facilitate the recruitment of AJ Richardson. A one-off award was made under this plan on 10 April 2008. 
The award has been regarded as an equity-settled share option plan with a vesting period of 5 years. The fair value of this award was measured 
at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo model and will not be subsequently re-measured. Details of the vesting performance criteria are set 
out in note 23.
2007 Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) 
This plan introduced during 2007 allows the granting of options to any employee in the Group, including Executive Directors, subject to the 
achievement of certain performance targets. Awards were made under this plan on 10 April 2008. The award has been regarded as an 
equity-settled share option plan with a vesting period of 3 years. The fair value of this award was measured at the date of grant using the 
Black–Scholes model and will not be subsequently re-measured. Details of the vesting performance criteria are set out in note 23.

Year Ended 31 December 2008
Stock Code: MRX Metalrax Group PLC  Annual Report 2008
2007 Sharesave Scheme 
This HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme was introduced during 2007 and allows employees to commit to saving a fixed amount of salary 
each month, which can be used after three years to purchase share options awarded to individual employees based on the level of savings they 
have agreed to. As such it is regarded as an equity-settled share option plan with a vesting period of three years and with non-market based 
performance criteria. 
The first awards under this scheme were made on 24 October 2007 and will vest on 1 December 2010. The fair value of this award was 
measured at the date of grant using the Black–Scholes model and will not be subsequently re-measured. This fair value is charged to the 
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the actual level of forfeiture and the expected level of 
options that will ultimately vest. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency (foreign 
currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. 
Significant judgements and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management have concluded that the three areas of significant judgement and 
estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: 
Going concern
As noted in note 1, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be successful in obtaining the necessary funding and for this 
reason believes it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating 
unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £7.6m; £4.7m of 
goodwill was impaired on discontinued businesses and £0.8m was impaired on Premier Stairways. No impairment loss was recognised 
during 2007.

Long-term contracts 
The carrying value of both work in progress and amounts recoverable in contracts is carefully considered through an exercise of estimating the 
final position on completion of those contracts. This includes making a judgement as to the success of any claims, including those which may be 
subject to a legal process for recovery. 
Stock provisioning policy 
Provisions for obsolete and slow-moving stock are calculated using a systematic approach based on anticipated usage. This requires 
management at each business unit to make judgements relating both to the extent to which historic usage is likely to continue into the future, 
and also on the likely net realisable value of stock. 
Adoption of new and revised Standards 
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2008, but are not currently relevant for the Group.
IFRIC11, ‘IFRS2 — Group and treasury share transactions’.
IFRIC12, ‘Service concession arrangements’.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2008 and have not been early adopted.
IFRS8, ‘Operating segments’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. IFRS8 replaces IAS14, ‘Segment reporting’, 
and requires a ‘management approach’ under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting 
purposes.
IFRS2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Management is assessing the 
impact of changes to vesting conditions and cancellations on the Group’s SAYE schemes.
IFRS3 (amendment), ‘Business combinations’ and consequential amendments to IAS27, ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, IAS28, 
‘Investments in associates’ and IAS31, ‘Interests in joint ventures’, effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date 
is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Management is assessing the impact of the 
new requirements regarding acquisition accounting, consolidation and associates on the Group. The Group does not have any joint ventures.
IAS1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of financial statements’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Management is in 
the process of developing pro forma accounts under the revised disclosure requirements of this standard.
IAS32 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: presentation’, and consequential amendments to IAS1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This is not currently relevant to the Group, as the Group does not have any 
puttable instruments.
IFRIC13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008. This is not relevant to the Group.
IFRIC14, ‘IAS19 — The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction’, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2008. This is not currently relevant to the Group as the Group does not have an IAS19 surplus.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IAS23 (revised 2007), “Borrowing Costs”
IAS27 (revised 2008), “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”
IFRIC15 “Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate”
IFRIC16, “Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation”
IFRIC17, “Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners”
IFRIC18, “Transfers of Assets from Customers”
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2008), “Improvements to IFRSs 2008”
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group except for additional segment disclosures when IFRS8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.

Notes to the Accounts
Year ended 31 December 2008
1 Going concern statement
The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to 
be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
The deterioration in market conditions since the year end results in a potential covenant breach at 30 June 2009 and the need for the Group to 
refinance its existing banking facilities. The Group has commenced re-financing discussions with its bankers to secure fully committed facilities. 
The move to secured facilities will require the agreement of both the banks and the Pension Scheme Trustees. The Company is also seeking 
clearance from the Pensions Regulator. Whilst these negotiations are significantly progressed they are not yet complete and at the date of signing 
the accounts these facilities are not finalised. Without these facilities in place, there is a risk that the Group and the Company will be unable to 
continue as a going concern.
The Board has concluded that ongoing negotiations with its bankers represents a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. However, after considering the uncertainties described above the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be successful in obtaining the necessary funding and for this reason believes it is appropriate to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that 
would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern. 
Further details on the above refinancing is included in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 17.

b) Segmental analysis by activity
In January 2008 the Group was reorganised into two divisions — Consumer Durables and Specialist Engineering. The principal activities of the 
two divisions are as follows: 
n Specialist Engineering — a variety of precision manufacturing activities that incorporate value adding technology for unique applications in 
the medical, specialist metal coating and premium automotive sectors.
n Consumer Durables — manufactures and markets bakeware and associated ranges of kitchen accessories to both the retail and commercial 
markets in the UK and abroad.

b) Segmental analysis by activity continued
 In 2007, the Group was organised into three operating divisions — Housewares, Engineering Support Services and Automotive — and the 
segmental reporting was analysed on this basis. The segmental disclosures for 2007 have been restated to analyse the results of the business as 
if this divisional structure had existed at that time. The businesses classified as discontinued in 2008 were all part of the Specialist Engineering 
division and would have been reported in this segment in 2007.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the sale of specialist products which fall within the Group’s ordinary activities after deduction of trade 
discounts and value added tax. The primary segment is based on the activities and markets to which the individual operating business units serve 
and an analysis of external revenue and operating profit/(loss) are shown below:

3 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items of income and expenditure that, in the judgement of management, should be disclosed separately on the basis that 
they are material, either by their nature or their size, to the understanding of the financial statements and where not to do so would distort the 
comparability of financial performance between periods. Items which have been considered appropriate to disclose as exceptional include: profits 
and losses on the disposal of non-current assets; restructuring and reorganisation costs including profits or losses on the disposal of businesses; 
and significant impairments of other current assets.

  During 2008, reorganisation and restructuring costs were incurred relating to the closure of various businesses which are included within discontinued 
operations. These are disclosed further in note 4. Restructuring costs were also incurred relating to continuing businesses. These related to: 
n £0.8m of costs incurred as a result of the relocation of the Samuel Groves business to a new location at Oldbury and redundancy costs as 
the workforce was reduced to a level appropriate for the new business.
n Other reorganisation and restructuring costs of £0.3m at Commercial Bearings, BSC (Diecasting) and Weston Body Hardware businesses 
relating to redundancies.
n Head office costs of £0.8m relating to the redundancy costs of former employees.
(3)
  Following the exit of the Romanian automotive business,  a further £0.5m provision was charged in respect of the onerous contract in MRX 
Romania (2007: £0.7m). These contracts will end in September 2009. 
(4)
  Impairment of fixed assets, inventory and trade debtors mainly relates to the closure of discontinued businesses (see note 4) the relocation of 
Samuel Groves from Hockley to Oldbury in December 2008.
(5)
  Property dev aluation results from the impairment of land and buildings over and above the amounts previously taken to the revaluation 
reserve at 31 December 2007. 
The tax effect of exceptional items in the year is a tax credit of £1.7m (2007: £0.5m charge).

4  Discontinued operations
The Group has undertaken a review of its underperforming businesses and has taken actions to close or sell those businesses. The businesses 
that are no longer part of the Group are:
Bacol Fine Blanking Sold February 2008
Down and Francis Closed June 2008
MRX Automotive Sold December 2008
Welland Engineering Sold December 2008
Stackright Building Systems Closed December 2008
Makespace Mezzanine Floors Closed December 2008
BSC (Diecasting) Sold April 2009
All of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations in the Profit and Loss account on the basis that irreversible 
management decisions were taken in 2008, and the communications to interested parties, including the employees and creditors of the 
businesses involved, were completed in 2008. The trade, assets and liabilities of BSC (Diecasting) were sold in April 2009 and therefore has 
been classified as discontinued. Management is of the view that this presentation of information enables the users of the financial statements 
to understand the financial effects of these operations no longer being part of the Group.

During the year, the businesses that have been discontinued contributed an inflow of £3.4m (2007 inflow: £2.9m) to the Group’s net operating 
cash flows, received £0.9m (2007: £2.7m) in respect of investing activities, and paid £nil (2007: £nil) in respect of financing activities.
During the year management undertook a review of each of the business to identify underperforming businesses. The assets of these 
businesses were written down to net recoverable value during the year and therefore none of the businesses that were sold generated a profit 
or loss on disposal.
At the year end the assets remaining in the balance sheet relating to the closed businesses have been written down to the recoverable value. 
Where appropriate, assets sold after the balance sheet date are presented in the balance sheet as held for resale (note 16). 
The effect of discontinued operations on segment results is disclosed in note 2. Central costs that would previously have been allocated to 
these closed or disposed businesses have not been allocated in the results presented on the basis that these costs remain part of the Central 
Services.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 
The Finance Act 2008 included legislation which prevents the Group from claiming industrial buildings allowances on affected assets after 
2011. This change is introduced by reducing the rate of allowances that may be claimed from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011, at which point 
allowances will be removed. The Directors estimate that the enactment of this legislation has increased the corporation tax charge by £1.2m in 
the current year.

8  (Loss)/earnings per share 
The basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share are calculated using the (loss)/profit attributable to equity holders of the parent. The adjusted 
earnings per share uses this figure adjusted by the post-tax exceptional charges.

 There is no dilution in the loss per share calculation at the 31 December 2008. Diluted earnings per share needs to be disclosed when a 
company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease net profit or increase net loss per share. It would be inappropriate to assume 
that option holders would act irrationally in exercising out of-the-money options when the Company has made a loss and therefore the existing 
options have no dilutive effect in the current year. Since there are no other diluting future share issues, diluted (loss)/earning per share equals 
basic (loss)/earning per share for the current year. In the previous year there were no potential diluting future shares. 
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the basic (loss)/earnings per share, the adjusted earnings per share, and the 
diluted (loss)/earnings per share is therefore 119,897,298 (2007: 119,897,298).

Goodwill impairment
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill at the year end has been allocated as follows:
    2008 2007
    £’m £’m
Consumer Durables    5.0 5.0
Specialist Engineering    2.6 6.4
    7.6 11.4
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The impairment charge in 2008 of £5.5m (2007: £nil) relates predominantly to the discontinued businesses (£4.7m) and Premier Architectural 
Stairways (£0.8m).
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are 
those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs — 9.50% 
(2007: 9.75%). Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and 
extrapolates cash flows to perpetuity excluding any growth. 
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets comprise brands and beneficial contracts identified on acquisition of Post Glover LifeLink (see note 11). The brands 
capitalised are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life.

11 Acquisitions
On 25 January 2008, Metalrax Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the entire share capital of Post Glover Lifelink 
Inc. (“PGL”) for a total cash consideration of £3.2m. PGL is based in Erlanger, KY, USA and is involved in the manufacture of isolated electrical 
power systems and electrical raceways for the medical, laboratory and education sectors. The transaction was accounted for by the purchase 
method of accounting.
PGL contributed an operating profit of £0.8m on revenues of £4.2m in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008. If PGL had been 
part of the Group since 31 December 2007, it would have generated an operating profit of £0.9m on revenues of £4.5m for the period to 
31 December 2008. PGL has operated as within the Specialist Engineering division.

The cost or valuation of long leasehold properties included above is £3.9m (2007: £3.6m).
The impairment loss on plant arose in connection with the restructuring in the Automotive division. 
Freehold and long leasehold properties were revalued at 31 December 2008 by AtisReal Limited, independent valuers not connected with the 
Group, on the basis of market value. The valuation conforms to International Valuation Standards and was based on recent market transactions 
on arm’s length terms for similar properties. Details of the revaluation surplus are disclosed in note 24. 
At 31 December 2008, had the freehold and long leasehold properties been carried at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses, their carrying value would have been approximately £13.1m (2007: £16.6m).

The fair value of the Group’s bank loans and overdrafts at the balance sheet date was £12.5m (2007: £12.0m). For the Group’s other loans and 
borrowings, the carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the financial instruments’ fair value. The Group’s banking facilities are currently 
being renegotiated and it is anticipated that these facilities will be available to allow the Group to continue as a going concern (see note 1).
The Group’s bank loan facility allows the Group to draw down a maximum of £15.0m. This facility is currently being renegotiated due to a potential 
covenant breach in June 2009 and is currently restricted to the £9.2m drawn down at 31 December 2008. During 2008 the Group was able to 
draw down variable amounts for fixed periods, usually 6 months. The interest rate is fixed at 0.6% above LIBOR at the date of the drawdown and is 
payable at the end of the agreed drawdown period.
The Group has a bank overdraft facility of £7.0m which is being rolled over on a monthly basis. Bank overdrafts accrue interest at 1% over the 
bank’s base rate, are repayable on demand and are covered by cross-guarantees within the Group. Interest accrues on a daily basis and increases  
the balance outstanding on the overdraft.
The Group also has £2m drawdown foreign currency facility which it uses to fund the Group activities in US dollars and euros. Interest is payable at 
1% above the bank’s base rate and accrues on a daily basis. No amounts have been drawn down at this facility at the year end (2007: £nil). 
The loan notes formed part of the consideration for the purchase of Stackright Building Systems Limited and did not become payable.

Deferred tax on temporary differences has been calculated at the rate of 28% (2007: 28%). 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses carried forward on the basis that it is expected that there will be sufficient taxable 
temporary differences unwinding in future periods against which the benefit of these losses will be granted. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised on share options to be exercised at a future date.
The change in tax legislation in respect of Industrial Buildings allowance has resulted in an additional deferred tax liability of £1.2m at 
31 December 2008.

21 Pensions
Defined contribution plans
The Group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension plans and the total cost charged to income for the year was £0.6m (2007: 
£0.4m) representing the contributions due to the plans for the year. 
Defined benefit plans 
The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK for qualifying employees, which provides benefits based on final pensionable pay. The 
scheme is closed to new entrants. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with insurance 
providers. The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary employed by the insurance providers on the basis of triennial 
valuations using the attained age funding method. The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
The date of the most recent actuarial valuation was 1 January 2008. The value of the fund at 1 January 2008 was £16.4m and this was 
sufficient to cover 92% of the value of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for future increases in earnings. The contributions 
made in the year from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008 were at the rate of 30% of pensionable salaries for the Company and 12% of 
pensionable salaries for the members.

Capital risk management 
As described in the share capital accounting policy the Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and 
accumulated retained earnings. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent 
return for its equity Shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions. 
In order to achieve this objective, the Group monitors its gearing to balance risks and returns at an acceptable level and also to maintain a 
sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its capital 
structure to achieve these aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group considers not 
only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

Under the 2007 Sharesave plan employees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company based on a fixed amount each contributes 
monthly into a Save As You Earn account. The options are exercisable at a price which represents a 20% discount to the closing mid-market 
price averaged over the three days immediately prior to the date of grant. The options vest three years after the date of grant, although there 
is scope for early vesting under the plan rules in circumstances such as retirement, redundancy or change of control. Options lapse if they have 
not been exercised within six months of vesting. There are no other performance criteria applicable to the exercise of the option.

27 Financial instruments
Risk exposure and management 
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in 
respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements. 
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for 
managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note. 
Principal financial instruments 
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: 
Group  Company
n trade and other receivables n other receivables
n bank overdrafts n inter-company receivables
n trade and other payables n bank overdrafts
n bank loans n trade and other payables
n loan notes n bank loans
n loan notes 
The Group occasionally uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate and euro/
sterling exchange rate. At the balance sheet date, the Group had no outstanding contracts for purchase or sale of currency, nor had there been 
any significant contracts entered into during the year. 
Inter-company receivables are due on demand and so pose no liquidity risk to the Company. 
The Company is also party to cross-company guarantees with its subsidiaries relating to bank overdrafts as detailed in note 27. 
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities 
The Group and Company hold no financial assets or liabilities categorised as held for trading. All of the Group’s liabilities are unsecured.

General objectives, policies and processes 
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate 
responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the 
objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports through which it reviews the effectiveness of the 
processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. 
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness 
and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below: 
Credit risk 
Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables. It is the risk that the counterparty fails to discharge its obligation in respect of the 
instrument. 
Credit risk is managed locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are obtained from a 
reputable external source (for example Atradius, creditCHECK, creditsafe.com). 
Based on this information, credit limits and payment terms are established, although for some large customers and contracts, credit risk is not 
considered to be high, and credit limits can sometimes be exceeded. These exceeded accounts are closely monitored and if there is a concern 
over recoverability accounts are put on stop and no further goods will be sold before receiving payments. Pro forma invoicing is sometimes used 
for new customers, or customers with a poor payment history, until creditworthiness can be proven or re-established. 
Management teams at each division receive monthly ageing reports, and these are used to chase relevant customers for outstanding balances. 
The Board receives monthly reports, summarising the turnover, trade receivable balance and ageing profile of each of the key customers 
individually. 
A number of the Group’s businesses insure their credit risk. During the year approximately 29% (2007: 23%) of the Group’s revenue was insured. 
No major renegotiation of terms has taken place during the year. There are no customers with restricted accounts. 
Concentration of credit risk 
While individual businesses may each have a limited number of significant customers, these are usually blue-chip companies where the credit 
risk is assessed as low. Given the diverse range of markets and customers with which the Group trades, the credit risk is spread over a large 
population and no individual customer is significant to the Group. 
The carrying value of trade receivables recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk. Full details are shown in note 15.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. 
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will 
always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed facilities) meet expected requirements for 
a period of at least 90 days. 
The Board monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts against actual cash position on a monthly basis. At the balance sheet date 
these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected 
circumstances. The following table illustrates the contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities that must be settled gross based, 
where relevant, on balance sheet interest rates and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Market risk 
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign exchange rates (currency risk). 
Interest rate risk 
It is the Group’s policy to reduce interest rate risk by fixing the interest rate for the period of the drawdown on the £15.0m loan facility. The 
interest rate is fixed for the period of the drawdown at amount of 0.6% above LIBOR on the date of the drawdown. The bank overdraft and 
the foreign currency drawdown facility accrue a variable rate of interest at a rate of 1% above the banks’ base rate. Interest rates are monitored 
on a regular basis. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The annualised effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the variable rate debt carried at that date 
would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an decrease in post-tax loss for the year of £44,500 (2007: decrease in post-tax profit 
£42,000). A 50 basis point increase in the interest rate would, on the same basis, have increased potential loss by the same amount. 
Currency risk 
Currency risk arises both on the translation of currency assets and liabilities in the balance sheet as well as from operational transactions. 
Historically the Group has not hedged translational credit risk (primarily on its Romanian operations). Group entities settle liabilities 
denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Where Group entities have 
liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency they utilise cash reserves in that currency or transfer currency within 
the Group. Where the exposure is substantial they set up appropriate forward contracts to fix the liability.

27 Financial instruments continued
In order to monitor the continuing effectiveness of this policy, the Board receives a monthly forecast, analysed by the major currencies held by 
the Group, of liabilities due for settlement and expected cash reserves. The Group is exposed to currency risk on purchases made from a major 
supplier based in the USA and the risk is occasionally hedged using forward exchange contracts. Whilst this is an economic hedge of the cash 
flow risk, the Group does not apply hedge accounting. At the balance sheet date the Group had net trade payables of £nil (2007: £0.2m) 
denominated in US dollars. 
Currency risk sensitivity 
The effect of a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against sterling at the balance sheet date on the dollar-denominated trade payables carried 
at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in post-tax loss for the year of £nil (2007: increase in post-tax 
profit of £12,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased post-tax loss by £nil. 
(2007: £10,000).
28 Contingent liabilities
The Company had given various cross-guarantees in connection with Group banking arrangements. At 31 December 2008 the Liabilities under 
these arrangements were £12.5m (2007: £12.0m).
29 Future capital expenditure
At 31 December 2008 capital expenditure contracted for but not provided in these accounts amounted to approximately £nil (2007: £1.4m).

Notes:
1.  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a 
member of the Company) to attend and to vote instead of the member. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a 
member from attending and voting at the meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so.
2. In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office 
copy of such power or authority, must reach the Company’s Registrars, Computershare, the Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8AE 
not less than 48 hours (including any part of a day which is a non-working day) before the time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the 
meeting.
3.  As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, Shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated form must 
be entered on the Company’s share register at 12.15 pm on 11 June 2009 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting. Such Shareholders may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the relevant register after that 
time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) 
if a corporate Shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a 
poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that Shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll 
those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate 
representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate Shareholder 
attends the meeting but the corporate Shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a 
designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the 
other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate Shareholders are referred to 
the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives — www.icsa.org.
uk — for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed 
as described in (i) above. A letter in this form would be acceptable to the Company and its Registrars.

5. eProxy:
 If you would like to submit your proxy vote via the internet, you can do so by accessing our registrar’s website (www.eproxyappointment.
com). You will require the control number, your unique PIN (which will expire at the end of the voting period) and your Shareholder 
Reference Number (“SRN”), printed on this proxy card, in order to log in and submit your proxy vote electronically. You can access this site 
from any internet enabled PC.
 
6. CREST Voting:
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual 
General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members 
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST 
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) specifications and 
must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, 
be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (ID 3RA50) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in 
the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by the enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In 
this connection, Crest members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
7. You are entitled to appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by you. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, 
(an) additional Proxy Form(s) may be obtained by contacting the Registrars helpline on 0870 707 1179 or you may photocopy this form. 
Please indicate in the box next to the proxy holder’s name the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy. 
Please also indicate by ticking the box provided, if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed 
and should be returned together in the same envelope.

 In pursuit of its strategy the Group completed one 
acquisition, three disposals and three closures during 
the course of 2008. Additionally, three businesses 
were consolidated into other existing operations. 
 The £3.2m acquisition of Post Glover LifeLink (PGL) 
takes us into the growing market for the supply of 
specialist medical equipment, perfectly fitting the 
Group’s strategic criteria. 
 The closure and disposal programme for non-core 
businesses has moved apace. The Group started 2008 
with twenty-one operating businesses and finished 
the year with thirteen. 
 The Group has also successfully refocused 
its Consumer Durables division through the 
consolidation of its RTA Wineracks business into GW 
International, and by relocating its Samuel Groves 
operation. 
 During 2008 significant operational progress 
was made across both divisions through the 
strengthening of management competencies and 
through the restructuring of the Executive Board 
and the divisional organisation. 
 Move to AIM in June 2008, thereby lowering 
compliance costs and enabling the more efficient and 
cost-effective executive of restructuring activities.
Current economic conditions reaffirm the need for the 
Group’s repositioning into growing, defensible niche sectors 
in line with the January 2008 strategic review.

OVERVIEW
Business Model
The Group’s success critically depends on finding the right candidates, 
registering them quickly, and matching their specialist skills and experience 
to the particular roles of our clients. This is achieved through ensuring that we 
have thorough and detailed knowledge of our clients and candidates. We focus 
our consultants on niche market segments, allowing them to become experts 
in their field. By overlaying structured business practices across the Group we 
are able to deliver a consistent client and candidate experience.
Expert Knowledge in Targeted Markets
Our proven success is based on our niche 
market focus, which we serve expertly. 
Our consultants work in one chosen eld, 
recruiting either permanent or contract 
candidates, in order to become a true 
consultant through understanding market 
conditions by skill and by client demand. 
Many of our consultants have memberships 
with leading industry bodies providing 
added value to our clients through industry 
updates and networking opportunities.
Our expert knowledge extends beyond 
recruiting skills for current projects as 
we seek to be an in uencer on future 
recruitment needs. We maintain an 
active dialogue with large employers 
by presenting at their conferences 
and advising on the policy documents 
produced by trade bodies. Examples 
of the latter includes the British Marine 
Federation and the Royal Institution of 
Naval Architects. In addition, we make 
some 400 visits to universities each year 
to develop the employability of new 
candidates entering the markets into which 
we recruit. Our active participation ensures 
that we are well placed to understand the 
current and future issues a ecting our 
market sectors, rather than reacting only 
to clients’ current needs.
Skills Shortages
Understanding our clients’ requirements is 
key. There are high levels of unemployment 
in the UK and Europe, but shortages in 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) skills remain. The 
industries and the niche sectors that we 
supply are driven by global demand for 
UK products and services as well as large 
multi-year infrastructure programmes, 
such as building aircraft carriers, rail lines, 
or major energy and water projects. These 
programmes often require a high volume 
of temporary and permanent labour to 
meet project timescales and costs.
Mapping our clients’ upcoming projects 
allows us to be proactive in nding scarce 
skills ahead of time. Our research helps 
client tender processes and our subsequent 
action ensures that successful projects 
are not delayed or over budget due to 
skill shortages. 
The diagram below demonstrates how our 
market-leading internal processes bene t 
both our clients and candidates:   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 05
OVERVIEW
Candidate Attraction
Using our extensive market knowledge, 
we identify areas of in-demand skills. 
We have skilled resource teams who work 
closely with the consultants to attract these 
hard-to- nd candidates to the Group, using 
both traditional and innovative sourcing 
methods. Consultants then have the time 
to focus on building relationships with 
clients and candidates.
“I would unhesitatingly recommend any 
of my fellow engineers to register with 
Matchtech. This is due to your company’s 
diligence with regards to placing people 
with the appropriate skill set with the correct 
client. The experience of Matchtech customer 
service provided is without doubt vastly 
superior to any agency I have worked for.”
Current contractor
Through a range of candidate attraction 
methods, we engage both active 
jobseekers, on job sites or who we meet 
at events, as well as passive jobseekers 
who engage through social media or are 
registered on our database. Engaging with 
passive jobseekers, including those based 
internationally, ensures that we increase 
the availability of the talent pool for our 
clients and represent candidates on an 
exclusive basis. 
At the start of our last nancial year, we 
invested signi cantly in the marketing of 
our individual brands, including revamps 
of the websites, which encourage talented 
job seekers to register with the Group. 
Our candidate database, eMploy, was 
created in-house and is developed in 
line with our clients’ needs. Our advanced 
 ltering system, based on candidate 
availability, skills, experience and location, 
means that we form an initial list of relevant 
candidates quickly. The database also 
produces reports showing our performance 
in terms of quality, compliance and time-to-
hire, where clients can measure our service 
against agreed criteria to drive continuous 
improvement throughout our agreements. 
Candidate Selection
Currently, the UK recruitment industry 
is very competitive. One of the reasons 
we are an industry leader is that we 
have access to a high number of passive 
candidates as a result of our extensive 
database. In order to shortlist motivated, 
engaged and suitable candidates, we have 
a comprehensive screening and accurate 
selection process for all applicants, be they 
active or passive jobseekers. 
We review applications in line with 
the Employment Agencies Act (EAA) 
regulations and the Recruitment and 
Employment Confederation’s (REC) best 
practice. We check each candidate’s 
proof of ID and their right to work, before 
analysing their technical competence for 
the role. We also use our understanding 
of the client’s business to ensure that our 
shortlisted candidates have the soft skills 
to be a good cultural t at the client. 
Our screening processes reduce the time 
that our clients and candidates spend in 
unsuitable interviews. This improves the 
candidate experience, the time-to-hire 
and the levels of sta retention during the 
recruitment process and after placement. 
Our latest gures for our largest clients 
show an average 2.9 interviews per 
placement, demonstrating our capability 
in sending suitable candidates. 
Excellent Candidate Experience
With almost 30 years of experience, 
we develop strong, mutually bene cial 
relationships that see many candidates 
remain loyal to us in order to advance their 
careers; 31% of our current contractors 
on assignment have worked with us on 
previous engagements. We are pleased 
that candidates who register with the 
Group know that they will be valued and 
respected for their skills, experience and 
educational achievements and will be 
given considerable practical support and 
advice to nd their preferred job. Our 
candidates recognise that our breadth 
and depth of industry expertise ensures 
that they will be matched with respected, 
ethical, market-leading organisations that 
provide attractive opportunities for their 
career development. 
We have a comprehensive shared service 
function which provides a full level 
of support to our contractors from an 
in-house legal team through to running 
a weekly payroll service.
“I have been an automation contractor 
with Matchtech for 10 years. In that time 
I have always found Matchtech to be very 
professional. Matchtech have a very good 
understanding of their clients’ requirements 
and their contractors’ skills and I have never 
been mismatched with a client. In addition 
Matchtech are always quick to respond to 
requests or enquires and I can thoroughly 
recommend any client or contractor to 
use them.”
Current engineering contractor
By providing an excellent service, we 
increase the number and quality of 
candidates recommended to us by our 
current customers. 23% of the Group’s 
placements are a result of referrals from 
within our network. It is an e ective way 
to source niche or scarce skills quickly, 
and provides our clients with sta often 
unavailable through other agencies.
An integral part of our focus on candidates 
is that we have fostered a corporate 
culture on building long-term, sustainable 
relationships with clients and candidates 
on an equal footing. Despite the current 
challenging market conditions, our culture 
has enabled the Group to continue to grow.

Trading Performance 
The Board is pleased to report a strong 
performance by the Group, with both 
net fee income (NFI) and pre-tax pro t 
over 20% up compared with last year. 
Total revenues were £371.4m, an increase 
of 23% on the previous year, NFI of 
£36.1m was up 21% and pro t before 
tax of £8.0m was up 25%.
We were pleased to have achieved 
another record year for contractors 
on assignment, which at 31 July 2012 
stood at 6,700, a rise of 12% on the 
previous year. Contract recruitment 
across engineering and technology 
sectors exceeded our initial expectations. 
Permanent recruitment continued to be 
sensitive to economic conditions and 
consequently some clients and candidates 
took longer to commit to new roles, 
which lengthened the time to hire.
The Group’s growth stemmed from 
successfully taking advantage of our 
established presence in growth niche 
markets, strong client retention based 
on consistently rst-class service 
delivery, and from the much improved 
performance by the professional services 
brands, which were created in the last 
2 years. 
Further information on our trading 
performance is provided in the Chief 
Financial O cer’s Report on page 16.
Dividend
Re ecting the year’s good performance, but 
mindful of prevailing economic conditions, 
the Board is pleased to recommend to 
shareholders that the nal dividend is 
maintained at last year’s level of 10.6 pence 
per share, which makes a total dividend for 
the year of 15.6 pence per share (2011: 15.6 
pence) covered 1.6 times by earnings per 
share (2011: 1.3 times).

DESCRIPTION 2012 PROGRESS 2013 OBJECTIVES   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 08
BUSINESS REVIEW
People 
The Group has spent the last 2 years 
creating its new brands around the 
recruitment of experienced sta . With the 
brands now established and management 
in place, resourcing in these areas 
will return to our traditional graduate 
recruitment programme. 
We have a strong tradition of developing 
graduate employees who are mentored by 
senior colleagues, and have clear career 
paths that will encourage them to develop 
within the Group. 
As a people business, we work hard to 
o er our employees an enjoyable and 
stimulating workplace, which the Board 
recognises is important when having to 
remain exible to a wider marketplace 
that demands constant innovation and 
the ability to respond quickly to secure 
opportunities. 
The Board wishes to pay tribute to all 
our sta and to our contractors for their 
continued hard work and dedication.
We were especially pleased to be placed 
25th in the 2012 Sunday Times Best 
Companies to Work For survey. This is an 
award which is entirely based upon the 
feedback of our sta and re ects the high 
importance we place upon employee 
engagement.
Board and Corporate Governance 
During the year Richard Bradford and Rudi 
Kindts joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors. We welcome them both and the 
contribution they are already making.
In September I was pleased to announce 
the appointment of Keith Lewis to the 
Board with e ect from 5 September 2012. 
Keith has been with Matchtech for 19 years. 
He is currently responsible for Matchtech 
UK, the largest business within the Group. 
Chairman’s Statement continued   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 09
BUSINESS REVIEW
Keith’s elevation to the Board re ects the 
pivotal role that he plays. He has a long and 
consistent track record of success in driving 
forward our engineering business, and his 
executive experience and character will 
complement what is already a strong Board. 
On behalf of my colleagues, I congratulate 
him on his new role.
I would like to pay a special thanks to David 
Rees, a colleague of the highest integrity, 
who has worked with me for 20 years and 
contributed a substantial amount to the 
success of the business over that time. 
David stepped down as Group HR Director 
and left the Group in September. I wish him 
the very best for the future.
I have also reported separately on 
Corporate Governance in a Letter from 
the Chairman on page 34 of this report.
Strategy
The Group’s traditional strength in 
segmenting the market and delivering 
highly skilled candidates to a largely blue 
chip engineering and technology client 
base gives us continuing competitive 
advantage. 
From this strong platform we have 
identi ed many opportunities to continue 
to grow the business by nding new niches 
to supply and by further internationalising 
our sales e orts. Our strategy is to nd 
and analyse opportunities, but only move 
forward where we can largely de-risk any 
new business propositions. 
Diversifying into new sectors under the 
Professional Services brands of Barclay 
Meade and Alderwood has provided 
opportunities for further growth. In just 2 
years both brands have made signi cant 
inroads into their markets and have 
quickly positioned themselves as experts 
in their elds. Professional Services’ NFI 
was £5.7m, up 33% on the previous full 
year, representing 16% of the Group’s NFI 
(2011: 14%). 
Our international growth strategy is partly 
de-risked by supplying candidates to 
existing clients for their new international 
projects. This lowers the risks associated 
with opening o ces in new countries, 
and has the additional bene t of further 
cementing relationships with our client 
base by helping meet their needs. 
Of course, there are still challenges in 
 nding the right candidates, almost all of 
whom are specialists. To increase our talent 
pool we have invested considerably in our 
technology, brands and websites. We plan 
to strengthen our online presence so that 
our websites are one of the rst places 
where new candidates register when 
looking for new roles. 
Outlook 
Since our Pre-close Trading Update on 
2 August 2012 trading has remained in 
line with the Board’s expectations, with 
contractor numbers at record levels 
continuing to grow well, up 2% in the 2 
months to 30 September 2012. Permanent 
recruitment continues to be sensitive to 
global market news and has started the 
year on a par with last year.
The Group delivered 21% growth in 
NFI in the year ended 31 July 2012. Our 
diversi cation strategy is continuing to 
bear fruit and we are seeing unprecedented 
demand for contract sta within the 
engineering markets with a record 
number of contractors on assignment. 
The changes we have introduced over 
the past 2 years to the Group’s structure, 
position us well for continued growth, 
particularly by supplying more contractors 
to UK clients who have global demand 
for their services or are working on large, 
multi-year engineering infrastructure 
projects in the UK and overseas markets.
Whilst we remain mindful that any 
deterioration in the global economy has 
the potential to impact on our business, 
we look forward with con dence to the 
year ahead.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Continuing to 
make progress
Our vision
Our vision is to be a leading 
international recruitment 
group within the engineering 
and professional services 
sectors.
Our goal
Our goal is to ‘always exceed 
the expectations of our 
customers and lead the 
recruitment sector through 
effective delivery and 
quality of service.’
Chief Executive’s Review 
Performance Overview 
The Group has continued to bene t 
from the substantial reorganisation and 
investment for growth made over the 
past two years. In particular, our contract 
recruitment business, which accounts for 
around two thirds of net fee income (NFI), 
performed ahead of our expectations, 
throughout the year with growth being 
driven by strong demand for contractors in 
our traditional niches of engineering and 
technology and by the understandable 
attractions of exible labour during an 
economic downturn. 
This year we have enhanced the 
performance of the business through 
further investment in our professional 
services brands additional sales personnel, 
and faster more e cient IT systems. 
Our improvements make us well-placed 
to handle signi cantly higher volumes 
of business. 
The Group has once again delivered a 
creditable performance with NFI growth 
of 21% on the previous year, contributing 
to a 25% increase in pro t before tax. The 
mix between contract NFI and permanent 
fees remained the same as the previous 
year at 68%:32%. 
Contractor numbers continue to increase. 
At 31 July 2012 there were 6,700 
contractors, an increase of 12% on the 
previous year, and up 3% on 31 January 
2012. Contract margins stabilised at 6.6% 
for the full year 2012. 
The increased number of contractors 
re ected continuing strong demand for 
contract sta in our main sectors, driven 
mostly by existing clients working on 
global, multi-year programmes. Growth 
also stemmed from supplying contractors 
to major UK infrastructure projects in the 
marine, rail and water sectors.
Greatly assisted by the brands in 
professional services, permanent fees rose 
by 22% compared with the previous year, 
with average placement fees essentially 
stable throughout each quarter of 2012. 
However, we have seen clients extending 
the typical time to hire. 
Business Plan 
The Group’s success has been built on 
a core strategy of attracting the best 
candidates (see pages 4 and 5). We 
believe that by nding strong candidates 
and making their interests central to our 
success, we will ensure that our clients 
are supplied with the right people, at 
the right time, for the right roles. By 
understanding the requirements of our 
clients, and by knowing our candidates 
thoroughly, we deliver by being able to 
scan, screen, shortlist and present our 
candidates more e ectively and quicker 
than our competitors.
We have now completed the rst year of 
our 5 year business plan and have made 
encouraging progress against our 7 Key 
Aims, set out below, which are absolutely 
integral to the business, and which provide 
the framework for delivering growth.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 11
BUSINESS REVIEW
As a result of working for many global businesses 
we have, in the last 12 months, supplied candidates 
to 25 di erent countries, lling roles for highly 
skilled engineering positions that demand some 
of the industry’s most able and talented candidates.
Currently, our German operation in Stuttgart is the Group’s 
only in-country overseas o ce. All other countries are served 
directly from the UK, via a network of well-established 
a liate relationships. 
Working from the UK has not restricted our ability to 
supply contractors to some major overseas programmes. 
For example, we have over 40 contractors placed in 
Kazakhstan on a major oil and gas project. 
We have just started working in China supplying design 
engineers to the aerospace industry. We are working with 
a locally-based partner to ful l this recent contract. 
 
Looking ahead, we anticipate that in the medium term the 
Group’s international expansion will be supplied largely 
from the UK, supplemented by a small number of additional 
in-country o ces. Operating in Germany has taught us 
the importance of adapting our model to t the country’s 
requirements. We are currently exploring selective new 
locations for new country o ces, focusing on fast-growing 
emerging markets and those where we can bene t from 
existing client relationships. 
Extending our 
international reach
CASE STUDY
1. Expanding our sector diversi cation 
and geographical reach by building 
on our early successes and looking at 
opportunities to grow into new sectors 
and additional strategic locations within 
the UK. 
2. Increasing the NFI we generate per 
employee by focusing on developing 
existing client relationships and 
winning new business outside the 
engineering sector. 
3. Building our conversion ratio of 
NFI to pro t from operations as our 
investments mature, continuing the 
Group’s ability to generate high levels 
of return from NFI. 
4. Enhancing internal systems’ 
performance and controls to deliver an 
even faster, more e cient and robust 
service to our clients and candidates. 
5. Improving our sta retention levels by 
continuing to look at sta engagement 
and providing career opportunities. 
This is a key factor in determining 
how fast the Group can grow. 
6. Maximising cross-selling opportunities 
across the Group by utilising the 
increasingly varied client base being 
created with our expanding brands. 
7. Extending our international reach by 
developing a structured rollout of 
international opportunities.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Strategic Developments 
In January 2012, the Group acquired 
certain assets of Xchanging Resources 
Services Limited (XRS), the contingency 
recruitment arm of Xchanging plc. The 
assets have quickly been integrated into 
the Group giving us greater access to its 
client base. This will increase our scope to 
expand into new Technology markets and 
helps us forge even closer links with one 
of our largest clients.
In June 2012, Matchtech met an important 
Group goal by signing its rst framework 
agreement with a strategic partner in 
China. This contract is for design engineers 
for the rapidly expanding Chinese 
aerospace industry. 
Management and Staff 
I wish to thank sta and management for 
another year in which they have applied 
hard work, resourcefulness and creativity 
to produce a strong nancial performance. 
It is a privilege to lead a business that is 
full of intelligent and talented individuals 
whom I believe serve our clients and 
candidates so well. 
Our nancial success is built on both 
the service ethos we cultivate and guard 
closely and from our culture which allies 
entrepreneurial air to strong relationship 
management. 
All of the Group’s sta work towards one 
common set of values: Teamwork, Integrity, 
Enthusiasm, Innovation, and Fun. We 
are also united behind our 7 Key Aims, 
which provide an excellent framework 
for delivering further growth. 
As a people business we also understand 
the importance of personal development. 
This is why we have continued to invest in 
developing our sta , including supporting 
them with considerably improved IT 
systems and shared services functions. 
I would like to add my congratulations to 
those of the Chairman to Keith Lewis on his 
promotion to the Board.
Divisional Performance
Matchtech UK operates in 4 key 
sectors: Engineering, Built Environment, 
Information Systems & Technology and 
Science & Medical. This was a record year 
for Matchtech UK with unprecedented 
demand for contract sta in its markets, 
and a record number of contractors on 
assignment. Matchtech UK contractor 
numbers grew from 5,250 at the start 
of the year to 5,850 at the year end. 
Engineering, the largest sector in 
Matchtech UK representing 44% of 
NFI, performed well again in 2012. NFI 
increased by 19% on the previous year, 
with strong demand across all areas, 
particularly in the Civil Aerospace, 
Automotive and Marine sectors. 
Built Environment, grew contractor 
numbers by 8% to 1,400, and produced 
NFI growth of 9%, which came primarily 
from Water and Rail infrastructure projects. 
Information Systems & Technology saw 
NFI grow by 26% on the previous full year. 
Growth was aided by the convergence 
of technology in Electronic Systems and 
Business Applications, which play to our 
strengths in niche service delivery.
Science & Medical grew steadily with NFI 
up 11% on 2011. 
elemense, our Managed Services business, 
provides account management support 
for key clients, which indirectly generates 
revenue for the Group.
elemense plays an important role in 
client retention by ensuring key contracts 
are constantly monitored and Service 
Level Agreements are delivered. The 
client handling skills are essential in 
fostering strong client relationships and 
have provided many new business leads 
in permanent recruitment across the Group.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
In the Chairman’s statement, he announced that 
the Board has proposed the same level of dividend 
as last year. It is a testament to the financial 
strength of the business that has allowed us to 
maintain the same level of dividend since 2008 
throughout the unstable economic times of the 
last few years.

Pro t from operations
Having now completed the initial investment 
phase to diversify, broaden and internationalise 
our services, one of our most important goals is  
to restore the Group’s historically strong levels  
of NFI conversion to pro t from operations. 
One way is by developing our sta to increase 
each individual’s NFI.
This year we have also introduced a graduate training 
programme in Professional Services. We plan to turn new 
graduates into high ying professionals, ultimately able 
to produce some of the best NFI per head in our industry.
The changes we have made this year and last have increased 
the speed and functionality of our internal systems, allowing 
us to process candidates more e ciently. Our proprietary 
database and CRM technology, in which we have invested 
considerable time, gives us a strong competitive advantage 
in quickly processing new candidates and in managing 
client and candidate relationships. We will continue to 
enhance our systems via our in-house team of 8 full time 
technology developers. 
Also, by using shared services more e ciently across the 
Group, we will continue to increase NFI and lift operating 
pro t. Furthermore, we will constantly examine xed 
overheads and seek to make more savings where applicable, 
again improving the conversion ratio of NFI to pro t 
from operations.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Matchtech Germany, a business which 
we opened in 2009, targets the Aerospace, 
Automotive and Energy sectors. Trading 
in Germany continues to gain momentum 
with NFI up 50% to £0.9m, achieving some 
excellent business development wins, 
despite growth being restricted by the 
shortage of available candidates. The loss 
before tax increased to £0.4m (2011: £0.1m).
A key challenge, therefore, is to attract 
more quali ed engineers for the German 
market, which is where our focus lies 
in the year ahead. As part of this e ort 
we re-launched our German website to 
have the ‘look and feel’ of an engineering 
consultancy, which is a much better t with 
the German labour leasing business model. 
The Professional Services brands, 
Barclay Meade and Alderwood continue 
to make progress.
Barclay Meade focuses on Finance & 
Accountancy, Marketing, Procurement 
& Supply Chain, HR and Sales. Alderwood 
focuses on the Skills and Employability 
markets. Setting up these 2 new 
professional Services brands, and 
establishing them rmly in their 
marketplace, has been an important 
stepindiversifying the business.
Barclay Meade continues to develop 
well, and has established good brand 
recognition in the permanent SME market, 
and is working with approximately 300, 
mainly medium sized, client companies. 
We intend to scale up the business by 
recruiting more graduate consultants,  
who will be guided and mentored by  
more experienced colleagues, which  
will enable Barclay Meade to continue 
togrow market share, while improving 
itsoperating margins. 
For its size and relative youth of the brand, 
Alderwood has exceeded expectations in 
the Welfare to Work market, working for 8 
of the 12 main providers. It has also made 
good headway in the Work-Based Learning 
market, providing assessors for National 
Vocational Quali cations (NVQs). Looking 
forward, we expect to increase placements 
in both sectors.
New reporting structure
In order to improve stakeholders’ 
understanding of the Group as it continues 
to diversify, we will be introducing a 
simpli ed reporting structure for the 
 nancial year to 31 July 2013. The business 
will be managed into 2 distinct segments, 
Engineering and Professional Services. 
The Engineering segment will operate 
under the Matchtech brand and will be led 
by Keith Lewis. It will include Matchtech 
Germany and also elemense, the Managed 
Services business, which supports 
Matchtech’s large framework agreements.
The Professional Services segment will 
comprise the existing Barclay Meade 
and Alderwood brands, along with the 
Information Systems & Technology sector, 
which was previously within Matchtech. 
This latter sector is more aligned with the 
Professional Services businesses where its 
pro le bears a closer t and opportunities 
for cross-selling will be greater.
An indicative representation of the 
 nancial performance this new structure 
can be found in Note 2 of the nancial 
statements on page 56.
The clarity that this new structure provides 
will allow us to maximise opportunities 
across the Group and I look forward to 
giving shareholders an initial update  
on progress with the interim results 
in April 2013.

This year we have enhanced our Links Programme 
to create greater focus on a select list of key

the aim of Links is to bring together the teams 
within the Group to help increase and maximise 
our activity with key clients.
By mapping the structure of key clients and the services we 
were providing, we were able to identify clients with which 
we had solid trading but where there was also signi cant 
growth potential. In addition we were able to introduce 
new service o erings that were not previously provided.
In the last 12 months we have seen a threefold increase in 
the number of internal delivery teams invoicing Links clients 
compared with the previous year. In this nancial year Links 
clients have delivered 55% of the Group’s NFI growth. 
Links provides a platform for collaboration across the Group. 
It places responsibility on management for the strategic 
development of each client, whilst bringing together 
consistent service delivery.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Chief Financial O cer’s Report 
Adding value  
to our clients
Revenue and Net fee income (NFI) 
The Group generated revenue of £371.4m, 
a rise of 23% on the previous year  
(2011: £301.8m), with NFI for the year  
of £36.1m, up 21% (2011: £29.8m). 
Contractor numbers on assignment 
continued to grow, nishing the year on 
6,700, up 12% on the starting position of 
6,000. This growth in numbers contributed 
to an increase of 21% in contract NFI to 
£24.6m (2011: £20.4m). 
Permanent recruitment fees of £11.5m 
were up 22% (2011: £9.4m). However, the 
average weekly fees billed each quarter 
essentially remained at throughout the 
year. Information on the performance of 
Group businesses is provided in the Chief 
Executive O cer’s Review on page 10. 
Overheads and NFI Conversion 
Overheads in the year increased by 20%, 
resulting in a slight increase in the NFI 
conversion rate to 24% (2011: 23%). We 
are in a position to start improving the NFI 
conversion rate going forwards (see the 
case study on page 13).
Profit and Earnings Per Share 
Pro t from operations was £8.7m, up 28% 
(2011: £6.8m). The increase of £1.9m from 
2011 was mainly due to successfully taking 
advantage of our established presence 
in growth niche markets, strong client 
retention based on consistently rst-class 
service delivery, and from the encouraging 
improved performance by the professional 
services brands, which we have created in 
the last 2 years.
The structure of the business and our July 
year end mean that there is a strong second 
half weighting to our pro ts, with the half 
year splits similar to last year, H1 39%;  
H2 61% (2011: H1 34%; H2 66%).
The Group generated pro t before tax of 
£8.0m, up 25% (2011: £6.4m) and pro t 
after tax of £5.7m (2011: £4.7m). The 
e ective tax rate has increased to 28.5% 
(2011: 25.9%) due to higher non tax 
deductible professional fees and increased 
losses incurred by Matchtech Germany. 
Basic earnings per share rose by 20% 
to 24.34 pence (2011: 20.26 pence) and 
diluted earnings per share of 23.49 pence 
up 19% (2011: 19.74 pence). 
Dividends 
The Board proposes an unchanged nal 
dividend for the year of 10.6 pence per 
share which, if approved by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 
Friday 16 November 2012, will be payable 
on 7 December 2012 to those shareholders 
registered on 9 November 2012. 
When added to the interim dividend of 5 
pence per share this makes an unchanged 
total dividend for the year of 15.6 pence 
per share, giving dividend cover of 1.6 
times (2011: 1.3 times).

(2011: £1.5m) consist of the Group’s 
motor eet, o ce equipment, leasehold 
improvements and computer equipment. 
Intangible assets at 31 July 2012 of £0.5m 
(2011: £0.1m) consist of £0.3m being the 
amortised acquisition cost of XRS, which 
will be amortised over a 2 year period, and 
external software licences of £0.2m which 
are amortised over the expected life of 
the licence. 
Working Capital, Cash Flow and Net Debt 
Current debtor days at the year end were 
improved to 50 (31 July 2011: 53).
Net cash from operating activities was 
£6.5m (2011: out ow of £7.4m) with 
an operating cash conversion of 106%

Con dential Invoice Discounting facility 
with Barclays Bank plc. 
In June 2012 the Group agreed an increase 
in its facilities with Barclays from £35m to 
£50m, on improved terms, committed until 
June 2015. 
The facility ceiling currently stands at 
the lower of £50m or 90% of qualifying 
invoiced debtors and interest on borrowing 
is at Barclays bank base rate plus 2.00%. 
At 31 July 2012 the balance on the 
Con dential Invoice Discounting facility 
was £15.1m.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 17
BUSINESS REVIEW
The Group has recorded strong profitable growth in 
the year. Having diversified the business with new 
brands in new markets, we are starting to see the 
results come through. Whilst there is still work to  
do to restore the Group’s historically high NFI 
conversion, I believe we have the right people in 
place to deliver further progress in the coming years. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
The Statement of Signi cant Accounting 
Policies is set out in Note 1 to the Financial 
Statements. 
The Group’s Revenue Recognition policy 
may be summarised as: 
 Contract revenue, and hence contract 
net fee income, is only recognised upon 
receipt of a client signed timesheet 
 Permanent fees are only recognised 
following con rmation by the client that 
the candidate has started work 
 Other fees are recognised on 
con rmation from the client committing 
to the agreement 
The Group makes estimates and 
assumptions regarding the future. 
Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. In the 
future, actual experience may di er from 
these estimates and assumptions. 
The Board considers that the estimates 
and assumptions which have a signi cant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next nancial year are the 
measurement of tangible assets (where 
the Group estimates useful lives for the 
purposes of depreciation). 
Group Financial Risk Management 
The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing nancial risks. The Group’s 
Finance function is responsible for 
managing investment and funding 
requirements including banking and cash 
 ow monitoring. It seeks to ensure that 
adequate liquidity exists at all times in 
order to meet its cash requirements. 
The Group’s strategy is to nance its 
operations through a mixture of cash 
generated from operations and, where 
necessary, equity nance and borrowings 
by way of bank facilities and working 
capital nance.
The Group’s nancial instruments comprise 
borrowings, cash and various items, such 
as trade receivables and trade payables 
that arise from its operations. The main 
purpose of these nancial instruments is to 
 nance the Group’s operations. The Group 
does not trade in nancial instruments. The 
main risks arising from the Group’s nancial 
instruments are described below. 
Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk 
The Group had net debt of £14.5m at the 
year end, comprising £15.1m debt less 
£0.6m cash. The Group’s exposure to 
market risk for changes in interest rates 
relates primarily to the Group’s bank 
loan and sales nancing facility debt 
obligations. Bank interest is charged 
on a oating rate basis. 
Credit Risk 
The Group trades only with recognised, 
creditworthy third parties. Receivable 
balances are monitored on an ongoing 
basis with the result that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts is not signi cant. 
There are no signi cant concentrations of 
credit risk within the Group, with no single 
debtor accounting for more than 18% 
(2011: 14%) of total receivables balances 
at 31 July 2012. 
Foreign Currency Risk 
The Board considers that the Group does 
not have any material risks arising from the 
e ects of exchange rate uctuations.

BUSINESS REVIEW
 
The Group has a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have  
a material impact on its long-term performance. Many of these are common to 
other companies. We recognise that effective risk management is fundamental 
to helping achieve our strategic objectives.
To enable it to deliver value to all 
stakeholders, the Board endeavours to 
mitigate these risks where possible. In 
order to achieve its business objectives, 
the Group must respond e ectively to the 
associated risks. The Group has established 
risk management procedures, involving 
the identi cation and monitoring of 
strategic and operational risks at various 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
RISK AREA AND POTENTIAL IMPACT GROUP STRATEGY MITIGATION
MARKET
The economic cycle The level of recruitment 
activity is largely linked to the general 
performance of the economy. A cyclical 
downturn can lead to uncertainty in 
businesses, which affects their confidence 
in the recruitment of permanent staff
The Group focuses on 
maintaining a strong bias 
towards being a contractor-
led recruitment business
 Just under 70% of the Group’s net fee income (NFI) 
is recurring contract business across a broad range 
of sectors and clients
 The Group’s client base largely consists of businesses 
working on long-term projects
 The engineering sector, because of its project-based 
nature, demands a flexible workforce which drives 
demand for contract labour
UK Public Sector expenditure Changes 
to public expenditure levels could have 
an impact on recruitment demand. This 
in turn could affect the Group’s NFI that 
is ultimately derived from the UK public 
sector funding
The Group continually 
reviews its direct and 
indirect exposure to the 
Public Sector seeking to 
ensure a balanced and 
varied portfolio of Public 
Sector business
 The Group’s Public Sector funded NFI is derived 
from many parts of the Public Sector, with few large 
concentrations of contractors working on single projects
 Approximately three-quarters of the Group’s Public 
Sector funded NFI is generated with outsourced 
providers working on long-term contracts
 The majority of the Group’s Public Sector funded NFI is 
derived from large and ongoing infrastructure projects
Dependence on key clients Too great 
an exposure to one or a few clients can 
lead to an over reliance on those clients. 
In the event that any major client ceases 
to procure services from the Group, or such 
a client does not pay for services provided 
by the Group in a timely manner, may have 
a material adverse effect on cash flow

Competition The recruitment market 
is highly fragmented and competition 
is intense
The Board works under the 
ethos that whilst remaining 
competitive the business 
must retain its integrity, 
work in a professional 
manner and be compliant
 The Board and Executive regularly meet to discuss and 
agree strategy to minimise this risk
 The Group recognises the importance of its Bids 
and Tenders capability to ensure that it maximises 
opportunities within the marketplace
 The Group undertakes a regular client framework review, 
seeking to ensure it minimises the risk of losing clients 
to competitors
Investment in new sectors and 
geographical markets Failure to expand 
into new markets could result in a business 
growing within a specific sector and 
eventually reaching a saturation point
The Group continually seeks 
to expand the remit of its 
services to ensure that, 
whilst it aims for significant 
market penetration in each 
market, the overall market 
it supplies is expanding
 Having expanded overseas through the opening of the 
German office, the acquisition of XRS has given further 
access into the European marketplace
 The Group has supplied candidates into 30 countries this 
year, and continues to explore client led opportunities 
across the world

risks identi ed and risk management is 
embedded in the annual budgeting and 
strategic planning processes. At its monthly

BUSINESS REVIEW
RISK AREA AND POTENTIAL IMPACT GROUP STRATEGY MITIGATION
MARKET
Shortage of skilled candidates In a 
candidate shortage marketplace there is 
increased competition and, whilst easing 
during the economic slowdown, there are 
still shortages of highly skilled engineers 
in many sectors
The Group focuses heavily 
on candidate attraction to 
ensure we have the best 
candidates available to our 
clients in a timely manner
 The Group employs a Resource Team that reviews the 
internet job boards for the most up-to-date candidates
 Search engine optimisation seeks to ensure that the 
Group’s websites are one of the primary results returned 
from internet searches for jobs in our sectors, driving 
candidates directly to our database
 All candidates are stored on our in-house database, 
meaning our consultants are only using one search tool, 
thereby improving the chance of us delivering the right 
candidate to the client first
FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE
Financing A failure to secure adequate 
financing, whether to fund expansion, to 
finance the slowing of payment terms or 
finance a bad debt, would have a material 
effect on results. The level of contract
margins, net fee income conversion, 
contract versus permanent balance and 
the speed of growth all affect the Groups 
ability to generate cash
The Group actively seeks 
to ensures it operates well 
within its funding facilities
 We maintain a strong balance sheet with low gearing.
 Net debt as at 31 July 2012 was £14.6m. Banking 
facilities have been increased to £50m
 We have long standing banking relationships and 
regular discussions to seek to ensure we have the banks’ 
backing to fund strategic plans
 We have procedures to check the creditworthiness 
of new clients with external agencies and regularly 
reviewed credit limits in place
Integrity of financial controls A failure to 
maintain sufficient financial controls may 
lead to reputational damage, financial loss 
or incorrect financial information used to 
manage the business
The Group seeks to ensure 
that it has good financial 
controls at all times
 The Group maintains a financial control framework 
which is reviewed and audited annually
 The controls include the Board review of the Group’s 
performance each month
 An external audit is performed on the Financial Statements
Compliance and regulatory obligations
Navigating the business through the large 
number of compliance and regulatory 
changes has become more complicated. 
Non-compliance places risk upon clients 
and the Group
The Group employs its 
own in-house compliance 
team which constantly 
reviews new regulations 
and monitors our internal 
processes and procedures 
to minimise the chance of 
non-conformance and the 
risk to all stakeholders
 The Group works closely with its in-house compliance 
team, its financial and legal advisors and recruitment 
governing bodies, such as the Recruitment and 
Employment Confederation (REC) and the Association of 
Professional Staffing Companies (APSCo), to ensure that 
the business is up-to-date on these issues and that the 
appropriate systems and processes are in place
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL
Loss of key management and staff Failure 
to attract and retain key staff could lead to 
a lack of necessary expertise or continuity 
to execute strategy
The Group has a strong 
record of developing and 
retaining key staff, whilst 
seeking to add additional 
external talent
 The Group gives its staff a clear structured career path 
within Group businesses whilst maintaining flexibility 
by allowing talent to be utilised across the Group
 By maintaining our niche focus we develop our business 
through empowering our talented staff to specialise and 
grow their own parts of the business
 The Group maintains short lines of communication 
to senior managers and the Board
Technology systems including data 
security There is a risk that IT systems 
become out of date, external software 
suppliers become inflexible or that 
the business is over reliant on external 
systems and databases
The Group regularly reviews 
its software requirements 
undertaking benchmarking 
reviews of external
comparator software
 The Group employs its own team of in-house developers 
to ensure its in-house recruitment software is focused on 
streamlining the recruitment process and providing high 
levels of service delivery
 Reliance on external software and its providers is 
minimised down to specialist software only
Loss of business continuity Operating 
from one site can lead to a risk from loss 
of business continuity
The Group regularly reviews 
its business continuity and 
has a dedicated Business 
Continuity Manager
 The Group’s business continuity strategy includes 
a highly resilient infrastructure within the Group’s 3 
building major site in Fareham, Hampshire
 The Group has also contracted a further Disaster Recovery 
facility where our staff would relocate to in the event of 
a major disaster   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 20
BUSINESS REVIEW
Growing:
Industry specialism 
reaps benefits
On the back of the strong demand we 
grew contractor numbers by 12% driving 
contract net fee income (NFI) up 20% to 
£20.7m. Having, over the last few years, 
witnessed reduced contract margins 
through client supplier rationalisation, 
this year we saw a stabilisation and in 
certain sectors opportunities to increase 
our margins. Contract gross margins for 
the year were 6.5%, essentially the same 
as the 6.6% generated in 2011.
We placed 2% more candidates into 
permanent roles, growing permanent 
fees by 13% to £6.9m.
Engineering Sector
The largest sector within Matchtech grew 
NFI by 19%.

Marine
The Naval shipyards and defence 
suppliers continued to experience a 
peak in the demand for shipbuilding 
design, engineering and build personnel, 
predominantly on the Queen Elizabeth 
Class aircraft carrier project. Such demand 
is expected to continue as further projects, 
including Type 26 and the Successor 
Submarine project, come on stream. 
The commercial and leisure marine 
markets, which have been adversely 
a ected in recent years, showed positive 
signs of recovery and growth.
Automotive 
The UK car industry’s exposure to Asian 
and North American export markets, from 
a design and manufacturing perspective, 
has fuelled demand for our clients’ 
products, which in turn has drawn inward 
investment into UK product development 
and increased our clients’ requirement 
for exible skilled labour. 
Aerospace 
The UK’s aerospace industry continued to 
grow as a result of continued investment 
in advanced technologies, materials and 
manufacturing techniques. We have been 
successfully working with our clients in 
developing innovative ways of meeting 
their recruitment needs and overcoming 
the sectors skills shortages. We continue 
to support aircraft projects including the 
A350, A320, C-series, EH101 and AW159 
F-Lynx Wildcat programmes.
Energy
Our focus has remained within the oil and 
gas and renewable energy markets where 
we have continued to grow our presence. 
Through having a strategically placed o ce 
in Aberdeen, we have been able to further 
our client relationships and accelerate 
growth. The high oil price in the last year 
has resulted in the oil and gas industry 
continuing to be busy and it is expected 
to remain so. 
Built Environment Sector
The growth in NFI of 9% in the built 
environment sector was driven mainly from 
the utilities sector with the continuation 
of the Asset Management Programme 
(AMP5) in the water industry where, with 
the planning phase of AMP6 expected to 
shortly commence, we expect to continue 
to have high levels of demand. 
We also saw growth in highways, tra c and 
planning, primarily driven by Public Sector 
expenditure in money through the Highways 
Agency and Local Authority clients.
We have grown our business in the rail 
industry on the back of both new build 
(Crossrail) and refurbishment/maintenance 
projects, where the demand for discipline 
engineers remains high. 
We also continued to have success 
in the nuclear defence and the power 
transmission and distribution sectors. 
Information Systems and T echnology Sector
We experienced strong demand for IT 
candidates across the Group’s expanding 
client base. Our ability to source niche 
technology candidates as a result of our 
skill set and industry specialism has fuelled 
growth of 26% in NFI. 
We have continued to diversify into new 
niche areas and have made good progress 
in IT security and cyber security, alongside 
capitalising on clients’ R&D technology 
investment which has remained high. 
Science and Medical Sector
Despite a number of key sta changes 
in the year this sector still delivered 11% 
growth in NFI as a result of a signi cant 
amount of business development activity 
throughout the pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology, food and drink, medical 
device and medical industries.
Our Managed Service Provider has 
continued to support some of the Group’s 
major framework contracts through 
account management support and bespoke 
client services. The accounts that elemense 
manages generated £65.2m of revenue 
across the Group.
elemense bene ts from the historic 
strength of Matchtech Group within the 
engineering market for lead generation and 
delivery capability, but also from its ability 
to act independently of the Group as and 
when required. 
This year elemense generated over £0.5m 
of NFI ful lling client requirements that fall 
outside of the Group’s core capabilities; 
requirements that would otherwise have 
gone outside the Group.
Matchtech: Matchtech delivered another strong performance 
this year. Many sectors that we supply into, continue to have 
acute skills shortages and demand for contract labour has 
been strong. Our niche focus and ability to source hard to 
find candidates has served us well.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 22

BUSINESS REVIEW
Barclay Meade
In its second year of trading, the Barclay 
Meade brand continued to develop, 
delivering similar growth to that in year 
one. NFI was up 27% compared with 
the previous year. 
As the brand has established itself, 
Barclay Meade has become a more familiar 
name in the market and this, along with 
the new consultants becoming more 
established with the Group’s culture, has 
allowed the business to take market share 
in challenging and highly competitive 
economic conditions.
Our strategic regional o ces have 
provided a strong foundation. The 
Aberdeen o ce was established to 
leverage our strong Group relationships in 
the oil and gas sector. Our St Albans o ce 
serves the SME market in the Northern 
Home Counties. At the Group’s head o ce 
in Whiteley, the team continues to focus on 
maximising opportunities from within the 
Group brands across the South Coast. 
Our London o ce has taken longer to 
establish itself than intended, but is now 
working with a range of FTSE companies 
and household brands throughout London. 
A strong culture of cross-selling across the 
o ce has been critical to this success.
Overall, we have now established a 
repeat client base of SME clients through 
e ective cross-selling across the full 
ranges of specialist functions; Finance and 
Accounting, Procurement, Supply Chain, 
HR, Sales, and Marketing. 
As with any developing new business, 
recruiting and retaining the right people 
is challenging. We have not always 
been able to identify the right talent 
to match our established culture. We 
are now con dent we have the right, 
experienced management team in place, 
along with a strong culture of mentoring 
and development. 
This will enable us to retain our core talent, 
whilst identifying the next generation of 
consultants to maintain the high levels 
of growth. 
This coming year we aim to further invest 
in our core specialist areas, aiming to take 
further market share without the need to 
expand into new locations.
Alderwood
The Alderwood brand has developed 
strongly in the year on the back of 
continued government investment in 
skills initiatives to support the long-term 
unemployed. NFI generated in the year 
of £1.0m was up 67% (2011: £0.6m).
Alderwood is now a recognised brand 
and a leading provider within the Welfare 
to Work sector. It has also cemented its 
position as the market leader within the 
Work-Based Learning market. This has 
been achieved through a mixture of rst 
class service delivery, strong account 
management and extensive networking 
and sector awareness. 
Our quarterly client dinners, hosted by 
Alderwood Non-Executive Director, Lord 
Jim Knight, have proved to be both popular 
and highly successful. As a result, our 
client portfolio has evolved to encompass 
a wider range of organisations from small, 
family owned training companies to large, 
national framework providers.
We will continue focusing on our core areas 
of strength whilst further developing our 
client services with the aim of providing 
a more complete recruitment solution. 
Operating Review continued
Professional Services: Both brands have continued to develop 
well with NFI up 33% on the previous year. The average fee per

Human Resources Report   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 25
BUSINESS REVIEW
Overview
We are a vibrant organisation with strong 
values and this is why we continue to 
develop strong client relationships and 
candidate loyalty.
The ambitious plans for the development 
of the Group rely heavily on the e ective 
delivery of Human Resources support to 
all the people in the organisation.
Staff Numbers and Attrition
Total sta numbers at 31 July 2012 
were 381 (31 July 2011: 350). Sales force 
headcount has risen from 266 to 291. This 
increase re ects our investment in both 
the new professional services brands along 
with additional headcount in Matchtech UK 
where activity levels have increased over 
the year.
Group attrition for the year was down to 
23% (2011: 30%), a decrease that re ects 
the success of the new brands in becoming 
established.
Recruitment
The need to attract and recruit high quality 
sta for the expanding Group is paramount. 
Our focus this year will be on enhancing 
our recruitment search and selection 
processes. One of the most e ective ways 
of reducing sta attrition is to ensure that 
we recruit the right people in the rst place.
Engagement
We recognise that successful employee 
engagement revolves around good, regular 
internal communication. The need to 
maintain a proactive 2-way exchange of 
information is key to understanding the 
key motivators of our sta .
We conduct regular sta surveys, gaining 
useful feedback which helps us to shape 
our people strategies. 
This was re ected in the Group being 
ranked 25th Best Company to Work For 
2012 by the Sunday Times.
The provision of e ective and consultative 
recruitment services relies upon the 
continuity and development of mutually 
bene cial business relationships. This 
same principle underpins the relationship 
between a business and its own people. 
Development
Personal development is a key factor 
in employee satisfaction and a growing 
business creates its own career 
opportunities for sta and we therefore 
continue to focus on and improve our 
talent management processes.
By placing continued and signi cant 
emphasis on developing our sta skills 
and our continued investment in training, 
we have expanded our in-house learning 
and development capabilities this year. 
We have also made further investment in 
our Graduate Training Programme to meet 
future demand for sales sta .
By enhancing our leadership training 
across the business we aim to ensure that 
all management sta have the required 
competency to manage and develop their 
own sta to a high level. At the same time 
we are coaching our senior management 
team to aid their strategic thinking.
Diversity
We believe that diversity is a business 
issue and needs to be managed 
accordingly. Unless we are able to attract 
and retain talented individuals from a 
broader range of backgrounds than has 
been the case historically, we will fail to 
realise our plans for the coming years. 
The Group understands that it is essential 
to attract and retain talented individuals 
who re ect the diverse nature of the areas 
in which we work.
The Group has policies in place to ensure 
that our candidate attraction does not 
exclude any individuals based upon 
diversity, and recruits sta purely based 
upon their abilities. 
Although currently there are no women 
on the Board, women account for 17% of 
management and 40% of all employees. 
The Board recognises the bene ts of 
having a diverse cross-section of people 
in senior management positions. It 
understands that the gender imbalance 
needs to be addressed at these levels and 
will continue to dedicate time over the 
coming months to consider diversity.
External Community
The Group recognises the importance 
of its links with the communities in which 
it operates and with the increasing needs 
of sta to feel their employers are engaged 
in positive action.
The Group encourages and supports 
our sta in undertaking charitable work, 
fundraising, volunteering activities and 
sports and social activities. The Group’s 
current chosen charity is Friends of PICU, 
the charity supporting the Paediatric 
Intensive Care Unit at Southampton 
General Hospital, www.friendsofpicu.org.uk.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 26

Corporate and Social Responsibility
Matchtech Group is committed to doing 
business responsibly in its interaction with 
clients, the environment, and within the 
local community.
Innovation, Integrity, Enthusiasm, 
Teamwork, and Fun are the underlying 
values that we expect in the make-up of 
our people, and these values are the basis 
of our approach to Corporate and Social 
Responsibility (CSR).
Delivering a responsible service to 
our clients means upholding the highest 
professional standards. Through active 
membership of our professional body, 
the REC, and by supporting the Advocacy 
Programme, we are helping to raise 
professional standards in our industry. In 
the last 2 years, key individuals received 
recognition for their contribution, receiving 
awards at the governing body’s annual 
awards in the categories of Best Newcomer 
and Best Contract Consultant.
Interacting responsibly with the 
environment is about minimising our 
impact. For our business, this is about 
energy reduction and recycling, and we 
have taken steps over the last 2 years to 
reduce energy consumption by increased 
use of timers to turn o equipment not in 
use, by switching from paper to sustainable 
sources, and by further reducing our 
company vehicle carbon emission limits.
Over the coming months we will be bringing 
together all aspects of the Group’s CSR 
activities under one overarching policy to 
help ensure that we maximise the bene ts 
that we can give.
In March 2012 the Group joined the charity 
Business in the Community. Following the 
initial induction and training periods we are 
working with our dedicated account manager 
to identify areas where the business and our 
sta can make a di erence.

Corporate Responsibility 
The Board recognises its employment, environmental and health 
and safety responsibilities. It devotes appropriate resources towards 
monitoring and improving compliance with existing standards. 
The Executive Directors have responsibility for these areas at 
Board level, ensuring that the Group’s policies are upheld and 
providing the necessary resources. 
Bribery 
The Matchtech Board has made a commitment to carry out 
business fairly, honestly and openly and has also demonstrated 
a commitment to zero tolerance towards bribery. A copy of the 
Matchtech High Level Commitment Statement is included below.

with Group policies. 
The standards expected of all employees are detailed in the 
Group’s Anti-Bribery, Gifts and Entertainment, Con icts of Interest 
and Whistle-blowing policies which have been put in place to help 
prevent bribery and provide a vehicle for con dential reporting. 
Disciplinary action, including dismissal, may be taken against any 
employee found to be in breach of any policy. 
The Group’s main Board and Legal and Compliance Department 
have worked hard in the development and implementation of bribery 
prevention procedures in order to maintain our reputation and ensure 
customer and business partner con dence. Our values and ethical

to develop strong client relationships and candidate loyalty. 
Matchtech Group plc aims to only work with companies that have 
made the same commitment to preventing bribery as we have.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the nancial statements in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company nancial statements for each nancial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group nancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company nancial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the nancial 
statements unless they are satis ed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of a airs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of their pro t or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company nancial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
 prepare the nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are su cient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the nancial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its nancial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and nancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of nancial statements may di er from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 33
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Disclosure of Audit Information 
The Directors con rm that, as at the date this report was approved, 
so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and that he 
has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going Concern 
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and budgets for the 
coming year, which have been drawn up with appropriate regard 
for the current macroeconomic environment and the particular 
circumstances in which the Group operates. These were prepared 
with reference to historic and current industry knowledge, taking 
the future strategy of the Group into account. As a result, at the 
time of approving the nancial statements, the Directors consider 
that the Company and the Group have su cient resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and 
accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in the preparation of the nancial statements. 
As with all business forecasts, the Directors’ statement cannot 
guarantee that the going concern basis will remain appropriate 
given the inherent uncertainty about future events. 
Auditors 
The Company’s independent external auditor, KPMG Audit Plc who 
was initially appointed in March 2011, has expressed its willingness 
to continue in o ce and resolutions for their reappointment and 
to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

Cautionary Statement 
Under the Companies Acts 2006, a Company’s Directors’ Report 
is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review by 
the Directors of the Group’s business, through a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the development and performance 
of the business of the Group and the position of the Group at the 
year end, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. 
The Directors’ Report set out above, including the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, and the Chief Financial 
O cer’s Report incorporated into it by reference (together with the 
Directors’ Report), has been prepared only for the shareholders of 
the Company as a whole, and its sole purpose and use is to assist 
shareholders to exercise their governance rights. In particular, the 
Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise independently 
veri ed. The Company and its Directors and employees are not 
responsible for any other purpose or use or to any other person 
in relation to the Directors’ Report. 
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward-looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the 
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the countries, sectors and business segments in which the 
Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, those 
discussed under Principal Risks and Uncertainties. These and other 
factors could adversely a ect the Group’s results, strategy and 
prospects. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions. They relate to events and/or depend on 
circumstances in the future which could cause actual results and 
outcomes to di er materially from those currently anticipated. No 
obligation is assumed to update any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 34

Corporate Governance Report
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
I am once again pleased to present the Board’s Annual Report 
on Corporate Governance. 
In writing this letter directly to all our shareholders, I would like 
to reiterate my personal commitment and that of the whole Board 
to the continued maintenance of good governance – meaningful, 
relevant and focused on our business. 
Whilst the speci c practices and procedures have necessarily 
changed over the years, I believe that Matchtech has followed the 
same principles of governance since I founded the business almost 
30 years ago. 
We treat all our stakeholders – candidates, contractors, clients, 
sta and shareholders – as we ourselves wish to be treated, 
honestly and openly. We are open when things go well – as we 
believe they usually do – and particularly when they go wrong, 
seeking to resolve them promptly. 
Naturally, we have continued to disclose the usual information  
in the Annual Report and on the Matchtech Group plc website  
www.matchtechgroupplc.com. 
However, I would like to mention the topics on which the Board 
has particularly focused this year. 
Responding to Increasing Scale and Complexity
The Group has increased signi cantly in scale. Compared with 
5 years ago revenue is over 4 times higher and compared with 
10 years ago it is up nearly 500%. In recent years we have seen 
further complexity with the introduction of a multi-brand strategy 
and operations outside the UK and the rst acquisition ever made 
by Matchtech.
In the context of these rapid changes – and with more expected 
as part of the Board’s strategy – we have spent time ensuring the 
Group has a Delegation of Authority which is appropriate for its 
current needs and is updated as the business changes and grows.
We have focused on ensuring that the Group Executive is aware 
of and complies with the Board’s approach, as a fundamental part 
of the Group’s culture and risk management. Where necessary, 
we have adapted the way in which the Board and Committees of 
the Board work, seeking to ensure there is e ective review and 
approval of management’s proposals and review of operational 
performance.
Succession Planning 
For a number of years the Board’s membership remained 
unchanged. I believe we have a well-matched team by experience 
and temperament. 
During the year I am pleased that we were able to strengthen 
our team by making 2 Non-Executive appointments to the Board, 
namely Richard Bradford in August 2011 and Rudi Kindts in March 
2012. Both have made e ective contributions. Since the year end 
we have also appointed Keith Lewis to the Board as an Executive 
Director with e ect from 5 September 2012.
From our experiences as a team, we all recognise the importance 
of diversity, of perspective, experience, thought, gender, ethnicity 
and nationality. We will be giving this high priority in the next 
stage of our succession planning, including in senior management 
appointments.
Best Practice 
We have continued with a performance review for each Director, 
which I undertake each year. 
Furthermore, in 2012 the Deputy Chairman undertook a similar 
review of me in my role as Chairman. This will be undertaken 
annually.
The Audit Committee was evaluated for the rst time, with a report 
for the Board prepared by the Group’s auditor.
George Materna 
Chairman 
4 October 2012   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 35
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The maintenance of effective Corporate 
Governance is a key priority for the Board.  
Whilst the Group is not subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) 
applicable to companies listed on the Official 
List, the Directors recognise the importance  
of sound Corporate Governance. The Group  
seeks to comply with the Corporate Governance 
Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies as 
published by the Quoted Companies Alliance 
in September 2010, as far as applicable. 
Board’s Management Objectives 
Entrepreneurial Management
There is a vision of what the Group is trying to achieve, over what 
period and an understanding of what is required to achieve this 
ambition. A dialogue exists between shareholders and the Board, 
with the aim that the Board understands shareholders’ objectives 
and the shareholders understand the Group’s constraints.
E cient Management
The mechanisms by which important decisions are taken 
are transparent. It is clear where the responsibility lies for 
the management of the Group and for the achievement of key 
tasks. Procedures are in place to protect signi cant tangible and 
intangible assets and these are regularly reviewed and updated.
E ective Management
The Board has the appropriate composition and skills mix which are 
regularly reviewed and it has collective responsibility that requires 
all Directors to be involved in the process of arriving at signi cant 
decisions. The Board is provided with regular appropriate 
management and nancial information on which to constructively 
challenge recommendations made to it. 
Ethical Management
Behaving ethically, both in the Group’s decision making and 
through the actions of our employees, is a must for the Group. 
Our continued success depends on earning, keeping the trust of 
and preserving our reputation in the eyes of those we deal with – 
including clients, contractors, employees, business partners and 
the broader community.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for their decision 
which includes strategy, the approval of nancial statements and 
shareholder circulars, treasury policy, major capital investments 
(including acquisitions and disposals) and risk management strategy.
The Board, Including Performance Evaluation 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s overall direction and 
management, and for the establishment and maintenance of a 
framework of delegated authorities and controls which ensure 
the e cient and e ective management of the Group’s operations. 
To ensure that vested interests should not be able to act in a 
manner contrary to the common good of all shareholders, at the 
date of this report the Board has 4 Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board considers the independence of the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors annually against the criteria 
set out in the Code with each being determined as independent of 
management having no business or other relationship that could 
interfere materially with the exercise of their judgement. 
Directors are required to notify the Company Secretary of any 
potential con icts of interest when they are appointed to the 
Board and, following appointment, as new potential con icts 
arise These noti cations are then considered and authorised 
by the Board as appropriate. 
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further 
meetings when required. In addition, Directors meet as members 
of relevant Committees. There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved speci cally to the Board for decision, delegating speci c 
responsibilities to Committees.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 36

The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present at least once a year. The Chairman had no 
other signi cant commitments in the 2 years ended 31 July 2012. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of Tony Dyer, the Chief Financial O cer, and Neil Ayton, the Company Secretary, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed procedure 
for Directors to obtain independent professional advice, paid for by the Group. 
In line with the requirements of the Code, which has applied to fully listed companies since 1 April 2011, the Group has voluntarily chosen 
that all Directors will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, will o er themselves for re-election. 
The Board is committed to ensuring its e ectiveness. It recognises the bene t of performance evaluation of the Board, Directors and Board 
Committees and exercised this during the year. 
3 years ago the Board undertook individual Board member leadership pro le assessments, and a Board culture survey that involved the 
whole Group management team. The recommendations arising from this process were considered by the Board and appropriate actions 
identi ed and implemented. 
During each of the last 2 years the Chairman undertook performance assessments with each Director. These will be undertaken each year. 
In the year to 31 July 2012 the Deputy Chairman undertook a performance assessment of the Chairman. This will be undertaken annually.
The Board is satis ed with the current balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which allows it to exercise objectivity in 
decision making and proper control of the Group’s business. The Board does recognise that the composition of the Board needs to be kept 
under regular review. 
The Board is also satis ed with the performance of each individual Board member and the Board as a whole. Where there are areas for 
improvement the Board has agreed objectives and action plans in place and will continually review progress on these. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has 3 established Committees for Audit, Nominations and Remuneration. The Committees have Terms of Reference which are 
reviewed at least biannually by the Board, and revised as deemed necessary and appropriate. The Terms of Reference of the Nominations 
Committee and of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed in 2012. The Terms of Reference of the Audit Committee, which were last 
reviewed in September 2011, will be reviewed in the coming 12 months. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available on the Group’s 
website www.matchtechgroupplc.com and on request from the Company Secretary. 
Following formal decision making, the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a Standing Committee consisting of any 2 Directors 
to facilitate nal sign o for an agreed course of action within strict parameters. 
Audit Committee 
The responsibilities and operation of the Audit Committee are described in the Audit Committee’s Report on pages 38 and 39.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Stephen Burke and Ric Piper stood down from the Nominations 
Committee on 31 July 2012. 
Richard Bradford and Rudi Kindts were appointed to the Committee 
on that date.
The Nominations Committee has full power and authority to carry 
out a formal selection process of candidates, before proposing new 
appointments to the Board. 
The Group has adopted a policy for Directors’ and key employees’ 
share dealings which is appropriate for an AIM-quoted Group. The 
Directors comply with Rule 21 of the AIM rules relating to Directors’ 
dealings and in addition take all reasonable steps to ensure 
compliance by the Group’s applicable employees.
Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment stating 
their annual fee, their re-election at forthcoming AGMs and that 
their appointment is subject to satisfactory performance. Their 
appointment may be terminated within a maximum of 6 months’ 
written notice at any time. 
Copies of the letters of appointment will be available for 
inspection prior to and during the AGM, and are also available for 
inspection at the Group’s registered o ce during normal business 
hours. The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the 
Articles of Association, including reviewing the level of fees paid by 
comparator companies. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any meeting at which discussions in respect of matters 
relating to their own position take place. There is currently 
no Senior Independent Director, although there is a Deputy 
Chairman. The Board will review annually the need for a Senior 
Independent Director. 
Internal Control 
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the 
Group’s governance framework and ensuring its adequacy 
and e ectiveness. Internal controls, which include nancial, 
operational and compliance and risk management systems, 
are central to this framework: 
 The system of internal nancial and operational controls 
is designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and aims, 
to facilitate e ective and e cient operations, to safeguard 
the Group’s assets, ensure proper accounting records are 
maintained, and ensure that the nancial information used 
within the business and for publication is reliable
 Such a system of internal control can only be designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement and loss
 The Board con rms that there is a continuing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the 
Group, with further improvements planned for the current 
 nancial year
 The Audit Committee and the Board review, at least annually, 
whether an internal audit function is required. Some initial internal 
audit work has been undertaken in the 2012 nancial year and 
further work will be undertaken in the current nancial year
 A separate report on principal risks and uncertainties is in 
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section
The Board’s statements and actions emphasise a culture of 
openness, integrity, competence, fairness and responsibility. 
The Board focuses mainly on strategic issues, senior management 
and nancial performance. The Group Executive concentrates on 
operational performance, operational decision making and the 
formulation of strategic proposals to the Board. 
The Board determines how the Chief Executive O cer operates 
within a framework of delegated authorities and reserved powers 
which seek to ensure that certain transactions, signi cant in terms 
of their size or type, are undertaken only after Board review. 
Risk Management Policy 
The Group has an overall Risk Management Policy in place, which 
has been communicated to all sta and is continually accessible. 
Corporate Policies 
The Board has introduced a range of policies for the Group to 
comply with which it constantly monitors, including policies on the 
Bribery Act, Corporate Social Responsibility, Equal Opportunities, 
Disability, Diversity, Health and Safety, Gifts and Entertainment 
and the Environment. 
Professional Practices 
The Group is a Corporate Member of the Recruitment and 
Employment Confederation (REC). The Group encourages 
all recruitment consultants to become members and actively 
promotes the REC training programme, to ensure that all sta 
are working to the appropriate guidelines. 
The Group endeavours to fully comply with the REC Code of Ethics, 
The Employment Agencies Act and Conduct Regulations 2003 and 
the REC Code of Professional Practice. The Group has achieved REC 
Audited status, which means systems and processes comply with 
current legislation. 
Financial Reporting 
The Board approves a business plan and annual budgets for 
individual business units and the Group. The nancial performance

Relations with Shareholders 
The Board regards e ective communication with shareholders 
as crucial. 
Relations with shareholders are managed principally by the 
Chief Executive O cer and Chief Financial O cer. Meetings are 
held regularly throughout the year with institutional investors, 
fund managers and analysts. 
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors make themselves available for meetings with major 
shareholders. This provides shareholders with the opportunity 
to take up with these individuals any issue they feel unable to 
raise with the Chief Executive O cer or Chief Financial O cer. 
The Group’s shareholders are invited to attend the AGM at which 
all Directors are present. 
The Non-Executive Directors are also kept informed of the views 
of shareholders, with the Executive Directors providing updates 
on investor meetings. Additionally, the Group’s broker provides 
brie ngs to the Board on shareholder opinions and compiles 
independent feedback from investor meetings. 
The Group’s website contains information on current business 
activities, including the annual and half-year results presentations.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 38

The Board considers he has recent and relevant nancial experience. 
The Committee met 6 times during the year. The external auditor attended all 6 of the meetings; and the Committee met privately with the 
external auditor on each occasion. 
Operation of the Committee 
The Committee’s Terms of Reference were reviewed and updated in September 2011 to conform to current best practice. No signi cant 
changes were deemed necessary. They are available on the Group’s website (www.matchtechgroupplc.com), as well as in hard copy format 
from the Company Secretary. 
The Terms of Reference will be next reviewed by September 2013.
The main activities of the Committee during the year were as follows:
 Financial statements. The Committee reviewed the interim and full year nancial statements. Presentations were made by management 
and the auditor about the key technical and judgemental matters relevant to the nancial statements. The Committee was satis ed that

The Chairman of the Committee reported to the Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting, identifying relevant matters 
requiring communication to the Board and recommendations on the steps to be taken.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 39
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Independent Auditor 
The appointment of the independent external auditor is approved 
by shareholders annually. The independent auditor’s audit of the 
 nancial statements is conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing, ISA (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. 
There are no contractual obligations that act to restrict the 
Committee’s choice of external auditor. 
In early 2011 the Board (on the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee) decided that it was appropriate to put the Group’s 
audit out to competitive tender. In March 2011 the Audit 
Committee proposed and the Board approved the appointment 
of KPMG Audit Plc as the Company’s registered independent public 
accounting rm commencing with audit work for the year ending 
31 July 2011. 
The independent auditor provides the following services: 
 A report to the Audit Committee giving an overview of the 
results, signi cant contracts and judgements and observations 
on the control environment
 An opinion on the truth and fairness of the Group and 
Company accounts
 An internal control report, following its audit, highlighting 
to management any areas of weakness or concern
The Audit Committee monitors the cost-e ectiveness of audit 
and non-audit work performed by the independent auditor 
and also considers the potential impact, if any, of this work on 
independence. Approval is required prior to the independent 
auditor commencing any material non-audit work in accordance 
with a Group policy approved by the Committee. Certain work, 
such as providing bookkeeping services, is prohibited. 
The Audit Committee also regulates the appointment of former 
employees of the independent auditor to positions in the Group.
 
The Audit Committee regularly reviews all fees for non-audit work 
paid to the independent auditor. Details of these fees can be found 
in Note 3 to the nancial statements. The Committee concluded 
that the level of non-audit fees, which represent 31% of the audit 
fees for the Group, did not have a negative impact on KPMG Audit 
Plc’s independence.
The independent external auditor also operates procedures 
designed to safeguard their objectivity and independence. 
These include the periodic rotation of audit partner, use of 
independent concurring partners, use of a technical review panel 
(where appropriate) and annual independence con rmations 
by all sta . 
The independent external auditor reports to the Committee 
on matters including independence and non-audit work 
on an annual basis. 
Independent Evaluation of the Committee
In 2012 an independent evaluation of the Committee was 
undertaken by the Group’s auditors who reported to the 
Chairman of the Board and subsequently issued their report 
to the whole Board.
The Board and the Audit Committee will be working on 
implementing the recommendations of the report, particularly 
additional members and the induction of new members.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Group has a Remuneration Committee which is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for developing remuneration policy. As Matchtech 
Group plc is an AIM-listed company rather than a fully listed company, it is not required to disclose all the information in the Remuneration 
Committee Report, but the Board has chosen to do so as a voluntary disclosure. As such, the Auditor is not required to and has not, 
except where indicated, audited the information included in the Remuneration Committee Report. The audited information meets the 
requirements of the changes to the AIM Rule 19, e ective February 2010. The Company’s statement on remuneration policy is set out 
together with details of the remuneration of each Director.

 Reviewing and noting the remuneration trends across the Group
Stephen Burke and Ric Piper have both been members of the Remuneration Committee since 2006.
The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice a year. The Chairman of the Board attends the meetings as required, except when 
his own remuneration is under consideration. 
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to review, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration policy for the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and other senior management, and to determine the level of remuneration, incentives and other bene ts, compensation 
payments and the terms of employment of the Executive plc Directors and other senior executives. It seeks to provide a remuneration 
package that aligns the interests of Executive Directors with that of the shareholders. 
It receives advice from independent remuneration consultants and makes comparisons with similar organisations. In 2012 advice was 
received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
The Committee has continued to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors with regard to the need to maintain a 
balance between the constituent elements of salary, incentives and other bene ts. During the year, the Committee instructed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to design and implement a Value Creation Plan (VCP) for the Executive Directors and senior management. 
No Directors, other than the members of the Remuneration Committee, provided material advice to the Committee on Directors’ remuneration. 
Remuneration Policy 
The objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy are to attract, retain and incentivise management with the appropriate professional, 
managerial and technological expertise to realise the Group’s business objectives, and align their interests with those of shareholders. 
The Group strives to link payment to performance and thereby create a performance culture. 
It is the Group’s policy that all Executive Directors’ service contracts contain a 6-month notice period. 
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment stating their annual fee, and that their appointment is subject to satisfactory 
performance and their re-election at forthcoming Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Their appointment may be terminated within 
a maximum of 6 months’ written notice at any time. 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the 
bonus or share option schemes. 
The remuneration agreed by the Committee for the Executive Directors are outlined in the following sections.
Base Salary and Benefits 
The Committee establishes salaries and bene ts by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for Executive 
Directors of companies of comparable status and market value, taking into account the range of incentives described elsewhere in this 
report, including a performance-based commission and performance bonus. Reviews of such base salary and bene ts are conducted 
annually by the Committee. 
Profit Bonus 
The performance-based commission for the Executive Directors is based upon a xed percentage of pre-tax pro ts generated by the 
Group in the year.

Pension 
The Group contributes 10% of Adrian Gunn’s and Tony Dyer’s basic salaries into a group personal pension plan. 
VCP
As announced on 21 November 2011, the Group has implemented and made awards to Directors under a VCP.
The VCP was approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting on 18 November 2011.
During the year the following Directors have been conditionally granted an award of units under the VCP:
Name Position
Number of  
VCP units
Percentage of total 
number of VCP units 
allocated and  
to be allocated
Adrian Gunn Chief Executive 266,000 26.6%
Tony Dyer Chief Financial O cer 145,000 14.5%
Other senior management 412,000 41.2%
Reserved for future allocations 177,000 17.7%
Included within other senior management are 145,000 units allocated to Keith Lewis, who was appointed a Director of the Company 
on 5 September 2012. The remaining 267,000 units are now reserved for future allocations following changes to senior management.
No payment has been made for the grant of these awards and the VCP units have no value at grant. 
The VCP has a 5 year performance period (ending after the preliminary announcement of the Company’s nal accounts in 2016) and 
the VCP units entitle the Directors to share in 7.5% of the total value created for shareholders in excess of an annual hurdle at a series 
of measurement dates.
The level of value created for Matchtech shareholders will be determined by reference to the appreciation in the Company’s share price, 
the amount of dividends paid and share buy backs. The shareholder value created at each measurement date will be calculated using the 
average share price over the 30 day period prior to the relevant measurement date. 
The annual hurdle will be the higher of:
 the actual share price at the previous measurement date; and
 20% growth over the threshold price from the previous measurement date. 
The initial price is 218 pence per Matchtech share, being the average share price of Matchtech shares for the 30 day period following the 
preliminary announcement of the Company’s 2011 nal results. This will result in the rst threshold price being 261.6 pence (218 pence 
increased by 20%).
At each measurement date each Director will receive an entitlement to Matchtech shares (in the form of a nil-cost option) with a value 
equivalent to each Director’s relevant proportion of the VCP pool created in respect of that measurement date. Any share entitlement will 
not become exercisable until the end of the fth year of the VCP when 50% of the shares are exercisable, with the balance exercisable 
1 year later.
Share Options Conditional on Performance 
During the year the Group operated a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) for Executive Directors and 
key sta .    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 42

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Diluted EPS for the year ending 31 July 2012 were 23.49 pence. Accordingly none of the Deferred Share Bonus Award will be granted 
as a zero priced share option. 
Share Incentive Plan 
During the year the Group operated a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for Executive Directors and all sta called ‘Match’. 
Under the scheme, sta are entitled to buy shares in Matchtech Group plc out of pre-tax salary. They can invest up to a maximum 
of £125 per month or an annual lump sum of £1,500, which will be used to purchase Matchtech Group shares (‘Invest shares’). 
The Group will award 1 free share for every share that is purchased (Match shares). Sta will receive Match shares at the end of a 3 year 
holding period, subject to remaining employed within the Group and the Invest shares remaining in the plan throughout the holding period. 
At 31 July 2012, the following shares were held in the scheme by the Executive Directors:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes
forming part of the nancial statements
1. Significant Accounting Policies
i. The Business and Address of the Group
Matchtech Group plc is a human capital resources business dealing with contract and permanent recruitment in the Private and Public 
Sectors. The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Group’s address is: Matchtech Group plc, 1450 Parkway, Whiteley, 
Fareham PO15 7AF.
ii. Basis of Preparation of the Financial Statements
The nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) and which are e ective at 31 July 2012.
These nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have been applied consistently 
throughout both the Group and the Company for the purposes of preparation of these nancial statements. A summary of the principal 
accounting policies of the Group are set out below.
iii. Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and budgets for the coming year, which have been drawn up with appropriate regard for the current 
macroeconomic environment and the particular circumstances in which the Group operates. These were prepared with reference to 
historic and current industry knowledge, taking future strategy of the Group into account. As a result, at the time of approving the nancial 
statements, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group have su cient resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, and accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the nancial statements. 
As with all business forecasts, the Directors cannot guarantee that the going concern basis will remain appropriate given the inherent 
uncertainty about future events.
iv. New Standards and Interpretations
New standards and amendments to existing standards applicable for the period ending 31 July 2012 are:
IAS 24 Related party disclosures 1 January 2011
The adoption of the above standards has had no impact on the nancial statements other than the presentational di erences described. 
Speci cally, there was no impact on the Statement of Financial Position in the current or prior periods, and as such an additional 
comparative Statement of Financial Position has not been included.
New Standards in Issue, Not Yet Effective
The following relevant Standards and Interpretations, which are new and yet to become mandatory, have not been applied in the Group 
 nancial statements:
Standard
E ective date 
(Annual periods 
beginning on or after)
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012
v. Basis of Consolidation
The Group nancial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the Statement 
of Financial Position date. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has power to control the nancial and operating policies 
so as to obtain bene ts from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all 
identi able assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not 
they were recorded in the nancial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary are included in the Group Statement of Financial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for subsequent 
measurement in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 52
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. The Group and Company Significant Accounting Policies continued
vi. Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for services provided, excluding 
VAT and trade discounts. Revenue on temporary placements is recognised upon receipt of a client approved timesheet or equivalent. 
Revenue from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidate’s remuneration package, is recognised when 
candidates commence employment at which point it is probable that the economic bene ts associated with the transaction will be 
transferred. Other fees are recognised on con rmation from the client committing to the agreement.
vii. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write o the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that 
asset. Depreciation is charged per annum as follows:
Motor vehicles 25.0% Reducing balance
Computer equipment 25.0% Straight-line
O ce equipment 12.5% Straight-line
Leasehold Improvements Over the period of the lease term
Residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.
viii. Intangible Assets
Separately acquired software licences are included at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of that asset 
at 20%–50% per annum. 
Other intangible assets are included at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of that asset.
Provision is made against the carrying value of intangible assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred. 
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement under administrative expenses.
ix. Disposal of Assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the di erence between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
x. Operating Lease Agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged against pro ts on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread 
over the term of the lease.
xi. Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable pro t for the year.
Deferred income tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary di erences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the di erence 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition 
of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or a ects tax or 
accounting pro t.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary di erences will be able to be o set against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted 
or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred tax on temporary di erences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if these temporary di erences can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as share-based payments) in which case the related deferred tax is also 
charged or credited directly to equity.
xii. Pension Costs
The Company operates a de ned contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Company. The annual contributions payable are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
xiii. Share-Based Payment
The transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 have been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested 
at 1 August 2006. All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding 
credit to ‘share-based payment reserve’. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based remuneration are 
measured at their fair values. Fair values of employee services are indirectly determined by reference to the fair value of the share options 
awarded. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, pro tability 
and sales growth targets).
Notes continued
forming part of the nancial statements   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 53
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest di ers from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the 
current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are di erent to that 
estimated on vesting. Upon exercise of share options, proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
and share premium.
The Company is the granting and settling entity in the Group share-based payment arrangement where share options are granted to 
employees of its subsidiary companies. The Company recognises the share-based payment expense as an increase in the investment 
in subsidiary undertakings.
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) which is HMRC approved, and enables employees to purchase Company shares out 
of pre-tax salary. For each share purchased the Company grants an additional share at no cost to the employee. The expense in relation 
to these ‘free’ shares is recorded as employee remuneration and measured at fair value of the shares issued as at the date of grant.
xiv. Business Combinations Completed Prior to Date of Transition to IFRS
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 August 2006.
Accordingly the classi cation of the combination (merger) remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP. Assets and liabilities 
are recognised at date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP carrying amount 
immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement. Deferred tax is adjusted for 
the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional provisions.
xv. Financial Assets
All nancial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
In the Company nancial statements, investment in the subsidiary Company is measured at cost, and provision made where an impairment 
value is deemed to have occurred.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables are classi ed as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at 
amortised cost using e ective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal 
of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the di erence between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
A nancial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to cash ows from the asset expire or the nancial asset is transferred 
and that transfer quali es for derecognition. A nancial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash ows of the 
asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash ows of the asset but assumes a contractual 
obligation to pay the cash ows to one or more recipients. A nancial asset that is transferred quali es for derecognition if the Group 
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Trade receivables subject to the invoice discounting facility are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position until they are settled 
by the customer.
xvi. Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other nancial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument and comprise trade and other payables and bank loans. Financial liabilities are recorded initially 
at fair value, net of direct issue costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e ective interest rate method.
A nancial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
xvii. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits.
xviii. Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘other short-term nancial liabilities’ when the dividends are 
approved in general meeting prior to the Statement of Financial Position date.
xix. Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Non-monetary items that are 
measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that 
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 54
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. The Group and Company Significant Accounting Policies continued
Any exchange di erences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates di erent from those 
at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the pro t or loss in the period in which they arise. 
The assets and liabilities in the nancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the Statement 
of Financial Position date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate. The exchange di erences arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to ‘Translation of foreign operations’ in equity. On disposal of a foreign 
operation the cumulative translation di erences are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance on the cumulative translation adjustment on retranslation of subsidiaries’ net assets has been set 
to zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
xx. Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares.
 ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses 
of the share issue.
 ‘Share-based payment reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
 ‘Merger reserve’ represents the equity balance arising on the merger of Matchtech Engineering and Matchmaker Personnel.
 ‘Translation of foreign operations’ represents the foreign currency di erences arising on translating foreign operations into the 
presentational currency of the Group.
 ‘Retained earnings’ represents retained pro ts.
xxi. Signi cant Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Estimates and assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the nancial statements. They a ect 
the application of the Group’s accounting policies, reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made. 
They are assessed on an ongoing basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical Judgements
The judgements made which, in the opinion of the Directors, are critical in drawing up the nancial statements are as follows:
Invoice Discounting Facility
The terms of this arrangement are judged to be such that the risk and rewards of ownership of the trade receivables do not pass to 
the nance provider. As such the receivables are not derecognised on draw-down of funds against this facility. This facility is recognised 
as a liability for the amount drawn.
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date are 
discussed below. These are included for completeness, although it is the Directors’ view that none of these have signi cant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next nancial year.
Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment
The cost of equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis and the cost of motor vehicles is depreciated on a reducing balance basis over 
their useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of property, plant and equipment to be within 2 to 8 years. These are common life 
expectancies applied in the industry in which the Group operates. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development 
could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future depreciation charges could be revised.
Impairment Loss of Trade and Other Receivables
The Group’s policy for doubtful receivables is based on the ongoing evaluation of the collectability and ageing analysis of the trade and 
other receivables and on management’s judgements. Considerable judgement is required in assessing the ultimate realisation of these 
receivables, including the current creditworthiness and the past collection history of each debtor. If the nancial conditions of the Group’s 
receivables were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional impairment loss of trade and other 
receivables may be required. The carrying amounts of these assets are shown in Note 15.
Share-Based Payments
The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values of options granted to employees under IFRS 2 are detailed under Note 20.

Future Tax Rate Changes
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK Corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014. A reduction in the rate 
from 26% to 25% (e ective from 1 April 2012) was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% (e ective 
from 1 April 2013) and 23% (e ective from 1 April 2014) were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 17 July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge and further reduce the deferred tax asset.
9. Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the consolidated pro t after taxation attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the same basis as above, except that the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares (arising from the Group’s share option schemes) into 
ordinary shares has been added to the denominator. There are no changes to the pro t (numerator) as a result of the dilutive calculation. 
The number of dilutive shares has increased due to the issue of new share options in the current year.

quality and consider the amounts to be recoverable in full. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Group uses a third party credit scoring system to assess the credit worthiness of potential new customers before accepting them. 
Credit limits are de ned by customer based on this information. All customer accounts are subject to review on a regular basis by senior

During the year the Group operated a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) for Executive Directors and 
a ero Priced Share Option Bonus for key sta . The LTIP options were granted on 31 January 2012 and are subject to an EPS performance 
target with a TSR underpin. The deferred share bonus option entitlements were granted on 31 January 2012, however, all the entitlements 
lapsed in the year due to performance falling below the minimum threshold. The zero priced share options were granted on 31 January to 
members of sta subject to 2 and 3 year holding periods.
All share options have a life of 10 years and are equity-settled on exercise.

In addition to the share option schemes the Group operated a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which is an HMRC approved plan available to all 
employees enabling them to purchase shares out of pre-tax salary. For each share purchased the Company grants an additional share at  
no cost.
The fair values of the share options and the SIPs are included in the table below. The values of the LTIPs granted in the year were calculated 
using a Monte Carlo simulation method along with the assumptions as detailed below. The values of the zero price options granted in the 
year were calculated using a Black Scholes method along with the assumptions as detailed below. The fair values of the SIPs and Deferred 
Share Bonus were calculated as the market values on the date of the grant adjusted for the assumptions as detailed below.

The volatility of the Company’s share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of the annualised standard deviations 
of daily continuously compounded returns on the Company’s stock, calculated over 5 years back from the date of grant, where applicable. 
The risk-free rate is the yield to maturity on the date of grant of a UK Gilt Strip, with term to maturity equal to the life of the option. 
LTIP awards are subject to a TSR test. This ‘market’ based condition is taken into account in the date of grant fair calculation.
During the year a Value Creation Plan (VCP) was implemented with participants receiving an entitlement to nil cost options dependent 
on the Company’s share price at annual measurement dates. The VCP has a 5 year performance period with the rst measurement date 
of 18 November 2012. The nil cost options will be exercisable, 50% on November 2016 and 50% in November 2017. The IFRS 2 charge 
was calculated using the Black-Scholes methodology using a risk free rate of return of 1.27% and share price volatility of 18.74%.

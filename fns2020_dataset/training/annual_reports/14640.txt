Chairman’s statement
Performance and dividend
Sales increased by over 4% to £689.4 million 
(2012: £661.7 million). Organic sales growth 
was 4%, continuing the trend reported in the 
first half year. Sales growth was strongest 
in Asia Pacific, followed by Watson-Marlow 
and EMEA; sales in the Americas were 
marginally lower. Overall currency effects 
were negligible.
Operating profit increased by 1 1% to 
£151.6 million (2012: £136.2 million), with 
an outstanding improvement in EMEA. 
The operating profit margin rose from 
20.6% to a record 22.0%. Net finance 
costs reduced and pre-tax profit was 12% 
higher at £151. 1 million (2012: £134.9 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 
14% to 138.8p (2012: 122.2p).
Cash generation was once again very 
strong with good cash conversion and we 
finished the year with a net cash balance 
of £16 million, which was after payment 
of the 100p per share special dividend of 
£78 million.
The interim dividend was raised by 13% to 
18.0p per share, which was paid in November 
2013. The Board is recommending an 
increase in the final dividend of 1 1 % to 41.0p 
per share payable on 30th May 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at 2nd May 
2014. The total ordinary dividend for the year 
is therefore increased by 1 1 % to 59.0p per 
share (2012: 53.0p per share).
A full review of our financial performance 
commences on page 28. 
The Board recognises the contribution made 
by our many exceptional people around the 
world who exemplify the Company’s core 
values. On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to express our gratitude to all our employees 
worldwide for their hard work and 
commitment throughout the year and for 
their individual contributions, which together 
culminated in the good results achieved 
in 2013.
Prospects
We have a robust and resilient business 
model built around our direct sales 
approach, delivering solutions to meet 
our customers’ energy saving, process 
efficiency and sustainability challenges, 
with a high proportion of sales coming from 
customers’ operating and maintenance 
budgets. Steam is universal as an energy 
source, used in processes in a diverse 
range of industries across the world, and our 
markets therefore reflect general economic 
activity and rates of industrial production.
Our assumption is that markets will continue 
to exhibit low levels of growth but with 
modest overall improvement through 2014. 
We remain focused on our strategic priorities 
to generate our own growth, through 
broadening our global presence, capitalising 
on our investment in new products and 
innovation, increasing market share and 
delivering application specific solutions 
through our teams of highly trained sales 
and service engineers. Our fundamental 
strengths and growth strategies give the 
Board confidence that the Group will make 
further progress in 2014, although stronger 
sterling and currency weakness in a number 
of emerging markets has provided a strong 
headwind in the early months of this year.
Governance and Board changes
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
ensuring that the Group successfully 
implements its strategies and achieves its 
objectives of generating shareholder value 
through consistent and sustainable growth 
in earnings and dividends. The Board and 
its Committees operate to the highest 
ethical standards and corporate governance 
practices, and demonstrates transparency 
through fair, balanced and understandable 
reporting. Our full governance review 
commences on page 56. 
During 2013, Mark Vernon announced his 
intention to retire as Group Chief Executive 
on 15th January 2014. On behalf of the 
Board and shareholders, I would like to 
convey our sincere thanks to Mark for 
his significant contribution in guiding the 
Company through a challenging economic 
period and meaningfully improving on the 
Group’s record of strong and consistent 
growth, and we wish him well on his 
retirement back home in his native America.
The Board was delighted to appoint Nick 
Anderson as Group Chief Executive in 
January 2014. Nick joined the Company 
in September 201 1, bringing his broad 
experience in the industrial engineering 
industry to the Group, with an emphasis 
on international business operations and 
sales management.
Structure of the Annual Report 
and Accounts
The Board welcomes the move to improve 
corporate reporting and the 2013 Annual 
Report and Accounts fully embraces the 
new regulatory and disclosure requirements. 
The Annual Report and Accounts now leads 
with a Strategic report explaining our market 
place, our business model, our strategy and 
our performance in a clear and integrated 
way. The Governance section explains 
the detailed work of the Board and its 
Committees, and presents a Remuneration 
policy report for consideration by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20th May 2014. We hope that you enjoy 
reading this Annual Report and Accounts 
and that it is helpful to your understanding 
of our business.
“ I am pleased to report further good 
progress in 2013, achieving record 
sales and profit.”

Global trends
With 64 operating units* in 39 
countries and a direct sales presence 
in over 50 countries worldwide, 
we are an organisation with a truly 
global reach. As a global Company, 
our operations are affected by 
a number of world megatrends, 
such as population growth, ageing 
populations, increasing global energy 
consumption, the economic rise of 
the East and climate change.
We predominantly view these 
megatrends as long-term drivers 
for growth. For example, population 
growth will stimulate increased 
consumption and, hence, a demand 
in all our major industries; ageing 
populations will increase demand 
for healthcare and pharmaceutical 
products; an increase in global 
energy consumption will 
drive investment in the oil and 
petrochemical industry in the short 
term and energy management 
solutions in the short, medium and 
long term; the economic rise of the 
East is opening new markets and 
increasing consumer demand; while 
national and international climate 
change mitigation strategies are 
encouraging companies to reduce 
their carbon footprint by managing 
energy more effectively, thereby 
increasing demand for our energy 
management products and services.

Growing our market share
Growing our market share is an essential 
element of our growth strategy and we have 
made good gains during the last five years. 
We gain market share through our ability to 
solve problems for our customers, which 
other suppliers cannot, and by winning new 
installations that then become the base for 
future revenue.
We also view market expansion as an 
essential element in creating future growth 
opportunities. We attribute approximately 
half of our addressable market growth 
during the past five years to new product 
development and acquisitions. 
Good regional balance
Group revenues are well spread 
geographically, with a good balance 
in regional market share; a key factor 
in the resiliency of our business.

Our diverse markets 
We serve a wide range of industries and have a great diversity of end markets and 
customers. Diversity is one of the core strengths of the Group and insulates us from much 
seasonal and cyclical demand. We have an excellent balance between higher-growth 
end markets and those that are more “defensive” and recession proof. More than 50% 
of the Group’s revenue is derived from these defensive end markets, including: foods, 
beverages, HVAC, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, chemicals, water treatment and power 
generation. 
Within the steam specialties business, approximately 50% of revenue is derived from the 
replacement of our installed product base. To maintain operational efficiency, production 
output and product quality, regular maintenance spending is required by our customers. 
In the Group as a whole, more than 85% of our revenues are derived from our customers’ 
annual maintenance and operational budgets, ensuring the resiliency of our business 
in times of recession.

Strategic report continued
We have built a resilient business model that 
has enabled the business to prosper, despite 
the challenging global economic environment 
over the past few years, and that positions 
us well to deliver continued good organic 
revenue growth. We benefit from the diversity

“ Developing strong relationships with our customers is 
essential. Word of mouth recommendations are vital 
in the communities where I work, in the Midwestern 
United States – and not just regarding the products, 
but the people too. In Wisconsin, for example, there’s 
a strong pulp and paper mill industry. If one mill has 
enjoyed success with a Bredel pump, for instance, 
it only takes a casual chat over a cup of coffee on a 
Saturday morning for word to spread. If we’ve done

Customer closeness helps Watson-Marlow to improve 
process efficiency in the paper industry
At Watson-Marlow we work closely with our customers to 
understand and overcome their process challenges and 
problems. Within the paper industry, the sector expertise 
of our sales engineers enables them to offer customers the 
most appropriate pump for each application. For example, 
during paper dyeing it is critical that multiple colours of dye 
are metered precisely onto paper rolls; if the colour of a roll 
falls outside of an acceptable tolerance range it must be 
scrapped and the process begun again, costing time and 
money. Selecting the right pump for the application reduces 
downtime and wastage.
The sector-specific knowledge, which arises from working 
closely with our customers, enables our engineers to 
practically demonstrate the value of peristaltic pumps 
to a particular industry. For example, in non-peristaltic 
pump types dye comes in contact with pump 
components, increasing the need for regular maintenance. 
Maintenance crews often become covered in dye as the 
pumps are taken apart and reassembled. In our peristaltic 
pumps, the unique design means that the liquid being 
pumped flows through tubes and does not come into 
contact with pump components. Maintaining our pumps is 
clean and quick; extracting and replacing the tubing takes 
only minutes to complete. Our paper mill customers benefit 
from our industry-specific knowledge of their processes and 
applications, as well as the metering accuracy and ease of 
maintenance supplied by our pumps. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 16

Applied engineering improves steam quality and process 
efficiency at a Hungarian pharmaceutical plant
Experiencing escalating maintenance costs and the 
frequent shutdowns of fermenters at their Budapest plant, 
Gedeon Richter Plc, Hungary’s largest biotechnology and 
pharmaceutical company, asked Spirax Sarco to design 
a solution for the effective lubrication of mechanical seals, 
which were requiring frequent and expensive repairs 
and replacements.
After a system survey, Spirax Sarco identified a range 
of problems, including insufficient steam traps, a faulty 
pressure reduction valve and excess pressure, which 
were causing operational issues.
A bespoke engineered solution was designed by Spirax 
Sarco to improve steam quality and operational efficiency 
across the site. Stainless steel elements of the solution 
included the installation of a PRV station for precise 
pressure control and separator units ahead of mechanical 
seals, a variety of appropriately selected and installed 
steam traps, a range of strainers and a small condensate 
recirculating pump for improved lubrication.
The innovative solution was so successful that 
Gedeon Richter Plc has implemented elements of it at 
their new biotechnology plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 18

Spirax Sarco’s heat recovery packages help ReFood UK Ltd 
save over 100MWh per day and £80,000 per year
At ReFood UK Limited’s anaerobic digester facility in 
Doncaster, 45,000 tonnes of food waste are broken down 
each year. The methane produced, as a result of the 
process, is used to run a series of combined heat and 
power engines that generate heat and electrical energy. 
A surplus of hot water is generated by the engines and 
three Spirax Sarco heat recovery packages have been 
installed to utilise the waste heat and carry out three 
separate heating roles at the plant. 
The first heat recovery package raises the temperature 
of the site’s boiler feed water, the second heats water to 
feed the site’s general-purpose hot water tank and the 
third maintains the temperature of circulating water that 
is used to prevent oils and fats in the food waste from 
solidifying in the tanks. 
The three heat recovery packages recover valuable waste 
heat that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere, 
save energy and contribute to the production of 
renewable energy. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 20

Spirax Sarco invests £5 million in a new factory, offices 
and training centre in Mexico
During 2013, construction began on a new factory, offices 
and steam technology training centre on a 25,000m² site in 
Monterrey, Mexico. The factory, which became operational 
during early 2014, is double the size of the previous factory 
and has the capacity to increase production from 30,000 to 
90,000 parts per month. 
The new facilities represent a key investment in our regional 
manufacturing strategy and will create a competitive 
advantage in the local market due to a higher availability 
of products and lower manufacturing costs. The factory 
currently supplies the home market and exports to the USA 
and Canada, but with the increased manufacturing capacity 
it is well positioned to fulfil specific product requirements for 
Central and South America. 
Environmental sustainability was central to the design of 
the new facilities. Skylights are increasing natural light in 
buildings, a geothermal cooling system is providing air 
conditioning and solar panels are helping to meet the site’s 
electricity needs. Rainwater harvesting is providing water for 
bathrooms and, once treated, for water fountains, while grey 
water (generated by hand washing) is used to irrigate the 
gardens. Green roofs have been planted and the grounds 
have been landscaped. An initiative called “Taking root in 
Spirax” was launched to engage the local workforce in the 
sustainability concept. The company has bought dozens of 
small trees which are now being cared for by the employees 
until they are big enough to plant outside.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 22

1. Strengthen position 2. Deliver solutions 3. Broaden presence
Strengthen our global  
market position
Our ability to help our customers solve difficult 
productivity, control and energy efficiency 
problems builds deep, long-term relationships 
that are central to our business model. This 
demands that our sales and service engineers 
are intimate with our customers’ operating 
issues and that they are skilled in steam or 
niche pumping systems knowledge and cost-
effective product applications.
To continually improve the competency 
and technical skills of our sales and service 
engineers, we have developed a wide-
ranging online university curriculum and other 
internet-based training tools, as well as formal 
classroom training that is available in our 42 
training centres located throughout the world. 
We have also installed global information 
collection and sharing software to improve our 
ability to share application knowledge across 
our global sales network.
Deliver solutions to reduce 
energy usage
Our customers are increasingly calling upon our 
sales and service engineers to provide energy 
audits aimed at reducing energy and water 
usage, lowering plant emissions and improving 
energy efficiency. While audits typically cover 
the thermal aspects of plant energy usage, 
we are developing capabilities to help our 
customers manage other areas of energy 
consumption, including plant compressed 
air usage, boiler and HVAC efficiency.
Our ability to deliver an increasingly wider 
range of solutions rests with our commitment 
to new product development. We have 
significantly increased our investments 
during the last five years to widen our 
range of products and applications and to 
develop unique energy recovery solutions. 
Innovative peristaltic pumping developments 
are delivering new solutions in previously 
unaddressed applications.
Broaden our global 
presence
Our strong global presence is a result of decades 
of effort and investment to build global brands 
that are easily recognisable and symbolise 
expertise and reliability. We have a long-standing 
presence in many key developing markets. Our 
strong infrastructure around the world is helping 
us to more quickly branch out into neighbouring 
markets that, in most cases, are at an earlier 
stage of economic development. 
We are also pioneering the introduction of 
peristaltic pumps in much of the developing 
world, demonstrating their superior technology 
and lower life cycle cost benefits. Continued 
investment in the development of emerging 
markets and in market penetration of mature 
markets, forms the basis of long-term growth 
opportunities for the Group.
We look to make acquisitions that deliver 
market access or widen our product range 
or add technological capability.
Progress in 2013
We have continued to broaden our global 
presence and added three new operating 
companies in 2013: Spirax Sarco Middle East, 
Spirax Sarco Indonesia and Watson-Marlow 
Austria. We also began direct selling in 
Peru and Panama, for the steam specialties 
business, and in Malaysia for Watson-Marlow.
Outlook
We will continue to strengthen our global 
position during 2014 with the appropriate 
expansion of our direct sales force. Through 
the creation of 30 additional bespoke 
“e-learning” courses we will further develop 
the skills of our direct sales people. 
Outlook
We will continue to maintain our R&D spend 
at its current higher level. Going forward we 
will see the benefit of our investments as 
we develop new products and extend our 
product ranges to meet the evolving needs 
of our customers.
Outlook
We will continue to establish new operating 
companies as demand reaches a crucial 
threshold. We perceive opportunities for further 
development in new and emerging markets 
and seek to strengthen our presence in our 
mature markets.
Progress in 2013
We have added sales resource in key regions, 
particularly in the emerging markets in Asia 
Pacific and continued to invest in the training 
of our sales and service engineers. During 
2013 we launched a Group-wide “e-learning” 
programme, with approximately 50 online 
courses, directed at enhancing the knowledge 
and skills of our sales and service engineers.
Progress in 2013
We have maintained the significant investment 
in R&D established in recent years. We have 
focused on helping our customers to meet 
their sustainability targets and improve their 
process efficiencies. Revenue from our energy 
management solutions has increased by over 
30% since 2008.

5. Generate growth 6. Operate sustainably 4. Grow share
Generate consistent 
organic growth
Our knowledge of our customers’ processes 
and operational issues enables us to deliver 
unique engineering solutions. In so doing, we 
also instil confidence that in turn strengthens 
our overall customer relationships and builds 
our installed base. We continually strive to 
strengthen our customer relationships through 
problem solving and supplying a wider range of 
products and services.
Investing in local manufacturing facilities has 
enabled us to expand our manufacturing 
footprint closer to the point of sale. The 
combination of our skilled local sales and 
service expertise, close customer relationships 
and off-the-shelf availability of our extensive 
range of steam system and pump products, 
enhance our ability to generate consistent 
top-line revenue growth.
Operate sustainably
Our approach to sustainability encompasses 
five primary areas of emphasis: good corporate 
governance, financial health, employee 
well-being, community engagement and 
environmental stewardship. We believe 
that effective management in each of these 
areas is essential to long-term sustainability. 
Further, our business is centred on providing 
environmentally-friendly solutions to our 
customers, helping them to improve the 
efficiency of their plant operations and reduce 
their energy and water usage.
We have exceptional people who share 
our core values of respect, accountability, 
passion, integrity and delivery. We maintain 
professionally challenging and safe workplaces 
and provide for on-going training and 
development. Our corporate values are the 
foundation upon which we base our decisions 
and actively manage our global operations.
Grow market share
Our direct sales approach allows us to leverage 
our brands into new products and applications. 
As we widen our product portfolio, we are 
making it easier for our customers to buy from 
us, resulting in an increasing spend on our 
products and engineered packages for small-
scale maintenance improvement activities and 
capital projects.
A wider range of new products in areas such 
as energy management, controls, condensate 
management and new pumping technologies 
and systems, have contributed about 20% to 
the organic sales growth in the past five years. 
We are also transitioning our Watson-Marlow 
selling organisation in Europe to a more 
sectorised, technical, direct sales approach 
that results in faster rates of growth.
Progress in 2013
During 2013 we invested £5 million in a new 
manufacturing facility in Mexico, which became 
operational in early 2014. On-going investment 
to develop the skills of our sales people and to 
strengthen relationships with our customers, 
have resulted in a successful year of revenue 
growth during 2013.
Progress in 2013
During 2013 we appointed a senior Group 
HS&E executive to monitor sustainability 
performance across the Group and appointed 
a third-party organisation to provide limited 
assurance of our CO 2e emissions data. 
We increased the average number of formal 
training days per customer facing employee 
and donated £200,000 to charity.
Progress in 2013
We have developed a number of new products 
during 2013, including the STAPS wireless 
steam trap monitoring system, which offers an 
alternative to manual steam trap surveys and 
hard wired monitoring systems. Significant 
revenue has been derived from key product 
initiatives, such as the Qdos pump, launched 
by Watson-Marlow in 2012.
Outlook
Our new facility in Mexico will improve 
efficiency and our ability to meet demand 
in the Americas. The skills of our customer 
facing employees mean that we are well 
positioned to capitalise on any improvement 
in economic conditions.
Outlook
During 2013 we received third-party assurance 
of our CO 2e emissions data. We intend to 
maintain the momentum generated by this 
process through investing in further carbon 
management strategies. 
Outlook
Our one-stop shop customer approach, 
wide product range, packaged solutions and 
direct selling model have positioned us well for 
continuing future growth.

Revenue growth is a key driver of profit 
generation and a central element in the 
annual planning process. Bonus targets 
are driven off annual plans and therefore 
revenue growth drives a key measure of 
variable remuneration.

Principal risks
A summary of the principal risks, their likely impact and an explanation of how the Group mitigates each risk is set out in the table below. 
The direction of change in particular risks during the year is explained in the “Principal Risk” column and illustrated by the arrow in the 
“Change” column. Please note that the “Change” column shows the change in the risk and not the mitigation of the risk. We have also 
set out the relevance of the risk to our strategy.
Principal risk Change Impact Mitigation Relevance to 
strategy
Economic and political instability:
The Group operates worldwide. 
Economic and political instability 
creates risks for our locally based 
direct operations. The Group 
has reviewed country, credit, 
liquidity and currency risks and, 
in particular, those arising from 
European debt issues.
Fluctuations in profit 
from significant 
currency movements
Reduced profit due to 
impact on customers 
with economic 
problems
Potential 
redenomination 
of local currency, 
devaluation and high 
inflation
Compliance with Group Treasury Policy
Strong internal controls with internal audit and 
appropriate insurance
Resilient business model (see pages 12–21)
Senior managers in the EMEA division undertook 
a Eurozone Scenario Planning Workshop, externally 
facilitated by PA Consulting Group, which considered 
the impact of countries leaving the Eurozone. The 
objective was to improve the Group’s preparedness 
in respect of this risk. The toolkit developed is to be 
deployed by other operating companies
The operations in Argentina were profitable despite a 
general devaluation in Argentina. This is mainly due to 
the move of the business to the US dollar.
Broaden our  
global presence
Significant exchange 
rate movements:
The Group reports its results 
and pays dividends in sterling. 
Operating companies, including 
manufacturing, trade in 
local currency.
 E x c h a n g e r a te 
movements impact 
landed costs, and 
therefore gross profits, 
depending upon the 
country of origin. 
Non-sterling receipts 
are translated 
into sterling on 
consolidation
Regional manufacturing strategy to spread 
manufacturing across a number of currency areas, 
and consideration of exchange rate exposures in the 
manufacturing strategy
Forward cover where appropriate and in line with the 
Treasury Policy. However, this has only a relatively 
short-term effect (up to two years) after which the 
underlying currency cost base and exchange rates 
apply
Focus on reducing manufacturing costs including 
sourcing materials, where appropriate, from cheaper 
areas such as China and India.

consistent organic 
growth
Loss of manufacturing output at 
any Group factory:
In relation to the steam business, 
the Group manufactures most 
of the products we sell in eight 
main factory units which supply 
our sales operations worldwide. 
Loss of manufacturing output at 
any important plant risks serious 
disruption to sales operations. 
In Watson-Marlow Pumps Group, 
pump and tubing manufacturing 
are separated.
Reduced sales and 
profit due to inability to 
meet customer orders
Loss of market share
Damage to reputation
Group manufacturing strategy to regionalise 
manufacturing base and increase resilience
Business continuity planning and disaster 
recovery plans

Breach of regulatory requirements:
The Group operates in a large 
number of countries across the 
world and is subject to many 
different laws and regulations, 
including the UK Bribery Act, 
the US Foreign and Corrupt 
Practices Act, health and safety, 
competition laws and local quality 
regulations. Breaching these 
laws and regulations could have 
serious consequences.
Fines and regulatory 
action and resultant

Our  
risks
Following the reprioritisation of the principal risks in 2013 by the Risk Management Committee, we have added one new principal 
risk (Significant exchange rate movements) and removed one principal risk shown in our 2012 Annual Report and Accounts (Risk of 
product failure).
The way in which the Risk Management Committee reviews and controls our risk management processes and procedures is set out 
in the Risk Management Committee report on pages 70 to 72.
There may be other risks and uncertainties which are unknown to the Group or which could become material in the future. These risks

Highlights
Organic sales increased by 3% despite difficult economic 
conditions. Operating profit rose by an outstanding 26% at 
constant currency and the margin rose to a record 19.7%. 
The margin was underpinned by an increased focus on price 
management, restructuring benefits and improved performance 
from the consolidated manufacturing site in Cheltenham. 
There was good sales growth in the UK, Africa and the 
Middle East.
Highlights
Organic sales increased by 8% with good growth in controls, 
flow metering and services. Market conditions remained 
favourable in China where our business performed strongly and 
our business in Korea delivered another good result. We continued 
to add sales resource expanding our direct sales presence in the 
Philippines and Indonesia. Overall, operating profit was up 6% 
at constant currency. 29 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Highlights
Organic sales were broadly flat with growth in Latin America 
but with lower sales in North America due to the non-repeat of 
large projects in the USA and lower project activity in Canada. 
Operating profit was up 6% at constant currency and the 
operating profit margin returned to almost 20%, with a good 
contribution from cost reductions and efficiencies in the USA.
Highlights
Organic sales increased by 4%, with growth in biopharm and 
food & beverage markets but with a difficult comparison in the 
second half year due to several large non-repeating projects. 
Underlying demand was sustained and we ended 2013 with a 
strong order book. The new Qdos and Apex products contributed 
significantly and we continued to add sector-focused sales 
resource. Operating profit increased by 7% at constant currency.

Introduction
This is a truly exceptional Company, with 
many fundamental strengths. The success 
and strong performance during recent 
years, despite a challenging global 
economic environment, demonstrates that 
our strategy, robust business model and 
talented organisation delivers superior value 
to our shareholders. As I take over as Group 
Chief Executive, my priority is to continue 
to leverage our strengths and build on this 
solid base.
The skills and applications knowledge of 
our people, especially our direct sales and 
service engineers, is central to our ability 
to provide customers with solutions to 
their energy efficiency, productivity, quality 
and sustainability issues. We manage the 
business for the long term and continually 
invest in widening our addressable markets, 
expanding our market penetration and 
extending our geographic presence, 
especially into newly emerging markets. 
Our focus on solution selling underpins 
our growth in both emerging and 
developed markets.
In recent years we have improved processes 
and significantly increased our investment in 
research and development resources, which 
is central to our ability to expand the size of 
our addressable market. I would expect new 
products to make an increasing contribution 
to sales growth in the future.
We have increased regional manufacturing 
to enhance local availability of an unrivalled 
range of products, improving customer 
service and supporting sales growth. We will 
look to increase supply chain effectiveness, 
by optimising our global distribution network 
and leveraging manufacturing efficiencies.
Global environment
Global industrial production provides a 
reasonable indicator for the conditions in 
our markets. We entered 2013 with very low 
rates of industrial production growth that 
had been progressively slowing through 
the previous year. The first half of 2013 
saw a continuation of this trend but with 
some acceleration in growth through the 
second half of the year. For the full year, 
growth in industrial production was, overall, 
broadly the same as the prior year’s growth. 
The outlook for 2014, however, is a little 
more positive. We have a robust and resilient 
business model but we are not immune 
from economic swings, which our markets 
can lag by up to nine months, although our 
focus remains on creating our own growth 
opportunities through the implementation of 
our growth strategy.
Market conditions remained weak across 
most of Europe, with overall industrial 
production flat year-on-year, although 
with recent indications of improvement in 
market conditions towards the end of the 
year. Markets in North America remained 
challenging and in developed markets 
generally, project activity was slow with lower 
demand for higher value, energy saving and 
process efficiency improvement projects; 
routine maintenance spending by customers 
was modestly higher.
Emerging market conditions were 
mixed, with stable growth in China and 
improvement in parts of Southeast Asia and 
Eastern Europe. In Latin America, there was 
an improving trend in economic conditions 
entering 2013, which flattened in the second 
half. Currency pressures in Argentina 
erupted in early 2014, with a knock-on 
effect in a number of other emerging 
market currencies, creating a degree of 
market uncertainty.
Progress in 2013
Group sales increased by over 4% from 
£661.7 million to £689.4 million. Organic 
sales growth was nearly 4% for the year, 
repeating the growth achieved in the first 
half year. Growth was led by Asia Pacific,  31 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

at a glance
with China continuing its strong progress, 
followed by Watson-Marlow. Modest sales 
growth was achieved in EMEA, despite the 
difficult economic background, and sales 
in the Americas were marginally lower due 
to North America, mitigated by growth in 
Latin America. Overall, sales in emerging 
markets expanded to 42% of Group revenue 
from 40% in 2012. Favourable currency 
movements at the half year were steadily 
eroded by the strengthening of sterling and 
weakness in a number of emerging market 
currencies, particularly in the fourth quarter 
of 2013. If current exchange rates prevail 
through 2014, sales would be reduced 
by around 5% on translation into sterling 
versus 2013.
In the steam specialties business, organic 
sales grew by nearly 3.5%. Sales of our 
traditional condensate management 
products were higher with increased sales 
of traps and valves, which reflected the 
solid underlying demand from the core 
maintenance and operating expenditures 
of our customers. In general, demand 
for higher value energy saving and plant 
improvement projects has been soft. 
Metering sales increased nicely, driven 
by the introduction of innovative and 
technologically advanced products over the 
past two years, with particular success in 
EMEA and Asia Pacific. Sales of controls 
products grew well, with progress in all 
regions, and energy services also did well. 
Following the exceptionally strong growth 
in heat exchange packages in 2012, the non-
repeat of several large projects meant that 
heat exchange package sales were down 
in 2013.
R&D in the steam specialties business 
continued to benefit from the higher level 
of investment and resource in recent years, 
which was maintained through 2013, as 
well as the improvement in processes and 
techniques. Focus was directed onto fewer, 
higher incremental sales value opportunities 
where we can best leverage new product 
sales. We expect that the investment and 
improvements will generate an increasing 
contribution to future sales growth from 
new products.
In the Watson-Marlow pumps business, 
organic sales grew 4% with a particularly 
tough second half comparison due to 
several large non-repeating wastewater 
treatment and mining projects shipped in 
the second half of the prior year. There was 
particularly good progress in Europe where 
an increase in the direct sales channel and 
greater focus through further sectorisation 
of the sales teams, delivered solid growth. 
New products contributed strongly, with 
the new Qdos pump making a particular 
impact. The higher level of R&D resource 
in Watson-Marlow has been maintained, 
with innovative new products that continue 
to expand the performance envelope 
that increases the addressable market, 
displacing other pump types.
The Group has added resource and 
intensified the search for suitable acquisition 
candidates, focusing on expanding our 
addressable markets through new products 
and technologies, direct market access and 
complementary businesses. Our strong 
balance sheet and debt capacity provides 
us with considerable flexibility.
We achieved a good increase in operating 
profit of 1 1% from £136.2 million to 
£151.6 million. Using constant exchange 
rates, operating profit was ahead 10%. 
Following the exaggerated seasonal bias 
in 2012 of profits to the second half year 
of 43:57 , 2013 returned to a more normal 
pattern of 45:55. Emerging markets 
accounted for 45% of Group operating 
profit in 2013, in line with the prior 
year. This reflects the significant profit 
improvement achieved in the developed 
markets of Europe.
The Group operating profit margin jumped 
from 20.6% to a record 22.0%. The cost 
of raw materials and components was 
broadly flat, reflecting subdued world 
metals prices plus our on-going initiatives 
to improve the operation of our supply 
chain. We fully realised the benefits from the 
greater focus on price management and 
margin, as well as from the restructuring 
of our European sales companies that 
delivered a year-on-year cost reduction of 
£3.5 million. Profits rebounded from the 
low levels in the prior year in our European 
steam specialties manufacturing operations 
in Europe, particularly in the UK where we 
achieved further efficiency improvements 
from the consolidated site. We continue to 
invest in geographic expansion and market 
penetration in emerging markets, which 
remains a strategic priority.
Market outlook
We have an outstanding business 
model and over recent years have made 
significant and far-reaching improvements 
to our performance through a time of 
great economic uncertainty. This has been 
achieved whilst at the same time investing 
heavily in our manufacturing capability 
and capacity, in our R&D resources and 
processes, in our people development and 
in our expanding network of direct sales and 
service engineers.
Our markets are heavily influenced by 
the level of industrial production. We are 
not immune from economic tides but 
our business is resilient, having a high 
proportion of sales drawn from customers’ 
maintenance and operating budgets and 
with less exposure to the capital cycle. 
Our focus is on our strategic actions to 
out-perform our markets and we are well 
positioned to leverage the investments 
we have made to achieve growth and 
improvements in our business. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 32

“ Organic sales increased by 3% to 
£244.3 million despite continuing difficult 
economic conditions. Operating profit 
increased by an outstanding 26% at 
constant currency.”
Neil Daws 
Executive Director
Progress in 2013 
Sales in EMEA increased by 5% to 
£244.3 million (2012: £232.8 million). 
We achieved organic sales growth of 3% 
and favourable exchange rate movements 
added 2% to sales due to the stronger 
euro, partially offset by weakness in 
the South African rand and Turkish lira. 
Operating profit more than recovered the 
dip in 2012 and rose strongly by 31% to 
£48.2 million (2012: £36.7 million), and 
at constant exchange rates the increase 
was 26%. The operating profit margin 
expanded significantly from 15.8% to 19.7%; 
with only a small benefit from exchange 
rate movements.
Economic conditions remained difficult 
across most of our markets and, in 
particular, industrial production overall in 
Europe was flat for the year. After starting 
the year in decline, industrial production 
progressively improved and was positive 
in the fourth quarter for the first time in 
two years. Our business tends to lag the 
economic cycle by several quarters and 
our markets were again weak but stable 
and we achieved modest growth from our 
customers’ core maintenance and plant 
operations. Project work for energy saving 
and plant improvements was down, in 
part due to the non-repeat of several large 
orders in the prior year, and we continued 
to see project delays as customers deferred 
committing to larger value opportunities.
Emerging markets in EMEA produced good 
growth in both sales and profits. Sales were 
strongly ahead in the Middle East following 
our increased investment in sales resource 
in the region, culminating in the creation of 
our latest operating company in the UAE. 
The Czech Republic did well, delivering 
a large steam injector project at a major 
steel mill and sales were ahead in Turkey. 
Business levels stabilised in Russia following 
the decline in refining and petrochemicals 
activity in the prior year and we anticipate 
improvements in this important market 
from increased focus on our core business. 
Our business in South Africa performed well, 
increasing sales and reducing costs.
In our developed markets in EMEA, which 
account for broadly 80% of segment sales, 
we achieved a very small sales increase 
but profits were significantly higher as 
we realised the full-year benefit of the 
restructuring actions in 2012 and increased 
our focus on pricing and margin. In our large 
more mature markets in France, Germany, 
Italy, Spain and the UK, overall sales 
were marginally ahead, largely due to the 
strong performance in the UK, and profits 
were sharply higher in all five operations. 
Elsewhere, in Scandinavia profits were also 
well ahead but sales were modestly down 
as we refocused on the more attractive 
sections of the market.

EMEA
As expected, the trading performance in 
our European manufacturing operations 
rebounded strongly. In particular, we realised 
a significant improvement in profit from the 
single consolidated site in the UK through 
efficiency and process improvements, 
and cost reductions. The final piece of 
investment was completed when the 
new distribution centre in Cheltenham 
became fully operational in April 2013 
and we now have for the first time an 
integrated manufacturing plant from receipt 
of raw materials and components, to the 
warehousing and despatch of finished 
goods. R&D expenditure was maintained at 
the much higher level of investment reached 
over recent years.
Market overview
The Group’s most mature business 
operations are centred in Europe. At year 
end, the EMEA region comprised 22 
operating companies. During 2013 we 
established an operating company in 
the Middle East, located in Dubai, which 
started trading in November. Within the 
EMEA region our most important markets 
are foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, 
institutions and OEM customers supplying 
these industries.
During 2013 our markets across Europe 
remained stubbornly flat amid continued 
challenging economic conditions and 
low investment confidence driven by 
on-going concerns surrounding the debt 
crisis. Only critical maintenance spending 
remained robust throughout the first half 
year, although trend indicators suggest 
some signs of progress during the second 
half year. Elements of our business are late 
cycle and any improvement in business 
conditions will have a lagged effect.
Our biggest single operation within the 
Eurozone is the UK, which rebounded into 
solid positive growth on a strengthening 
economy and as some large projects 
came to fruition during 2013. Belgium, 
Sweden and our humidification business 
in Germany also posted positive growth, 
helping to off-set general weakness in 
most other European markets.
Markets in France, Italy and Germany 
showed no sign of improvement, and 
Iberia remained significantly depressed. 
The Nordics lacked signs of positive 
investment during 2013 and we faced 
significant competitive pressure in the 
region. Project business declined slightly 
in Russia, the Czech Republic and Turkey, 
in markets where we have seen steady 
growth in recent years. However, export 
markets throughout much of Eastern 
Europe remained positive, as did much 
of the Middle East.
Strategy and outlook
Quotation logs are healthy and economic 
indicators turned marginally positive as we 
entered 2014 and we hope to see some of 
this reflected in our markets in 2014. 
Through our direct sales model we 
provide customers with a wide range of 
solutions for energy saving and process 
productivity. Our investments in training 
our people and widening our service 
offering mean that we are well placed 
to take advantage of any improvement 
in markets. 
We remain committed to growing our

Spirax Sarco 
provides Saudi 
Arabian hospital 
with a clean steam 
solution
At a university teaching hospital in Saudi 
Arabia, a new intensive care unit (ICU) 
is being constructed. Spirax Sarco 
was asked to design a system to 
supply steam humidification, a reliable 
domestic hot water supply and hot water 
for use in the building’s heating system. 
The bespoke solution needed to utilise 
an existing high-temperature water 
supply from a central boiler plant.   
A building consultant had suggested inserting 
a flash vessel into the existing hot water 
system to generate steam for humidification. 
Spirax Sarco identified several problems with 
this approach. For example, water lost from the 
flash steam vessel would need to be replaced 
by cold water, reducing boiler efficiency and 
increasing energy usage; and the flash steam 
produced would contain boiler water chemicals 
and so be of insufficient quality for use in a 
hospital environment.  
Spirax Sarco recommended installing a water 
to clean steam generator and stainless steel 
humidifiers to provide clean, efficiently generated 
steam for humidification purposes. The steam 
generated would be of a good enough quality to 
meet a number of international standards, such 
as EN285 (the European standard for steam 
quality for use in sterilisation) and the ASHRAE 
standard for acceptable indoor air quality. 
A packaged plate heat exchanger was installed 
to provide a source of heat for the air heating 
system and a range of products were added to 
the existing water supply to ensure a constant 
source of domestic hot water. 
In addition to providing a fully functional and 
bespoke engineered solution that meets the 
ICU’s humidification, heating and domestic water 
needs, Spirax Sarco enabled the university to 
purchase a complete package from a reputable 
single source. Further, the solution that was 
installed will require less maintenance and offer 
substantial energy savings, compared with 
alternative solutions. The university was so 
impressed that they have asked Spirax Sarco to 
install the same system in a new cardiac centre 
and in a new teaching hospital.  35 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

“ We achieved a good sales increase in 
Asia Pacific, rising by 10% to £182.8 
million. Organic sales increased by 
8% with good growth in controls, 
flow metering and services.”
Klaus Rümler 
Divisional Director
Progress in 2013 
We achieved a good sales increase in 
Asia Pacific, rising by 10% to £182.8 million 
(2012: £166.9 million). Exchange movements 
were generally favourable adding 2% 
to sales on translation into sterling due 
to the Chinese RMB and the Korean 
won both strengthening by 4% against 
sterling, partially offset by the weakening 
of the Australian dollar and Japanese 
yen. Organic sales therefore increased by 
8%, with continued progress in traditional 
products and good growth in controls, flow 
metering and services. Market conditions 
remained favourable in China but elsewhere 
were mixed. The widespread applications 
for industrial steam, in particular in food 
& beverage and healthcare, provides 
good resilience to our business in Asia. 
Operating profit increased by 9% to 
£48.0 million (2012: £43.9 million) and at 
constant currency the increase was 6%. 
The operating profit margin was unchanged 
at 26.3% (2012: 26.3%) as the benefit from 
the additional sales volume was offset by 
the costs of transitioning to a fully-fledged 
operating company in the Philippines 
and in preparation for our new company 
in Indonesia that commenced trading in 
January 2014, following the acquisition of 
our largest distributor.
Our steam specialties business in China is 
the largest sales and profit contributor in 
the Group, accounting for 10% of Group 
sales in 2013, and again performed strongly, 
although the pace of industrial production 
growth eased and some projects were 
delayed. Our business derives largely 
from sectors linked to domestic Chinese 
consumption, particularly food & beverages, 
pharmaceuticals, textiles and healthcare, all 
of which have been resilient. We continue 
to add sales resource, expanding our 
extensive network of sales offices to 43 and 
deepening our penetration of the market. 
In line with our regional manufacturing 
strategy, production at our plant in Shanghai 
continues to increase rapidly across an 
expanding range of products. This is 
primarily to meet local demand and also 
to support regional demand in Southeast 
Asia, increasing flexibility and improving 
customer service.
Our business in Korea again performed 
well with record sales and profits despite 
a more difficult economic environment 
where industrial production was negative 
for most of the year. As expected, second 
half sales were much stronger in Korea as a 
number of large projects were completed. 
Elsewhere, we grew sales in Japan in a 
challenging market but had to contend 
with the impact of higher landed costs of 
imported products from the significant 
currency weakness. We continued to 
invest in market development, adding sales 
resource in both the more established and 
newly emerging markets.

Market overview
The Group has invested heavily in 
developing the important Asia Pacific 
region over the past 20 years. Today this 
region generates 33% of total steam 
specialties business sales and the Group’s 
business operations in China and Korea 
are continuing to be two of the largest 
in the Group. We have 1 1 operating 
companies and one associate in the region 
and additionally have a good, direct sales 
presence in newly emerging markets such 
as Vietnam and Cambodia. In the past 
three years, our headcount has increased 
significantly as we have added important 
sales and sales support people throughout 
the region and have increased our 
manufacturing footprint.
Market conditions were strong in China, 
as we benefited from our direct sales 
approach to domestic consumer industries 
and from our continued investment 
in geographic coverage, localised 
manufacturing and sales of a broader 
range of engineering solutions.
We see good growth potential in most of 
Southeast Asia and are taking additional 
steps to increase our direct selling 
presence in some of these still small, but 
important, emerging markets. Elsewhere in 
the region, our Australian and New Zealand 
markets were more flat but careful cost 
control provided us with good profit.
Within the Asia Pacific region, our most 
important industry sector is foods & 
beverages. It is easily our single largest 
sector and comprises a much higher 
percentage of sales in Asia Pacific 
than it does elsewhere for the Group. 
This industry segment is continuously 
growing in a number of countries as we 
see a movement towards better product 
quality and higher food safety standards, 
which foster higher quality manufacturing 
equipment. We also saw good levels of 
customer spending at the refineries and 
petrochemical plants and higher levels of 
activity in pharmaceuticals.
Strategy and outlook
We see very good mid-term growth 
opportunities throughout Asia Pacific 
due to the rapidly growing demand in 
local consumption. Our business model 
particularly benefits from our direct end-
user approach in foods & beverages, 
healthcare facilities, pharmaceuticals and 
textiles, the chemical industry, rubber and 
tyre and also in public buildings (HVAC). 
We therefore see continued good potential 
for organic growth.
We employ a direct sales model 
throughout the region and we see 
additional growth opportunities by 
increasing market share and geographic 
reach, as our people become more 
highly skilled in selling the broad range of 
engineering solutions already existing in 
our product portfolio. New and increasing 
demand for energy reduction, process 
efficiency improvements, cost reduction, 
reduced carbon footprint and emissions, 
requires our people to be flexible and highly 
qualified. Our business model is based 
on highest quality advice and support 
to customers. A key strategic priority is 
therefore the training for our customer 
facing staff. This differentiates us from 
other companies in the market. We will 
further focus and invest in training and 
staff recruitment.
Our local manufacturing strategy will further 
help us to improve customer service and 
drive costs down. It also helps us manage 
our own carbon footprint. We have made 
good progress in controlling stock and 
target further improvements during 2014. 
Our expectations for 2014 are further 
growth and good trading margins. 
This growth will come from general 
economic growth, demand for energy 
saving and process improvements, 
our own sales initiatives and our newly 
developed operations.

Hospital 
emergency 
averted by a rapid 
response from 
Spirax Sarco 
Australia
On a Wednesday afternoon in July, at 
a private hospital in Victoria, one of 
the hospital’s two hot water calorifiers 
(water heating units) imploded due to 
a rupture of the internal steam heating 
tubes. Fortunately, the hospital’s 
second calorifier was able to maintain 
the hospital’s hot water supply, but the 
fear was that if one could fail, so could 
the second.
Spirax Sarco was asked to assess the damage 
and ensure that a back-up water heating 
solution was installed as quickly as possible. 
Spirax Sarco’s expert engineers found that 
the calorifier was too extensively damaged to 
repair and recommended the installation of an 
Ausiheat 2 heat exchanger package, to replace 
the damaged calorifier. 
The Ausiheat arrived in Spirax Sarco’s 
Melbourne office on Friday and was in place in 
the hospital by Friday evening. By the following 
evening the hospital had a fully operational 
back-up hot water supply. 
Before long, the second calorifier began to show 
signs of failure, causing it to be shut down, and 
the Ausiheat 2 became the hospital’s sole water 
supply. The Ausiheat’s exceptional performance 
and ability to handle the peak loads in the 
hospital, impressed the hospital’s engineering 
staff to such an extent that they requested that 
Spirax Sarco install a second Ausiheat 2 heat 
exchanger package, to provide a back-up hot 
water supply. Once installed, the two Ausiheat 2 
heat exchanger packages only occupied one-
third of the space of the two old-style hot water 
storage calorifiers.
As well as the packages’ exceptional 
performance and Spirax Sarco’s rapid response 
and problem solving capability, the hospital 
was impressed by the after-service support 
offered by Spirax Sarco. The hospital engineers 
now feel confident that the hospital’s hot water 
supply is secure for the foreseeable future.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 38

“ Sales were broadly flat at constant 
currency, with growth in all our operations 
in Latin America, offset by lower sales 
in North America due to non-repeating 
projects. Operating profit increased 
by 6%.”
Alberto Grandi 
Divisional Director
Progress in 2013 
Sales in the Americas declined by 4% 
to £132.0 million (2012: £137 .5 million), 
although excluding unfavourable exchange 
rate movements, particularly in Argentina 
and Brazil, sales were broadly flat. Overall, 
sales of traditional products were ahead 
reflecting resilient demand from core 
maintenance and operations spending 
by customers. We made further good 
progress with controls, although sales of 
heat exchange packages and services 
were lower due to the non-repeat of 
large projects and generally subdued 
project activity. Operating profit was flat 
at £26. 1 million (2012: £26.2 million) but 
at constant exchange rates was ahead 
6%. The operating profit margin advanced 
from 19. 1% to 19.8% due to cost reduction 
actions and efficiency improvements, 
including a small reduction in headcount.
In North America, economic conditions 
were reasonable but sales were lower 
due to the non-repeat of two large service 
contracts in the USA and significantly lower 
project activity related to the Alberta Tar 
Sands in Canada. Operating profit was 
only marginally lower having benefited from 
cost reductions and from a good increase 
in contribution from our new packages 
fabrication facility in South Carolina. In the 
USA, the new President of our business 
started in the fourth quarter and the focus is 
on the development and improvement of our 
business performance as we take actions 
to improve our market approach and better 
segment our business.
In Latin America, market conditions were 
generally positive, with industrial production 
returning to growth in the second quarter 
after more than a year of decline, but this 
flattened out in the second half. We achieved 
sales growth in all our operations and our 
new company in Chile performed well in its 
first year. Our business in Argentina had a 
very good year against the background of 
a fragile economy that finally succumbed 
in the fourth quarter, with significant 
currency weakness that continued in 
2014 and that will no doubt impact the 
local economy. The export of ball valves, 
in dollars, from our centre of excellence in 
Argentina, helps to mitigate the impact of 
the currency devaluation. Brazil, our largest 
company in the region, returned to growth 
and we made further progress in Mexico, 
where the new manufacturing plant will 
be fully operational in the second quarter 
of 2014 and will be integrated into our 
Americas regional manufacturing strategy. 
Overall in Latin America, operating profits 
were nicely ahead.

Americas EMEA
Market overview
The Group’s involvement in the major 
markets in the Americas dates back many 
years; over 100 years in the USA and 
60 years in Latin America. As a result, 
the Group has a strong share of these 
established markets. However, this is 
balanced by more recent investment in the 
developing economies in the region, where 
there are good opportunities to achieve 
rapid growth through strengthening our 
market share and marketing a more 
extensive range of products and services.
Market share is highest in those markets 
where the Group established a presence 
early in the cycle of industrial development. 
This applies notably in Argentina and Brazil 
and more recently in Mexico. By contrast, 
there are many competitors based in 
North America.
The oil and petrochemical industry is a 
key market for the Group throughout the 
region, but the importance of other key 
market segments varies with the economic 
climate and trends in consumer spending. 
For example, in North America district 
heating of government buildings and 
university campuses underpins a strong 
HVAC market, whereas in Latin America 
the food, beverages and pharmaceuticals 
industries continue to invest in improving 
their processes and their energy efficiency, 
and are therefore key targets for the Group 
in this region.
Market conditions were at best neutral 
throughout the Americas in 2013. In North 
America, business confidence was 
undermined by continuing uncertainties 
relating to Government spending and 
as a result there was less project work. 
This has been accentuated over recent 
years by more specific influences, notably 
the reduction in energy costs following 
the development of shale gas in the USA 
and the impact of a less buoyant oil price 
on Tar Sands projects in Canada. In Latin 
America, as the year progressed it became 
clear that earlier growth projections 
had been too optimistic, particularly in 
Brazil and Mexico. However, this was 
partially offset by continuing industrial 
development in markets such as Colombia 
and Chile, where we are investing to 
keep pace with continuing increases in 
domestic consumption.
Strategy and outlook
Even in our more mature markets the 
continuing desire of equipment users to 
reduce their carbon footprint provides 
opportunities to grow the core business by 
offering a more complete range of steam 
related products and services. Our priority 
in these markets is therefore to invest in 
streamlining that capability, as evidenced 
by the new fabrication facility in the USA, 
which enables us to expand our portfolio 
of pre-fabricated engineered packages for 
heat transfer applications.
We see continuing opportunities to 
strengthen our market position through 
expanding our geographical sales 
coverage, as we are doing in Mexico and 
Chile, and in various other markets in Latin 
America. We also continue to invest in 
generating consistent organic growth and 
improving our competitiveness through 
the further development of our regional 
manufacturing strategy, as evidenced by 
our new factory in Mexico.

Spirax Sarco 
Mexico saves 
Nestlé energy and 
reduces water 
consumption by 
28,000m³ per year
When specialist engineers from Spirax 
Sarco audited the steam system at 
Nestlé’s instant coffee plant in Toluca, 
Mexico, they were asked to develop 
and install a solution to recover 100% 
of condensate from distiller bells and to 
increase steam system efficiency.
The audit found that condensate was being lost 
as a result of back pressure being imposed on 
the condensate line by a flash steam recovery 
vessel. Spirax Sarco installed an automatic 
pump trap to overcome the back pressure, 
enabling the existing flash vessel to function 
correctly. Flash steam, generated in the flash 
vessel, is now used to preheat water before 
it enters a newly installed Easiheat™ unit, 
which is producing hot water for the plant. 
The condensate from both the flash vessel 
and the Easiheat™ unit is now returned to 
the boiler house (saving energy, water, and 
water treatment chemicals) where it is used to 
generate steam.
The solution cost Nestlé £76,000 but is saving 
£67 ,000 per year. In addition, it is reducing 
energy consumption at the plant by 6,700 
gigajoules per annum and is saving 147 tonnes 
of CO
2 emissions each year. Furthermore, 
improved steam system efficiency has reduced 
water consumption by as much as 28,513m³ 
per year.
Mr Ricardo Morales, Energy Manager at Nestlé 
Mexico, explained, “We are making investments 
to increase our energy efficiency. Each year in 
Nestlé Mexico we have the objective of saving 
around 4% in the use of energy and water. 
The participation of Spirax Sarco is key to 
improving the energy efficiency of our company 
in matters relating to steam production and 
distribution, condensate recovery, heat 
exchange and delivering expert training to 
our staff.” 41 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

“ Organic sales increased by 4% against 
a tough comparison in the prior year , 
with the new Qdos and Apex products 
making a meaningful contribution. The 
operating profit margin strengthened 
further to 30.3%.”
Jay Whalen 
Executive Director
Progress in 2013 
Sales increased by 5% to £130.3 million 
(2012: £124.5 million) and were ahead 4% 
at constant exchange rates. Sales growth 
slowed in the second half, against a 
particularly difficult comparison due to 
several large non-repeating projects that 
shipped in the prior year, but demand 
continued and we ended 2013 with a 
strong order book. There was good growth 
across most product lines with a meaningful 
contribution from the new Qdos and Apex 
products but the larger capacity Bredel hose 
pump sales were lower due to the reduced 
project activity in the wastewater treatment 
and mining segments. Watson-Marlow 
operating profit increased by 7% to 
£39.5 million (2012: £36.8 million), with an 
overall neutral effect from exchange rate 
movements. The operating profit margin 
strengthened further to 30.3% (2012: 29.6%).
Trading conditions were strong in the 
biopharmaceutical market, which is our 
largest sector, in both North America and in 
Europe, with positive investment trends by 
customers in the industry. Food & beverage 
markets were ahead with good activity in 
Latin America and also now Asia Pacific. 
Mining (precious metals) markets have 
been difficult in South Africa and Australia 
but this was mitigated by inroads made in 
Russia and Brazil. Water and wastewater 
markets continued to be under pressure 
due to restrictions on government finances 
in many countries, although mitigated by 
increased market penetration from our new 
Qdos pump and with early indications of 
improving conditions in the USA. Overall, 
there was a lower level of projects across 
most markets but generally more positive 
base business demand.
Sales were higher in all geographic regions. 
Despite an unfavourable economic 
background, sales growth was robust 
across EMEA, which accounts for almost 
40% of total Watson-Marlow sales, 
with virtually all operations contributing. 
We reaped the benefit of our strategic 
actions over the last three years to increase 
industry sector focus in the sales teams, 
continue our conversions to direct sales 
and expand our network of direct sales 
operations, with new companies added in 
Austria and Poland during 2013. Growth was 
strong in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.

Sales in Asia Pacific were ahead and our 
newer operations in India, Singapore and 
Malaysia all performed well. Our more 
established operations in China and Korea 
made good progress in the food & beverage 
sector but saw lower levels of project work. 
We continue to add sector-focused direct 
sales resource across the Asia Pacific 
region to increase our market presence 
and widen the addressable market as we 
present the whole life-cycle cost benefits of 
peristaltic and niche pumps in these under-
developed markets.
Sales growth was strong in Latin America 
driven by success with new products and 
underpinned by additional sector-focused 
sales resource. North America was unable 
to match the very good performance in the 
prior year that included a number of large 
non-repeating projects but base business 
was nicely ahead across most sectors. 
The Americas account for almost 40% of 
total Watson-Marlow sales.
Product development has been a key driver 
of our sales growth and we continue to 
add resource focused on expanding the 
capability, functionality and performance of 
our niche pump and tubing to reduce the 
total-cost-of-ownership for our customers. 
These developments grow our addressable 
market as we displace other pump types 
in more applications. The revolutionary 
Qdos peristaltic metering pump with its 
ReNu pumphead is a particular success, 
exceeding expectations, alongside the 
new Apex hose pump, and new product 
developments also in Alitea, Flexicon 
and MasoSine.

Market overview
The Watson-Marlow pumps business 
was acquired in 1990 and since then 
has grown from contributing 4% of sales 
that year to 19% of Group sales in 2013. 
Recent acquisitions have played a key role 
in expanding our addressable markets 
by increasing our applications capability 
in the important biopharmaceutical 
and foods & beverages industries. 
New product development has expanded 
our addressable markets particularly 
in industrial, OEM and water and 
wastewater markets.
Our Watson-Marlow pumps business is 
centred in Europe and the United States, 
together comprising about 80% of total 
pump sales, about evenly split, but we 
continue to expand into emerging markets 
in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America 
with good results. Our core markets are 
biopharmaceutical, (which represents 
about one-third of total pump sales), OEM, 
water and wastewater, mining (precious 
metals), foods & beverages and general 
industrial. These applications are ideal 
for our pumps, which are unequalled 
in the pumping of hygienic fluids and, 
alternatively, abrasive or aggressive fluids 
or slurries.
The market conditions for Watson-Marlow 
Pumps in 2013 were largely similar 
to the steam specialties business 
from a geographical perspective. 
Maintenance and project spending 
for biopharmaceuticals increased, 
but capital spending on wastewater 
treatment (particularly in the USA) and 
mining slowed.
Strategy and outlook
We continue to focus on strategically 
delivering growth through the penetration 
of emerging markets, where we see 
excellent opportunities for growth as 
we pioneer the introduction of peristaltic 
pumps. We aim to grow our market 
share within emerging regions as we 
demonstrate the peristaltic pump’s 
superior technology and lower life-
cycle cost benefits, for applications in 
biopharmaceuticals, precious metals 
processing, food production and chemical 
dosing in water and wastewater treatment. 
We will also focus on the sectorisation 
of our field sales force to ensure our 
engineers have the specific market and 
applications knowledge to add value 
to customers.
We have achieved significant success 
through transitioning from distributor 
sales to a value-added direct sales 
approach in our more mature European 
markets and we will continue this process 
in more markets in Asia, Europe and 
Latin America. 
Further, we will continue to expand 
the ranges of recently introduced new 
pumps, with revolutionary new pumping 
technology, which continues our strategy 
of increasing our addressable markets by 
taking market share from other positive 
displacement pump types. We will also 
selectively seek acquisitions of synergistic 
value-added niche pumps and associated 
equipment that will allow us to leverage 
sales of new and existing products 
through our direct and market sector 
sales channels. 43 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Qdos metering 
pumps solve 
turbidity testing 
dilemma for Welsh 
Water
At the Pontsticill Water Treatment Works 
in the Brecon Beacons National Park 
regular turbidity testing is undertaken 
as a means of assessing water quality. 
Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness 
of a fluid, caused by the suspension 
of particles. While some suspended 
particles will settle quickly if a sample 
is left to stand, others will not settle or 
will require a long period of time to do 
so, causing the liquid to appear turbid. 
In drinking water, a high turbidity level 
increases the risk that people may 
develop gastrointestinal problems. 
Until recently turbidity testing at the Pontsticill 
Water Treatment Works relied on bellows pump 
technology. However, the bellows pumps 
introduced air into the samples, giving false or 
unreliable readings. Marek Cegielski, a process 
scientist and manager at D ˆ wr Cymru Welsh 
Water, explained, “This is a clean water site 
and the quality of sample is very important. 
In the past we have tried other types of turbidity 
monitoring devices, such as dip probes, but 
without much success. We have even used 
bubble traps in conjunction with our bellows 
pumps, but we still fell short of 100% reliability.”
However, the installation of a Qdos 30 metering 
pump is now ensuring consistently accurate 
readings. “Our main requirement is for a 
constant, pulse-free flow,” says Mr Cegielski. 
“Previously we had tried fitting back valves to 
bellows pumps to stop the pulsing but in truth 
we could not properly buffer the effect and still 
ended up with false readings.” The Qdos 30 
pump is providing D ˆ wr Cymru Welsh Water with 
a steady, pulse-free flow speed of 280 ml/min, 
completely free from air or flow variation.
“So far, so good, as far as we are concerned – 
when new technology comes along that has a 
clear advantage over existing market solutions, 
then we are always willing to give it a try,” 
concludes Mr Cegielski. “If our existing Qdos 
30 continues to meet expectations then we will 
place an order for a further three pumps.” Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 44

“ We achieved good results in 2013, 
producing record sales, profit and 
margins. Sales increased by just over 4%, 
with strongest growth in Asia Pacific, and 
adjusted operating profit increased by 
1 1 %, with an outstanding performance 
in EMEA.”

Key highlights
•	The Board has proposed a final 
dividend of 41.0p per share. 
T ogether with the interim dividend 
this gives a total Ordinary dividend 
of 59.0p per share, an increase 
of 11%
•	Adjusted basic earnings per share 
increased by 14% to 138.8p
•	Return on capital employed 
reached a record 44.4%
•	Adjusted operating cash flow 
rose by £13.2 million or 10% to 
£143.0 million
Spirax Sarco reports its results under 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and in addition uses adjusted figures 
as key performance indicators as the Board 
believes that these are more representative 
of the underlying performance. Unless 
otherwise stated adjusted figures are used 
throughout and in 2013 they excluded the 
amortisation and impairment of acquisition-
related intangible assets and acquisition and 
disposal costs, together with the tax effects 
of these items. Additionally in 2012, they 
included contingent consideration  
fair-value adjustments and one-off 
exceptional restructuring charges of 
£7 .2 million largely related to headcount 
reductions in our European operations, 
the benefit of which has been seen in our 
EMEA results. 2012 results have been 
restated to reflect the adoption of IAS 19(R) 
Employee Benefits.
This Annual Report and Accounts has 
been prepared in line with the latest 
requirements for integrated reporting and 
the Board has taken care to ensure that 
it is “fair, balanced and understandable”. 
The Annual Report clearly sets out our 
resilient and robust business model, and 
explains how our strategy is implemented 
through the business model, with the 
aim of delivering long-term sustainable, 
profitable growth and the creation of value 
for shareholders. Our key performance 
indicators have been carefully selected and 
we show the link from strategy through to 
Directors’ remuneration. The section on risk 
management has been enhanced and the 
work of the various Board committees is 
detailed in the Governance section, including 
the new Remuneration policy report that 
will be the subject of a binding vote by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20th May 2014. Sustainability is part of 
our strategy and we report a number of non-
financial measures including the Group’s 
employee serious accident rate, which 
shows a year-on-year improvement, and 
the Group’s CO
2e intensity, which shows a 
reversal in 2013 after several years of good 
reductions. Investment in a combined heat 
and power plant for our manufacturing unit 
in Cheltenham has been approved for 2014, 
which will reduce energy usage and 
improve resilience.
We achieved good results in 2013, 
producing record sales, profit and 
margins. Sales increased by just over 4% 
to £689.4 million (2012: £661.7 million). 
Organic sales increased by nearly 4%, 
with the strongest growth in Asia Pacific 
followed by more modest growth in 
Watson-Marlow and EMEA. In the Americas, 
progress in Latin America was broadly 
offset by a decline in North America. 
Favourable currency gains in the first 
half year were progressively eroded by 
the strengthening of sterling and were 
negligible for the full year. A number of 
emerging market currencies were weak 
in 2013 including the Brazilian real, South 
African rand and Argentine peso, the latter 
devalued by 13% in the final quarter and by 
significantly more in early 2014. If current 
exchange rates prevail through 2014, 
sales would be reduced by around 5% 
on translation into sterling versus 2013.
Operating profit increased by 1 1% to 
£151.6 million (2012: £136.2 million) and 
by 10% at constant exchange rates. 
Favourable currency movements produced 
an overall gain of 1% or £1.7 million to 
operating profit versus the prior year. 
Segmentally, there were exchange 
gains in EMEA of £1.7 million and Asia 
Pacific of £1.6 million, a neutral position 
in Watson-Marlow and an unfavourable 
£1.6 million in the Americas. The most 
significant factors driving the overall increase

Benefits, increased overheads by 
£0.4 million in respect of pension scheme 
fund management fees that are now 
recorded within overheads.
The operating profit margin jumped from 
20.6% to a record 22.0%.
Interest
Net interest cost reduced by £0.9 million 
to £2.3 million (2012: £3.2 million restated). 
The adoption of IAS 19(R) Employee 
Benefits for 2013 significantly changed 
the accounting for investment returns in 
respect of defined benefit pension schemes. 
Investment returns are now assessed based 
on bond returns for an assumed 100% 
holding in bonds, in place of the previous 
method that used a blended investment 
return based on actual assets being held 
by the pension schemes. 2012 net interest 
has accordingly been restated to show 
an additional cost of £3.6 million under 
IAS 19(R). Net interest in respect of the 
Group’s defined benefit pension schemes 
improved by £0.2 million versus the prior 
year, mainly due to the increase in asset 
values in 2012 that produced an improved 
assumed return on assets for 2013. 
Net bank interest was £0.6 million better 
due to the good cash flow and despite the 
payment of the £78 million special dividend 
mid-year.
Associates
The Group’s after-tax share of the profits 
of Associates was down 8% at £1.7 million 
(2012: £1.9 million) and was broadly 
unchanged at constant exchange rates. 
The Group’s 49.3% share of Spirax-Marshall 
in India was ahead but this was offset 
by a small loss in respect of the Group’s 
30% interest in the Econotherm heat pipe 
technology start-up.
Pre-tax profit
The profit before tax increased by 12% to 
£151. 1 million (2012: £134.9 million) and 
at constant exchange rates the increase 
was 1 1%. The statutory profit before tax 
takes into account certain non-operating 
items listed below and rose by 17% to 
£145.7 million (2012: £124. 1 million restated):
• 	 	 A 	 c h a r g e 	 o f 	 £ 4 . 6 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 1 2 : 	 £ 4 . 1 	 m i l l i o n )	
in respect of the amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, 
£0.8 million of which related to Associates 
(2012: £0.3 million)
•	 	 A 	 g o o d w i l l 	 i m p a i rm en t 	 c h a r g e 	 o f

of £0.6 million)
•	 	 On e- o ff 	 e x c ep ti o n a l 	 r es tru c tu ri n g 	 c o s ts	
were nil (2012: £7 .2 million). The large 
majority of the 2012 costs were paid in 
that year but a residual £1.6 million of 
these costs were a cash outflow in 2013.
Taxation
The tax charge on the adjusted pre-tax 
profit, excluding Associates, was marginally 
higher at 29.8% (2012: 29.7% restated). 
The Group’s direct sales business model 
means that we are structured with many, 
largely small, operating entities spread 
worldwide, addressing our customers 
directly with a local sales team and local 
stocks. Our tax rates essentially reflect the 
blended average of the many different tax 
jurisdictions in which we operate. During the 
year we reorganised the funding of several 
of our European companies under the 
legislation introduced by the UK Government 
that will have a modest tax benefit in 
future years.
Earnings per share
The Group’s prime financial objective is to 
provide enhanced value to shareholders 
through the consistent growth in earnings 
per share and dividends per share. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased 
by 14% to 138.8p (2012: 122.2p) primarily 
reflecting the 12% rise in pre-tax profit. 
The marginally higher tax rate detracted from 
earnings per share growth but this was more 
than outweighed by the 3.7% reduction in 
the number of shares in issue from mid-year 
following the 26 for 27 share consolidation 
linked to the special dividend. This will have 
a further small full-year benefit to earnings 
per share growth in 2014. The statutory 
basic earnings per share increased by 19% 
to 133.4p (2012: 1 12.2p restated) reflecting 
the adjusted profit increase and also the 
non-repeat of the one-off exceptional 
restructuring costs in 2012. The fully diluted 
earnings per share were not materially 
different in either year.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 41.0p per share, which is an increase 
of 1 1% from 37 .0p in the prior year. 
Together with the interim dividend of 18.0p 
per share (2012: 16.0p), this gives a total 
Ordinary dividend of 59.0p per share for 
the year, an increase of 1 1% over the total 
of 53.0p per share in 2012. Our dividend 
record is extended to 46 years that has a 
compound annual growth rate of 1 1% over 
that period. If approved by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting on 20th May 
2014, the final dividend will be paid on 30th 
May 2014 to shareholders on the register at 
2nd May 2014.
A special dividend of 100.0p per share was 
paid on 3rd July 2013 in respect of 2012. 
Including this special dividend, total dividend 
payments in 2013 amounted to £121 million 
or 155.0p per share.
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year additional resource was 
added to the team as we intensified our 
search for suitable acquisition candidates. 
Our acquisition strategy is interwoven with 
our growth strategy and our focus is largely 
directed at expanding addressable markets, 
adding new products and technologies 
for our existing businesses and extending 
direct market access, although we remain 
interested in complementary businesses that 
are adjacent to our main markets. Our strong 
balance sheet and debt capacity provides 
us with considerable flexibility. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 46

Strategic report continued
On 22nd January 2013, the Group 
announced the acquisition of a 30% stake 
in Econotherm UK Ltd for £1.0 million, with 
an option to acquire the remaining equity. 
Econotherm specialises in the design and 
manufacture of heat pipes and associated 
heat exchangers for industrial waste heat 
recovery and other industrial applications, 
utilising unique and patented technology. 
This start-up technology business made 
a loss in the year ahead of an expected 
ramp-up in sales.
On 26th July 2013, the Group announced 
an agreement to acquire the business and 
assets of PT Petrolog MUM, our steam 
specialties distributor in the Java region 
of Indonesia, for a total consideration of 
£1.7 million. Indonesia is an expanding 
market with good future growth prospects 
that will be enhanced by our direct sales 
approach. As expected, following a short 
transition period, our new subsidiary 
commenced trading in January 2014.
In April 2013, the Group disposed 
of the HVAC business of Eirdata for 
£0.6 million that reduced sales in the year 
by approaching £1 million. We retained the 
Eirdata Energy Advisory Services business, 
which contributes to our solutions selling 
and energy management value propositions. 
On 6th January 2014, the Group announced 
the acquisition of UK-based Bio Pure 
Technology Limited for £8.5 million. Bio Pure 
specialises in the design and production 
of advanced single-use tubing connector 
systems for the biopharmaceutical industry, 
where there is already a strong commercial 
relationship with Watson-Marlow 
jointly promoting products to shared 
customers. The acquisition strengthens 
Watson-Marlow’s presence in the rapidly 
growing single-use biopharmaceutical 
market, complementing our existing range 
of Flexicon peristaltic filling systems.
Research and development
Investment in product development was 
maintained at the higher level established 
over recent years. In the steam specialties 
business, there was a reduction in the 
number of new or updated products 
released during the year as we focused 
on fewer, potentially higher value projects. 
Resources are focused on supporting our 
strategic growth initiatives and product 
launches during the year included an 
innovative continuous wireless steam trap 
monitoring system, desuperheaters, several 
important flowmeters and various control 
valve releases. In the Watson-Marlow 
peristaltic and niche pumps business, 
the Qdos pump that utilises revolutionary 
pulseless pumping technology made 
significant progress in its first full year after 
launch and the Bredel Apex range gained 
real traction in the second half of the year. 
We expect that new products will make a 
greater contribution to sales growth than 
in prior years.
Capital employed
The focus on capital employed was 
increased in 2013 and in particular the 
continued roll-out of systems to optimise 
stock levels to improve delivery performance 
and customer service. Overall, total capital 
employed increased by £5 million to 
£344 million; at constant exchanges rates 
the increase was 4.5%.
The net book value of fixed assets (excluding 
intangible assets) increased by £2 million 
or 1% at constant exchange rates to 
£17 4 million, with capital expenditure 
of £27 million at 1 18% of depreciation. 
The most significant investments were the 
construction of a new manufacturing plant 
in Mexico that will be fully operational by 
April 2014 and the start of a major project 
to modernise the core IT systems in all of 
Watson-Marlow’s operations. We have 
continued to add production equipment in 
China as we expand output and to upgrade 
our machining capability in our main regional 
manufacturing locations. Our energy costs 
have been increasing, particularly in the 
UK where we have expanded product 
development and testing facilities, and we 
have approved the investment in energy 
saving projects that are being implemented 
in 2014, which will also have a positive 
impact on our energy intensity and CO
2e 
measures. Overall, we expect capital 
expenditure to be a little higher in 2014.
Total working capital at £170 million 
was up 8% at constant exchange rates. 
Inventory rose by 4% at constant exchange 
rates and we achieved a further small 
reduction in stock weeks whilst also 
improving the balance of stocks held to 
support higher levels of customer service. 
The overall balance of debtors and creditors 
increased by £9 million largely due to a rise in 
debtors. The ratio of working capital to sales 
was marginally lower at 24.7% (2012: 24.8%).
Return on capital employed
This important measure of overall 
performance shows a marked increase to a 
record 44.4%, more than recovering the dip 
to 39.4% in the prior year. The improvement 
results from a combination of the 1 1% rise in 
the adjusted operating profit to £151.6 million 
and a small reduction in average capital 
employed (using the average of opening 
and closing sterling balance sheets for 
2013 and 2012).
Post-retirement benefits
The net post-retirement benefit liability 
shown on the balance sheet was marginally 
lower at £72.0 million (£54. 1 million net of 
deferred tax). Asset values rose by 12% 
as investment returns again exceeded 
scheme assumptions and deficit reduction 
contributions of nearly £7 million were 
made to the main UK schemes. However, 
liability value increased by 9% largely 
due to unfavourable changes in financial 
assumptions. The majority of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension liabilities relate to 
the main UK schemes that were closed to 
new members in 2001. For the past two 
years these have been managed under a 
dynamic de-risking strategy whereby asset

Cash flow and Treasury Policy
We achieved another year of good cash 
flow in 2013 generating greater operating 
cash inflows with good cash conversion. 
Adjusted operating cash flow rose by 
£13.2 million or 10% to £143.0 million 
essentially due to the profit increase for 
the year, as reflected through a high 
cash conversion rate of 94%; a relatively 
small cash outflow of £7 .3 million in 
respect of working capital was mitigated 
by a small reduction of £3.0 million in 
capital expenditure.
Taxation paid increased by £4.4 million 
to £42.3 million with corporation tax paid 
in virtually every one of the 39 countries 
in which the Group has subsidiaries. 
Free cash flow therefore rose by £9.4 million 
to £101. 1 million. Dividend payments were 
£120.0 million, comprising £78.3 million in 
respect of the 100.0p per share special 
dividend for 2012 paid in July 2013 and 
£42.5 million in respect of core Ordinary 
dividends per share paid that increased 
by 9% in the year net of Associate 
company dividends received of £1.0 million. 
Pension deficit reduction contributions 
and provisions were a cash outflow of 
£7 .0 million and the balance of £1.6 million 
restructuring costs were paid having been 
charged against profit in 2012. There was an 
outflow of £5.6 million for acquisitions, largely 
relating to the deferred consideration in 
respect of our acquisition in Mexico in 2010, 
including an accelerated final instalment 
brought forward from 2014. There was a 
net cash outflow of £0.6 million comprising 
a payment in November of £4.6 million in 
respect of shares bought back and lodged 
in an Employee Benefit Trust to provide 
shares for the future vesting of awards 
under the Group’s long-term performance 
share plan, net of an inflow from the issue of 
shares under the Group’s various employee 
share schemes.
The net cash outflow for the year was 
therefore £33.7 million, which together 
with an unfavourable currency movement 
effect on translation of £1.6 million, gave a 
closing net cash balance of £16.4 million 
at 31st December 2013, compared with 
£51.7 million a year earlier.
The Group has a direct sales business 
model, which dictates that we have a large 
number of operating companies dealing on 
a local level directly with customers, trading 
in local currencies. Our trading results and 
balance sheet can therefore be affected 
by relative movements in exchange rates, 
the most significant of which are the euro, 
dollar, Chinese renminbi and Korean won. 
Mitigating this exposure is the wide spread of 
our business across many different countries 
and currencies, the partial natural hedge that 
we have from our cost base also being in 
local currencies (people are our largest cost) 
and our regional manufacturing strategy that 
balances the concentration of manufacturing 
from any one currency base. We have a 
rigorously applied Treasury Policy and do not 
undertake complex derivative transactions, 
typically using simple forward contracts to 
manage exposures to known cash flows 
where this can provide an appropriate 
degree of certainty for landed costs.
Capital structure
We continue to follow a policy of maintaining 
a strong balance sheet to protect the 
business and to provide flexibility of 
funding for our growth, either through 
organic expansion, capital investment or 
acquisitions. Our emphasis is to reinvest 
in the business, where we believe that 
capital can be put to most effective use 
in the generation of increased future 
returns. We also seek to make appropriate 
acquisitions that make strategic, commercial 
and economic sense, and where we can 
see that good returns can be achieved. 
However, where cash resources exceed 
future expected requirements, we will 
generally seek to return excess cash 
to shareholders.
A return of capital to shareholders of 
£78 million was made in the form of a special 
dividend of 100.0p per share paid in July 
2013. This was equivalent to approximately 
4% of the market capitalisation of the 
Company at the time and, as is common 
with a significant return of capital to 
shareholders, was accompanied by a 
share consolidation on the basis of 26 
new Ordinary shares for every 27 existing 
Ordinary shares. The purpose of the 
share consolidation was to seek, as far as 
possible, to maintain comparability of the 
share price before and after the special 
dividend and to remove the impact of 
the special dividend on employee equity-
based incentives. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 48

Sustainability report
Strategic report continued
Sustainability is one of the six key strategic priorities through which 
we are driving growth and achieving shareholder value, while 
managing our environmental and social impact. 
We recognise the importance of corporate sustainability and believe 
that sustainability is synonymous with resiliency. A sustainable 
business is one that can survive shocks and economic challenges 
because it has been managed with an eye to both the present and 
the future. 
Our sustainability strategy is focused on three core areas: our 
business, our communities and our environment. Within these three 
broad areas we have identified eight key objectives:
Our business:
•	 T o govern the business ethically and uphold our 
core values
•	T o achieve consistent and sustainable growth and 
shareholder value
•	T o maintain professionally challenging and 
safe workplaces 
•	T o provide for the on-going training and development 
of our people
Our communities:
•	T o engage positively with the communities in which 
we operate
•	T o offer financial support to approved charities through 
the Spirax Sarco Group Charitable Trust
Our environment:
•	T o manage and minimise the environmental impacts 
of our operations 
•	T o help our customers to achieve their 
sustainability targets.
Achieving our sustainability objectives requires a clear and well-
defined management structure. The Group Chief Executive has 
overall responsibility for the Company’s sustainability strategy and 
is fully supported by the Board of Directors. We have a senior 
Group Health, Safety and Environment executive who ensures that 
appropriate policies, systems and reporting metrics are in place 
to achieve the Group’s sustainability objectives. Regional and 
general managers have responsibility for ensuring that the Group’s 
sustainability policies are upheld and implemented by our operating 
companies, and at a local level individuals and groups are organised 
to oversee and report on key aspects of sustainability within 
their workplaces.
During 2013 we focused on developing the mechanisms by 
which we share best practice across the Group. For example, in 
September 2013 a health, safety and environment (HSE) conference 
was held at Spirax Sarco, USA, attended by delegates from 
the Spirax Sarco HSE user group. The conference provided an 
opportunity for attendees to learn more about the Behavioural Based 
Safety programme that is in operation in the USA (see page 52) and 
to discuss how the programme is to be rolled out across the Group. 
Our environmental targets were also discussed, as were strategies 
for achieving them.
To ensure that we are recording, measuring and reporting key 
sustainability metrics accurately, and to provide transparency in our 
sustainability reporting, during 2013 we appointed Carbon Clear, 
an independent third-party organisation, to help us achieve limited 
assurance of our carbon emissions data, with assurance provided 
by TÜV (see page 54). 
During 2014 we will continue to invest management time into 
developing and furthering our sustainability agenda. We recognise 
that we have an ethical responsibility to manage our economic, 
environmental and social impacts, but also believe that it makes 
good business sense to do so. A focus on sustainability drives 
behaviours which cut costs and increase operational efficiency, 
while also creating new market and business opportunities and 
mitigating risks. Put simply, we believe that sustainability enhances 
our competitive edge, ensuring financial progress and the delivery 
of shareholder value.

Our business:
Objective:
To govern the business ethically and to uphold 
our core values 
We believe that good governance is essential to the success 
and sustainability of our business. We define good governance 
as managing the business transparently and in accordance with 
best practice, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012, the 
UK Stewardship Code and all applicable laws and regulations. 
During 2013, we were delighted to receive a nomination for a 
Transparency in Governance Award, by the Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators, within the category: FTSE250 Best 
Board Disclosure.
In July the strength of our governance and business performance 
was further recognised when Watson-Marlow won a prestigious 
PwC 2013 West of England Business of the Year award. The award 
recognised various aspects of business achievement such as 
financial performance, product and service innovation, business 
management, future prospects and contribution to the region.
Our core values of respect, accountability, passion, integrity and 
delivery provide the foundation upon which we make decisions, 
drive innovation and manage our global operations. During 2013, 
1,000 of our employees and senior managers participated in “Doing 
the Right Thing” training, designed to increase understanding of 
the core values and anti-discrimination law, and to improve diversity 
awareness. All employees have responsibility for ensuring that the 
Group operates ethically and have an obligation to report breaches 
of Company policy. The Group will not permit retaliation of any kind 
against employees for making good faith reports about an actual 
or suspected violation of Group policy. 
We communicate regularly with our employees through a variety of 
channels and undertake employee surveys. Our aim is to ensure that 
all employees are informed about, and engaged in, their part of the 
business locally while having a wider understanding of the Group 
and its future direction.
Our Group Management Code articulates the standards that 
we expect everyone within the Group to meet. It includes the 
requirement to comply with laws, regulations and Group policies; 
the rejection of bribery and corruption; the promotion of ethical 
business practices; the fair treatment of customers; the confidentiality 
of information; and respect for our people, communities and the 
environment. It is Group policy to conduct business free of bribery 
or corruption. The Group will not enter into contractual relationships 
with third parties who are known to participate in corrupt practices 
and will not engage in the giving or receiving of bribes. We do not 
make political donations.
The Group supports the Human Rights principles set out in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Core Conventions 
of the International Labour Organisation. We recognise that all 
individuals have the right to lead a dignified life, free from fear 
and want, and free to express independent beliefs. Our Group 
Human Rights Policy includes the right of all employees to equal 
opportunities and non-discriminatory treatment, security of person, 
a safe working environment and a fair wage. We also recognise 
the rights of children and reject the use of forced or compulsory 
labour. We endeavour to ensure that our direct operations and any 
interactions with business partners do not make us complicit in 
Human Rights violations and seek suppliers who meet the same 
high standards we set for our own businesses.
Equal opportunities
Total workforce gender diversity
Board gender diversity
Senior management gender diversity
We recognise that diversity of gender, age, culture, experience 
and expertise serve to enhance our ability to govern the business 
effectively and ethically. 
Target: 25% female Board members by 2016.
We are fully committed to the principle of equal opportunity 
in employment and ensure that all applicants and employees 
receive equal treatment during their recruitment, transfer, 
promotion, training and assessment of salary and benefits. 
We give full and fair consideration to applications for employment 
made by disabled persons, having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. We have procedures in place to facilitate 
the continuing employment of those who may become disabled 
during the period in which they are employed by the Company, 
and disabled persons are entitled to the same opportunities for 
career development as all other employees.
During 2013 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc became a member 
of the Business Disability Forum, an organisation that offers 
help and support to companies that are striving to increase their 
disability awareness, through giving practical advice and sharing 
best practice.

Financial performance
While many of our products and services aid effective energy 
management, we have identified a specific range as falling within 
the energy management sector of our marketplace (see page 8). 
These include our metering products, boilerhouse products, heat 
transfer packages and energy services. We recognise a direct link 
between the sales of energy management products and three of 
our strategic objectives: deliver solutions to reduce energy usage; 
grow market share and achieve sustainability. As a result of our 
strategic focus and investments, during the last five years sales of 
our energy management products have increased by more than 
30% at constant currency.
Our energy management products form a core component of 
many of our engineered solutions. During the last five years we 
have invested in R&D to enhance existing energy management 
products and to develop new, unique energy recovery packages, 
ensuring that we deliver effective solutions to our customers.
We have been able to grow our market share through widening 
our range of products, including energy metering and heat 
recovery packages, which have contributed meaningfully to our 
sales growth.
As we continue to increase our capacity to solve our customers’ 
process issues, improve their productivity and help them 
meet their sustainability targets, particularly in relation to 
energy management, we are investing in the sustainability of 
our business.

Our business continued:
Objective:
To achieve consistent and sustainable growth 
and shareholder value
Managing our business sustainability has a positive impact on our 
financial performance. Through reducing energy consumption 
and managing waste we optimise process efficiency, resulting in 
greater cost efficiencies. For example, by managing our energy 
consumption, we not only lower our energy bill but we also reduce 
outlay on carbon taxes (incurred through the UK’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Scheme and Climate Change Levy). 
A focus on sustainability is a core component of our risk mitigation 
strategy (see pages 26–27). Weak environmental, social or 
governance performance can have a significant, negative impact 
on a company’s reputation and can incur a subsequent financial 
cost. By managing all aspects of our business with our sustainability 
objectives in mind, we mitigate the risk of breaching regulatory 
requirements, avoid non-compliance with health, safety and 
environmental legislation and manage our corporate reputation, 
contributing to the sustainability and long-term financial viability of 
our business.
The wellbeing of our employees is a key sustainability objective. 
We recognise our responsibility to treat our employees with 
respect and to provide safe and professionally challenging 
workplaces. We believe that high standards of safety and employee 
engagement can mean less time lost to absence and lower voluntary 
employee turnover. This also helps us to recruit the best and most 
talented people. We take seriously our governance, social and 
environmental responsibilities.
We believe that a focus on sustainability helps us to access new 
markets for existing products and gain market share, as well as 
acting as a catalyst for the innovation of new products and services. 
The strategic integration of sustainability helps us to anticipate the 
needs of our customers who are increasingly turning to us for help 
to meet their sustainability targets. A core strength of our direct 
sales business model is that our expert sales and service engineers 
can walk our customers’ plants and identify ways to improve their 
operational efficiency and reduce their energy consumption, carbon 
emissions or water use. 
Through investing in R&D we continuously improve our product 
range and develop new products to meet our customers’ needs, 
thereby ensuring the long-term viability of our business. During 2013, 
the new Qdos 30 metering pump from Watson-Marlow won a 
Vaaler Award, from Chemical Processing, in the USA. The award 
recognises products and services that can significantly improve plant 
operations and economics. 
Our wide product range, ability to design bespoke engineered 
applied solutions, and the expert knowledge of our people help 
to build trust, enhance our reputation and ensure that we provide 
outstanding customer service. Through helping our customers 
to meet their sustainability targets we develop customer loyalty 
which, in turn, helps us to deliver long-term sustainable growth and 
shareholder value.

Our business continued:
Objective:
To maintain professionally challenging and 
safe workplaces
Our people are one of our greatest assets. Looking after their 
health and wellbeing is a key priority for the Group. We remain 
committed to improving our health and safety (H&S) record and 
to maintaining a safe environment for our employees, visitors and 
subcontractors worldwide. 
Our goal is to embed a health and safety culture across the Group 
through providing our employees with the training and tools needed 
to recognise and understand both the importance of H&S practices 
and how to proactively mitigate H&S risk. This year we began to roll 
out a Behavioural Based Safety (BBS) programme across all our 
manufacturing sites. BBS was first implemented in our operating 
company in the USA. The success of this programme (see page 52) has 
resulted in the decision to adopt it across the Group. We anticipate 
a steady improvement in our H&S performance over the next 
few years as a result of the cultural change brought about by 
the programme. 
Our H&S management and governance structure is well developed. 
As with the other elements of our sustainability strategy, the Board 
and Group Chief Executive have overall responsibility for H&S. 
The Board formally reviews H&S matters at least bi-annually and 
is supported by a H&S Executive, appointed during 2013, who 
monitors H&S practices across the Group, facilitates the sharing of 
best practice and ensures that appropriate processes are in place 
for collecting and reporting H&S data.
All H&S accidents and near misses are recorded at a local level and 
reported regularly to the Board. All RIDDOR recordable accidents 
and incidents are reported immediately, with a follow up report 
within two days detailing improvements made to prevent a repeat of 
the accident.
All of our operating companies are expected to adhere to the Group 
H&S Policy, and to have local H&S policies in place. The Group 
Policy is reviewed annually and outlines minimum expected H&S 
standards for each of our operating companies. Our operating 
companies define local strategies and objectives which are reviewed 
and approved by local management teams. 
Each of our operating companies has its own occupational H&S 
management system in place with documents that define the 
local H&S policy and procedures. The occupational health and 
safety systems of our operating companies generally follow the 
requirements of the OHSAS 18001 standard, but not all operating 
companies have yet been assessed and certified. By the end 
of 2013 seven of our operating companies had OHSAS 18001 
certification in place (2012: five) and we aim to increase this number 
year-on-year.
In addition to the H&S policies, procedures and management 
systems that we have in place, annual H&S risk assessments are 
conducted within each operating company. Regular staff training 
also occurs, including daily H&S briefings in our manufacturing 
plants, and we provide our employees with personal protective 
equipment. Taken together, these actions, policies and procedures 
help to minimise risk in our workplaces. Through ensuring that our 
people are safe, we protect one of our most valuable assets and 
contribute to the sustainability of our business.

The total number of over seven day accidents decreased by 19%

Target
We want all of our employees to return home safely at the end of 
each day. As such, we have a long-term target of zero accidents. 
In the short term, however, our H&S targets are to achieve a 
year-on-year reduction in our over seven day accident rate and 
to achieve a better than benchmark H&S record. The H&S 
benchmark that we use is the RIDDOR over seven day accident 
rate in the UK manufacturing sector, which was 4.0 accidents per 
1,000 employees in 2012/2013.
We have made good progress during the last three years and 
have reduced our accident rate by 27% and are now close to 
the H&S industry benchmark. We are taking action to reduce 
our accident rate further, including the adoption of BBS and the 
sharing of best practice across the Group.

Case study:  
Behavioural Based Safety and Wellness 
Programme, Spirax Sarco USA.
During 2011 Spirax-Sarco Inc, USA, launched a 
Behavioural Based Safety and Wellness Programme. 
The programme aims to engage all employees in 
H&S, enabling them to better identify and eliminate 
risks; to drive cultural and behavioural change; and 
to incentivise staff to live a healthier lifestyle. 
Core components of the programme include: 
1. A “start with safety” culture
2.  Regular and formal reviews of all accidents, near misses, risks 
and risk behaviours
3. Ongoing training for all employees
4.  The identification of job specific “safe behaviours”
5.  A combination of both leading and lagging indicator KPIs.
The company has seen significant success; the reportable 
accident rate has fallen by over 40% from 2010 to 2013. However, 
perhaps even more significant has been the phenomenal 
reduction in the number of “light duty days” which have fallen from 
925 in 2010 to 230 during 2013. In addition, by 31st December 
2013 the company had completed 483 days without a lost 
time incident.
Kris Brown, Safety Supervisor at Spirax Sarco USA, stated, 
“Behavioural Based Safety was a natural progression for 
us. Over the years our employees have become excellent at 
identifying hazards and safety issues. The next logical step was 
to help employees to start to identify positive H&S behaviours that 
not only they exhibit but their fellow co-workers as well. One of 
the keys of Behavioural Based Safety is to identify behaviours, 
positive or negative, that have an impact on health, safety and 
wellness, and address them in a manner reflective of our core 
values.”
Chip Stokes, Vice President Supply of Spirax Sarco, USA stated, 
“Our efforts in Behavioural Based Safety and Wellness is a 
significant part of the foundation we are building to support our 
journey for organisational excellence. We have a passion to foster 
a safety-first culture that encourages all levels of the organisation 
to take a proactive role in continuously improving our health 
and wellness. This allows everyone to be part of creating an 
environment that motivates us to take care of each other. It is part 
of Spirax Sarco’s DNA to do the right thing for our greatest asset: 
our people.”

Whatever their position within the Company, all employees are 
encouraged to develop their skills. We support applications for 
training and professional development from workers from the factory 
floor through to senior managers and Directors. 
The knowledge and skills of our customer facing sales and service 
engineers is a key differentiator and is central to our ability to 
offer value to our customers. Ensuring that our sales and service 
engineers have unrivalled industry expertise is crucial to achieving 
our first strategic objective of strengthening our global market 
position through local expertise and customer insight. 
We spend approximately two years training all new engineers. 
Once trained, our engineers are expected to participate in on-going 
training and professional development and we provide opportunities 
for them to do so. During 2013 we launched a Group-wide 
“e-learning” programme, with approximately 50 online courses 
currently available, directed at enhancing the knowledge and skills of 
our sales and service engineers. By the end of 2014 we plan to add a 
further 30 courses to the programme. While we view “e-learning” as 
an important mechanism for the on-going training of our engineers, 
it is designed to supplement, and not replace, traditional classroom 
based and on-the-job training. We have over 40 state-of-the-art 
training centres worldwide, in which we train both our people and 
our customers.
We increased our average number of formal (classroom based) 
training days per customer facing employee by nearly 30% 
during 2013. 
Talent management is essential to prepare promising employees 
for leadership and senior management positions within the 
Group and to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. 
During 201 1 we launched our Spirax Sarco Leadership Academy. 
During 2013, 15 of our future leaders attended a two week Advanced 
Management Programme, run by the Ashridge Business School. 
The course covers such topics as: effective people management; 
driving growth and innovation; and delivering results. By investing in 
the professional development of our future managers we meet their 
ongoing development needs while equipping them to support the 
long-term success of the business.
In addition to supporting and facilitating the professional 
development of our people, we provide training to ensure that 
they have the necessary knowledge to uphold the Company’s 
core values. During 2013, 1,000 of our employees participated in 
“Doing the Right Thing” training (see page 49) and since launching 
our “anti-bribery@work” online course during 2012, over 2,800 
customer facing employees and senior managers have participated 
in the training.  53 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Objective:
To engage positively with the communities in 
which we operate 
We are committed to improving the social and economic conditions 
of the communities in which we operate. We recognise that the 
most effective way of doing this is through managing the business 
effectively to ensure its on-going success and providing employment 
that fairly remunerates people for the work that they do. However, 
we also seek to positively engage in our local communities, 
particularly through improving educational access and helping 
disadvantaged children.
For example, Spirax Sarco UK is a sponsor of the annual 
Cheltenham Science Festival. Each year the Company designs a 
stand, which is manned by our employees, through which it engages 
local people and, in particular, school children in the science of 
steam and its modern applications. The theme of the stand in 2013 
was “the elements”.
By making charitable donations to worthwhile causes we can 
focus our efforts on helping specific groups of people (e.g. 
the less advantaged, disabled or abused); promote education; 
improve access to healthcare; or offer assistance following 
natural disasters. 
During 2013, the Spirax Sarco Group Charitable Trust (Trust) 
made 49 donations, ranging from £1,000 to £15,000, in 
accordance with its charitable donations policy. Donations made 
by the Trust included £15,000 to Cobalt, a leading medical 
charity that helps in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
of cancer and other life-limiting conditions; £15,000 to Open 
Door, a local Cheltenham charity that offers food, hospitality and 
support to the homeless; and £10,000 to the Philippines Typhoon 
Disaster Appeal. 
In addition to the donations made by the Trust, a further £64,000 
(2012: £40,000) was donated to charitable causes by our 
operating companies during 2013.
Our employees frequently undertake independent fundraising 
initiatives and raise significant funds to donate to charitable 
causes that have particular meaning and importance to them.
Since 2008, Spirax Sarco has donated more than £80,000 to 
the National Star College (NSC) in Cheltenham, UK. The NSC 
provides specialist further education, training and personal 
development for young people aged 16 to 25 with complex 
physical, educational and emotional needs. In September 
2013, a group of 24 runners from Spirax Sarco completed 
the Cheltenham Half-Marathon, and raised over £1,600 in 
sponsorship for the NSC.

Group Charitable Trust donations £’000
During 2013 our MasoSine business in Germany (part of the 
Watson-Marlow Pumps Group) donated several old computers 
to a local school. The computers, which were fully depreciated, 
had reached the end of their serviceable life for MasoSine, but 
were gratefully received by the school, which has limited access to 
IT equipment.
Furthermore, throughout 2013 MasoSine offered several school 
children, aged 13 to 14, the opportunity to undertake a week-long 
work experience placement within the company, as well as offering a 
six month internship to an engineering student from a local university 
and employing an apprentice within the factory. 
During 2013, MasoSine offered their local fire department the use of 
the company’s buildings for training. Finding locations to undertake 
training in “real” conditions is crucial for emergency services but 
access to suitable locations is often limited. Allowing the fire service 
access to company buildings has also helped MasoSine to review its 
emergency fire procedures. 
Spirax Sarco, Korea’s “ Jo Club” (“ Jo” meaning “help” in Korean) has 
continued to make a positive impact on its local community. On a 
monthly basis throughout 2013, club members donated money to 
local charities, visited and assisted at a centre for the disabled and 
volunteered in a soup kitchen. Twice during the year, club members 
delivered coal, bread and rice to the elderly. The club is financed 
by donations from the company as well as from money raised by 
collections and fund-raising events organised by the club members. * 2012 figure restated due to improvements in our methodology

Our environment:
Objective:
To manage and minimise the environmental 
impact of our operations
Climate change is widely recognised as a global threat, with the 
potential to affect world environmental, social, political and economic 
systems. We have a responsibility to address the threat of climate 
change by managing our energy consumption and reducing our 
CO
2e emissions.
In accordance with national and international directives on climate 
change, we endeavour to continuously reduce the carbon intensity 
of our business and implement strategies to minimise our carbon 
footprint. We have measured and reported our CO
2e emissions 
for several years and welcome the new requirement for listed 
companies to disclose their CO 2e emissions. We report on all of the 
emission sources required under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
(Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.
We have employed an “operational control” definition to outline 
our carbon footprint boundary. Included within that boundary are 
manufacturing facilities, administrative and sales offices where we 
have authority to implement our operating policies. For each of these 
entities we have measured and reported on our relevant Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions. (Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from 
sources owned or controlled by the Company; Scope 2 refers 
to indirect emissions resulting from the purchase of electricity 
generated off site, including electricity.) Excluded from our footprint 
boundary are entities where we do not have operational control. 
In 2013 this included Spirax-Marshall Ltd. Also excluded from the 
footprint boundary are emission sources from operating companies 
established during 2013 and from companies acquired during the 
year. We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors from the 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
2014 to calculate our total CO
2e emissions figures.
Our total CO 2e emissions increased during 2013. This was primarily 
due to an increase in energy-intensive R&D testing at our world-
leading steam testing facilities in the UK and the expansion in 
manufacturing capability in the Asia Pacific region. Although an 
increase in emissions is undesirable, through R&D we develop 
products that improve our customers’ energy efficiency and reduce 
emissions. Furthermore, our regional manufacturing strategy is 
improving the efficiency of our manufacturing process and reducing 
emissions associated with transportation of products. 
Our Group Environmental Policy sets minimum standards that we 
expect all of our operating companies to adhere to and requires 
them to implement local policies to manage their environmental 
impact. Our operating companies are all expected to take steps 
to minimise their environmental impact and reduce their CO
2e 
emissions. For example, when upgrading its fleet of vehicles, 
minimising environmental impact was a top priority for Spirax Sarco 
Canada. They chose the hybrid Toyota Prius because of its excellent 
fuel efficiency and low emissions.
Through taking steps to manage our CO
2e emissions, we are 
doing our part to mitigate climate change and are improving the 
sustainability of our business.
Target: To achieve a year-on-year reduction in our CO 2e 
emissions intensity.
To demonstrate our commitment to measuring, managing and 
disclosing our emissions, in 2013 we appointed Carbon Clear, 
an independent third-party organisation, to help us calculate 
our carbon emissions, with TÜV providing the assurance. 
TÜV’s statement of limited assurance can be found in full in the 
interactive online Annual Reports and Accounts 2013, on our 
Company website: www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com. A short 
version of the assurance statement is given below.
“TÜV NORD UK, is acting as the independent verifier of the 
carbon footprint of SPIRAX SARCO. Based on our checks and 
reviews, taking into consideration a materiality level of 10% and a 
limited level of assurance we have found no evidence suggesting 
that the calculated greenhouse gas emissions are materially 
misstated and, hence, they are not an unreasonable assertion 
of the greenhouse gas related data and information.
Further, no facts became evident, which led us to the assumption 
that the calculation was not carried out in accordance with the 
applied international norm for the quantification, monitoring and 
reporting of GHG emissions (GHG-Protocol).
The emissions for the reporting period 1st January 2013 to 31st 
December 2013 (inclusive) are: 17 ,266 tCO
2e for Scope 1 and 
16,695 tCO 2e for Scope 2.

Our environment continued:
Objective:
To help our customers to achieve their 
sustainability targets, by improving their 
process efficiency, energy and water

products and the utilisation of our services
Tonnes of CO
2
e emissions our customers saved as a 
result of purchasing our energy management products
Helping our customers to achieve their environmental targets 
is central to our sustainability strategy and business model. 
Reducing CO 2 emissions is one of the key drivers that our customers 
have for improving their on-site energy management.
Using methodology externally verified by AEA Group, we estimate 
that the Spirax Sarco energy management products sold this 
year will reduce our customers’ CO
2 emissions by 4.65 million 
tonnes annually. These savings are calculated with reference to a 
specific range of products, for which we can quantify savings with 
reasonable accuracy. Many other products, such as pressure and 
temperature controls, will also provide CO
2 savings but, as these 
are not easily quantifiable, they are excluded from our methodology. 
The total amount of CO 2 that we save our customers can vary year-
on-year as a result of product mix.
Our direct sales business model enables us to build close 
relationships with our customers. In doing so, we develop a 
comprehensive understanding of their needs. We then deliver 
bespoke engineered solutions to improve process efficiency 
and reduce energy or water consumption. In addition, our 
comprehensive plant-wide energy audits and steam trap monitoring 
systems are used by our customers to monitor and manage their 
energy consumption.
Many applications for our peristaltic and niche pumps help 
our customers to improve their environmental performance. 
For example, within the mining industry the installation of a Bredel 
slurry pump, from Watson-Marlow, can reduce water consumption 
by as much as 70%. This typically equates to water savings of over 
900,000m
3
 of water a year for each pump installed.
In the water and wastewater industries, our customers treat 
industrial/municipal effluent and return it to clean, usable water. 
The precision pumping offered by our pumps prevents overdosing 
of chemicals and reduces the need for additional chemicals to 
neutralise any excess.
As a Group, we have doubled our R&D spend during the last five 
years. We are continuously updating our products and developing 
new ones to ensure that we maintain our market-leading position 
as an expert provider of energy efficient steam solutions and niche 
pumps. Through maintaining our position as a leading supplier of 
energy management products and services, we are responding 
to the threat of climate change, driving growth and increasing the 
sustainability of our business.

Case study:  
Spirax Sarco delivers steam solution for 
pioneering carbon capture project
Spirax Sarco delivered a comprehensive steam-
driven heat exchange package for a ground-
breaking carbon capture project at Ferrybridge 
coal-fired power station in Yorkshire, UK. The Spirax 
Sarco system is a key element in the success of 
this cutting-edge project to develop large-scale 
technology to mitigate the environmental damage 
from burning fossil fuels. 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology aims to capture 
carbon dioxide from the flue gas of major emitters such as power 
stations and store it underground, preventing it from contributing 
to climate change. 
At Ferrybridge the “capture” part of the process takes place; 
an amine-based solvent is used to absorb up to 100 tonnes of 
CO
2 per day. Spirax Sarco’s steam system is used to re-boil and 
regenerate the CO 2 saturated solvent for reuse by stripping out 
the CO 2 under carefully controlled high-temperature conditions. 
The temperature and pressure in the clean-up column has to be 
controlled precisely and steam is the ideal heating medium. 
Spirax Sarco’s all-round steam expertise and project 
management capability made us the ideal company to work 
on the project. “Spirax Sarco has an excellent reputation in 
dealing with steam and condensate management,” said Scott 
Hume, Process Engineer at Doosan Power Systems. “They 
supplied everything as a package, from the steam interface 
back to the condensate return line, including the heat exchanger. 
That simplified the scope of work for our team and it really helped.” Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 56

Governance continued
Chairman’s introduction
We believe that good governance is 
about managing the business effectively 
and in a way that is honest, transparent 
and accountable.
On the following pages, we set out our 
approach to governance, explain how the 
Board and its Committees are structured 
and what they have done during the year. 
Our Governance report explains how 
the Group has applied the principles and 
complied with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2010 and 
2012
1
 (Code). We are fully compliant with the 
requirements of the Code. Compliance with 
the Code is set out in detail on the Group's 
website, www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, 
under the Governance section.
Regulatory disclosures required under DTR 
7 .2.6 can be found on page 97 .
In his introduction to the Remuneration 
report, on pages 73 and 7 4, Dr Rajagopal, 
the Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
discusses our forward-looking policy on 
remuneration, which will be subject to a 
binding shareholder vote at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in May 2014 
and thereafter at least every three years. 
The Annual report on remuneration 
2013 sets out the details of executive 
compensation throughout 2013, which will 
be subject to the normal advisory vote at 
the AGM.
During 2013 we continued our active 
dialogue with our principal investors and 
shareholder representative bodies to ensure 
that we understand their views.
As a Board, we have ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s performance and for 
overseeing the management of risk. 
We acknowledge that shareholders look 
to us to promote the long-term success of 
the Group and, as Chairman, I recognise 
that it is my role to provide the leadership 
to enable it to do so effectively. In 2012 the 
effectiveness of the Board was subject to 
an externally facilitated independent review 
by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review 
Limited. In 2013, as part of our annual Board 
effectiveness review, the Board monitored 
progress with the recommendations 
made by Dr Long. I am pleased to report 
that we have followed through with a 
comprehensive set of actions in respect 
of all recommendations.
The Board takes seriously its responsibility 
for promoting the Group’s values and, in 
particular, for ensuring that all employees 
and everyone associated with the Group are 
aware of their responsibility to act lawfully 
and conduct themselves in accordance 
with high standards of business integrity. 
These values are embedded in our Group 
Management Code. A strong anti-corruption 
culture has long been at the centre of the 
Group’s values. In 2013 we significantly 
improved our compliance programme. 
This included (i) over 2,800 employees 
participating in anti-bribery training using a 
specialised “anti-bribery@work” programme, 
(ii) the issue of a new Sanctions, Embargoes 
and Restrictions Policy and Guide to ensure 
compliance with UN, USA and UK laws, 
and (iii) the intended roll-out of a Behavioural 
Based Safety programme.
A further area of focus in 2013 was a review 
of our arrangements with our external 
auditor. Following revisions to the Code 
recommending that the external audit is put 
out to tender at least every 10 years, the 
Board has determined that, after over 50 
years with KPMG Audit Plc acting as our 
auditor, we change and appoint Deloitte LLP .
Good corporate governance has always 
been an important matter for the Board and, 
combined with our clear and consistent 
strategy, the Group is well equipped to 
continue generating value for shareholders. 
We will continue to live good governance in 
everything we do. I look forward to meeting 
you at our AGM on Tuesday, 20th May 2014.
“ High standards of corporate governance 
are central to sustaining our business 
and maintaining the confidence of 
our shareholders.”

 Compliance statement
The Company is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code, published by the Financial Reporting 
Council and available on their website, www.frc.org.uk. The edition of the Code published in September 
2012 applied throughout our financial year ended 31st December 2013, but the Financial Conduct 
Authority has yet to change the Listing Rules and therefore requires that certain compliance statements 
are made in relation to the predecessor edition of the code, issued in June 2010. This Annual Report and

Director development
Directors attend formal training seminars 
to update their knowledge and duties. 
The Board is regularly notified of changes to 
relevant laws and regulations. Non-Executive 
Directors are invited to attend Group 
conferences, which provide information on 
new product development and sales and 
marketing initiatives. Business presentations 
are given at Board meetings to enable 
a review of new product development, 
regional operations, business strategies and 
employee development.
An induction pack is provided to new 
appointees to the Board and induction 
procedures include site visits, briefings 
by senior managers and meetings with 
major shareholders.
During 2013 Mr Anderson attended the 
Advanced Management Programme and 
Mr Whalen attended the Leadership Best 
Practices Executive Programme, both held 
at Harvard Business School.
Approach to governance
Governance helps us to:
• 		 E n s u r e 	 o u r 	 s h a r eh o l d e r s 	 r ec e i v e 	 a 	 g o o d	
return on their investment
• 		 B eh a v e 	 w i th 	 i n t eg ri ty 	 a s 	 c o l l ea g u es ,	
making sure that each feels valued, 
motivated and rewarded
• 		 T r ea t 	 o u r 	 c u s t o m er s , 	 s u p p l i e r s 	 a n d 	 l o c a l	
communities properly
• 	 R es p ec t 	 th e 	 en v i r o n m en t .
Board activities in 2013
We aim to embed governance practices 
throughout the Group so that they become 
an integral part of running a successful 
business. In the diagram below we have 
set out how the Board spent its time during 
2013. The Board agendas are linked to the 
fundamentals of a trusted brand, a clear 
strategic plan, strong leadership, motivated 
employees and satisfied customers, 
together with the necessary checks and 
balances. We focus on long-term plans for 
our businesses, the issues that matter on 
the ground, and what our management and 
people are doing day-to-day. The Board 
spends 25% of its time ensuring the Group’s 
operations and risk management controls 
are effective. In June 2013 the Board 
devoted considerable time to the Group’s 
business and corporate strategy looking, 
in particular, at the global competitive 
environment and emerging global markets. 
During 2013 the Board also regularly 
reviewed the Group’s performance and 
satisfied itself that, despite difficult trading 
conditions, management was on track 
in delivering the strategic business plan. 
In addition, the Board concentrated its 
efforts on succession planning, devoting 
much time to this important subject during 
its strategic planning meeting in June. 
The Board also regarded engagement with 
shareholders on governance, remuneration 
and trading as a significant issue.
The Board adopted a Human Rights Policy 
to support our values, which is explained in 
the Sustainability report on page 49.
Compliance with the Code
The governance rules which applied 
to the Group for 2013 are found in the 
Code. The Group’s compliance in 2013 
with each provision of the Code is set 
out in detail on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section.
The Group complies with every provision 
of the Code including provision B. 1.2 
(balance of the Board between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors). Following the 
retirement of Mr Vernon and Mr Bullock, 
and the forthcoming appointment of a 
new independent Non-Executive Director, 
we will deliberately move to a position of 
compliance as the number of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, excluding the 
Non-Executive Chairman, will be equal to the 
number of Executive Directors.
The Board is committed to the Code 
provisions on board diversity and has set 
measurable objectives to monitor progress. 
Diversity is discussed in more detail in the 
Nomination Committee’s report on page 69.
Annual Report and Accounts
In accordance with the Code, the Directors 
confirm that they consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Governance structure
The Board Committees and functions are 
listed below together with an overview 
of their activities and the main person 
responsible. The terms of reference for the 
Committees are published on the Group’s 
website, www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, 
under the Governance section.
Group Board
Mr Whiteley 
The Board relies on executive management 
to run the business and monitor 
management activities and holds them 
accountable against targets and standards. 
The Board also approves long-term 
corporate and strategic plans after a full 
review and assessment of market and 
technology trends, business drivers and 
risks. Having a senior management team 
that is capable of executing the strategic 
plans is a key focus.
The formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’s decision 
is available on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section.
Key Board matters include:
• 		 Th e 	 a p p r o v a l 	 o f 	 c o rp o r a t e 	 a n d 	 s tr a t eg i c

• 	 M a j o r 	 l i ti g a ti o n .
The Non-Executive Directors provide 
independent challenge and review, bringing 
wide experience, specific expertise and a 
fresh objective perspective.
The Board meets as often as is necessary 
to discharge its duties. In 2013 the Board 
met seven times. All Directors are expected 
to attend all Board meetings and relevant 
Committee meetings unless prevented by 
prior commitments, illness or a conflict of 
interest. Directors unable to attend specific 
Board or Committee meetings are sent 
the relevant papers and asked to provide 
comments in advance of the meeting to 
the Chairman of the Board or Committee. 
In addition, all Board and Committee 
members receive the minutes of meetings 
as a matter of course.
The Directors’ attendance record at Board 
and Committee meetings is set out on 
page 62. The Non-Executive Directors 
meet without the Executive Directors 
present to discuss the Executive Directors’ 
performance and other matters. The Senior 
Independent Director (Mr Bullock until 
his retirement on 20th May 2014, and as 
nominated) is available to discuss concerns 
with shareholders, in addition to the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive or the Finance Director.
The Board has a conflicts of interest policy 
and has put in place procedures for the 
disclosure and review of any potential or 
actual conflicts.
Committee composition
The Non-Executive Directors play an 
important governance role in the detailed 
work they carry out on our Committees on 
behalf of the Board. All the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement, in 
compliance with the Code.
The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary supports the Committee 
Chairmen in making sure members are 
equipped for informed decision-making 
and that they allocate their time to the 
right subjects.
The Board has satisfied itself that at least 
one member of the Audit Committee, 
namely Mr Watson, has recent and relevant 
financial experience and is confident that the 
collective experience of its members enables 
it to be effective. The Audit Committee also 
has access to the financial expertise of the 
Group, the external and internal auditors and 
can seek further professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, if required.
The Board has delegated specific 
responsibilities to the four Board 
Committees: the Audit Committee, 
the Nomination Committee, the Risk 
Management Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee.
Audit Committee
Mr Watson 
Monitors the integrity of the financial 
statements, ensures significant issues 
have been addressed and reviews the 
effectiveness of internal controls and 
external audit.
Nomination Committee
Mr Whiteley 
Recommends Board appointments and 
reviews succession plans.
Risk Management Committee
Mr Anderson 
Ensures that risk management is meaningful, 
relevant and focused on improving 
the business.
Remuneration Committee
Dr Rajagopal 
Recommends remuneration strategy and 
framework to attract, retain and reward 
senior executives, determines annual 
Executive Director and senior executive 
remuneration and approves awards 
under the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP). The Committee also determines 
the remuneration policy set out in the 
Remuneration policy report 2014.
Further information on each of the 
Committees’ activities during the 12 month 
period to 31st December 2013 is set out in 
pages 66 to 95.
Board effectiveness
In 2012, we commissioned an independently 
facilitated Board effectiveness review 
conducted by Dr Long of Boardroom 
Review Limited, in accordance with 
the provisions of the Code. The Board 
effectiveness review for 2013 focused 
on monitoring progress with Dr Long’s 
recommendations. As a result, the Board 
has actioned the following:

Review of 2013
The Committee met four times in 2013.
Both the internal and external auditors attend 
its meetings and have direct access to the 
Committee Chairman.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of the internal audit, tracks the findings and 
the responsiveness of management to 
any issues identified. As a safeguard, the 
Committee holds separate meetings with 
the external and internal auditors, without 
management present, to discuss their 
respective areas and any issues arising from 
their audits.
During the year the Committee received 
reports from external and internal auditors 
on the major findings of their work and the 
progress of management follow-up. 
We received assurance on going concern, 
pension valuation and risk management.
Auditor
The effectiveness of the external auditor is 
vital in underpinning the Group’s internal 
controls and the integrity of our systems.
Following revisions to the Code introduced 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
in September 2012 and, in particular, the 
recommendation to put the external audit 
out to tender at least every 10 years, during 
the year the Committee approved an 
Invitation to Tender (ITT) document which 
was sent to selected firms. 67 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The ITT followed the FRC’s guidance 
and coincided with the end of the current 
auditor’s five yearly cycle of partner rotation.
The service tendered was the year-end 
external audit. Other services, such as tax 
compliance and advice, were not within the 
scope of the ITT.
The objective of the ITT process was to 
benchmark service, fees and value, and to 
gain insight into new ideas and perspectives 
that would contribute to the current risk and 
control environment.
The selection panel comprised the 
Committee Chairman, the Finance Director 
and the Group Financial Controller, with 
consideration of both quantitative and 
qualitative measures including the:
• 		 S tr en g th 	 o f 	 th e 	 a u d i t 	 fi r m ’ s 	 c o v e r a g e	 
and reputation
• 		 S tr en g th 	 o f 	 th e 	 t ea m

• 		 F ees 	 a n d 	 v a l u e 	 a d d e d
• 		 T r a n s i t i o n 	 p l a n .
Based on reports from the panel, the 
Committee made a recommendation to the 
Board that, with effect from 20th May 2014, 
Deloitte LLP be appointed as the external 
auditor, subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM.
We look forward to a constructive and 
professional relationship with Deloitte LLP , in 
support of the Committee’s responsibility for 
oversight of financial reporting. 
The Committee, with the approval of the 
Board, has put in place policies that restrict 
the types and the amount of non-audit 
work that can be carried out by the external 
auditor. The Committee is provided with a 
report of all non-audit work carried out by 
the external auditor and a full breakdown of 
fees related to non-audit work. A summary 
of the fees is contained in note 6 on page 
1 17 . The policies, restrictions and reporting 
requirements allow the Committee to ensure 
that auditor objectivity and independence 
is maintained.
We will ensure that these policies and 
requirements are satisfied with respect to 
Deloitte LLP , following their forthcoming 
appointment as external auditor.
Information security
The Group does not consider that it is high 
risk for information theft and assesses itself 
as a low value opportunity for cyber-attack. 
To date there have been no known  
cyber-attacks on the Group. However, 
we remain alert at all times.
The Group has identified the information 
assets that are at risk to ensure the relevant 
protection is in place.
Over the past five years changes have 
been made to strengthen our information 
security including:
• 		 An ti - v i ru s 	 r o l l - o u t 	 t o 	 m i ti g a t e 	 g l o b a l 
virus threat
• 		 I m p l e m en t a ti o n 	 o f 	 a 	 g l o b a l 	 o p er a ti n g

• 		 An 	 i n f o r m a ti o n 	 s ec u ri ty 	 a u d i t .
The penetration testing is aimed at ensuring 
our global network remains secure.
The testing is carried out by the Commercial 
Arm of the Government Communications 
Headquarters, with a full test report provided 
listing any vulnerabilities found and how 
these can be addressed. A follow-up test 
is subsequently carried out to ensure the 
vulnerabilities are fully resolved.
Our global network provider complies with 
industry best practice and is Government 
and Ministry of Defence certified.
Significant issues in relation 
to the financial statements
During the year the Committee considered 
significant issues in relation to the Group’s 
financial statements and disclosures 
relating to:
(i) The carrying value of goodwill
The Committee focused on the impairment 
testing by the Company of the carrying 
value of goodwill, including the sensitivity 
analysis, and agreed with the conclusion 
reached that no impairments were required. 
The Committee agreed with the conclusion 
that, following review, no re-allocation of 
goodwill was required in respect of  
Watson-Marlow acquisitions where the 
routes to market had been progressively 
changed from distribution to direct sales.
(ii) R&D and software costs 
As set out in note 1 on page 1 1 1, 
the Group’s intangible assets include 
capitalised development and software 
costs. The Committee focused on the 
judgements made by the Company as to 
the appropriateness of capitalisation of 
these assets. Particular attention was paid 
to the costs incurred for the implementation 
of a new ERP system for Watson-Marlow, 
which have been capitalised during the year. 
The Committee enquired as to the progress 
of the system implementation, examined the 
nature of the capitalised costs and agreed 
that capitalisation is in accordance with the 
accounting standards. 
(iii) Taxation
There is judgement involved in the estimation 
of the Group’s tax charge, in assessing the 
risk of successful challenge by local tax 
authorities and the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets. The Committee considered 
reports by the Company, including those 
relating to transfer pricing arrangements. 
The Committee also considered the 
appropriateness of recognition of deferred 
tax assets, including those relating 
to brought forward tax losses in the 
UK as a result of accelerated pension 
payments. The Committee reviewed, 
and is comfortable with, the forecasts 
and assumptions supporting utilisation of 
these losses.
(iv)  Ensuring the Annual Report and 
Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable
We carried out a full assessment and review 
to ensure the new more exacting standard 
was satisfied.
(v)  Other judgements in the financial 
statements
Pensions, provisions and acquisitions 
were addressed. Chairman’s introduction Board of Directors Corporate governance report Our governance Nomination Committee Audit Committee

Audit Committee continued
Governance continued
These issues were discussed with 
management during 2013, and with the 
auditor when reviewing and agreeing the 
audit plan, and also at the conclusion of the 
audit of the financial statements.
After reviewing the presentations and reports 
from management and consulting with the 
auditor, the Committee is satisfied that the 
financial statements appropriately address 
the critical judgements and key estimates, 
both in respect of the amounts reported 
and the disclosures. The Committee is also 
satisfied that the significant assumptions 
used for determining the value of assets and 
liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are sufficiently robust.
Review of financial 
statements
During 2013 the Committee considered 
many components of business performance 
in order to ensure it has a full understanding 
of the operations of the Group.
Examples of processes the Committee 
uses include:
• 		 D e t e r m i n i n g 	 th e 	 p o s i t i o n 	 a d o p t e d 	 i n 	 k e y	
judgement areas including pensions, 
provisions and acquisitions
• 		 R i s k 	 a r ea s 	 s e t 	 o u t 	 i n 	 th e 	 R i s k 	 M a n a g e m en t

• 		 R ec e i p t 	 o f 	 r eg u l a r 	 s tr a t eg y 	 r e p o rts 	 fr o m

reports from the Divisional Directors
• 		 R e q u es ti n g 	 m em b er s 	 o f 	 m a n a g e m en t 	 t o

• 		 R e v i e w 	 o f 	 i n f o rm a ti o n 	 s ec u r i ty .
Through these processes and its monitoring 
of the effectiveness of controls, internal 
audit and risk management, the Committee 
is able to maintain a good understanding 
of business performance, key areas of 
judgement and decision-making processes 
within the Group. 
Matters considered
In 2013, the following matters were 
considered by the Committee and, 
where applicable, by the Board or 
other Committees:

Fair, balanced and 
understandable report 
and accounts
One of the key governance requirements 
is for the report and accounts to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. The  
co-ordination and review of the Group-wide 
input into the Annual Report and Accounts 
is a significant exercise performed within an 
exacting time frame, which runs alongside 
the formal audit process undertaken by the 
external auditor.
Arriving at a position where initially the 
Committee and then the Board are satisfied 
with the overall fairness, balance and 
clarity of the document is underpinned by 
the following:
• 		 C o m p r eh en s i v e 	 g u i d a n c e 	 f o r 	 c o n tri b u t o r s

Role of the Committee
The primary responsibilities of the Committee 
are to make appropriate recommendations 
to the Board for the appointment,  
re-appointment or replacement of Directors; 
keep under review the structure and 
composition of the Board; recommend any 
proposed changes to the Board; and consider 
succession planning arrangements for Directors 
and, more generally, senior executives.
In recommending appointments to the Board, 
the Committee has regard to the overall balance 
of the skills, knowledge and experience of Board 
members against the current and perceived 
future requirements of the Group and to the 
benefits of diversity, including gender.
Review of 2013
Following the announcement of Mr Vernon’s 
intention to retire, we recommended the 
appointment of Mr Anderson as Chief Operating 
Officer, with a view to him taking over as Group 
Chief Executive. This appointment was part of 
the Group’s on-going succession planning and 
followed a comprehensive nomination process. 
Mr Bullock advised the Board that he did not 
intend to seek re-election at the AGM after 
completing nine years as a Non-Executive 
Director and Senior Independent Director, 
which is the maximum period of tenure for 
assured independence as set out in the Code. 
In consequence of Mr Bullock stepping down, 
the Committee recommended to the Board 
that Dr Rajagopal took over as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee. Finally, the 
Committee is engaged in a planned succession 
process to appoint a new independent 
Non-Executive Director before the AGM.
Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, who do not 
have any other connection with the Company, 
assisted with the appointment of Mr Anderson 
and are assisting with the appointment of the 
new independent Non-Executive Director.
We have given increased focus to leadership 
development through robust succession 
planning and a strengthened performance 
management culture. We seek to ensure that 
we have a high-performing workforce and 
that we better identify tomorrow’s leaders. 
We have a management development plan for 
those individuals demonstrating high potential 
fulfilled through our Leadership Academy in 
conjunction with Ashridge Business School 
and our “Aspire” programme.
The Executive Directors meet frequently to 
review organisational staffing requirements 
against career planning of high-potential leaders. 
The most recent review of succession planning 
formed part of the strategic planning meeting 
held in June 2013.
The Group seeks to have Directors who, in 
addition to relevant technical and commercial 
expertise, meet the highest standards of 
judgement, critical thinking and openness. 
Furthermore, the Group recognises the 
importance of diversity at all levels of the 
Company as well as on the Board.
We believe that the Board’s perspective and 
approach is greatly enhanced through gender, 
age and cultural diversity and it is our policy to 
consider overall Board balance and diversity 
when appointing new Directors. As illustrated on 
page 62, the diverse range and nationalities of 
our Board is particularly relevant given the broad 
international reach of the Group. 
We are committed to a target of a minimum of 
25% women on our Board by 2016. This is a 
key element of our Board succession plan and 
therefore we are confident that this target can 
be achieved. We ensure that, when vacancies 
arise, women candidates for Board positions are 
actively encouraged as part of the recruitment 
process. Board appointments are, in the final 
analysis, made on merit. 
We will also encourage the progress of females 
in senior positions throughout the Group 
and, during 2013, females were appointed as 
President of Spirax Sarco Inc in the USA and 
Engineering Procurement and Construction 
Key Account Manager, Americas. We are 
also constantly improving the intake of female 
professionals to ensure a better talent pipeline 
for senior leadership roles in the future.
We have offered practical support for the 
Department for Business Innovation and Skills’ 
“Women on Boards – FTSE 250” initiative, 
by nominating two females from our senior 
management team to serve as non-executive 
directors on other company boards.
“ Our main focus is on a strong 
and balanced Board and senior 
management with a range of skills, 
experience and diversity.”

Risk Management Committee
Governance continued
Role of the Committee
The Committee ensures that the Group 
has operating policies and procedures 
covering everything from financial planning 
and reporting, capital expenditure, project 
governance, sanctions and embargoes 
to human rights, business continuity, 
employee performance management and 
how we do business. Detailed policies 
and procedures are in place to ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements. The Committee is responsible 
for risk management, compliance 
and regulation.
Our approach and appetite 
for risk
Our aim is to continue to build a 
sustainable business through consistent, 
profitable growth and to provide value 
to our customers and shareholders. 
Creating shareholder value is the reward 
for taking acceptable risks. The effective 
understanding, acceptance and 
management of risk is fundamental to the 
long-term success of the Group.
Our approach is encapsulated in the 
principles of our risk management policy:
• 		 T o 	 u n d e r s t a n d 	 th e 	 n a tu r e 	 a n d 	 e xt en t 	 o f	
risks facing the Group
• 		 T o 	 a c c e p t 	 a n d 	 m a n a g e 	 w i th i n 	 th e 	 b u s i n es s	
those risks which our employees have 
the skills and expertise to understand 
and leverage
• 		 T o 	 a ss ess 	 a n d 	 tr a n s fer 	 o r 	 a v o i d 	 th o s e 	 ri s k s

• 		 T o 	 es t a b l i s h 	 th e 	 a u th o ri ty 	 l e v el s 	 w i th i n 	 th e	
Group, by consideration of materiality, 
at which decisions on acceptance and 
mitigation of these risks are taken.
The risk review process
We have adopted an integrated approach 
to our risk management, independent 
assurance and internal controls to ensure 
greater linkage across our review and 
assessment of risk. Internal controls and 
risk management are designed to limit 
the chance of failure to achieve corporate 
objectives. Independent assurance is 
provided by the external auditor and 
internal audit.
The Committee has accountability for 
overseeing the risk management processes 
and procedures, works with the Audit 
Committee and reports to the Board on the 
principal risks facing the Group.
The Committee also monitors the mitigating 
actions put in place by the relevant divisions 
and Group companies to address the 
identified risks.
External consultants are involved in the 
review every three years, with the last review 
taking place in 201 1. A review involving 
external consultants and our independent 
Non-Executive Directors, who take a 
strong interest in risk management, will be 
conducted in 2014.
At a local level, each operating company is 
required to undertake a formal review of the 
risks which impact on its business at least 
twice a year. The reviews are consolidated 
into Group-wide risk reports which are 
maintained and reviewed by the Committee 
on a regular basis.
We have a robust risk management process 
in place through which we identify, evaluate 
and manage the principal risks that could 
impact on the Group’s performance. 
The principal risks and the product of the 
2013 review are set out on pages 26 and 27 .
“ We seek to understand, manage 
and mitigate risks for the long-term 
success of our business.”

Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role of 
management is to implement Board policies 
on risk and control. There is an on-going 
review process for identifying and managing 
risks faced by the Group which has been 
in place for 2013 and up to the date of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The review 
covers and assesses the effectiveness 
of all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management systems. This ensures 
that proper accounting records have been 
maintained, financial information used within 
the business is reliable and the consolidated 
accounts preparation and financial reporting 
process comply with all relevant regulatory 
reporting requirements. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve the business objectives.
The Board believes from its annual reviews 
that the system of internal controls is 
embedded in the business and regular 
review allows for assessment of new and 
changing risks in the Group’s business.
In pursuing these objectives, internal 
controls can provide only reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the 
Group has complied throughout the year 
and up to the date of the Annual Report 
and Accounts with the Code provisions on 
internal controls.
All operating companies are required 
annually to complete self-certification 
questionnaires regarding compliance with 
the policies, procedures and minimum 
requirements for an effective system of 
internal controls.
Self-certification is given by both the General 
Manager and the Finance Manager of 
each operation.
Internal audit
The Board has an established internal audit 
function which allows each of the Group 
operating companies to be audited at 
least every three years and those judged 
to be in higher risk territories are audited 
more frequently. 
All businesses acquired by the Group are 
subject to internal audit within one year 
from the date of acquisition. Internal audit 
resource is supplemented by experienced, 
qualified accounting staff from principal 
Group operating companies and a 
professional auditing firm, BDO International. 
Reports are made to the Audit Committee 
and the Board as a whole. Whilst there were 
some areas for local improvement identified 
in the internal audit reports, no significant 
matters were raised in the reports made in 
the operating companies audited during 
the year. 
As explained by the Chairman, in his 
introduction to Governance on page 58, 
we have built on our strong anti-corruption 
culture and our Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy, which includes specific policies 
and a comprehensive training programme 
called “anti-bribery@work”. The programme 
was rolled-out across the Group during 
2013. At the end of the roll-out, over 2,800 
employees will have participated. We also 
ensure that all relevant new appointees 
undertake the training. The training will be 
refreshed on a regular basis. The Group 
Legal function also makes face-to-face 
presentations throughout the Group on 
business ethics.
The Committee has ensured compliance 
with centrally documented control 
procedures on such matters as capital 
expenditure, information and technology 
security and legal and regulatory 
compliance. We also followed up on 
compliance with our Competition Policy, 
which was introduced in 2012, to ensure the 
Group conducts its business in accordance 
with the competition laws of all the countries 
in which it operates.
Important developments in 
the year
Our risk management approach is subject 
to continuous review and updating to 
take account of new and developing 
issues which might impact our business 
objectives. The following actions have been 
undertaken during the year to address 
significant developments:
• 		 C o m p l e t e d 	 th e 	 r o l l - o u t 	 a c r o s s 	 th e 	 Gr o u p

Chairman, Remuneration Committee

 Appointed Committee Chairman 1st January 2014.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present our Remuneration report for 
2013. In line with the new Government 
(Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills) reporting regulations on Directors’ pay, 
introduced in October 2013, this report has 
been split into three sections:
• 		 A 	 s t a t e m en t 	 b y 	 th e 	 C h a i rm a n 	 o f 
the Committee
• 		 A 	 p o l i c y 	 r ep o rt 	 – 	 th a t 	 d es c ri b es 	 a n d	
explains the components of the 
Company’s proposed remuneration policy
• 		 An 	 a n n u a l 	 r ep o rt 	 o n 	 r em u n er a ti o n 	 – 	 th a t	
discloses how the current remuneration 
policy has been implemented during the 
year ended 31st December 2013.
We will seek your support for the Annual 
report on remuneration 2013, in the form 
of an advisory vote, and for the Policy 
report 2014, in the form of a binding vote, 
at the AGM on 20th May 2014. It is the 
Committee’s intention that the proposed 
policy should be implemented following 
the AGM. 
We would like to thank shareholders for their 
support of the 2012 Remuneration report. 
At the AGM on 9th May 2013, the advisory 
vote on the 2012 Directors’ remuneration 
report received 96.3% of the votes in favour. 
We have continued to actively seek and 
take into account the views of shareholders 
when reviewing Executive Director 
remuneration. The Committee is satisfied 
that the remuneration policy proposed in this 
report reflects the interests of shareholders 
and aligns Executive Director remuneration 
with Company strategy, while allowing the 
Group to attract and retain motivated and 
talented individuals. 
Business performance
As noted in the Chairman’s statement on 
page 4, the Company made good progress 
in 2013, with Group revenue up 4% and 
pre-tax profit up 12%, contributing to 
earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% 
and an improvement in Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) to 44.3%. Over the  
three-year period ending in 2013, the 
Company delivered a total shareholder return 
(TSR) of 70.9%. An 1 1 % increase in the total 
dividend for the year extends our year-on-
year dividend increase record to 46 years.
Our remuneration policy is designed to 
ensure that a significant percentage of 
Executive Director pay is based on the 
achievement of demanding performance 
targets and is, therefore, “at risk”. 
Maximum payout in the annual bonus 
plan and Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
is only available as a result of significant 
outperformance by the business. 
The Committee considers that the 
remuneration paid to Executive Directors 
in 2013 (given as a single figure for each 
Director on page 83) reflects the good 
progress made by the Company during 
2013, as well as over the last three years.
Annual bonuses are based on pre-tax profit 
and ROCE targets and these targets are 
adjusted as explained in the Annual report on 
remuneration 2013 on page 85. The Group 
profit achievement of £153.4 million was 
3.8% above the plan target of £147 .8 million 
and the ROCE achieved of 44.3% was 9. 1 % 
above the 40.6% plan target. These metrics 
are after adjustment in accordance with the 
annual bonus plan rules and therefore differ 
from the figures on page 1 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts. These achievements 
resulted in a 95.24% bonus award for the 
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director. Other Executive Directors' targets 
have an additional divisional profit element 
and details of their bonus targets and level 
of achievement can be found on pages 
84 and 85. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 74
Chairman’s introduction Board of Directors Corporate governance report Audit Committee Nomination Committee Our governance
Remuneration Committee letter of introduction continued
Governance continued
Continuing difficult macro-economic 
conditions have resulted in some of the 
demanding performance targets in the PSP 
not being met. Shares awarded in the PSP 
vest based on growth of two measures, 
TSR (60% ) and EPS (40% ) over the three-year 
plan period. Performance on the EPS 
measure resulted in vesting of 7 4.8% of the 
shares awarded for this measure. However, 
a 70.9% increase in TSR in the three years to 
2013 was insufficient to trigger any award for 
the TSR element. The shares vesting under 
both elements were therefore 29.93% of 
the total shares awarded. (Details of bonus 
and PSP awards can be found on pages 
85 and 86 of this report.)
Board changes in 2013
Following Mr Vernon’s announcement of 
his intention to retire, Mr Anderson was 
appointed Group Chief Operating Officer 
from 7th August 2013 and was subsequently 
appointed Group Chief Executive following 
Mr Vernon’s retirement in January 2014. 
In light of his new appointment, the Committee 
reviewed Mr Anderson’ s contract and 
remuneration package to ensure alignment 
with the proposed remuneration policy 
set out in this report. It is the Committee’s 
intention that all new appointments to the 
Board, or significant changes to the scale, 
scope or responsibilities of existing Executive 
Directors, will result in new contracts being 
agreed, aligned with the proposed policy. 
For more information see section 1.5 
(Service agreements and termination policy) 
on pages 79 and 80.
Committee change in 2013
Mr Bullock stepped down as Chairman of 
the Committee in December 2013, but will 
stay on the Committee until the AGM. As the 
new Chairman, I would like to thank Gareth 
for the valuable contribution he made during 
his nine years on the Committee. 
Our remuneration policy and 
links to strategy
The elements of Executive Director 
remuneration are described and explained 
in the policy table on pages 75 to 77 . 
The principal aims of the Committee, as it 
reviews and establishes remuneration policy, 
are outlined below:
1)  To maintain a competitive remuneration 
package that will attract, retain and 
motivate Executive Directors of the calibre 
required to meet the Group’s strategic 
objectives both in the short and long term.
2)  To align the interests of shareholders and 
Executive Directors. This will be achieved 
through the use of long-term incentives, 
which reward TSR and EPS growth, 
and by requiring Executive Directors 
to build a significant shareholding 
themselves, ensuring that they are 
directly exposed to the same gains 
or losses as all other shareholders.
3)  To support the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic priorities to: 
	 • 		 S tr en g th en 	 o u r 	 g l o b a l 	 m a rk e t 	 p o s i t i o n	
through local expertise and customer 
insight
	 • 		 D e l i v e r 	 s o l u ti o n s 	 t o 	 r e d u c e 	 en er gy 	 u s a g e	
through applications engineering and 
energy audits
	 • 		 B r o a d en 	 o u r 	 g l o b a l 	 p r es en c e 	 th r o u g h	
first-to-market leadership in emerging 
markets
	 • 		 Gr o w 	 m a rk e t 	 s h a r e 	 th r o u g h 	 i n c r ea s e d	
market penetration and our one-stop 
shop customer approach
	 • 		 G en e r a t e 	 c o n s i s t en t 	 o r g a n i c

customer value
	 • 		 Op er a t e 	 s u s t a i n a b l y 	 th r o u g h 	 g o o d	
corporate governance, financial 
health, employee well-being, 
community engagement and 
environmental stewardship.
  For more details of the alignment between 
strategy and remuneration and the 
description of performance measures and 
relevant targets see the Policy table on 
pages 75 to 77 .
4)  To align Executive Director remuneration 
with financial and non-financial Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). For more 
details see the description of performance 
measures and relevant targets on pages 
75 to 77 .
5)  To ensure that superior awards are only 
paid for exceptional performance against 
challenging targets. 
Base salary is reviewed annually and 
takes into account the scale, scope and 
responsibilities of Executive Director roles; 
the skills and experience of individuals; 
wider workforce comparisons; and market 
benchmarking, within a defined external 
comparator group.
The annual bonus plan and PSP reward 
financial performance, both absolute and 
relative, to ensure that there is clear and 
demonstrable pay for performance.
In order to further align Executive Director 
interests with those of shareholders, under 
the proposed Remuneration policy Executive 
Directors will be required to defer any bonus 
over 60% of base salary into shares until 
the shareholding guidelines have been 
met. Executive Directors are expected to 
accumulate, over a period of up to five years, 
a shareholding in the Company worth at 
least 100% of base salary and to maintain 
this level of shareholding while remaining on 
the Board.
The Committee believes that the current 
remuneration policy (implemented during 
2013) and the proposed policy (to apply, if 
approved, following the AGM), outlined in 
this Remuneration report, offer a fair and 
competitive package for Executive Directors 
rewarding performance while supporting the 
interests of shareholders.
Changes for 2014
The current macro-economic conditions 
and challenges mentioned in the Chairman’s 
statement have led the Committee to 
review the terms of the PSP award for 
next year. In particular, to increase focus 
on earnings growth in present economic 
circumstances, the proportion of the award 
based on EPS targets has been increased 
to 60% compared with 40% at present 
and the proportion based on TSR reduced 
correspondingly to 40%. In addition, the 
comparator group has been changed to the 
FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services 
Supersector reflecting the current make-up 
of the Company and providing a larger 
comparator group to reduce the effect 
of a few volatile performers affecting the 
Group’s relative TSR rating either positively 
or negatively.

Fixed elements of Executive Director remuneration
Base salary To enable the Group 
to attract, retain 
and motivate high-
performing Executive 
Directors of the calibre 
required to meet the 
Group’s strategic 
objectives. 
 Reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account:
–  Scale, scope and complexity of the role
–  Skills and experience of the individual
–  Wider workforce comparisons
–  Market benchmarking, within a defined external comparator 
group. The Committee uses this information with caution, 
given the limited number of direct comparators and to avoid 
remuneration inflation as a result of benchmarking exercises 
with no corresponding improvement in performance.
The Committee considers the impact of any base salary 
increase on the total remuneration package.
 Reviews take into 
account Company and 
individual performance.
 O r d i na r i l y , s a la r y 
increases will not 
exceed the average 
increase awarded to 
other Group employees. 
The maximum value 
of any annual increase 
in Executive Director 
salaries will be capped 
at country of residence 
inflation plus 5%.  
The Committee may 
award increases above 
this level, subject to a 
maximum of country of 
residence inflation plus 
10%, in circumstances 
such as (i) where a new 
recruit or promoted 
Executive Director’s 
salary has been set lower 
than the market level for 
such a role, or (ii) where 
there is a significant 
increase in the size and 
responsibilities of the 
Executive Director’s role.

competitive levels of 
pension and benefit.
To attract and retain 
individuals with the 
personal attributes, 
skills and experience 
required to deliver 
Group strategy.

pension arrangements 
will comprise no more 
than 25% of base salary.
No element other than

benefits
To ensure that 
Executive Directors 
who have relocated 
nationally or 
internationally are 
compensated for 
costs incurred.
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for the Executive 
Director to relocate on appointment. Costs will primarily be 
dependent on geographical location and family size. 
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for repatriation 
of the Executive Director and his/her family to the original home 
country at the end of their assignment and/or employment.
Executive Directors are personally responsible for all taxes and 
social charges incurred in the home and host locations as a 
result of their appointment. To ensure that Executive Directors 
who relocate internationally are able to fulfil their tax obligations 
in the home and host countries the Company will pay for 
reasonable tax advice and filing support in relation to work-
related income for international Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are reimbursed under a Tax Treaty 
Adjustment for any double tax they might be liable for as a 
result of being subject to home country and host country 
taxation typically for days worked in the home location. 
Executive Directors are not entitled to tax equalisation.
N/A Based on individual 
circumstances 
and subject to 
written agreement.
Maximum values will

against selected KPIs 
which are directly linked 
to business strategy.
 T o r e c o g ni se

and enable the 
Company to flexibly 
control its cost base 
and react to events and 
market circumstances.
To ensure a significant 
proportion of Executive 
Director remuneration 
is directly linked to 
business performance.
Measures, targets and their relative weightings are reviewed 
regularly by the Committee to ensure continuing alignment 
with strategic objectives, and will be detailed in the relevant 
Annual report on remuneration. In 2012 and 2013, the target 
was 60% and the maximum was 100% of base salary.
Bonus is based largely or entirely on the achievement of 
challenging financial performance measures, which have 
been selected to ensure the Company is focused on its 
strategic objectives.
Bonus is delivered in cash. Executive Directors must use 
that part of the bonus over 60% of base salary (net of tax) to 
buy shares until the shareholding guidelines have been met. 
Purchase to be made within 12 months of bonus receipt.
 Bonus is subject to clawback for up to three years following 
payment. Circumstances include financial misstatement, 
erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross 
misconduct. 
The Committee can adjust some performance targets to 
reflect certain non-operating items such as the amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangible assets and exceptional 
reorganisational costs, and to reflect the inclusion of 
Associate companies. These adjustments are mechanical 
rather than discretionary.
Subject to the 
Committee’s 
judgement, 
performance measures 
and their respective 
targets are set at a 
Group or divisional 
level depending 
on the Executive 
Director’s role.
 Any measure can 
be incorporated at 
the Committee’s 
discretion provided 
it is clearly aligned to 
the Group’s strategic 
objectives, subject to 
the requirement that 
financial measures will 
account for a minimum 
of 90% of bonus 
opportunity, with up to 
10% being available for 
sustainability or other 
strategic measures. 
The weighting of each 
component will be 
chosen specifically to 
reflect the Executive 
Director’s role. 
Threshold: 0% of salary.
 Target: 75% of salary 
(60% in 2014).
Maximum: 125% 
of salary (100% in 2014).

1.2 Notes to the policy table
1.2 (i) Outstanding incentive awards
Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted in 2013, 
and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 84 to 87 of the Annual report on remuneration 2013.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion 
to amend such awards.
1.2 (ii) Remuneration policy for other employees
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of 
experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels. The most senior managers in the business (approximately 80 people 
globally) participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors. Target and 
maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the manager’s role. Performance targets are based on an appropriate 
combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures. Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce 
are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
1.2 (iii) Measure selection and the target setting process
Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within 
an individual’s span of control.
Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching. An appropriate mix 
of long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
1.3 External directorships
Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company. Such appointments 
are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships. The Board ensures 
compliance by Directors with Code provision B.3.
Mr Vernon served as a Non-Executive Director at Senior plc during 2013, for which he received and retained total fees of £40,400.
1.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration
When appointing external hires or when promoting executives, or an Executive Director, internally, the Committee will continue to act in the 
best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy. The main elements of the remuneration policy 
for Executive Director appointments are:
• 		 B a s e 	 s a l a ry 	 w i l l 	 b e 	 s e t 	 o n 	 a p p o i n tm en t 	 t a ki n g 	 i n t o 	 a c c o u n t 	 th e 	 f a c t o r s 	 s e t 	 o u t 	 i n 	 th e 	 p o l i c y 	 t a b l e , 	 b u t 	 a l s o 	 th e 	 i n d i v i d u a l ’ s 	 e xp eri en c e .	
Depending on an individual’s prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over 
time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role. In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the “normal” rate 
of annual salary increase set out in the policy table.
• 		 On - g o i n g 	 a n n u a l 	 i n c en t i v e 	 p a y 	 o p p o rtu n i ty 	 w i l l 	 n o t 	 e x c ee d 	 2 7 5 % 	 o f 	 s a l a ry , 	 i n 	 l i n e 	 w i th 	 th e 	 m ax i m u m s 	 s t a t e d 	 i n 	 th e 	 p o l i c y 	 t a b l e 	 ( u p 	 t o 	 1 2 5 %	
of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 150% of salary under the PSP). In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the 
PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
• 		 I n 	 a d d i ti o n 	 t o 	 th e 	 s t a n d a rd 	 e l e m en ts 	 o f 	 r e m u n e r a ti o n , 	 o n 	 th e 	 a p p o i n tm en t 	 o f 	 a n 	 e xt ern a l 	 ca n d i d a t e , 	 th e 	 C o m m i tt ee 	 r es erv es 	 th e 	 ri g h t 	 t o	
buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate. The terms of such awards would 
be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms (for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject 
to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons). It is the intention of the Committee that on an “expected” basis, the value 
of the awards being made would not exceed those being forfeited. Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in 
accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
• 		 Wh en 	 a n 	 i n t ern a l 	 a p p o i n tm en t 	 t o 	 th e 	 B o a rd 	 i s 	 m a d e , 	 a n y 	 p r e- e x i s ti n g 	 o b l i g a ti o n s 	 m a y 	 b e 	 h o n o u r e d 	 b y 	 th e 	 C o m m i tt ee 	 a n d 	 p a ym en t 	 w i l l

The Committee shall have discretion to grant one-off cash or share-based awards to Executive Directors pursuant to the Listing Rules. 
The Committee will exercise this discretion only in exceptional circumstances, where it determines that such an award is necessary to secure 
the recruitment or retention of an Executive Director and where the Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Company 
to do so. Any one-off award will be subject to a maximum of 100% of salary and will be performance related. In such circumstances, the 
Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for the one-off award. The Committee does not expect to have to make any 
one-off awards as a matter of course, and this power has been included in the policy to cater for any exceptional and genuinely unforeseen 
circumstances, such as a grant to a key individual where it is vital to retain them in the business.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on a timely basis on the

1.5 Service agreements and termination policy
The Company’s policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. Service agreements 
are designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned. Executive Directors’ service agreements are kept 
at the Company’s headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable 
by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ notice. In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business 
reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period. All Directors are subject to election 
(if newly appointed in the year) or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group 
or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit/deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 
12 months following the cessation of employment. 
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 75 to 77 . There is 
no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP , until individual participation, level of award, 
measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an 
initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Appointments may be terminated by the Company or individual with 
one month’s notice. 
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013
The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below. The Group 
Chief Executive's service agreement has been updated to reflect latest best practice. In the event of a material change in role, function or 
responsibilities, Executive Directors’ agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain 
circumstances
No additional termination payment if notice worked
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice
Otherwise 12 months’ base salary only  
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump sum 
will be paid
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new 
paid employment in that period 
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP . See page 80
Garden leave clause
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or 
suppliers
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, 
such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement
Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award 
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct
Executive Directors’ legacy agreements
Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period. Where payment is 
made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity (based on an average of the preceding 
three years’ bonus payments) is subject to the Committee’s discretion, with the power to reduce the amount to reflect performance on the 
part of the Executive Director which is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory. On termination of such an Executive Director’s 
service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Director’s need to mitigate his or her loss when determining 
the amount of bonus. Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order 
to ensure that there will be no “payments for failure”. In any event, payments will be subject to clawback provisions. 
Executive Directors’ service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of 
certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.  Chairman’s introduction Board of Directors Corporate governance report Audit Committee Nomination Committee Our governance

While the Executive Directors’ service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an 
offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not. The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for 
the Board and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors’ service agreements 
would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors. Executive Directors’ legacy agreements are summarised in the 
table below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain 
circumstances
No additional termination payment if notice worked 
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice
Otherwise 12 months’ base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the 
average of the prior three years’ annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would 
otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below 
the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new 
paid employment in that period 
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP . See below
Garden leave clause
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or 
suppliers 
Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct
 
Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans
Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a “good leaver” (i.e. where the cessation of employment is 
due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he/she works being disposed of where the ending of 
employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause), payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets 
are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules. If the Executive Director is not a “good leaver” it is expected that no bonus will 
be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules. Any awards granted within 
six months prior to termination (or the giving or receiving of notice) will lapse. Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of 
employment (but prior to the end of the performance period) will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a “good leaver”.
In the case of a “good leaver” the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committee’s discretion. This is 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the 
shortening of the performance period. 
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver” where the ending of employment is not for cause, 
the number of shares vested may be reduced (including to zero) by the Committee in its absolute discretion.  
If an Executive Director ceases employment (or notice is given) on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which 
the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver”, his/her award will be 
preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his/her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a “good 
leaver”, his/her award will lapse on the earlier of his/her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
Change of control
Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to (i) a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice and (ii) receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years’ bonus payments (without any 
reduction for performance).
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance 
targets are met at the date of the event. Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis. The Committee may, at its discretion, 
increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.  Remuneration Committee

Total remuneration by performance scenario
  Fixed    Annual bonus   PSP
1.6 Illustrations of application of the remuneration policy
Under the remuneration policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Company’s performance. Below we 
illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and 
below threshold. 
The scenarios, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are defined as follows:
Element
Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises:
– Base salary effective 1st January 2014
 – Benefits value based on 2013 disclosure
– Pension value (DB 2013 as reported; cash allowance: rate applied to 2014 salary)
 – ESOP participation of up to £1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors
Percentage of Base Salary
Below threshold On target Maximum
Annual bonus (% of salary) 0% 60% 100%
PSP
1
 (% of salary at award) 0% 25% 100%

  A level of 25% vesting for “on target” performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP , which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption 
for on target performance given the approach taken to setting performance targets. Chairman’s introduction Board of Directors Corporate governance report Audit Committee Nomination Committee Our governance

Remuneration policy report 2014 continued
1.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group. When 
conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across 
the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration. The remuneration policy 
was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Group’s senior managers. The responsibility 
for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and 
the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in remuneration policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the 
PSP . The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen 
the development of the business.
1.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views
In developing and reviewing the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks 
and takes into account the range of views of shareholders. The Committee Chairman actively engages with institutional shareholders when 
appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Company’s remuneration policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more generally. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered 
as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy. At the AGM in 2013, the advisory vote on the 2012 Directors’ remuneration 
report received 96.3% in favour. 
The views of shareholders have been helpful and constructive and assisted in the development of a pro-forma Executive Director 
service agreement which has been applied to Mr Anderson on his appointment as Group Chief Executive and which will apply to all new 
appointments. Specifically in relation to the termination arrangements, the revised service agreement restricts any termination payment to 
12 months’ base pay. This applies to the new Group Chief Executive service agreement and, in the event of a material change in the role, 
function or responsibilities, existing Executive Directors’ service agreements will be reviewed and changed to meet the new standard. 83 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Annual Bonus
Executive Directors participate in the annual bonus plan. The annual bonus plan rewards Executive Directors for financial performance both 
at Group level and, where appropriate, for the division for which they are responsible. Targets are reviewed annually to ensure continuing 
alignment with strategy. Bonus levels are determined following the year-end by the Committee based on performance against targets. 
Bonus is payable entirely in cash for the financial year ended 31st December 2013.
Any bonus payment is based entirely on the achievement of challenging financial measures, which have been chosen as they are clearly 
aligned with the Company’s strategy. The mix of performance measures is tailored to the specific role of the Executive Director (see below).
Group roles
Group operating profit (65%) + Group ROCE (35%)
Divisional roles – Steam specialties
Group operating profit (35%) + Group ROCE (35%) + Divisional operating profit (30%)
Divisional role – Watson-Marlow
Group operating profit (15%) + Group ROCE (35%) + Divisional operating profit (50%)
The above performance measures are adjusted to reflect certain non-operating items including the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets and exceptional reorganisational costs, and to reflect the inclusion of our Associate company in India.
Bonus payments are subject to clawback for up to three years following payment. Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous 
calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
The table below sets out the performance measures that each of the Executive Director’s bonus awards were subject to:

Achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 60% of salary, increasing to 100% of salary for maximum performance.
2013 was a good year for the Group which delivered earnings growth, maintained a strong operating profit margin and increased dividends 
to shareholders. The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors ranged between 78.92% and 95.24% of target.
The annual bonus has stretching targets that the Committee determines each year for the Executive Directors, in order to incentivise above 
target performance.
The table below summarises the achieved performance in 2013 in respect of each of the measures used in the determination of annual 
bonus, together with an indication of actual performance relative to target.

Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee makes an annual conditional award of shares to each Executive Director under the PSP . Prior to award, the Committee 
reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching. For financial measures this includes a review 
of analysts’ forecasts.
In normal circumstances, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be 
increased to 150% of base salary. Vesting is based on two performance measures, which have been chosen as they are aligned with 
our strategy:
– TSR performance relative to a comparator group
– Aggregate EPS relative to target aggregate EPS.
Performance is measured over a three-year period.
Clawback provisions apply for PSP awards made from 2012 onwards.
PSP Awards vesting over 2011 – 2013
In 201 1 the Executive Directors, excluding Mr Whalen, received share awards under the PSP , with vesting subject to EPS growth and 
relative TSR performance. The diagrams below set out details of the performance measures and targets that applied, along with the actual 
performance during the period 1st January 201 1 to 31st December 2013.
Aggregate EPS performance (40% of PSP award)
Over the three-year period to 31st December 2013, the Company 
delivered aggregate adjusted EPS of 382.0p. Adjusted EPS was 
103.2p in 2010 (restated for IAS 19R) and so this equated to growth 
of approximately 10.9% per annum over the three years.
Performance Payout
Threshold 354.1p 25%
Maximum 396.1p 100%
Actual 382.0p 74.8%
EPS is derived from the audited Annual Report and Accounts for 
the relevant financial year but adjusted to exclude any non-operating 
items shown separately on the face of the Company’s profit and 
loss account.
Relative TSR performance (60% of PSP award)
Over the three-year period to 31st December 2013, the Company 
delivered a TSR of 70.9%. This fell below the median of the 
comparator group.
Performance Payout
Threshold Median 25%
Maximum Upper Quartile 100%
Actual 46.7% 0.0%
The comparator group for the purpose of measuring relative 
TSR performance comprises 24 similar companies, namely 
BAE Systems, Bodycote, Chemring Group, Cobham, Domino 
Printing Sciences, Fenner, Halma, IMI, Laird, Meggitt, Melrose 
Industries, Morgan Advanced Material, QinetiQ Group, Renishaw, 
Rexam, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Rotork, Senior, Smith (DS), Smiths 
Group, Spectris, Ultra Electronics Hdg, Vesuvius and Weir Group. 
Charter International were removed following their acquisition by 
Colfax Corporation in January 2012.
In respect of the 201 1 PSP awards, actual performance for the combined relative TSR and aggregate EPS resulted in 29.93% of 
shares vesting.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Share Option Schemes
In 2010, Mr Whalen received share options with vesting subject to an increase in EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK 
RPI over the three year period from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2012. The auditor confirmed the performance measure had been 
met and the 7 ,500 share options became exercisable on 26th March 2013. The value of the share options on that date was £202,050, based 
on a share price of 2694.0p.
In respect of the 201 1 grant, if the performance measure is met, the options will be become exercisable on 18th March 2014.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
Executive Directors (excluding Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen who are USA citizens) are eligible to participate in an HMRC approved Share 
Incentive Plan known as the ESOP . The maximum annual investment in shares is £1,500 per Executive Director which can be matched by the 
Company on a one-for-one basis for each share that is purchased by an Executive Director and dividend shares can be reinvested.
No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in 
the Company by all eligible UK employees.
2.2 Pension (audited)
Directors’ pensions
Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen are members of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit plan. The benefit paid under normal retirement from the 
USA defined benefit plan is a single life annuity equal to the number of years of service multiplied by the sum of 1.0% of pensionable salary up 
to social security covered compensation, plus 1.45% of pensionable salary in excess of social security covered compensation. Final average 
salary is the average of the highest pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement up to a ceiling. Both Mr Vernon’s and

  This is a non-contributory plan so Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen paid zero contributions into the plan over the year.
The following additional information is provided.
•	 Death in service: a spouse’s pension equal to one-half of the member’s pension, based on pensionable service to the date of death, is 
payable. After payment of the pension commences the accrued pension shown has no attaching spouse’s pension. However, at retirement 
there is an option to reduce the member’s pension to provide for a spouse’s pension after death. 
•	 Early retirement rights: after leaving the service of the Company, both members have the right to draw their accrued pension at any time 
after their 65th birthday with no reduction. Both members have the right to commence their pension earlier if they meet the age and service 
requirements, with the pension being reduced. The annual reductions for early retirement are 3% for each year from age 65 to age 60 and 
5% for each year from age 60 to earliest retirement age. 
•	Pension increases: the pension has no guaranteed increases. Spirax Sarco Inc. has the discretion to provide increases. 
•	 Other discretionary benefits: additionally, Mr Vernon benefited from an amount in lieu of contributions to a UK DC plan. The total amount 
made by the Group was £1 14,641. Mr Whalen benefited from Company contributions to a USA defined contribution pension plan and 
to a 401k plan. The total amount made by the Group was £7 4,461. This amount exceeded the 25% of base salary cap in 2013 due to an 
adjustment for underpayment in 2012.
Mr Meredith is a member of an HMRC registered, contributory DB scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits Scheme. 
The benefit paid under normal retirement is a pension based on 1/60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service to  
31st March 201 1 and 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service after 31st March 201 1, with final pensionable 
salary defined as basic annual salary over the last 12 months of service. Mr Meredith accrues pro-rata additional service at a rate which gives 
a further two and a half years of service at age 62½ based on 1/60th accrual. At retirement he is entitled to commute a proportion of his 
pension for a tax-free cash lump sum payment within HMRC limits.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 88

Mr Daws became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory DB scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits 
Scheme, with effect from 31st December 2012, and is, therefore, no longer accruing any pension benefits within the DB scheme. In lieu of 
pension benefits, Mr Daws now receives 25% of his basic salary which in the year to 31st December 2013 amounted to £70,000.
Mr Anderson receives 25% of his basic salary in lieu of pension benefits which in the year to 31st December 2013 amounted to £71,917 .

– M.E. Vernon:  £500,000 (0.0%)
– N.J. Anderson:  £475,000 (48.4%)
– D.J. Meredith:  £317 ,000 (3.3%)
– N.H. Daws:  £288,000 (2.9%)
– J.L. Whalen:  £258,599 (3.0%)
With the exception of Mr Anderson, this is similar to the average increase for the broader UK employee population of some 3.0% and takes 
into consideration the other factors noted. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 94

Fees effective January 2014:
The Chairman’s fee has been increased by 4.9% and the Non-Executive Directors’ base fee by 3.4% in 2014.
Base fees:
– Chairman: £150,000
– Non-Executive Directors’ base fee: £46,000
Additional fees:
– Senior Independent Director: £2,000
– Audit/Remuneration Committee Chairmen: £8,500
Benefits
No change.
Annual bonus
No change has been made to the maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan. The performance measures and their respective 
weightings also remain unchanged. 
Bonus targets for the current year 2014 are not disclosed because they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. 
The targets will be retrospectively reported in the Annual report on remuneration 2014. 
Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The weighting of the TSR and EPS performance measures will be changed to 40% : 60% for 2014, to place greater emphasis on delivering 
strong EPS performance in the context of the current economic environment. The Committee also agreed to change the comparator group 
for the 2014 PSP award in respect of the TSR element to the full FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector to reduce volatility 
over the long-term. This provides the Group with a more credible tool with which to motivate and incentivise senior management, while still 
clearly aligning Executive Directors' remuneration to shareholder interests. Based on standard statistical modelling, this change has a  
non-cash cost impact of £143,000 over three years in respect of the Executive Directors’ 2014 award.
Pensions
No change.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
If enacted, the Finance Act 2014 will increase the maximum permitted annual investment into partnership shares to £1,800 (with a 
corresponding increase in the number of matching shares that may be awarded).
2.12 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2013
Membership and attendance
Each of the Committee members is an independent Non-Executive Director and thus brings independence to consideration of all aspects 
of Board remuneration and the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2013, the Committee was chaired by Mr Bullock, and the members comprised Dr Rajagopal, Dr Schoolenberg and Mr Watson, 
all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
In 2013 the Committee met three times and all members attended each meeting.
Advisers to the Committee
During 2013 the Committee sought advice and information from Mr Whiteley, the Chairman, Mr Vernon, the Group Chief Executive and  
Mr Richardson, the Group Human Resources Director. None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their own remuneration 
or fees. The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received external advice from Towers Watson. Towers Watson were appointed by the Committee and provided 
material advice to the Committee on various matters such as executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in respect 
of the PSP , the new Directors’ remuneration report, the impact of the special dividend on outstanding share awards and attendance at 
Committee meetings. Towers Watson’s fees in respect of these services totalled £52,000 in 2013. In addition, Towers Watson work with 
management on other matters relating to remuneration with the approval of the Committee. A separate advisory team within Towers Watson 
provides support and advice to management on pensions and other employee benefit related matters. The Committee is of the opinion that 
the advice received is objective and independent, given that Towers Watson are a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code 
of Conduct, the manner in which advice is delivered and the separate teams that advise management more generally.
Herbert Smith Freehills LLP is appointed by the Company to provide advice to the Company (which is available to the Committee) in relation 
to Executive Directors’ service agreements and share plans. Legal fees relate to advice provided to the Company and not the Committee, 
and are charged on a time-cost basis. Herbert Smith Freehills LLP also provides general legal advice to the Company. 95 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Directors’ and officers’ 
insurance 
The Company provides Directors’ and 
Officers’ Insurance for Board members, 
directors of the Group’s operating 
companies and senior officers.
The Company has also provided each 
Director with an indemnity to the extent 
permitted by law in respect of the liabilities 
incurred as a result of their holding office as 
a Director of the Company.
Appointment and 
replacement of Directors
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. 
As previously announced, Mr Vernon retired 
as Group Chief Executive on  
15th January 2014 and Mr Bullock will 
retire as Non-Executive Director and Senior 
Independent Director following the AGM. 
In order to comply with the Code, all 
Directors, with the exception of Mr Bullock, 
will seek re-election at the AGM and will 
do so thereafter on an annual basis at 
each future AGM. We are also expecting to 
appoint a new independent Non-Executive 
Director before the AGM.
Conflicts
Under the Companies Act 2006 and 
the provisions of the Company’s Articles 
of Association, the Board is required to 
consider potential conflicts of interest. 
The Company has established formal 
procedures for the disclosure and review of 
any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest 
which the Directors may have and for the 
authorisation of such matters of conflict by 
the Board. To this end the Board considers 
and, if appropriate, authorises any conflicts, 
or potential conflicts, of interest as they arise 
and reviews any such authorisation annually. 
New Directors are required to declare any 
conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest to 
the Board at the first Board meeting after 
his or her appointment. The Board believes 
that the procedures established to deal with 
conflicts of interest are operating effectively.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association 
are available from Companies House 
in the UK or by writing to the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary at the 
Group’s registered office in Cheltenham. 
Amendments to the Articles of Association 
can only be made by means of a special 
resolution at a general meeting of the 
shareholders of the Company.
Share capital
As at 28th February 2014 there were no 
treasury shares held by the Company. 
Details of shares issued during the year are 
set out in note 23 on page 127 .
As at 31st December 2013 the Company’s 
share capital was made up of Ordinary 
shares which each carry one vote at general 
meetings of the Company. Except as set out 
in the Articles of Association or in applicable 
legislation, there are no restrictions on the 
transfer of shares in the Company and there 
are no restrictions on the voting rights in the 
Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements entered into between any 
shareholders in the Company which restrict 
the transfer of shares or the exercise of any 
voting rights attached to the shares.
Powers of the Directors and 
purchase of own shares
Subject to the provisions of the Articles of 
Association, the Directors may exercise all 
the powers of the Company. A shareholder’s 
authority for the purchase by the Company 
of a maximum of 10% of its own shares was 
in existence during the year. However, the 
Company did not purchase any of its shares 
during that time. This authority expires at 
the forthcoming AGM and it is proposed 
that a similar authority be approved. 
The total number of shares in issue as at 
31st December 2013 was 75,509,562.
In November 2013 the Company instructed 
Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, 
as trustee of the Spirax-Sarco Engineering 
Employee Benefit Trust, to purchase 
150,000 shares to satisfy awards under 
the PSP . At 31st December 2013, 135,486 
of these shares were held in the Employee 
Benefit Trust.
Significant contracts
The Company is not a party to any 
significant agreements that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid.
There are provisions in the Executive 
Directors’ service agreements which 
state that following a takeover or change 
of control, if the Executive Director’s 
employment is terminated then both salary/
benefits and a sum in respect of lost future 
bonus opportunity become payable as a 
lump sum.
The Strategic report contains all the 
information required to comply with section 
414(c) of the Companies Act 2006 and there 
are no contractual arrangements that need 
to be disclosed which are essential to the 
business of the Group.
Disclosure of information to 
auditor
As at the date of the approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts, as far as each 
Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware.
Each Director has taken all such steps as he 
or she ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. For these purposes, relevant 
audit information (as defined by Section 
418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) means 
information needed by the Company’s 
auditor in connection with preparing their 
report set out on pages 100 to 102.
Auditor
The Company’s auditor for 2013 was 
KPMG Audit Plc. Following a tender 
process as set out in the Audit Committee 
report, resolutions will be proposed at the 
2014 AGM to appoint Deloitte LLP as the 
Company’s auditor and to authorise the 
Directors to determine their remuneration. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 98

Research and development
The Group continues to devote significant 
resources to the development and the 
updating and expansion of its range of 
products in order to remain at the forefront 
of its world markets. The Group steam 
specialties R&D function, which is based 
in Cheltenham, is tasked with improving 
the Group’s pipeline of new products, 
decreasing the time to launch, expanding 
the Group’s addressable market and 
realising additional sales. Further information 
on the expenditure on R&D is contained in 
note 1 on page 1 1 1. The amount of R&D 
expenditure capitalised, and the amount 
amortised, in the year, are given in note 13 
on pages 120 and 121.
Treasury and foreign 
exchange
The Group has in place appropriate 
treasury policies and procedures, which 
are approved by the Board. The treasury 
function manages interest rates for both 
borrowings and cash deposits for the 
Group and is also responsible for ensuring 
there is sufficient headroom against any 
banking covenants contained within its 
credit facilities, and for ensuring there are 
appropriate facilities available to meet the 
Group’s strategic plans.
In order to mitigate and manage exchange 
rate risk, the Group routinely enters into 
forward contracts and continues to monitor 
exchange rate risk in respect of foreign 
currency exposures.
All these treasury policies and procedures 
are regularly monitored and reviewed. 
It is the Group’s policy not to undertake 
speculative transactions which create 
additional exposures over and above those 
arising from normal trading activity.
Political donations
There were no political donations made 
during the year (2012: nil).
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of our greenhouse gas emissions 
can be found on page 54 of the 
Sustainability report.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the main trends and factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and position, and the financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities, are set out in 
the Financial review on pages 44 to 47 . 
In addition note 31 on page 141 includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources together with contracts with a 
diverse range of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and 
industries. No one customer accounts 
for more than 1% of Group turnover. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence and 
that the Directors intend to do so, for at 
least one year from the date the Financial 
statements were signed, and that therefore 
it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Pages 96 to 98 form the Directors’ report for 
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.

report were approved by the Board on

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts and 
the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• 		 S e l ec t 	 s u i t a b l e 	 a c c o u n ti n g 	 p o l i c i es 	 a n d	
then apply them consistently
• 		 M a k e 	 j u d g em en ts 	 a n d 	 es ti m a t es 	 th a t 	 a r e

the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing a 
Corporate governance report, Remuneration 
report and Regulatory disclosures that 
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit 
were as follows: 
Goodwill (£45.8 million) 
Refer to page 67 (Audit Committee report of the Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts), pages 109, 1 1 1 (accounting policy) 
and pages 120 to 123 (financial disclosures). 
•	 	 The risk – Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows which support the carrying value of 
goodwill, this is one of the key judgemental areas in our audit. There is an increased risk of impairment for (i) the goodwill balances that 
arose in recent acquisitions, and (ii) for amounts allocated to components of the Group that have experienced trading difficulties in recent 
years, with operations in Europe being of most concern given the downturn in performance in prior periods. 
•	 	 Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the integrity of the key assumptions applied by the Group, in 
particular those relating to future revenue growth and discount rates. We utilised our own valuation specialists to assist us in comparing 
the Group’s discount rate assumption to risk-adjusted market rates. The growth rates were compared to the approved budgets, which 
represent the Group’s forecasts of expected future performance, as well as to our own assessments based on our knowledge of the 
business, the historical performance of the business and our view on market conditions. We re-performed the Group’s sensitivity analysis 
and, having ascertained the extent of change in the key assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for goodwill to 
be impaired and the circumstances that could result in those changes, considered the likelihood of such a set of circumstances arising. 
  We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuations and the requirements of accounting standards. 
Tax payable (£16.9 million) and UK deferred tax asset (£14.2 million) 
Refer to page 67 (Audit Committee report of the Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts), pages 109, 1 13 (accounting policy) 
and pages 1 18, 125 to 126 (financial disclosures). 
•	 	 The risk – The Group operates in many tax jurisdictions and must comply with complex rules with regard to corporate taxation, in 
particular in the area of transfer pricing. There is judgement involved in assessing the amount of exposures from challenges by local tax 
authorities as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets, in particular those arising from tax losses in the UK trading entity, due to the 
inherent uncertainty in assessing future taxable profits. 
•	 	 Our response – Our procedures in this area included utilising our global tax specialists to assist us in evaluating the Group’s assessment 
of tax exposures, appraising the likely outcome of tax treatments and inspecting correspondence with the tax authorities to assess the 
reasonableness of the tax provisions made. 
  The deferred tax asset arising from tax losses in the UK trading entity results principally from temporary deficit reduction contributions into 
the main UK pension schemes. We assessed the recoverability of this asset through stress testing the financial forecasts of the UK trading 
entity. We tested the integrity of the key assumptions applied in the forecasts, such as future revenue growth and profit margins and made 
our own assessments in relation to the future performance of the UK trading entity. 
  We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of deferred tax and uncertain tax positions.  101 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit continued 
Development costs (£2.8 million capitalised in the year) and software costs (£5.2 million capitalised in the year) 
Refer to page 67 (Audit Committee report of the Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts), pages 109, 1 1 1 (accounting policy) 
and pages 120 to 121 (financial disclosures). 
•	 	 The risk – Development costs and software costs are expensed unless they meet specific criteria in accounting standards, in which case 
they are capitalised. The assessment of whether or not development and software related costs meet the criteria regarding the required 
degree of confidence in the technical feasibility and commerciality of each project is inherently judgemental and, therefore, there is a risk 
that costs may be inappropriately capitalised and profit for the period overstated. 
•	 	 Our response – Our audit work included an evaluation of the adequacy of the Group’s policies for capitalisation of development and 
software related costs against the requirements of the relevant accounting standards. We examined the nature of capitalised development 
and software related costs and tested a sample of these costs compared to the requirements of those accounting standards. In relation 
to capitalised development costs, we stress tested, through discussion with the Group’s technical department, the technical feasibility of 
completing each project and their commercial prospects. We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the degree 
of judgement involved in determining the carrying amount of these assets. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £10.5m. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before taxation (of which it represents 7%), which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the 
company in assessing the financial performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value 
in excess of £0.4m, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The Group is characterised by a diverse geographic footprint, represented by a large number of medium and small sized operations. 
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by the Group audit team at the key reporting component in the UK and by component 
audit teams in the following countries: UK, US (two components), Italy (two components), China, France, South Korea, Argentina, Germany 
(two components), Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Brazil, Australia, and Spain. These audits covered 7 4% of total Group revenue, 72% of Group 
profit before taxation, and 79% of total Group assets. Analytical procedures were performed by a component audit team in Italy and by the 
Group audit team for the Group components in Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands. The analytical procedures covered 4% of total Group 
revenue, 4% of Group profit before taxation, and 4% of total Group assets. The remaining 22% of Group revenue, 24% of Group profit before 
tax and 17% of Group total assets are represented by 33 components, none of which represented individually more than 2% of total Group 
revenue, Group profit before tax, or Group total assets. Statutory audits are performed at the majority of these components but generally 
these are completed after the date of this report. We took account of the prior year audits of these entities in assessing the risk that a material 
misstatement could arise. 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the Group were all performed to materiality levels set 
by, or agreed with, the Group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged from £0. 1m to £3.2m. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all the auditors in these locations. These instructions covered the significant audit areas that should be 
covered by these audits (which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) and set out the information required to be 
reported back to the Group audit team. The Group audit team visited the key reporting component in person or attended telephone meetings with 
the auditors at the following countries: UK (one component not audited by the Group audit team), US (two components), China, and South Korea.

Notes to the Accounts
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The Parent Company and consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been adopted by the European Union (EU). 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. As further explained below, the most significant effect on the financial statements from 
accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of capitalisation of research and development (R&D) and software, goodwill, taxation 
and pensions. 
The major judgements made in respect of R&D are those in assessing whether an intangible asset arises from the development phase of a 
product development project, i.e.: 
i)  The technical feasibility of completing the product so it will be ready for sale 
ii)  The market for the product and the future sales that the product will generate 
iii)  Assessing the costs directly attributable to the individual product during its development. 
The Group has a very wide product range and the general nature of product development is that of a number of modest sized projects. 
The value of capitalised development costs is disclosed in note 13. 
The judgements made in respect of capitalising software costs are those in assessing whether future economic benefits will be generated by 
the asset and the useful life of the asset. More detail on the useful life is given in the intangible assets accounting policy on page 1 1 1 below.
The judgements made in respect of goodwill are those relating to the key assumptions used to assess the value in use in the annual 
impairment tests. More detail about these key assumptions is disclosed in note 13.
The judgements made in respect of taxation are those in assessing the amount of exposure to challenges from tax authorities with regard 
to liabilities in relation to corporate and indirect taxation. Judgement is also required in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. 
More detail is given in the taxation accounting policy on page 1 13 below. 
The judgements made in respect of pensions are those in assessing the assumptions chosen to calculate the net obligation in respect of 
defined benefit pensions. More detail is given in the Employee Benefits accounting policy on page 1 12 below. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. 
Further information on the Group’s business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital 
structure and cash flow are included in the business review and financial review on pages 28 to 47 . In addition, note 31 to the financial 
statements discloses details of the Group’s financial risk management and credit facilities. 
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency, rounded to the nearest thousand. 
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 (revised 201 1) Employee Benefits which introduces a number of changes 
to accounting for defined benefit plans. The key change that impacts the Group is the change in assumption on the expected return on plan 
assets. The requirement to use the expected return on plan assets has been replaced with a requirement to recognise interest on plan assets 
by using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation. Financial statements continued

An additional cost in 2012 of £1 14,000 for administrative and investment expenses under IAS 19 (revised 201 1) has not been recognised due 
to materiality.
There has been no change to previously reported retained earnings, balance sheet amounts or cash flows, other than consequential 
adjustments to the analysis of operating cash flows.
The Group has adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement which lays out the framework for determining the measurement of fair value and 
the disclosure of information relating to fair value and the disclosure of information relating to fair value measurement. IFRS 13 does not 
materially affect any fair value measurement of the Group’s assets or liabilities, with changes being limited to presentation and disclosure, and 
therefore has no effect on the Group’s financial position or performance.
The Group has also adopted IAS 1 (Amendment) Presentation of Financial Statements which changes the grouping of items presented in 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income so that items which may be reclassified to profit and loss in the future are presented 
separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s financial 
position or performance.
In addition, with effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has implemented IAS 28 (Amendment) Investments in Associates and IFRS 10 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The adoption of these standards has had no material impact on the Group’s financial performance or 
position and there has been no requirement to restate prior year comparatives.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and accordingly 
the Group has not yet adopted. The cumulative impact of these standards is not expected to be significant. 
Basis of accounting
( i )  S u b s idi a r ie s 
The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the 
Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into 
account. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. 
( i i)  A s s o c iat e s 
Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
The accounts include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from 
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
(iii)  Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the entity. 
( i v)  Co m p a n y 
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.  1. Strategic report 2. Governance 3. Financial statements
111 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Foreign currency
( i)  O n c ons o l i d at i on 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the 
year. Where the notes to the Group accounts include tables reconciling movements between opening and closing balances, assets and 
liabilities are translated at balance sheet rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates with the exchange differences 
arising being disclosed separately. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a separate translation reserve within 
equity. They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation. In respect of all foreign operations, any 
differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity. 
(ii)  Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined. 
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, 
the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
Cash flow hedge reserve. The associated gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
the transaction to which it relates occurs. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation. 
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, 
are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual values 
over their estimated useful lives. Land is not depreciated. The principal rates are as follows: 
Freehold buildings 1.5% Office equipment 12.5-33.3%
Plant and machinery 10-12.5% Motor vehicles 20%
Office furniture and fittings 10% Tooling and patterns 10%
The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets 
(i )  Go o d wi l l 
All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment 
(see note 13 for more detail). In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, 
which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
( i i )  R& D  
Expenditure on R&D is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that development expenditure 
is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to be released 
for sale and will generate future economic benefits. The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related expenses. 
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and any impairment losses. 
(iii)  Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and 
any impairment losses. Annual impairment tests are performed on acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value with the 
recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, of 
future cash flows in respect of intangible assets for the relevant cash generating unit. More detail is given in note 13. 
( i v )  A m or t is at i on  
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other 
than goodwill, from the date they are available for use. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. The principal amortisation rates are 
as follows: 
Capitalised development costs 20% Manufacturing designs and core technology 10%
ERP systems and software 12.5-20% Non compete undertakings 20-50%
Brand names and trademarks 10-20% Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 112

Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring 
the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of 
manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating 
capacity. Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases 
of inventories. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity usually of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statements. 
Going concern
The statement on the going concern assumption is included within corporate governance on page 98. 
Employee benefits
(i)  Defined contribution plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
(ii)  Defined benefit plans 
The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and 
spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees’ services. The Group’s net obligation in respect 
of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned 
in return for their service in the current and prior periods. Past service costs are recognised straight away. That benefit is discounted at 
rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations 
to determine its present value. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses, 
differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income in the year they arise. Any scheme surplus (to the extent it is considered recoverable) or deficit is recognised in 
full in the balance sheet. 
  The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the 
period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees’ services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. 
(iii)  Employee share plans 
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. The fair value of these options 
and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options and share awards vesting. 
(iv)  Long-term share incentive plans 
The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an 
expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance conditions. 
Revenue 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer, which is typically on delivery. For service contracts, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance. 
Revenue from projects is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. 
Judgements can be required to assess the stage of completion, although in the vast majority of projects the position is relatively easy to 
identify. Projects where a stage of completion assessment is needed typically involve the sale of products, installation and commissioning, 
which are usually separately identified elements in the project order. 
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or there is the 
possibility of return of the goods. No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods. 
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income 
statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract. An expected loss on a project or service contract is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.  1. Strategic report 2. Governance 3. Financial statements

1 Accounting policies continued 
Leases 
( i)  O p e r at i n g l e ase s 
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
( i i)  F i na n c e l e ase s  
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital and interest 
elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors. Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar 
owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis 
which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability. 
Taxation 
The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income 
respectively. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for 
temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax 
is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary 
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Share capital and repurchased shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares or placed in an Employee Benefit Trust and are 
presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Share options granted to subsidiary employees
The Parent Company grants share options over its own Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies. These employees 
provide services to the subsidiary companies. The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of the share options 
granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies. This is accounted for as an increase in investments with a 
corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 114

2012 figures have been restated to comply with IAS 19(R) (see note 1).
The Group’s tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising and the effective tax rates in the various 
territories in which the Group operates.
The UK corporation tax charge is calculated after deducting tax allowable deficit reduction cash contributions to the UK post retirement 
benefit schemes of £7 ,302,000 (2012: £7 ,500,000) covering all employees in the UK defined benefit schemes.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax from 26% to 24% (effective from 1st April 2012) and to 23% (effective 1st April 2013) were substantively 
enacted on 26th March 2012 and 3rd July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1st April 2014) and 20% (effective 
from 1st April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2nd July 2013. This will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. 
The deferred tax asset at 31st December 2013 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
No UK tax (after double tax relief for underlying tax) is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries. 1. Strategic report 2. Governance 3. Financial statements

27 Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations – The Group
The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and 
practices within the countries concerned. These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer 
contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employee’s pay. Contributions made to 
defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled £7 ,373,000 (2012: £6,832,000). In the UK, following the closure 
of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements
The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service. 
Whilst the Group’s primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the US as well as less material schemes 
elsewhere. In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar 
structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements
The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately 66% of the Group’s net balance sheet liability for defined retirement benefit 
schemes. Spirax Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax Sarco Executives Retirement 
Benefits Scheme and the Watson Marlow Pension Fund. These are all final salary pension schemes. The UK schemes are closed to new 
members but are open to future accrual. There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which 
vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of. All three schemes have 
been setup under UK Law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the scheme’s investments, administration 
and management. A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. 
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco. Further information on the 
contribution commitments is shown in the Financial review on pages 46 to 47 .
US defined benefit Schemes
The Group operates a pension scheme in the US which is open to new entrants and defines the pension in terms of the highest average 
pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement. No pension increases (in payment and deferment) are offered by this 
scheme. It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the US, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal Risks
The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, 
dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation 
on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors 
including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms. A key risk is that additional 
contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes. 
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject 
to change and may impact on the Group’s pension schemes. The IAS 19 (R) liability measurement (DBO) and the Service Cost are sensitive to 
the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the 
most important of these assumptions being about the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation. 
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 (R) discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit 
payments. The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Investment strategies are set with funding rather than 
IAS 19 (R) considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 (R) measurement of DBO. As a result the 
difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 (R) DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 132.
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Group has adopted IAS 19 revised 201 1. It differs from the previous adopted standard IAS 19 revised 
2008 in that discount rates that are used to calculate the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation are used to calculate the expected 
return on assets. The 2012 comparative figures have therefore been restated in compliance with IAS 19 revised 201 1 resulting in the expected 
return on assets being £3,559,000 lower at £12,418,000. More detail is given in note 1.

UK pensions
£’000
Overseas 
pensions
and medical
Total
£000
Increase/(decrease) in pension deficit
Discount rate assumption being 0.25% higher (14,000) (2,000) (16,000)
Discount rate assumption being 0.25% lower 19,000 2,000 21,000

Inflation assumption being 0.25% lower (12,000) (1,000) (13,000)
The average age of active participants in the UK schemes at 31st December 2013 was 51 years and in the overseas schemes 49 years.
Pension plans – Parent Company
The Parent Company is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Parent Company’s defined benefit obligations. Other plans operated by the Parent 
Company were defined contribution plans.
The total expense relating to the Parent Company’s defined contribution pension plans in the current year was £49,351 (2012: £29, 163).
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of the Parent Company Defined Benefit Scheme follows the SAPS light tables, with 
improvements based on the 2009 CMI Core Projections with a 1.5% long-term trend. This basis gives a life expectancy of 24 years and 
26 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65. These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of increased longevity. 
These assumptions are regularly reviewed in light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.
With effect from 1st January 2013, the Parent Company has adopted IAS 19 revised 201 1. It differs from the previous adopted standard IAS 
19 revised 2008 in that discount rates that are used to calculate the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation are used to calculate the 
expected return on assets. The 2012 comparative figures have therefore been restated in compliance with IAS 19 revised 201 1 resulting in the 
expected return on assets being £539,000 lower at £2,246,000. More detail is given in note 1.
The financial assumptions used at 31st December were:
Assumptions weighted
by value of liabilities
% per annum
UK pensions
2013 2012
Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 3.6
Rate of increase in pensions 3.1 2.8
Rate of price inflation 3.4 2.9
Discount rate 4.5 4.6
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the 
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. 1. Strategic report 2. Governance 3. Financial statements

Share Option Scheme 
The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees. Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee 
whose objective is to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value. 
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date 
of grant. For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase 
in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant. From and including the 
2002 options, the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a three-year consecutive 
period and from 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant. 
If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. 
The relevant disclosures in respect of the share option scheme grants are set out below. No options were granted in 2013 or 2012.

 Performance Share Plan 
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent 
rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target. To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in 
shares or an option over shares. For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Company’s total shareholder return 
(TSR) relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance 
period where awards will vest on a sliding scale. All shares within an award will vest if the Company’s TSR is at or above the upper quartile. 
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 
25% and 100% if the Company’s TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile. No shares will vest if the Company’s TSR is below 
the median. The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts. The vesting of the first part, amounting 
to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure. The vesting of the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to 
achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period. For the 2008 to 2010 awards, 25% will vest if the 
compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 1 1%, there is pro-rata 
vesting for actual growth between these rates. For awards made in 201 1 onwards, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 
the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the 
UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.

Employee Share Ownership Plan 
UK employees are eligible to participate in the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased 
shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions. Employees are invited to join the ESOP 
when an offer is made each year. Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the 
price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules. The Company provides a matching share for each share 
purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology.

31 Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions. The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and 
short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various 
other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout 
the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained fundamentally 
unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
Credit risk
The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector. 
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers’ credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance 
leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of 
exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this 
structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies. Such exposures arise from 
sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Net cash flows between any two currencies of 
less than £1 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. Forward cover is not taken out 
more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months’ and 60% of the following 12 months’ forecast exposure.

Financial assets on which no interest is earned comprise trade and other receivables and cash at bank and in hand.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates. The average rate of 
interest received on sterling deposits during the year was nil (2012: 0.6%).
Currency exposures
As explained above, the Group’s objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas (in other words, its 
structural currency exposures) are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation. All gains and losses 
arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement. 
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating 
(or “functional”) currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December 2013 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net 
monetary liability of (£706,000) (2012 net monetary liability: £543,000) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary liability of £696,000 
(2012: £7 ,961,000).
At 31st December 2013, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 0.08% (2012: 0.65%) for the euro and nil (2012: nil) for the 
US dollar.

Cash flow hedge
The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are 
designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship. At 31st December 2013 the Group had contracts outstanding to 
purchase £1,004,000 with euros and £931,000 with US dollars. The fair values at the end of the reporting period were £1,887 ,000 
(2012: £1,558,000). The fair value of cash flow hedges falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7 . Financial statements continued

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2013 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact 
that they were at short-term rates of interest. Fair values have been assessed as follows:
•	 	 D e ri v a ti v es
 Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year-end exchange rates
•	 	 I n t e r es t - b ea ri n g 	 l o a n s 	 a n d 	 b o r r o w i n g s
  Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows
•	 	 F i n a n c e 	 l ea s e 	 l i a b i l i ti es
  The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease 
agreements. The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates
•	 	 T r a d e 	 a n d 	 o th er 	 r ec ei v a b l es/ p a y a b l es
  For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the year-end borrowings totalled £100,918,000 (2012: £48, 156,000). At 31st December 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of one 
percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Group’s profit after tax and equity by approximately £700,000 (2012: £250,000). 
For the year ended 31st December 2013, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation 
to the Group’s profit and trading flows would have increased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £2,000,000 (2012: £1,800,000). 
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements. Forward exchange contracts have 
been included in this calculation. 1. Strategic report 2. Governance 3. Financial statements

Other than trade receivables there are no financial assets that are past their due date at 31st December 2013.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

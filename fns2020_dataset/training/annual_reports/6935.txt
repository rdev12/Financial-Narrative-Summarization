Chairman’s Statement 
 
Dear Shareholder, 
 
The past twelve months have been, without question, the most difficult period in the Company’s history and among the most 
trying episodes I can recall in any business venture in which I have been involved.   
 
The Company received no revenue whatsoever from our Syrian assets during 2012 and it is impossible to make any sensible 
prognostication as to when we may once again begin to do so.   
 
The terrible tragedy that continues to unfold in Syria remains the subject of intensive media coverage and there is nothing that I 
can usefully add to that commentary.   
 
I am relieved to report that, to the best of our knowledge, all of our Syrian personnel remain safe, albeit suffering severe disloca-
tion to their personal lives. Nor have our assets in Block 26, at the date hereof, suffered any significant damage or depredations.   
 
In line with our previously stated intent, we continue to employ a significant number of our Syrian personnel and are beginning 
wherever possible to redeploy suitably qualified staff to work on our newly acquired assets in Morocco.   
 
We continue to take all available steps, in strict compliance with EU sanctions, to try to protect the value of our Syrian assets and 
to ensure that, as and when conditions permit, we are able to recommence operations in Block 26. We also continue selectively, 
despite the difficulty of the circumstances, to implement our established programme of Corporate Social Responsibility.  
 
Difficult as the circumstances have been, your Board and management have made substantial progress during the year in apply-
ing the Company’s technical and financial strengths to new business opportunities.  
 
We have entered Morocco, where we have acquired operatorship of a large and highly prospective area of approximately 13,000 
square kilometres, encompassing both a near term opportunity to generate meaningful cash flow through the exploitation of the 
biogenic gas reservoirs in the Rharb Permit areas and longer term, higher risk/reward exploration opportunities in the Fes and 
Taounate Permit areas. 
 
We have increased our participation in the Chorbane Permit, onshore Tunisia, and have become operator of that acreage, there-
by taking control of the direction and timing of the work programme. 
 
Finally, we have diversified beyond the MENA region by securing the award of two licences in Colombia that will, we anticipate, 
provide the Company with leveraged exposure to the exploration potential of two prolific oil producing basins. 
 
These developments are discussed in greater detail in the Chief Executive’s Report and the Operations Review. 
 
Following these initiatives, the Company remains well funded, with free cash balances (after paying for the Moroccan acquisition) 
of approximately $68 million and no debt as of the date of writing this report. As you will imagine, the husbanding and optimum 
deployment of this cash is your Board’s single highest priority, pending the Company’s return to positive cash flow. All reasona-
ble efforts are being made and will continue to be made to contain expenditure.  
 
I am not going to offer hostages to fortune by making any prognostication, at this juncture, as to the timing of a return to produc-
tion in Block 26. All that I can usefully say in that regard is to echo the heartfelt wish of all reasonable people that the violence 
cease and some semblance of normality be restored to the lives of the people of Syria, who have suffered and continue to suffer 
so terribly. 
 
As to the Company’s new initiatives, I am unashamedly enthusiastic. We now have before us some fine opportunities. I believe 
we know how to make the best of them. As a Board and senior management we have done it before, building the Syrian opera-
tion from scratch in little more than three years, and I see no reason why we should not repeat the trick given hard work, sensible 
commercial judgement and some reasonable luck, which latter is always an essential ingredient of success in the exploration 
business. The coming twelve months will be of crucial importance in proving my confidence well-founded. I can but hope that I 
will be writing to you with better news this time next year. 
 
It remains only for me to extend my personal gratitude and that of the Board to our long term shareholders, our loyal employees 
and our Block 26 joint venture partner, Sinochem, all of whom who have remained absolutely staunch in their support throughout 
these trying times. 
 
Yours sincerely

Chief Executive’s Report 
 
 
Gulfsands move into Morocco and Colombia is an exciting development for the Group as we re-establish ourselves as an 
active operator. 
 
Introduction 
Gulfsands has continued to focus its strategy on exploration and production efforts onshore in the Middle East-North African (“MENA”) 
region where our strengths and expertise lie.   During 2012 we evaluated a very large number of opportunities for investment, both 
within the MENA region and in certain other target countries that we considered complimentary to our skill set and that had the 
potential to generate real growth and significant shareholder value.  We set ourselves the target of consolidating our position in Tunisia 
and building a new non-Syrian leg to the business.  With the acquisition of Cabre Maroc in Morocco, the successful award of two 
permits in Colombia and operatorship onshore Tunisia, these objectives have now been achieved.   
 
The situation in Syria has unfortunately not improved during 2012 with the Company being precluded from operating in country by 
virtue of the military activity and European Union sanctions.  The safety of our Syrian staff is and has been a top priority and we 
continue to do whatever we can to provide security during this difficult period. 
 
In seeking new business opportunities, our strategy has been based around a two-pronged approach of pursuing significant interests 
in high materiality exploration projects together with opportunities generating near term cash flow in order to sustain our ongoing 
general, administrative and some exploration costs.  This search included possible farmins, applications for new acreage and 
corporate transactions.    
 
Morocco 
In December 2012 we announced that agreement had been reached with Caithness Petroleum Limited to acquire their wholly owned 
subsidiary, Cabre Maroc Limited. This transaction completed in early January 2013 and delivers to the Group, operatorship of a large 
contiguous and highly prospective onshore acreage position of 13,352 km
2
, with two very distinct components.  Firstly, potential for 
high impact oil discoveries in a thrust and folded tectonic environment within a proven petroleum system, and secondly, an established 
business of gas exploration with near term production potential. The total consideration for this transaction was $19.0 million in cash 
plus an agreement to fund up to $11.0 million of Caithness’s remaining exploration commitments. 
 
Our first goal in Morocco will be to bring forward, as soon as possible the discovery, production and commercialisation of gas, ideally 
within the second half of the year.  The prospects are shallow biogenic gas accumulations identified on seismic data as “bright spots” 
in the Rharb Centre Permit that, although characteristically small, can be brought into production relatively inexpensively and 
commercialised relatively quickly.  We anticipate generating our first revenue stream from this country entry as early as the last quarter 
of the year.  A new 3D seismic survey is also planned to be acquired this year in order to mature additional drilling targets for 2014 and 
beyond. 
 
An active exploration programme is also planned in the Fes Permit during 2013 and 2014 where a number of potentially large 
structures have been identified, based on the application of new technology (Full Tensor Gravity), lying adjacent to existing oil fields.  
We are in advanced discussions with contractors to commence 2D seismic acquisition of approximately 600 line km of data in 2013 
and a further 400 line km in 2014. Once this data has been acquired and interpreted we anticipate that it should be possible to mature 
three or four drillable prospects, one of which is likely to be drilled in 2014 and two drilled in 2015.  In the event of success, the 
Taounate Permit provides a very significant extension of the play fairway.  
 
Colombia 
In 2012, the Group participated in the Ronda 2012 bid round in Colombia and was successful in acquiring 100% interest in two frontier 
permits located in prospective areas on trend with existing oil discoveries.  This move, beyond the core area of the MENA region, 
maintains our focus on attractive oil prospects with attractive fiscal terms, in addition to providing an element of country risk 
diversification to the exploration portfolio.   We are currently in negotiations with a number of parties to join us in a consortium to 
explore these permits.   
 
Tunisia 
In November 2012 agreements were reached with ADX Energy Limited, Xstate Resources Limited and Verus Investments Limited to 
extend the Group’s interests in the Chorbane, Kerkouane and Pantelleria permits. The total consideration for these transactions was 
approximately $1.15 million plus an agreement to fund ADX’s remaining share of a seismic survey to be carried out in the onshore 
Chorbane Permit during 2013.  
 
Subject to government approval in Tunisia, which is expected imminently, we hold a 70% operated interest in the Chorbane Permit 
and 40% interest in both the offshore Kerkouane and Pantelleria permits.   
 
Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate value adding opportunities in Tunisia and, to this end, announced a strategic 
alliance with Rift Basin Resources to jointly pursue new projects in Tunisia and more generally across the MENA region. Under the 
terms of this alliance, Gulfsands has the opportunity to participate in any such projects at up to 70% equity and to act as operator. 
 
Syria 
The Syrian government’s General Petroleum Corporation (“GPC”) has during the year, intermittently produced minor quantities of oil 
from our fields in Block 26, but otherwise the fields have been shut in and remain in good order.  Although we have not conducted any 
operations during the year in full compliance with European Union sanctions, we have continued to maintain a presence in Syria and 
employ the majority of our Syrian staff throughout this difficult period as we believe the situation will be resolved in due course, at 
which time the Company will be able to resume operations.  We are using the skill set available amongst our workforce in Syria to 
assist in the establishment of our new business in Morocco, with the secondment of selected staff members.

Financial Performance 
The Group has endured a difficult period since the implementation of sanctions against the oil industry in Syria and this year recorded 
a loss of $27.0 million and a cash outflow from operations of $14.6 million. During 2012 we have focused on reducing the rate of cash 
burn and we will continue to keep a tight grip of overheads to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from the Group’s cash 
resources through exposure to exploration. 
 
We anticipate that the Group’s performance will improve during 2013 and with the cash on hand at 31 December 2012 our future 
exploration obligations for 2013 and beyond are fully funded. We do not preclude the option of raising further capital, either through 
equity or debt, in the near future should the need and opportunity arise.   
 
Outlook 2013 and Beyond 
The entry into Morocco and Colombia and operatorship onshore Tunisia will result in a busy year ahead, with emphasis on acquiring 
seismic and gravity data in addition to the drilling of at least five exploration wells in the Rharb Centre Permit.  2014 will also be an 
active year as we aim to drill up to seven exploration wells in our Moroccan and Tunisian permits.  
 
The move into Morocco and Colombia is an exciting development for the Group as we re-establish ourselves as an active operator 
with exploration acreage we believe has the potential to mirror elements of the technical success that we achieved in Syria.  The 
Group has no debt and is well funded with cash resources of $91 million at 31 December 2012.  We are now well positioned to use our 
existing resources to deliver real growth and significant value for shareholders.

Morocco 
Operations Review 
Gulfsands is the operator of a portfolio of exploration licences 
covering 13,352 km2 of northern Morocco 
 
Description 
 
In December 2012 Gulfsands announced that it had reached agreement with the Caithness Petroleum Limited group to acquire its 
shareholding in Cabre Maroc Limited. Cabre Maroc is the operator of several exploration and exploitation permits in northern 
Morocco and has also reached agreement with l’Office National des Hydrocarbures at des Mines (“ONHYM”) for the award of a 
Petroleum Agreement including exploration permits covering a further 9,037km
2
 in respect of the Taounate region. The Taouante 
permits remain subject to formal approval from the relevant governmental authorities. The transaction completed on 16 January 
2013. 
 
Rharb Permits 
 
The Rharb Centre Permit lies within a foreland basin (Rharb Basin). Contained within the basin are discrete turbidite channel and fan 
sands of Upper Miocene age that provide excellent reservoirs for biogenically sourced natural gas accumulations (99% methane). 
Thirteen exploration wells have been drilled by previous owners of Cabre Maroc Limited on the permit and nine of them were gas 
discoveries. Five wells have since been completed as producers and successfully run on Extended Production Tests. 
 
A Competent Person's Report on the Rharb Permits prepared by Senergy Oil & Gas Limited for Cabre Maroc in July 2012 reported 
2P reserves of 0.6 billion standard cubic feet ("bscf"), 2C contingent resources of 1.4 bscf and P50 prospective resources of 24.4 
bscf.  
 
Within the immediate vicinity of the Rharb Permits, there is existing demand for the sale of natural gas to local industry, made 
possible by access to an existing network of gas pipelines which transect the license area. It is therefore anticipated that revenues 
from the sale of gas discovered, developed and produced will begin to be received by the fourth quarter of 2013. Current 
development plans suggest that production by 2015 could average approximately 9 million standard cubic feet per day ("mmscf/d") 
and be expected to continue at that level for at least four years. 
 
Further, these natural gas accumulations are typically identified through analysis of seismic amplitude data and particularly high 
geologic success rates have been achieved when drilling locations have been identified utilising 3D seismic data. A 3D seismic 
survey of approximately 300 km
2
 has been recently acquired by Caithness over part of the Rharb Centre Permit and processing of 
these data is anticipated to be completed by April 2013. An extensive drilling programme, of up to nine exploration wells, is therefore 
planned for 2013 and 2014 on prospects delineated by the new 3D seismic data.  
 
Individual gas prospects are relatively modest in terms of reserves but are generally located at quite shallow drilling depths (500 – 
1,500 m) such that drilling and completion costs, particularly in a multi-well programme, are also relatively modest at approximately 
$3.0 million (gross) per well. As the natural gas produced is almost pure methane, minimal surface processing is required and cycle 
time from discovery to production can generally be measured in weeks rather than years.  
 
Fes and Taounate Permits 	
 
These permits lie within a fold and thrust belt domain. To date, both permits have seen only very limited exploration with only one 
well having been drilled on the Fes Permit, which was drilled off-structure and had limited gas shows. Immediately west of the Fes 
Permit are several small and apparently depleted oil fields that had produced light oil at commercial rates. The primary reservoir for 
these fields is the Haricha Formation, a deltaic sandstone of late Jurassic age which exhibits good reservoir characteristics. Oil 
seeps have also been identified on or near both permit areas.  
 
Gulfsands is preparing plans for an intensive exploration programme on the Fes Permit commencing in Q3 2013 with the acquisition 
of approximately 600 line km of 2D seismic data in order to identify potential drilling locations on some of the dozen or so leads 
previously identified by utilising existing Full Tensor Gravity data as well as legacy seismic data. Following evaluation of the 2D 
seismic data, the Company anticipates the drilling of at least three exploration wells within this permit area, commencing during 
2014. 
 
Exploration success on the Fes Permit is expected to have a significant and positive impact on projected levels of activity undertaken 
within the contiguous Taounate permits.

Plans for 2013 
 
Following completion of the Cabre Maroc acquisition on 16 January 2013 the Company has moved to accelerate the work 
programme previously proposed for the Rharb Permit. 3D seismic data acquired in Q4 2012 is being interpreted to allow the 
Company to select several drilling locations for its biogenic gas exploration programme. Negotiations have commenced to enable 
the Company to mobilise a rig to Morocco during H1 2013. It is anticipated that at least five wells could be drilled in the initial 
2013 drilling campaign with the belief that further prospects may be identified for subsequent campaigns. If success is achieved, 
the Company will move to complete and tie back the wells and commence production as quickly as possible, anticipated to be 
within a period of months of discovery. 
 
On the Fes Permit the Company is in advanced negotiations to commence the acquisition of approximately 600 line km of 2D 
seismic data. This programme is expected to commence in the second half of 2013.  
 
Negotiations continue with ONHYM to conclude the award of the Taounate Permit. Once this award is formalised, which is 
anticipated to be during H1 2013, the Company proposes a 10,000 line km Full Tensor Gravity survey.    10 | Page 
 
Tunisia & Italy 
Operations Review 
Gulfsands has interests in two exploration permits in Tunisia and one 
in southern Italy 
 
Description 
 
Gulfsands has an operated interest in the Chorbane permit and non-operated working interests in an exploration permit in 
Tunisia (the Kerkouane Permit) and one exploration permit in Southern Italy (G.R15.PU) as a result of a farm-in in May 2010. 
During 2012 the Group increased its participation in the Chorbane Permit from 40% to 70% and in the Kerkouane and G.R15.PU 
permits from 30% to 40%, subject to certain regulatory approvals. The operator of the Kerkouane and G.R15.PU permits is ADX 
Energy Ltd, an Australia based independent E&P company.  
 
Chorbane Permit – Onshore Tunisia (Gulfsands: 70%) 
 
The Chorbane Permit is located in central Tunisia and covers an area of approximately 1,942 km². The permit is surrounded by 
several producing oil fields and extensive oil & gas infrastructure. A number of prospects and leads have been identified within 
the permit, and following the Company’s increased participation and assumption of operatorship it is intended to commence a 
seismic acquisition programme during 2013. The minimum work obligation includes the drilling of one exploration well to a depth 
of at least 2,500m. The current exploration term is set to expire in July 2015. 
 
Kerkouane Permit – Offshore Tunisia (Gulfsands: 40%) 
G.R15.PU (Pantelleria) Permit – Offshore Italy (Gulfsands: 40%) 
 
The Kerkouane Permit is located offshore north east of Tunisia and G.R15.PU is located off the island of Pantelleria south west 
of Sicily in Italian waters. The two permits are contiguous and comprise a total area of approximately 3,700 km
2
. The Kerkouane 
exploration permit has been extended to February 2014 while the G.R15.PU permit remains suspended pending application to 
the Italian government for the permit to be reactivated. The Kerkouane block is governed by a Tunisian PSC, whilst the 
Pantelleria block is governed by an Italian tax/royalty structure. 
 
The Kerkouane Permit contains the Dougga gas/condensate discovery made by Shell in 1981, which is estimated to comprise mean 
raw GIIP of 618 bcf. 640 km² of 3D seismic was acquired in 2010. The Lambouka-1 well was drilled in 2010. Although wireline logs 
indicated the presence of gas and possibly condensate, it was not possible to safely recover fluid samples or pressure data from the 
formation, and the well was suspended. 
The minimum work obligation includes the drilling of one exploration well and the re-entry and testing of the Lambouka-1 discovery. 
 
Operations 
 
Chorbane 
 
The Sidi Dhaher-1 well was drilled to a depth of 2,011 m Measured Depth (“MD”) in 2011 and wire-line logs acquired over a 
1,012 m interval. Formation pressure measurements indicated the presence of a possible oil column commencing at a depth of 
1,156 m MD within a late Cretaceous aged reservoir, and wireline fluid samples recovered yielded a mix of drilling mud filtrate 
and movable oil. The well was then suspended pending testing.  A test rig was mobilised during May 2012 and a full testing 
programme was conducted during June 2012. Following the drilling out of the safety plug within the previously suspended well, 
two separate intervals within the Bireno Formation were perforated and flow tested. A 5m section within the deeper Bireno 
Dolomite interval was perforated between 1,174-1,179m MD together with a 16m section in the shallower Bireno Limestone 
interval between 1,155 and 1,171m MD.  
 
Approximately 90 barrels of fluid were recovered which were identified as most likely consisting of a mixture of drilling mud filtrate 
and possibly formation water. The efficient recovery of these fluids during the test suggests that they were sourced from the 
deeper Dolomite interval. Although a large volume of fluids had been lost to the formation whilst drilling and in preparation for the 
test, and the total volume had not yet been recovered during the flow test, the Joint Venture participants agreed to plug off the 
deeper Bireno Dolomite section and test only the shallower Bireno Limestone section in isolation. 
 
After performing a cement squeeze to close the perforations over the deeper Bireno Dolomite interval, and the setting of a bridge 
plug within the well-bore and between the Bireno Dolomite and the Bireno Limestone intervals, a flow test of the Bireno 
Limestone interval commenced. Prior to acid stimulation of the reservoir, no liquid flow from the Bireno Limestone was observed 
and an acid stimulation was undertaken.  
 
Following completion of the acid stimulation, the well was flow tested, with the benefit of nitrogen lift and approximately 680 
barrels of fluid were recovered over a flow test period of 35 hours. The initial interpretation from the well site was that the 
recovered fluid was a mixture of spent acid, drilling mud filtrate and formation water. 
 
The Sidi Dhaher-1 well has subsequently been plugged and abandoned.  
 
   11 | Page 
 
 
 
 
On 23 November 2012 the Company announced that it had reached agreement to acquire additional participating interests in the 
Chorbane permit totalling an additional 30% from ADX Energy Limited, Verus Investments Limited and Xstate Resources Limited 
for a total consideration of $1.15 million plus an agreed carry of approximately $0.6 million for a seismic study to be conducted 
during 2013. Additionally ADX Energy Limited farmed down a further 15% to Rift Basin Resources Limited, subject to govern-
mental approval. The Company assumed operatorship of the Chorbane permit in February 2013. 
 
Kerkouane 
 
During 2012, the Kerkouane Joint Venture continued to reprocess data from previously acquired 2D seismic survey and 
continued with various geological and geophysical studies, incorporating the results of the Lambouka-1 well into the regional 
geological framework in order to identify further leads. The most promising lead is the West Dougga structure. West Dougga is a 
fault-supported four way dip closure with both Tertiary and Cretaceous aged reservoir targets. 
 
The Joint Venture is also currently in discussions with the authorities in Tunisia regarding potential fiscal options for progressing 
the development of the existing Dougga gas/condensate discovery. 
 
 
Plans for 2013 
 
On the Chorbane permit, geological and geophysical studies and seismic data reprocessing are being undertaken to evaluate 
the exploration potential of the block. A further 2D seismic acquisition programme is being designed and it is anticipated that this 
will commence during H1 2013.The estimated cost to the Company during 2013 will be $2 million. 
 
In the Kerkouane permit, pending satisfactory resolution of the discussions regarding the fiscal terms, plans for the minimum 
work commitment exploration well will be put in place and drilling could possibly commence during 2013. The Joint Venture is 
also assessing options for the permanent abandonment of the Lambouka-1 well.

Syria 
Operations Review 
Gulfsands is the operator of the Block 26 Production Sharing Contract 
with a 50% working interest. The contract is currently in force majeure 
as a result of the EU sanctions against Syria 
 
Description 
 
Gulfsands is the operator of the Block 26 Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) with a 50% working interest; the other 50% interest is 
held by Sinochem. Block 26 covers an area of 5,414 km². The PSC grants rights to explore, develop and produce from all depths 
outside the existing field areas and from the deeper stratigraphic levels only within the pre-existing discovered field areas. The final 
exploration period of the PSC expired in August 2012 but it is anticipated that an extension to this date will be granted once 
sanctions are lifted. 
 
There are two producing oil fields of Cretaceous age within the PSC area, Khurbet East and Yousefieh. In addition, two further oil 
and gas discoveries of Triassic age lie beneath the Cretaceous oil producing reservoir in the Khurbet East field, within the 
Butmah and Kurrachine Dolomite formations, for which development approval has been granted. 
 
The development and operation of these fields has been undertaken by Dijla Petroleum Corporation (“DPC”), a joint operating 
company formed between Gulfsands, Sinochem and the General Petroleum Corporation (“GPC”) for this purpose, to which staff of 
both Gulfsands and GPC had been seconded. Since the imposition of sanctions against GPC on 1 December 2011, which led to the 
subsequent declaration of force majeure under the PSC, Gulfsands has had no involvement with the operations of DPC and 
Gulfsands staff seconded to DPC have been withdrawn, leaving DPC to be run by its GPC secondees. 
 
The Khurbet East field was discovered in June 2007, and commercial development approval was granted in February 2008 for 
the Cretaceous Massive Formation and Triassic Kurrachine Dolomite formations. Oil production from the Cretaceous Massive 
Formation commenced in July 2008. The Yousefieh field was discovered in November 2008, commercial development approval 
was granted in January 2010, and oil production commenced in April 2010, also from the Cretaceous Massive Formation.  
 
The original discovery well at Yousefieh is located approximately 3 km away from the Early Production Facility (“EPF”) at Khurbet 
East. The development and production period for the Khurbet East Cretaceous Massive and Triassic Kurrachine Dolomite 
formations expires in February 2033, and that for the Yousefieh field in January 2035, but each may be extended for a further 10 
years at the Contractor’s option. 
 
The crude oil produced from Khurbet East has an API gravity of approximately 25°, slightly lighter than that of the area benchmark 
“Syrian Heavy” crude oil. Oil produced from Yousefieh is similar to that from Khurbet East, with an API gravity of 23–24°. Until the 
declaration of force majeure the oil was transported, via pipeline, to the GPC-operated gathering facilities located some 30 km away 
at Tel Addas, before being blended with the Syrian Heavy crude oil, and transported to the Mediterranean port of Tartous using 
GPC’s oil handling infrastructure. 
 
Approval for the development of the Khurbet East Triassic Butmah oil and gas field was granted in December 2011 but no work 
has been done on the required infrastructure due to the imposition of sanctions. Oil from the Triassic formations in Khurbet East 
has been sampled and has been found to be lighter than that produced from the Cretaceous Formation, with an API gravity of 
34–35°, and it contains a higher gas content. In addition, small amounts of condensate have been recovered from the gas cap in 
the Butmah Formation. The construction of sour gas sweetening and export facilities at Khurbet East is planned to enable 
commercial production of hydrocarbons both from the Butmah and also from the Triassic Kurrachine Dolomite formations. The 
development and production period for the Khurbet East Triassic Butmah Formation expires in December 2036, but may be 
extended for a further 10 years at the Contractor’s option. 
 
Operations 
 
Production 
 
The Company has not been involved with any production related activities since 1 December 2011. We do continue to monitor the 
performance of the fields and the condition of the surface infrastructure, where possible and safe to do so. Production since 1 
December 2011, being the date of imposition of sanctions against GPC, has been estimated in order to produce the following 
information. 
 
The Khurbet East Cretaceous Massive oil reservoir has produced at levels of up to 24,200 bopd (gross) during 2012 but has 
been shut in for substantial periods since the imposition of sanctions against the Syrian oil industry. The estimated gross average 
daily production from the reservoir has been 4,700 bopd during 2012. It is our understanding that the performance of the 
reservoir has continued to be excellent. Estimated gross production during 2012 was approximately 1.7 million barrels and as at 
the end of December 2012, it is believed that cumulative production from Khurbet East since inception was approximately 19.3 
million barrels. 
 
   13 | Page 
 
The gross production from the Yousefieh field during 2012 is estimated at 0.1 million barrels (220 bopd) with peak production of over 
3,500 bopd but it is believed that the field has produced for only 46 days during 2012. It is believed that as at the end of December 
2012, cumulative production from the Yousefieh field since inception was approximately 1.3 million barrels. 
 
It is believed that production from the Block 26 fields is being constrained as the normal export routes for the oil are not currently 
available to GPC. 
 
Development wells 
 
No development drilling was undertaken during 2012. 
 
Facilities 
 
Work on the central production facility at Khurbet East, contracted to Saipem, was suspended in December 2011 after Saipem 
declared force majeure under their contract as a result of EU sanctions. The project was still at the design stage, having been 
delayed already owing to the deteriorating situation in Syria.  
 
Exploration Programme 
 
In February 2012 the Company announced that it had decided to cease all further exploration in Syria in light of the effect of the 
EU sanctions and the impact these were having on the procurement of essential goods and services for exploration operations. 
The final exploration period of the Block 26 PSC expired in August 2012 but it is hoped that an extension to the exploration period 
can be negotiated with the Syrian authorities to replace that lost due to sanctions. 
 
The only activities of the Company in Syria during 2012 was the completion of the Khurbet East-102 Butmah appraisal well which 
was spudded in October 2011 on the northern flank of the Khurbet East field. An open hole DST conducted in January 2012 over 
a 48m interval in the Butmah section flowed wet gas at a rate of 10.7mmcfd with a 32/64” choke, with associated 524 bopd of 58° 
API condensate and with no formation water. The results were interpreted as signifying an oil reservoir with an overlying gas cap 
which also contains small volumes of condensate. The Kurrachine Dolomite section failed to flow oil in an open hole DST. 
 
In prior years the Company had drilled three wells that remain of interest to joint venture partners, Al Khairat, Wardieh and 
Twaiba. Additionally the Company is in possession of a substantial quantity of high quality 3D seismic data over the Block 26 
area that, it is hoped, will enable the Company to target further prospects should an extension to the exploration period be 
granted. The cost of all drilling and seismic acquisition has been written off in full. 
 
The Al Khairat exploration well, located 3.5km south-east of Yousefieh East, which completed drilling and testing in December 
2011 found a 29m net oil column in the Cretaceous Massive Formation. When tested open hole over a 26m interval with a 2” 
choke and under nitrogen lift it flowed 1,826 bopd of 22° API oil. Al Khairat is located outside the Yousefieh field DLA, but no 
application for commercial development approval has been made because of EU sanctions. 
 
The Wardieh exploration well, which completed drilling and testing in September 2011, targeted a combined structural and 
stratigraphic trap in formations of Cretaceous age. While drilling it encountered a zone of live asphaltic hydrocarbons overlying a 
porous reservoir zone, the combination of which caused the well to be plugged and abandoned for safety reasons within 271 m 
of its planned total depth. A comprehensive geological and operational review of the well will be completed once sanctions 
permit.  
 
The Twaiba exploration well, located 7km north of the Khurbet East field, was drilled during December 2010 to target Cretaceous 
aged reservoirs. There were significant indications of oil-bearing reservoirs based on oil & gas shows while drilling, whole core 
recovery, wireline log evaluation and down-hole pressure measurements. Only very high-salinity water and minor amounts of oil 
were recovered to surface during production testing in January 2011. The well was suspended and Special Core Analysis 
(“SCAL”) was conducted to further assess the well. The results of the SCAL will be interpreted once sanctions permit. 
 
 
Plans for 2013 
 
Following the declaration of force majeure on its PSC in December 2011 the Group no longer has any involvement in the 
operation of producing fields, or the development of discoveries, on Block 26, and no longer seconds staff, or supplies technical 
assistance, to DPC. In February 2012 the Company announced that it had decided to cease all further exploration in Syria in light 
of the effect of the EU sanctions and the effect these were having on the procurement of essential goods and services for 
exploration operations.  
 
A core staff remains in Syria engaged, for the time being at least, in conducting internal studies and analysing potential exploration 
prospects with a view to being in a position to resume exploration activity as and when sanctions are lifted, on the assumption that 
an extension in the exploration period (which expired in August 2012) can be negotiated with the Syrian authorities to replace that 
time lost due to the sanctions.

Colombia 
Operations Review 
Gulfsands is operator of two exploration licences in Colombia 
awarded in the Ronda 2012 bid round 
 
Description 
 
In late 2012 the Company was preliminarily awarded concessions in Colombia following the heavily subscribed Ronda 2012 bid 
round. On 1 March 2013 the Company announced that it had finalised the award of two exploration and production agreements 
in Colombia covering licence areas referred to as Llanos Area 50 (“LLA50”) and Putumayo Area 14 (“PUT14”) in the Llanos and 
Caguan Putumayo Basins respectively. The licence areas are considered to be of a frontier nature and cover 513.7 km
2
 and 
463.6 km
2
. 
 
The Caguan Putumayo Basin is a portion of the larger geological province formed by the Marañon Basin in Peru and the Oriente 
Basin in Ecuador. Within the Putumayo basin reserves of 365 million barrels of oil and 305 bcf of gas have been reported in 
more than 35 fields. PUT14 does have analogous structures to those that have worked to the west of Block 12 and may have 
stratigraphic trap potential in addition.   
 
LLA50 is located in the south eastern part of the province which includes the giant Caño Limon field (1,020 mmbo) approximately 
100km to the north west. The block is interpreted to offer similar play types to the Putumayo area.   
 
The contracts are of a tax and royalty nature. Colombia has relatively attractive commercial terms for exploration and provides 
for rapid development in the case of exploration success. Sliding scale royalties are in the range 8-25% for oil and the corporate 
tax rate is 33%. As part of the bid the Company will also pay Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (“ANH”) a participation fee of 
6% in LLA 50 and 5% in the PUT14 area. 
 
Minimum work obligations for phase one of the licence term on the blocks are for 1line km of 2D seismic for every 5 km
2
 of the 
area plus one exploration well on each block. The programme must be conducted within three years. 
 
 
Plans for 2013 
 
The Company is looking to finalise discussions with potential joint venture partners imminently and proposed work programmes 
for the two blocks will be established. It is not anticipated that there will be significant operational activity within Colombia during 
2013.Negotiations are currently under way to form a consortium of companies to join Gulfsands in exploring these two 
concessions.

USA 
Operations Review 
Gulfsands continues to hold interests in a small number of non-
operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico 
 
Description 
 
Gulfsands owns a small portfolio of non-operated oil & gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico, in the shallow “shelf” region offshore 
Texas and Louisiana. These comprise interests in 13 leases containing five producing fields.  
 
The assets are mature and deemed to be non-core to the business. Proved & Probable reserves at year-end 2012 amounted to 
1.5 million boe on a working interest basis (1.3 million boe on a net revenue interest basis), comprised 68% of oil and 32% of 
gas. 
 
Operations 
 
Production on a working interest basis, including Natural Gas Liquids (“NGLs”), averaged 311 boepd in 2012, compared with 410 
boepd in 2011. The composition of this production was 50% oil, 46% gas and 4% NGLs. After tax and royalties, net interest 
production in 2012 was 239 boepd (2011: 323 boepd). The Company is currently producing from five properties. 
 
In September 2011 the Company had sold a package of properties with an effective date of 1 June 2011. When excluding these 
properties from the 2011 working interest production the underlying production for the retained properties in 2011 was 322 boepd.  
 
At Eugene Island 32, Gulfsands continued to participate in the reprocessing of 3D data to optimise further field development and 
identify new drill opportunities.  
 
Recompletions were undertaken of the Ship Shoal 249 D5, Vermilion 225 B5 and West Delta 64 C1 wells leading to incremental 
increases to Proved and Probable working interest reserves of approximately 175,000 boe. The cost of these operations to 
Gulfsands was less than $300,000. 
 
Decommissioning projects continued on various properties, most significantly High Island A 561 where the operator had 
substantial difficulties with permanently abandoning several wells. These problems have now been resolved and platform 
abandonment is on-going. The decommissioning of the South Marsh Island 243 property was completed at a lower cost than 
anticipated. The Company retains liabilities for decommissioning 13 properties.  
 
Plans for 2013 
 
Gulfsands intends to continue efforts to divest the remaining Gulf of Mexico assets in 2013, provided that it is able to negotiate 
realistic prices. In the absence of a sale, the Company will continue to retain its interests and manage the properties in order to 
maximise any future potential cash flow.

Reserves Report 
 
Reserves and Contingent Resources 
The Group’s reserves and contingent resources at 31 December 2012 are based on estimates made by management and 
reviewed by independent petroleum engineers. For the Syrian and Tunisian assets the review was performed by Senergy Oil and 
Gas Limited (“Senergy”) (2011: Senergy), and for the USA by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc (“NSAI”) (2011: NSAI). The 
reserves and contingent resources below do not include Morocco as the transaction completed in January 2013.  
 
Reserves 
The reserves are categorised into Proved, Probable and Possible reserves in accordance with the 2007 Petroleum Resources 
Management classification system of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”). Definitions for Proved, Probable and Possible 
reserves are contained in the Glossary. 
 
Working interest reserves in Syria represent the proportion, attributable to the Group’s 50% participating interest, of forecast 
future hydrocarbon production during the economic life of the Block 26 PSC, including the share of that production attributable to 
General Petroleum Corporation (“GPC”). In assessing the reserves it has been assumed that: 
(a) the force majeure condition is lifted with effect from 1 January 2014 and Gulfsands resumes its role as operator; 
(b) all Gulfsands’ rights under the PSC are preserved and no change is made to the economic terms thereof; and  
(c) the option is exercised to extend the development period of each field for a further 10 years after its initial 25 year 
development period has expired.  
 
It should be noted that these assumptions are highly subjective and their outcome is impacted by events beyond the Group’s 
control, including the timing and circumstances of the eventual lifting of the EU sanctions against Syria and the actions of any new 
government in Syria which may ultimately replace the one currently in power.

NB: Certain figures may not add up due to roundings. 
 
Working interest reserves in the USA represent the proportion, attributable to the Group’s participating interests, of forecast future 
hydrocarbon production during the economic life of the properties in question, before deduction of state production taxes and 
overriding royalty interests. Working interest reserves have been derived from the net revenue interest reserves data contained in 
the NSAI report, by grossing up for the percentage production tax and royalty “burden” applicable to each property. The reserves-
weighted average burden at 31 December 2012 was 19% (2011: 20%). 
 
Entitlement reserves in Syria represent the Group’s estimated share of working interest reserves after deducting the share of 
forecast future production attributable to GPC. This proportion is impacted by assumptions as to future development expenditure 
and future oil prices. For the calculation as at 31 December 2012 the average price of Brent crude was assumed to be $105/bbl 
in 2013, $100/bbl in 2014, $95/bbl in 2015 and constant $90/bbl thereafter. It has been assumed that the oil sold from the Syrian 
production is sold at a 12% discount to Brent. The gas prices are linked, through the PSC, to oil prices. 
 
Entitlement reserves in the USA represent the Group’s estimated net revenue interest reserves after deduction of the 
equivalent share of hydrocarbon production attributable to state production taxes and overriding royalty interests. 
 
Contingent Resources 
Contingent Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known 
accumulations by the application of development projects, but are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one 
or more contingencies. Contingent Resources are further categorised by the SPE into 1C, 2C and 3C according to the level of 
uncertainty associated with the estimates: these categories correspond broadly to the Proved, Proved & Probable, and Proved, 
Probable & Possible categorisations for Reserves.

Financial Review 
Selected operational and financial data 
 
 
Market conditions 
Brent crude prices started and finished the year at approximately $111/bbl with a peak of $125/bbl in March and a low of $89/bbl 
in May.  The benchmark averaged approximately $112/bbl (2011: $111/bbl)  
 
West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) has continued to trade at a substantial discount to Brent averaging $18/bbl with a peak 
discount of approximately $27/bbl in October 2012. The majority of the production from the Group’s US assets is linked to the 
price of WTI with an adjustment to reflect the price of Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) which more closely tracks Brent crude 
prices.  The Group’s gas production in the US is linked most closely to Henry Hub prices which have traded in the range 
$1.8/mcf to $3.8/mcf with an average price of $2.7/mcf during 2012 (2011: $4.0/mcf).

Acquisition in Morocco 
 
On 19 December 2012 the Group announced an agreement with Caithness Petroleum Limited group to acquire Cabre Maroc 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary and operator of an extensive portfolio of highly prospective oil & gas licences and gas 
exploitation concessions covering an area of 13,352 km
2
 in northern Morocco.  The acquisition was completed on 16 January 
2013.  The total cash consideration was $19.0 million plus an agreement to fund up to $11.0 million of Caithness’s remaining 
exploration commitments.  No data related to Cabre Maroc Limited is included in the Financial Statements of the Group for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 other than in note 6.6. 
 
Morocco Market Conditions 
 
Morocco is one of the most fiscally favourable countries worldwide to explore and is generally regarded as having a low risk 
political environment. It is Africa’s 2
nd
 largest importer of hydrocarbons importing 99% of oil and 91% of gas. The gas price is 
very favourable - in excess of $8/mcf. The country has infrastructure available for the delivery of hydrocarbons to market 
 
Morocco fiscal terms summary 
 
 
State participation 25% maximum, exercised after commercial discovery.  Contractor carries 
ONHYM through exploration.  
Oil royalty 10% 
Royalty free production 300,000 tonnes of oil from each exploitation concession 
Gas royalty 5% 
Royalty free production 300 million m
3
 of gas from each exploitation concession 
Corporation tax 30% 
Tax holiday Ten years from the date of regular production of each exploitation concession 
 
 
Accounting treatment of Syria 
 
As disclosed in the Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 and described in note 5.9 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and in the section on Sanctions Compliance the Group considers that it has temporarily lost 
the ability to manage, control or participate in the operations of Dijla Petroleum Company, the entity established in Syria, 
pursuant to the PSC, to administer the Syrian oil & gas production assets, and to benefit (in conjunction with the rights granted 
by the PSC itself) from the production from its fields in Block 26, Syria (“DPC”). The Group’s share of the net assets and liabilities 
of DPC were derecognised as at 1 December 2011, the date on which the EU listed General Petroleum Corporation (“GPC”) as 
an entity subject to an asset freeze and the results of the suspended operations for 2011 are  shown separately at the bottom of 
the Income Statement. In accordance with IAS 39 – “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” the Group has then 
recognised a fair value for its net investment in DPC. This value reflects a subjective assessment of the financial consequences 
of the EU’s sanctions on the Group’s interest in DPC and is not, nor is it intended to be, an estimate of the Directors’ view of the 
long-term value of its Syrian operations once the present situation in Syria is resolved.  
 
The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of DPC at 31 December 2012 and consider that its fair value for inclusion in the 
financial statements at that date is not significantly different from the value recorded at 31 December 2011. 
 
In 2011 the Group impaired its share of outstanding crude oil receivables from production in Block 26 and recorded an impairment 
loss on its remaining exploration & evaluation assets in Syria. This impairment of the exploration & evaluation assets is not related 
to geological conditions but is as a direct result of it becoming illegal for an EU entity to provide economic resources to GPC.  It is 
presently unclear whether the Group will be able to pursue commercial development applications for successful discoveries, 
including Al Khairat, in the manner contemplated by the PSC.

Group financial statements 
Income Statement 
The Group reported a net loss after tax in 2012 of $27.0million (2011: profit $55.1 million). Excluding all Syrian operations, the 
loss for the period was $22.4 million (2011: $26.3 million). The decreased loss is due  to 2011 including the write off of the 
Lambouka-1 well, offshore Tunisia ($13.8 million) partially offset by the 2012 write off of Sidi Dhaher well, onshore Tunisia ($7.1 
million), $6.6 million gains on US asset disposals in 2011 and $2.1 million reduction in administration costs. 
 
Revenues from sales of hydrocarbons reduced by 95% to $5.6 million (2011: $124.9 million). The Group’s entitlement 
production, including NGLs, dropped by 93% from 3,494 boepd to 239 boepd primarily because no revenue has been recorded 
in Syria since 1 December 2011. In 2012 the average price achieved for the Group’s crude oil sales was $102.1/bbl (2011: 
$101.2/bbl), an increase of 1%. Revenue was 84% from crude oil (2011: 95%) 13% from gas (2011: 4%) and approximately 3% 
(2011: 1%) from NGLs. 
 
Depletion charges dropped to $1.4 million (2011: $13.8 million) in line with the fall in entitlement production. Impairment charges 
increased to $0.6 million (2011: $0.1 million). Other cost of sales fell 60% to $4.9 million (2011: $12.4 million). 
 
Administrative expenses (including depreciation) decreased to $18.5 million (2011: $26.1 million) principally due to a $5.4 million 
reduction to expenditure in Syria. 
 
Costs of unsuccessful exploration & evaluation efforts of $7.1 million (2011: $22.5 million) were written off principally  in respect 
of the Sidi Dhaher (onshore Tunisia) well, (2011: Lambouka well $13.8 million, Syria Block 26 wells $8.8 million). In 2011an 
impairment charge of $10.0 million was incurred against the remaining exploration & evaluation assets in Syria given that it is 
unclear whether the Group will be able to pursue further applications for commercial development in the manner contemplated 
by the PSC. There was no significant corresponding charge in 2012.

Cash Flow 
Cash consumed by operations was $14.6 million (2011: $94.0 million cash generated). The Group had delayed payment of 
certain suppliers at year end 2011 whilst it reviewed the implications of the imposition of sanctions, a situation that resulted in 
payments during 2012 for operations of $1.8 million and for capital expenditure of $6.3 million. At 31 December 2012 $4.2 million 
of creditors are still unpaid as payment of these obligations would contravene EU sanctions. Excluding these items $0.6 million 
was consumed from an increase in working capital (2011: $3.0 million generated). 
 
$7.8 million (2011: $22.9 million) was expended on exploration and evaluation activities in Tunisia and $0.3 million (2011: $20.5 
million) on oil & gas development assets. $1.0 million was spent on other tangible assets and software (2011: $2.2 million). The 
Group paid $1.9 million to decommission assets in the Gulf of Mexico (2011: $5.1 million). $5.0 million was placed in escrow to 
guarantee bonds related to the acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited which was offset by releases from restricted cash balances of 
$1.1 million (2011: $11.2 million). The 2011 release from restricted cash is related to the disposal of a package of assets in the 
Gulf of Mexico and the associated decommissioning provisions.  
 
The exercise of options, less cash paid to buy back options issued, contributed $0.1 million (2011: $0.6 million) and $0.1 million 
was spent relating to a share buyback programme that terminated in December 2011 (2011: $13.0 million). 
 
The resultant net decrease in cash during the period was $33.3 million (2011: $43.6 million increase). 
 
As the Group has been unable to exploit its Syrian assets since the declaration of force majeure in December 2011 it is 
anticipated that the Group will consume cash at the operating level during 2013 but that by Q4 2013 the Morocco acquisition 
should begin to generate revenue.  The cash balance held is sufficient to fund the Group’s current operations under all 
reasonably foreseeable circumstances for substantially longer than the twelve months following the date of this report.

Financial position 
Despite the challenges provided by the situation in Syria, the Group remains in a strong financial position. At 31 December 2012 
the Group had cash balances of $91.0 million (2011: $124.2 million) of which $87.4 million ($111.8 million) was denominated in 
US Dollars and held in money market funds through UK regulated financial institutions. 
 
Long-term financial assets have increased to $7.8 million (2011: $4.0 million) primarily related to a $5.0 million financial 
guarantee placed in Morocco on behalf of Cabre Maroc. The provision for decommissioning held by the Group has increased 
slightly to $17.6 million (2011: $16.8 million), $15.3 million long-term (2011: $14.7 million) and $2.3 million short-term (2011: $2.1 
million).  
 
Review of business units 
Morocco 
 
On 19 December 2012 the Group announced an agreement with Caithness Petroleum Limited to acquire Cabre Maroc Limited, a 
wholly owned subsidiary and operator of an extensive portfolio of highly prospective oil and gas licences and gas exploitation 
concessions covering an area of 13,352 km
2
 in northern Morocco.  The acquisition was completed on 16 January 2013. 
 
Income statement 
As completion occurred after the financial year end no income statement impact of the acquisition is shown in 2012. 
 
Cash Flow 
Whilst the completion payments to Caithness related to the acquisition were made in 2013, a $5 million bond was provided by 
the Group in 2012 to ONHYM, the regulator of Morocco’s oil and gas sector. The bond relates to the future exploration 
commitments on the Rharb permits and should be cancelled immediately upon fulfilment of those commitments which is 
expected to occur in H2 2013. The Group provided collateral to a UK bank to guarantee this bond.   
 
 
Tunisia 
Income Statement 
Tunisian operations made a loss of $7.5 million (2011: $13.8 million) which was principally due to the write off of the Sidi Dhaher 
exploration well. Administrative expenses of $0.4 million were incurred as the Group increased its participating interests in the 
country and started the process of assuming operatorship of the Chorbane Permit. 
 
Cash Flow 
During the year $3.9 million (2011: $4.4 million) was spent on exploration activities. $2.4 million was spent in the Chorbane block 
where the Sidi Dhaher-1 well discovered a potential hydrocarbon column but did not flow hydrocarbons during testing, and was 
plugged and abandoned. In addition the Group paid $0.8 million to increase its share in both the Chorbane Permit (from 40% to 
70%) and the Kerkouane / Pantelleria areas (from 30% to 40%). A further $0.5 million will be paid upon final approval of the 
transactions and the Company will additionally provide a carried interest of approximately $0.6 million through a seismic 
acquisition programme on the Chorbane block to ADX Energy Limited.   
 
 
Syria 
Income Statement 
The group has not recognised any working interest production from Block 26 (2011: 8,133 bopd). The reduction in volumes is 
directly attributable to the derecognition of volumes produced by DPC.  
 
Administrative expenses including depreciation and amortisation were $4.2 million (2011: $9.6 million). The reduction in 
administrative expenses was principally attributable to reduction in staff and office costs in 2012 as the Group has endeavoured to 
save costs in recognition of the long term nature of the crisis. 
 
The net loss from the Syrian operations before adjustments relating to impairment of exploration and evaluation of assets 
following the imposition of sanctions, interest and taxation amounted to $4.5 million (2011: $82.7 million profit). 
 
In 2011 one-off costs associated with the imposition of EU sanctions against the Syrian oil industry amounted to $1.3 million 
comprising the impairment of exploration and evaluation assets of $10.0 million and a net accounting gain on the deconsolidation of 
the Group’s production assets and reinstatement at a fair value, taking into account the current exceptional circumstances in Syria 
and the consequential difficulty of predicting the timing of future activities in the country, of $8.7 million. The resultant net profit 
contribution to the Group from Syrian operations amounted to $81.4 million in 2011. 
  
Cash Flow 
Cash consumed by Syrian operations amounted to $9.7 million (2011: $104.2 million generated). No cash was received from oil 
sales in 2012 (2011: $114.1 million). The Group delayed payment of certain suppliers at year end 2011 whilst it reviewed the 
implications of the imposition of sanctions, resulting in 2012 cash payments for operations prior to the declaration of force 
majeure of $8.1 million. 
 
Capital expenditure amounted to $5.6 million (2011: $39.4 million) including development and inventory expenditure of $1.1 million 
(2011: $20.2 million) and exploration expenditure of $3.9 million (2011: $18.5 million), all of which related to the Group’s 2011 
activities, including the drilling of the Khurbet East-102 and Al Khairat wells and had been committed in advance of the introduction 
of sanctions on 1 December 2011. Payment of all amounts has been made in full compliance with the EU sanctions in place. 
   24 | Page 
 
 
Net cash outflows before financing activities amounted to $6.0 million (2011: $64.8 million inflow). No dividend was paid to the 
holding company (2011: $90.0 million). All funding of the Syrian operations is provided in proportionate shares by the Group and 
its joint venture partner, Emerald Energy plc, by way of non-interest bearing loans.  
 
 
USA 
Income Statement 
Production for the year from offshore USA assets averaged 239 boepd on a net revenue interest (“NRI”) basis (2011: 323 
boepd), a total reduction of 84 boepd. There were no disposals in the year although the Group did finalise the termination of its 
obligations for certain leases.  
 
The NRI production comprised 53% oil (127 bopd), 43% gas (610 mcf/d) and 4% NGLs (433 galls/d). The corresponding figures 
for 2011 were 52% oil (168 bopd), 43% gas (824 mcf/d) and 5% NGLs (728 galls/d). 
 
Average sales prices were $102.1/bbl for oil (2011: $103.0/bbl), $3.2/mcf for gas (2011: $4.0/mcf) and $1.1/gall for NGLs (2011: 
$1.4/gall). The majority of the Group’s production from offshore Gulf of Mexico is sold through contracts with prices linked to a 
combination of indices comprising WTI and a pricing differential based on LLS and then adjusted for transportation tariffs. During 
2012 the average of the WTI and LLS differential averaged $18/bbl (2011: $17/bbl).  
  
Depletion during the year was $1.4 million ($16.4/boe on an NRI basis) compared to $3.9 million ($32.9/boe) during 2011. The 
depletion charge is calculated asset by asset and is substantially affected by changes to the production mix and also any 
significant adjustments to decommissioning estimates. The average depletion rate of the Group’s remaining assets at 31 
December 2012 is approximately $19.5/boe on an NRI basis. Impairment charges of $0.6 million (2011: $0.1 million) were 
incurred, principally in respect of the East Cameron 160 lease where the operator has concluded no further economic production 
can be achieved following sanding up of the well bore. 
 
Other costs of sales of $4.6 million (2011: $6.4 million) included repair and workover costs of $2.0 million (2011: $3.0 million) and 
decommissioning costs in excess of provisions of $1.1 million (2011: $1.1 million). Excluding maintenance & repair costs, and 
adjustments to decommissioning expenses, underlying lease operating expenses amounted to an average of approximately 
$21/boe on a working interest basis (2011: $15/boe). 
 
Administrative costs were $1.9 million (2011: $2.8 million) and a recharge was made to reflect time spent on Group business 
development work in respect of 2011 and 2012 of $1.1 million (2011: nil).  Interest payable to Group undertakings was $3.7 
million (2011: $4.4 million) and amortisation of the decommissioning provision amounted to $0.5 million (2011: $0.6 million). 
 
Cash Flow  
The net cash inflow from US operations was $1.1 million (2011: $0.9 million). Included in the net cash inflow from operations was 
expenditure of $2.0 million (2011: $3.0 million) on repairs to assets.  
 
Development expenditure was $0.3 million (2011: $0.2 million) and $1.9 million (2011: $5.1 million) was spent on 
decommissioning assets.  
 
Key Performance Indicators 
 
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) provide a means of measuring our progress in delivering our strategic objectives and creating 
shareholder value. 
 
The KPIs mentioned below are inclusive of the Syrian production assets, which are currently suspended. The Board do not consider 
the KPIs below to be meaningful for the year ended 31 December 2012 due to the suspension of the Syrian producing assets and 
expect them to alter significantly during 2013 as the operations of the acquired business in Morocco commence during 2013.  
 
The KPIs are not necessarily GAAP measures.  
 
Working interest production 
 
 2012 2011 2010 
 -96% -18% +39% 
mmboe 0.1 3.1 3.8 
 
The key driver of cash generation. The working interest measure is preferred to entitlement production because the latter is impacted by the terms 
of production sharing agreements so is not representative of underlying operational performance. 
 
Outlook 
This measure is expected to increase as production from Morocco commences in H2 2013. 
 
Lifting cost per barrel (working interest) 
 
 2012 2011 2010 
 +1,127% -8% -32% 
$/boe 53.1 4.3 4.7 
 
The key measure of operating efficiency. Calculated as cost of sales excluding depreciation, impairment charges, dry hole costs, decommissioning 
costs and hurricane repair costs, divided by working interest production. 
 
Outlook 
Expected to decrease in 2013 as the lower lifting cost anticipated in Morocco dilutes the impact of the more expensive barrels in the Gulf of Mexico.  25 | Page 
 
 
Cash flow available for exploration 
 
 2012 2011 2010 
 -132% +65% +111% 
$MM (25.4) 78.9 47.7 
 
Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less net cash used in investing activities but excluding exploration and evaluation expenditure. 
This gives a measure of the cash flow available to the Group for exploration after investment in the development of its existing reserves, purchase of 
other fixed assets and payment of decommissioning costs. 
 
Outlook 
Once more likely to be negative in 2013 as the Group will not benefit from a full year of Moroccan production but will be subject to a full year of 
overheads. Expected to be positive by the end of 2013. 
 
Earnings per share 
 
 2012 2011 2010 
 -151% +25% +53% 
US cents (22.94) 44.8 35.9 
 
The standard measure of profit attributable to shareholders calculated on a diluted basis assuming the exercise of outstanding options. 
 
Outlook 
The loss per share is likely to decrease in 2013 as new production commences in Morocco. 
 
Underlying reserves growth 
3 year average rate + 20%
 
Percentage change 2012 2011 2010 
Annual rate -1% +40% +20% 
Three year average +20% +31% +20% 
 
The growth in proved and probable working interest reserves over the year after adding back production in that year. 
 
Outlook 
The Group targets to at least replace the year’s production with new reserves. 
 
Non-financial KPIs – Lost time incidents 
The number of incidents during the year which resulted in a loss of working time. 
 
There were no lost-time incidents in the years 2010 to 2012. 
 
Financial risk management 
The financial risks concerning the Group comprise pricing risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and access to capital. 
 
Pricing risk arises because all of the Group’s oil and gas production is sold under short term pricing arrangements and so the 
Group is exposed to movements in oil and gas prices. To date this exposure has not been hedged since the Board has taken the 
view that the Group’s cash flow has been sufficient to bear any reasonably foreseeable downturn in prices without affecting our 
core business. However this policy is kept under frequent review. 
 
Currency risk arises because the Group’s sales are denominated in US Dollars but a proportion of its expenses are in Euro and 
Sterling (head office costs). The risk is mitigated by retaining a proportion of our cash resources in these currencies. 
 
Liquidity risk concerns the Group’s ability to access funds to meet its obligations as they fall due. Our policy is to maintain 
sufficient cash balances and readily realisable investments for this purpose, given that the Group has no bank lines of credit 
available to it. Sums in excess of what is needed to meet near-term obligations are invested in a money market fund which holds 
a diverse portfolio of short-term financial instruments rated A1 or better, resulting in a greater spread of risk and an improved 
return compared with what we would otherwise be able to achieve.  
 
Access to capital depends on conditions prevailing in the equity market for independent E&P companies generally, and the 
sentiment among the Group’s shareholders in particular. The Group has sufficient resources to finance its current operations for 
the foreseeable future.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Our comprehensive approach to risk management aims to identify key risks as early as possible and to reduce or 
eliminate those risks to the greatest extent practicable. Through critical evaluation, the Board assesses each risk 
in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential adverse impact on our operations, employees, 
performance, assets and shareholder expectations. 
 
On 23 January 2012 by EU Regulation 55/2012 Dijla Petroleum Company (”DPC”) was added to the list of 
entities subject to the asset freezing regulations. The Group has continued to monitor sanctions applicable to its 
business in Syria but following the Group's declaration of force majeure over our production business in Block 
26 on 11 December 2011, there have been no further EU sanctions imposed against activities in Syria that 
impact upon the Group. Gulfsands continues to maintain a business presence in country and has retained a core 
staff in readiness for re‐entry to Syria as and when sanctions are lifted. Although the risk remains that Gulfsands 
may not be able to resume operatorship of the Block 26 PSC without any disruption or amendment to the terms 
of our PSC, there is a risk that the government may elect to re‐negotiate the terms of PSCs of international oil 
companies with operations in Syria, or may attempt to put existing licensed blocks out for re‐tender. Whilst in 
the case of Gulfsands at least, either such actions would amount to a breach of the terms of our PSC, the 
possibility of such an outcome cannot be discounted. 
 
The last annual risk review took place in November 2012 in which the following principal risks and uncertainties 
were identified. The risks have been grouped into operational, strategic, financial and external risks and are not 
set out in any order of priority and they do not comprise all the risks and uncertainties we face.

Sanctions Compliance 
Gulfsands is in full compliance with all sanctions imposed on Syria 
and takes no part in exploration or production activities, nor does it 
receive revenue from its assets in the country. Further, all interests 
with designated persons and entities have been frozen and 
relationships suspended 
 
The European Union (“EU”) sanctions imposed against Syria have continued to affect the Company. The following outlines the 
impact of those sanctions, and the measures taken by the Group to comply therewith. 
 
Summary of Legislation 
USA 
The USA has since the 2003 Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act had measures in place against Syria, 
to prohibit the export of certain goods and to block the property of certain persons. Whilst these measures did not impact Gulfsands 
directly, Mr Rami Makhlouf, with whom Gulfsands has had a relationship since the time of its entry into Syria in 2000, was in 2008 
designated by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) as a Specially Designated National pursuant 
to this legislation. 
 
EU 
On 9 May 2011, the EU Council adopted Regulation 442/2011 which, inter alia, froze the assets held or controlled by certain 
individuals and entities. Among the individuals in question was Mr Rami Makhlouf. The provision of funds or economic resources, 
directly or indirectly, to those on this list was prohibited. 
 
Subsequently several further Regulations  have added additional persons and entities to the list of those subject to the asset 
freeze. These included President Bashar Al-Assad, other members of his family, and certain relatives of Mr Rami Makhlouf and 
entities controlled or beneficially owned by him and his family (the “Makhlouf Interests”).  Throughout September 2011 and 
continuing through the remainder of the year,  the EU Council adopted further Regulations culminating on 1 December 2011 in 
an EU Council Decision to significantly increase sanctions against the oil industry in Syria.  Furthermore the 1 December 2011 
EU Council Decision added General Petroleum Corporation ("GPC") to the asset freeze list. 
 
EU Council adoption of Regulation 55/2012 on 23 January 2012 added Dijla Petroleum Company ("DPC") to the list of those 
subject to the asset freeze. 
 
On 10 July 2012 the United Kingdom enacted The Syria (Restrictive Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2012 (SI 2012 No. 
1755) which, for the first time, directly brought Gulfsands Petroleum Levant Limited, a company incorporated in the Cayman 
Islands, under the European sanctions net. This legislation has had no substantive impact however because Gulfsands 
Petroleum plc has, at all times, applied the relevant United Kingdom legislation as though it applied directly to its subsidiaries and 
affiliated undertakings.   
 
Relationship with Makhlouf Interests 
A full disclosure of the extent of the Group’s relationship with Mr Makhlouf and certain corporate entities in which Mr Makhlouf 
and other members of his family are involved was made in August 2011, and a copy of the press release may be found on 
Gulfsands’ website www.gulfsands.com.  
 
Compliance Measures Taken 
Gulfsands has from the outset taken extensive legal advice to ensure full compliance with the relevant sanctions. 
 
Immediately after the 9 May 2011 EU regulation, all payments to the Makhlouf Interests under existing commercial agreements 
were suspended, and additionally all voting, dividend and transfer rights pertaining to the shares in Gulfsands held by Al Mashrek 
Global Invest were suspended. 
 
Following the EU Council Decision of 1 December 2011, after taking legal advice and obtaining the agreement of Emerald En-
ergy (a subsidiary of Sinochem and its 50% working interest partner), Gulfsands on 11 December 2011 declared force majeure 
under the PSC on the grounds that it could no longer comply with its obligations while remaining compliant with UK law. This 
notice of force majeure has continued since that date and remains in force. 
 
   30 | Page 
 
With effect from 1 December 2011 Gulfsands has: 
 
 ceased to provide assistance to DPC in the form of seconded staff or indeed have any involvement with the day to day 
operations of DPC 
 recused itself from decisions taken by the DPC board 
 not submitted invoices for the Joint Venture’s entitlement share of oil production 
 exercised strict control over payment of outstanding invoices to ensure that (a) no payments were made to persons or entities 
who are included on the list of those subject to the asset freeze and (b) no payment was made which would constitute a 
transfer of economic resources to GPC or DPC 
 ceased (with effect from 18 January 2012, being the date of adoption of EU Regulation 36/2012) to enter into new contracts 
for the procurement of oil & gas related goods or services into Syria, or for associated technical assistance. 
 
The Group has not conducted any exploration or production activities in Syria since that date, other than the completion of the 
drilling of wells to TD that had been spudded before 1 December 2011, but retains a place of business in the country, and 
maintains a core staff as neither of these actions are precluded by the EU sanctions. The protracted nature of the suspension in 
operations has necessitated a review of staffing levels within Syria where the Group has had to release a proportion of its 
workforce.

Corporate Social Responsibility  
Our support for these programmes reflects our commitment to 
achieving high standards of corporate social responsibility and 
corporate governance. 
 
Notwithstanding Syria’s well publicised security issues and the challenges created by the broad and indiscriminate impact of the 
European Union’s (“EU”) sanctions on Syria, during 2012 the Company’s Corporate and Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiatives 
in Syria remained focused on assisting various organisations and community groups addressing  education and health issues 
affecting women and children and the disadvantaged members of society.  
  
With the support of our Block 26 partner Sinochem and the tremendous voluntary assistance provided by our highly committed 
staff at our offices in Syria and Lebanon, we have continued our work with the local communities near our facilities in Block 26 
and our CSR partner organisations working in and from Damascus and Qamishli. 
 
During the year we also undertook support for a number of new initiatives in and related to Iraq and following the Company’s 
recently announced entry into Morocco and acquisition of operatorship of the Chorbane Permit in Tunisia we have initiated an 
examination of CSR opportunities in those countries in cooperation with the energy sector regulators, ONHYM in Morocco and 
ETAP in Tunisia. 
 
Supporting Local Communities and Charitable Causes 
 
The EU’s sanctions on Syria necessitated a reduction in the level and scope of our financial and logistical support for the local 
communities and social and charitable organisations with which we have historically been engaged although the programmes 
and activities undertaken in the past year have remained generally consistent with our activities in prior years. 
 
Gulfsands continues to direct these efforts towards supporting programmes that aim to improve the health, welfare and 
prospects of children, women and the disadvantaged members of society and especially for people living within the north east 
region of Syria where our Khurbet East and Yousefieh projects are located.  
 
During 2012 we extended our support for the three elementary schools in villages local to our facilities at the Khurbet East and 
Yousefieh oil fields, with small renovation and building programmes and the replacement of a failed, critical water supply system. 
We also assisted the local communities to complete a substantial restoration and refurbishment project at the mosque in the 
village of Ali Agha which is a central feature in the lives of people of these communities.  
 
We are proud that we have been able to continue our CSR programmes to support education at these schools and to supply 
equipment for teaching programmes. Our support for the local community and these villages in particular is widely recognised 
across the region.  
 
We recognise and appreciate that the local communities with which we interact are actively engaged in providing security for 
themselves and the areas surrounding our facilities in Block 26. With this local support, security for our facilities and the area in 
general has remained remarkably stable.  
 
We are especially pleased to report that during the past year we have assisted the Al Buruni University Hospital’s paediatric 
oncology unit in Damascus to secure critical supplies of oncology pharmaceutical supplies to enable the continued treatment of 
young cancer patients receiving a range of critical treatments at the oncology unit. This BASMA sponsored facility remains 
Syria’s first and only dedicated paediatric oncology unit and has been able to continue to operate during the recent unrest in 
Syria with financial and logistical support provided by Gulfsands and Sinochem and the wonderful efforts of the large number of 
dedicated volunteers assembled by BASMA.  
 
While the recent unrest in Syria has made field work difficult during 2012, Gulfsands continued to support technical, academic 
and scientific scholarships related to the archaeological excavation of the ancient Urkesh Palace at the Tell Mozan near 
Qamishli, the largest city within Block 26. This important work is coordinated by the International Institute for Mesopotamian 
Area Studies (“IIAMS”). The Urkesh Palace is believed to have been the original home of the Hurrian Kings of Syria and built 
circa 2250 BC. 
 
Further details about this important work and the Gulfsands Urkesh Exploration Fund can be viewed at www.urkesh.org.  
 
In a similar vein to the Urkesh project in north east Syria, Gulfsands has also provided financial and administrative support to the 
Ur Region archaeology project in southern Iraq. This project, coordinated by Dr Jane Moon and a team of archaeologists from 
Manchester University, is focused on Tell Khaiber, near to the ancient city of Ur, near Nasiriyah, in Thi Qar province, southern 
Iraq.  
 
This project is just now getting underway as a result of Gulfsands’ support and from the pottery already collected on the surface it 
is evident that Tell Khaiber was occupied for over two thousand years, from about 4,000 to 2,000BC. The town appears to have 
enjoyed a long period of prosperity and satellite images show the presence of large public buildings confirming the importance of 
Tell Khaiber in antiquity. We look forward to following this excavation as it unearths more of Iraq’s important history. 
 
Gulfsands is widely recognised for its commitment to supporting the communities in which we operate. During 2013 we intend to 
expand our CSR activities to Morocco and Tunisia through working with volunteers and organisations pursuing worthy social 
objectives. We believe this work provides an important point of reference for our organisation when interacting with governments 
and pursuing new business opportunities and with the continued support of our shareholders and partners we expect to further 
build on our present record during the coming year.

Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
The business of oil and gas exploration involves a high degree of risk which a combination of experience, knowledge and careful 
evaluation may not be able to prevent. The Board has established a process for identifying and evaluating the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group and a summary of these risks and uncertainties, together with measures taken to mitigate them, is 
contained on pages 26 to 28. 
 
There are also significant risks arising due to the sanctions imposed on the Syrian oil and gas sector by the EU which are 
extensively described in the Chairman’s letter, the Chief Executive’s Report and the Financial Review. 
  
Suppliers’ payments policy 
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between 
the Company and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. The Company’s average 
creditors’ payment period at 31 December 2012 was 17 days (2011: 11 days).  
 
Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Gulfsands’ approach to financial risk management is described in the Financial Review on page 25 and in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 26 to 28. Further disclosure is made in note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and note 
6.2 to the Company Financial Statements including the Group and Company’s exposure to price, credit, liquidity and currency risk. 
 
Political and charitable donations 
There were no political contributions made by the Group during the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011. The Group has a 
policy of making social contributions in its areas of operations where it will impact directly in the local communities. Further 
details are included in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on page 31. Approximately $125,000 was provided to 
community programmes undertaken in Syria during 2012 (2010: $347,000) and a further $32,000 (2011: $15,000) was donated 
to other charitable causes outside Syria. 
 
Annual General Meeting

Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, financial performance, financial position and risks are set out in the Operations Review and the 
Financial Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and resources are detailed in these reviews 
and further details are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group has significant cash resources, no debt 
and, based on current predictions of expenditure, anticipates that it will have sufficient resources available to meet all committed 
expenditure for substantially longer than twelve months from the date of this report. After making appropriate enquiries and 
examining those areas which could give rise to financial exposure the Directors are satisfied that the Group and Company has 
adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future, despite the current uncertain economic environment. 
For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
 
Information to shareholders 
The Group has its own website (www.gulfsands.com) for the purposes of improving information flow to shareholders and 
potential investors. 
 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. 
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
 properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
The Directors confirm that the Financial Statements comply with the above requirements. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and the dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Statement of disclosure to the auditor 
So far as the Directors, at the time of approval of their report, are aware: 
 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
 each Director has taken steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.  
 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditor and that the Directors be authorised to fix their remuneration will be put to 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
 
By order of the Board

Directors’ Corporate Governance Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
Gulfsands Petroleum plc is committed to meeting high standards of corporate governance. The Directors are committed to 
maintaining throughout the Group the highest standards of business conduct and ethics, as well as full compliance with all 
applicable government laws, rules and regulations. The Group is also committed to prompt and comprehensive corporate 
reporting and disclosure. 
 
The Board of Directors holds scheduled Board Meetings approximately six times per year plus such other ad hoc meetings as 
are deemed necessary to deal with urgent business matters. 
 
The Company has established subcommittees of the Board, comprising an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a 
Risk Committee, each of which has its own written terms of reference. A copy of these terms of reference is available on the 
Company’s website. A detailed schedule of matters reserved to the Board is in place. 
 
The Company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and an Employee Handbook containing all Group policies and 
procedures. These include, inter alia, a Whistleblower Policy. 
 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee meets at least three times each year to discuss the review of the Interim Financial Statements, to agree the 
plan for the audit of the year-end Financial Statements and to review the outcome of that audit. For the annual results the 
independent auditors are invited to discuss the conclusions arising from their audit and their assessment of the Group’s internal 
controls. The Audit Committee also reviews annually, in detail, the risks and uncertainties facing the Group prior to the 
submission of the annual risk report to the Board. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is Joe Darby and the other participating 
members of the committee are Andrew West and David Cowan. 
 
The activities of the Audit Committee are governed by terms of reference which cover its mandate, its composition, the 
independence and expertise of the members, frequency of meetings, and its responsibilities which include oversight of the 
external audit function, risk management, internal controls, financial reporting, and the provision by the auditors of non-audit 
services. The Audit Committee has the power to engage such external advisers as it deems necessary to discharge its 
responsibilities. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once per year and is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Board of 
Directors, including share incentive plan awards, and for establishing guidelines for the remuneration of staff in general, with 
closer scrutiny of the remuneration of senior management. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Cowan and 
the other participating members are Andrew West and Joe Darby. 
 
Risk Committee 
The mandate of the Risk Committee is to review on an ongoing basis the risks facing the Group, their potential impact, the 
strategies available to mitigate those risks and the costs of such mitigation. The remit of the committee also includes oversight of 
the Group’s system of internal controls and its policies and procedures, including those pertaining to conduct of business, health 
and safety, and environment. The Risk Committee is comprised of senior members of Executive Management, including the 
Chief Executive and tthe Group Vice President, Engineering and Projects. It reports to the Audit Committee pursuant to the 
latter’s responsibility for oversight of risk management and internal controls in the Group. 
 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets out the Group’s policy in relation to the payment of bribes (including facilitation 
payments), conflicts of interest, gifts and hospitality, charitable and political donations, and business relationships generally 
(including the promotion of fair competition).  
 
The Code states clearly that the direct or indirect offer or payment of bribes in any form is unacceptable, as is the solicitation or 
receipt of bribes from others, and that the payment of money or the provision of gifts or services to public officials in order to 
influence them in any decision concerning the Group is strictly prohibited. Further details of the Group’s policy on bribery and 
corruption are included below. 
 
Employee Handbook 
The Employee Handbook contains the Group’s policies and procedures governing such matters as the workplace environment 
(including non-discrimination, harassment, substance abuse, and employment of family members), grievance and disciplinary 
procedures, maternity and paternity leave, corporate disclosure, share dealing, health & safety and information technology. It 
also includes the Whistleblower Policy. 
 
Whistleblower Policy 
The Whistleblower Policy provides a confidential and anonymous means whereby persons can report any matter relating to the 
Group which, in the view of the complainant, is illegal, unethical, contrary to the policies of the Group or in some other manner 
not right or proper. 
 
Health, Safety & Environment Policy 
A primary goal of the Group is the protection of Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”). This policy, whose implementation is 
overseen by the Chief Executive Officer, governs the Group’s operations and is specifically designed to: 
 comply with relevant HSE legislation, regulations and other requirements; 
 maintain and develop systems to identify, assess, monitor, review and control HSE issues; 
 set HSE objectives and targets;  37 | Page 
 
 implement mechanisms to communicate with and to obtain input from employees, contractors, partners and associates; 
 coordinate HSE policy, including the HSE management systems of contractors, to provide a unified system to guide 
operations; and 
 institute a site-specific Emergency Response Procedure (“ERP”) so that immediate actions are taken, without delay, to 
minimise danger to personnel, the environment and property. ERPs will be rehearsed prior to commencing operations to 
ensure that personnel make the appropriate responses in the event of emergency. 
 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy 
One of Gulfsands' core values is to uphold responsible and fair business practices.  It is committed to promoting and maintaining 
the highest level of ethical standards in relation to all our business activities and in all our dealings with our stakeholders.  The 
Group therefore has a zero tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption, which is strictly prohibited. There are no 
circumstances under which the Group will make any provision, set money aside or create accounts for the purposes of facilitating 
the payment or receipts of a bribe. 
 
All directors, officers, employees of Gulfsands and its subsidiaries and associated persons are required to comply with the 
Bribery Act 2010 and with any other anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation that applies in any jurisdiction in any part of the 
world in which they might be expected to conduct business. 
 
On the introduction of the Bribery Act 2010 in July 2011, a detailed Group policy was produced and circulated appropriately and 
all existing staff underwent comprehensive guidance as to the content of the Bribery Act and how to recognise and deal with 
bribery and corruption issues.  For new employees joining Gulfsands, we ensure they receive this guidance as part of their 
induction process.  Regular refreshers are mandatory for all staff as part of our ongoing responsibility to act in accordance with 
the spirit of free and fair competition.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
 
This report has been prepared having regard to Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations of the Companies Act 2006 under 
which the auditor reports to a company’s shareholders on the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and states 
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.  
 
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board for submission to 
shareholders. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Cowan and the other participating members are Andrew 
West and Joe Darby.  
 
Unaudited Information 
Remuneration Policy 
The policy of the Group is to remunerate Directors and employees by a combination of salary, discretionary bonus and share-
based awards. Bands are established for Directors and the various different seniority levels of employee which define the range 
of potential bonus and share-based awards relative to the Director’s or employee’s salary, and awards are generally made 
annually. The level of award within the applicable band is determined by a combination of the Group’s performance and the 
assessment of the individual’s performance during the previous year, together with an assessment of the relative importance of 
that employee to the Group. Formal assessments are made annually of each employee’s performance and goals set for the 
coming year. Bonuses are entirely discretionary (not subject to performance conditions) and are paid in cash. 
 
There are two share-based plans in operation, a Share Option Plan and a Restricted Share Plan. The Share Option Plan is 
reserved for the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management. The majority of employees receive awards 
under the Restricted Share Plan. Substantially all awards made since 2009 have had a vesting period of two years: the majority 
of awards made prior to 2009 had no vesting period. Neither plan contains performance conditions.  
 
The Group’s current remuneration policy was established in 2009 and was reviewed in early 2011 by Hewitt New Bridge Street, 
external specialist remuneration consultants. The policy as regards Directors’ remuneration is that variable remuneration 
including on-target bonuses and the value of share-based awards, shall comprise in the region of 50% of Directors’ aggregate 
remuneration. A detailed benchmarking exercise was undertaken by the same consultants in early 2011 to compare the 
remuneration of each Director with that of their equivalent peers among London-listed independent oil & gas companies and 
other companies of similar size. A less detailed benchmarking exercise was undertaken at the same time for other staff using 
external databases for remuneration in the oil & gas industry. An update to this exercise was undertaken by the same 
consultants in January 2013. 
 
The Group provides life assurance cover for all staff outside Syria and medical insurance cover for substantially all staff. 
Stakeholder pension arrangements were put in place in early 2011 for the Company’s staff but there is no Company pension 
scheme and the Company does not make any contribution to individual employee pension schemes. 
 
Directors’ incentive compensation 
As reported last year, in recognition of the extraordinary impact that the Syrian sanctions have had on the Company’s share price 
the Board deferred any cash bonus payments related to 2011 performance and contribution until such time as the Company 
receives payments for production from its Syrian interests. These bonus payments continue to be deferred and no awards were 
made to directors under the Company’s Executive Share Option Plan during 2012.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Gulfsands Petroleum plc 
 
We have audited the financial statements of Gulfsands Petroleum plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, and the related notes 1 to 6 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and notes 1 to 6 of the Company Financial Statements. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in the Directors’ Report, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
 
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
 
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion: 
 the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 the Consolidated Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union; 
 the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
Emphasis of matter – fair value of the Group’s producing operations in Syria 
In forming our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, which is not qualified, 
we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 5.9 and 6.2 to the Financial Statements concerning the 
valuation of the Group’s suspended producing operations in Syria, which are recorded at the Directors’ best estimate of their fair 
value following the loss of joint control in December 2011. As highlighted in note 5.9, there is significant uncertainty as to the 
duration of the EU sanctions imposed in December 2011 and the eventual outcome of events in Syria and hence whether the 
carrying value of $102 million is an appropriate estimate of the fair value of its suspended producing operations in the country. 
 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Financial Statements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
 
Other matters 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied were the Company a quoted company.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
Section 1 – Basis of Preparation
 
 
 
This section contains the Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. 
Significant accounting policies specific to one note have been included in that note. Accounting policies 
determined non-significant are not included in these financial statements. There have been no changes to the 
Group’s accounting policies that are not disclosed in the financial statements. 
 
This section also includes new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their 
expected impact, if any, on the performance of the Group. 
 
1.1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs 
Gulfsands Petroleum plc is a public limited company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock 
Exchange and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) are 
that of oil and gas production, exploration and development. 
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 8 April 2013 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Ric Malcolm. 
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in note 1.3 below. 
 
1.2 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and for the comparative year ended 31 December 
2011 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
and IFRIC (International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
 
1.3 Significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation and accounting standards 
The Group’s significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union and, except for share-based payments and the valuation of available-for-sale investments, 
under the historical cost convention. They have also been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, for the reasons 
set out in the “Going concern” section of the Directors’ Report.  
 
These financial statements consolidate the accounts of Gulfsands Petroleum plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
31 December each year.  
 
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, merged subsidiary undertakings are treated as if they had always been a member of 
the Group. The results of such subsidiaries are included for the whole year in the year they join the Group.  
 
b)  New IFRS standards and interpretations 
The Financial Statements have been prepared after adopting a number of new and revised pronouncements from the IASB, 
including amendments to IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures). However, these have had no 
effect on either the reported results and financial position or the presentation or disclosure within these financial statements. 
 
The following pronouncements from the IASB will become effective for future financial reporting periods and have not yet been 
adopted by the Group.  
 
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 
The standard introduces a new classification and measurement regime for financial assets including “available-for-sale” assets 
and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. 
 
IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements 
The standard supersedes IAS 27 – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and establishes principles for the 
presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. It is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
 
IFRS 11 – Joint Ventures/Joint arrangements 
The standard supersedes IAS 31 – Interest in Joint Ventures and establishes the principles for financial reporting by parties to a 
joint arrangement and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
b)  New IFRS standards and interpretations continued 
IFRS 12 – Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities 
The standard applies to entities that have an interest in a subsidiary, a joint arrangement, an associate or an unconsolidated 
structured entity and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  
 
IFRS 13 – Fair value measurement 
The standard sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and required disclosures about fair value 
measurement and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
 
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 – Transition guidance 
The amendments clarify the transition guidance in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The amendments also provide 
additional transition relief in IFRS 10, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, limiting 
the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. The amendments are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
 
Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 
The amendments aim is to improve consistency and clarity of the presentation of items of other comprehensive income 
statement properties and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
 
IAS 19 – Employee Benefits 
The revised standard prescribes the accounting and disclosure for employee benefits allowing users to make better assessment 
on the characteristics of a company’s defined benefit plans and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2013. 
 
IAS 27 – Separate Financial Statements 
The revised standard outlines the accounting and disclosure requirements for 'separate financial statements' which are financial 
statements prepared by a parent, or an investor in a joint venture or associate, where those investments are accounted for either 
at cost or in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The 
standard also outlines the accounting requirements for dividends and contains numerous disclosure requirements. It is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
 
IAS 28 – Investment in Associated and Joint Ventures 
The reissued standard outlines how to apply, with certain limited exceptions, the equity method to investments in associates and 
joint ventures. The standard also defines an associate by reference to the concept of "significant influence", which requires 
power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions of an investee (but not joint control or control of those polices). It 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
 
Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial assets and Financial Liabilities  
The amendments address inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 Financial Instru-
ments: Presentation and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material effect on the reported 
income or net assets of the Group or Company.  
 
c) Basis of consolidation  
Intra-group sales, profits and balances are eliminated fully on consolidation. 
 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date when control passed. 
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method, under which purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and 
liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. 
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiary undertakings when the Company has the power to 
exercise, or actually exercises, dominant influence or control over the undertaking.  
 
The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production through incorporated and unincorporated joint 
ventures (together “Jointly Controlled Entities”). The Group accounts for its share of the results and net assets of these Jointly 
Controlled Entities using the proportional consolidation method.  
 
When the Group loses control or joint control of a subsidiary or joint venture, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the 
difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 
(ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary or joint venture and any non-
controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary or joint venture 
are accounted for in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities are disposed of. The fair value of 
any investment retained in the former subsidiary or joint venture at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on 
initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” or, when 
applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

d) Reporting currency 
These financial statements are presented in US Dollars. The majority of all costs associated with foreign operations are 
denominated in US Dollars and not the local currency of the operations. Therefore the presentational and functional currency of 
the Group, and the functional currency of all subsidiaries, is the US Dollar. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, 
if any, are recognised in the Income Statement for the year. The effective exchange rate to the Pound Sterling at 31 December 
2012 was £1: US $1.61 (2011 – £1: US $1.57). 
 
Assets and Investments 
Section 2 – Oil and Gas Assets 
 
This section focuses on the oil and gas assets which form the core of our business, including details of exploration 
costs incurred in the year, those written off or impaired and capital commitments existing at the year end. 
 
Significant Accounting Judgments in this Section: 
Definition of reserves 
The Group’s definition of reserves is in accordance and consistent with the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management System, as 
prepared by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) and reviewed and jointly 
sponsored by the World Petroleum Council (“WPC”), the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Society of 
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The estimation of Proved (“1P”), Proved plus Probable (“2P”) and Proved plus Probable plus 
Possible (“3P”) commercially recoverable reserves are performed utilising relevant geological, geophysical and engineering data 
and with reference to the use of the probabilistic methodology as approved by SPE/WPC. The reserves are verified by a certified 
independent expert. 
 
Proved plus Probable entitlement reserves are utilised as the basis for the Group’s calculations of depletion and impairment as 
these represent the Group’s estimate of the most likely commercially recoverable reserves as per the approved probabilistic 
methodology. 
 
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: 
Intangible oil and gas exploration and evaluation assets 
Costs capitalised as intangible assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying value may 
exceed its recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to the (i) likely commerciality of the assets, and (ii) future 
revenues and costs pertaining and the discount rate to be applied for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. Additional 
judgements apply to the Group’s exploration and evaluation assets affected by sanctions in Syria. 
 
Oil and gas development and production assets and reserves 
Oil and gas development and production assets held in property, plant and equipment are depleted on a unit of production basis 
calculated by reference to Proved and Probable (“2P”) reserves. The Group’s 2P reserves take the estimated future cost of 
developing and extracting those reserves into account.  
 
Future forecast capital expenditure associated with developing Proved and Probable reserves is included in the cost base for the 
purposes of calculating depletion charges. 2P reserves are determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors 
and future oil and gas prices. A long-term oil price of $90/bbl (2011: $90/bbl) and a long-term gas price in the Gulf of Mexico of 
$4.00/mcf (2011: $4.50/mcf) have been used in determining the commercial reserves. The gas price in Syria is linked to the price 
of oil through the Production Sharing Contract. The carrying amount of oil and gas assets therefore depends upon a number of 
estimates at year-end. 
 
The level of 2P reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Group’s oil and gas 
assets has been impaired.  
 
The carrying amount of oil and gas development and production assets is shown in note 2.3.  
 
An increase in the forecast long-term oil price of $10/bbl would reduce the 2P entitlement reserves in Syria by approximately 0.4 
mmboe. A $10/bbl reduction in the forecast long-term oil price would not materially change the entitlement reserves. The 
entitlement reserves in Syria are not sensitive to gas price changes of 10%. There would be no significant impact on the 
reserves, depletion charge or impairment attributable to the USA from a $10/bbl or $1/mcf change in the oil and gas prices. 
 
An increase in the forecast future capital expenditure for Syria of $50 million (gross) would increase the Group’s entitlement 
reserves by 0.2 mmboe and would increase the depletion charge by approximately 5% per entitlement barrel. An increase of 
50% in the forecast future expenditure in the USA would increase the depletion charge for 2012 by $0.3 million but have no 
material impact on entitlement reserves.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources” and where additional 
guidance is needed IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” and IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” noting that several items in the 
latter two standards are exempted for assets at the exploration and evaluation stage due to the application of IFRS 6. Set out 
below is our interpretation of the principles set out in IFRS 6 and other IFRSs. 
 
There are two categories of oil and gas assets, exploration and evaluation assets which are included in Intangible assets, and 
development and production assets which are included in Property, plant and equipment.  
 
2.1 Intangible assets 
Recognition and measurement 
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting whereby costs for unsuccessful exploration and development 
activities are expensed. All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets 
in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property. 
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities. Pre-licence costs 
and general exploration costs not directly attributable to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred. 
 
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets relating to each exploration licence/prospect are not amortised but are carried forward 
until the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves has been determined. If commercial reserves have been discovered, the 
related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cash generating unit basis as set out below and any impairment loss is 
recognised in the Income Statement. The carrying value of the E&E assets, after any impairment loss, is then reclassified as 
development and production assets in property, plant and equipment. Costs of unsuccessful exploration efforts are expensed at 
the time that a determination is made that the exploration has failed to locate commercially recoverable hydrocarbons. 
 
Impairment 
Non-current assets are assessed for impairment on a cash generating unit basis when facts and circumstances suggest that the 
carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such triggering events in respect of E&E assets include the point at which 
determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist. 
 
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the 
cash generating unit by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on management’s expectation of 
the future production, hydrocarbon prices and costs. Any identified impairment is charged to the Income Statement. 
 
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit 
to the Income Statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.

2.1 Intangible assets continued 
The accumulated costs of E&E assets in Syria represent the Group’s share of the drilling costs of the Al Khairat, Twaiba and 
Wardieh wells and certain 3D seismic surveys. The Al Khairat well was successfully tested but commercial development 
approval is yet to be granted by the Syrian Arab Republic. The Twaiba and Wardieh wells are still under evaluation.  
 
Following the imposition of EU sanctions against the oil industry in Syria, an impairment test was conducted and the carrying value 
of all E&E assets in Syria has been impaired to nil as it is presently unclear whether the Group will be able to apply for commercial 
development approval in the manner contemplated by the Production Sharing Contract. In 2011 the Group announced a discovery 
in the Khurbet East 101 well and the costs of this well plus the appraisal well drilled at Khurbet East 102 were transferred to 
property, plant & equipment following the granting of a commercial development licence.  
 
In 2012 the Group wrote off $7,099,000 in respect of the Sidi Dhaher well and associated seismic costs following the 
unsuccessful testing of the well. At 31 December 2012 the Tunisian E&E assets represent seismic acquisition and related costs 
invoiced to date by the operator for both the onshore and offshore Tunisian assets plus amounts paid during 2012 to increase 
participation in these licences.  
 
2.2 Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets  
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for 
impairment. Amortisation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis 
over their useful lives of between two and five years. Amortisation is included with depreciation and classified as cost of sales or 
administrative expenses as appropriate. No intangible assets other than oil and gas assets have indefinite lives. 
 
2.3 Property, plant and equipment 
Tangible oil and gas assets are grouped into a cash generating unit or groups of units for purposes of impairment testing and for 
depreciating the development and production assets. A cash generating unit is the smallest unit that does not have inter-related 
revenues and may be a well, field, area, block, region or other defined area as appropriate. Inter-relationships can be measured 
by oil and gas production agreements, geological analysis, or other documentation showing such relationships. The only 
limitation in the size of a cash generating unit is that it cannot be larger than an operating segment of the Group. 
 
Recognition and measurement 
Development and production assets are accumulated on a cash generating unit basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding 
commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets. 
 
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly 
attributable overheads, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning. 
 
Depletion of producing assets 
Expenditure within each cash generating unit is depleted by a unit of production method using the ratio of oil and gas production 
in the year compared to the estimated quantity of commercial reserves at the beginning of the year. Costs used in the unit of 
production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs for 
proved and probable reserves. Changes in estimates of commercial reserves or future development costs are dealt with 
prospectively. 
 
Impairment 
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase 
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate 
carrying value is compared against the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present 
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.

Disposals during 2012 represent the write off of several leases in the Gulf of Mexico that have been terminated where all 
associated decommissioning obligations have been fulfilled. Disposals during 2011 were related to the sale of a package of 
assets in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 
Included in the 2012 depletion charge for the US oil and gas properties is a charge of $44,000 (2011: $1,147,000) related to 
properties substantially depleted in prior years. These depletion adjustments occur where revisions to decommissioning 
estimates have been made to properties with very short useful lives. 
 
The impairment charge for 2012 includes $493,000 in respect of the East Cameron 160 lease where the operator believes that 
economic production has ceased following the sanding up of the well. Other impairment charges related to provisions against the 
Group’s carrying values of its USA producing assets, following a review of reserves at the year end.  
 
Impairment for the assets in the Gulf of Mexico has been assessed, based on a value in use calculation, and using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 6% (2011: 6%), a long-term Brent crude oil price of $90/bbl (2011: $90/bbl) and a long-term gas price of $4.0/mcf 
(2011: $4.5/mcf). In determining the appropriate discount rate to be used consideration is given to the risk directly incorporated in 
the underlying cash flow forecasts.  
 
2.4 Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets 
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision 
for impairment. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis 
over their useful lives of between two and five years. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Assets and Investments 
Section 3 – Working Capital 
 
 
This section focuses on the funding available to the Group to pursue new business opportunities and the working capital position 
of the Group and Company at the year end. 
 
 
3.1 Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amounts less any provision made for impairment of receivables. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the debt.

Amounts due from oil and gas partnerships 5,165  2,804 
 8,560  5,347 
 
At 31 December 2012 and 2011 the Group was owed $25,332,000 by the government of the Syrian Arab Republic relating to oil 
delivered during the period August to November 2011. The total amount invoiced was $31,232,000 and to date an amount  
of $5,900,000 has been paid. The government of the Syrian Arab Republic has acknowledged the debt.  
 
This asset has been effectively impaired as part of the deconsolidation of the Group’s Syrian producing operations, described in 
note 5.9.  
 
Underlift at 31 December 2012 and 2011 represents the rights to gas revenue receivable as a result of the acquisition of  
oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2004. Underlift represents a right to future economic benefits (through 
entitlement to receive equivalent future production), which constitutes an asset of which the timing of recovery is uncertain. 
During the year ended 31 December 2012 certain underlift balances were settled and cash received.  
 
Amounts due from oil and gas partnerships represents amounts owed from its joint venture partners.  
 
3.2 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at cost and comprise cash in hand and deposits repayable on 
demand by banks and other short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Balances held in bank 
accounts subject to escrow agreements as collateral for performance bonds issued are excluded from cash and cash equivalents 
and are shown as long-term financial assets.

The restricted cash balances at 31 December 2012 includes amounts held in escrow to cover decommissioning expenditures 
under the requirements of the regulatory authorities that manage the oil and gas and other mineral resources in the Gulf of 
Mexico and an amount of $5.0 million held in escrow to guarantee minimum work obligations on the Rharb permit related to the 
acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited (see note 6.6). At 31 December 2011 a further $1.0 million was held in escrow to secure a 
line of credit for forward foreign currency trading.

Included within accruals and other payables are amounts of approximately $4.2 million that are owed to parties subject to asset 
freezing regulations under the EU sanctions regime. These amounts relate to goods and services acquired before those entities 
were designated as sanctioned parties. The Group is not in a position to make payments for these goods or services until such 
time as sanctions are lifted against the named parties.  
 
3.4 Inventories 
Inventories comprise materials and equipment, which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all 
costs incurred in bringing the materials and equipment to its present condition and location. 
 
 
Assets and Investments 
Section 4 – Other Assets and Liabilities  
 
This section details the Company’s investments in subsidiaries and provision for decommissioning. 
 
 
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: 
Fair value of the Group’s investment in Dijla Petroleum Company (“DPC”) 
The Group’s investment in DPC, the entity established in Syria, pursuant to the PSC, to administer the Group’s Syrian oil and 
gas production assets (and which is considered to also include the related rights to production under the PSC), is recorded  
as an available-for-sale investment at an estimate of fair value taking into account the current exceptional circumstances in Syria 
and the consequential difficulty of predicting the timing of future activities in Syria. Due to the unknown duration of EU sanctions 
in force against Syria and uncertainty over the eventual outcome of events in the country, the calculation of fair value is highly 
subjective and subject to material change in future periods, as described further in note 5.9. 
 
Decommissioning 
The Group has decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in the Gulf of Mexico and its exploration well 
offshore Tunisia. The full extent to which the provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the time of 
decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning works and the discount rate applied to such costs. The Group 
received a report from external specialist decommissioning experts regarding the cost of future works in the Gulf of Mexico 
during 2011, which has been reviewed and updated by management, and has prepared an internal estimate of the work required 
offshore Tunisia. The timing of the decommissioning works is inherently uncertain and depends upon the determination of the 
end of commercial production. The Group has utilised the expected useful lives in the year-end reserves report for the Gulf of 
Mexico to estimate the timing of associated decommissioning liabilities.  
 
A risk free interest rate of 3% (2011: 3%) has been used to discount the expected costs of decommissioning. A decrease in the 
discount rate utilised to 2% per annum would increase the total value of the decommissioning provision by $1.1 million. An 
increase in the discount rate to 4% would decrease the decommissioning provision by $1.0 million. The impact on the income 
statement for 2013 is immaterial. A future cost inflation rate of 2.5% per annum has been used. An increase in this estimate to 
4% per annum would increase the decommissioning provision by $1.7 million. 
 
 
4.1 Investments 
The Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown below. All investments are in ordinary shares and are directly

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
 
Gulfsands Petroleum Levant Limited owns a 50% interest in a contractor group that has been exploring for hydrocarbons in 
Block 26 in Syria prior to the imposition of EU sanctions against the Syrian oil industry. The results and net assets of the 
contractor group are proportionally consolidated within the Group accounts. 
 
Gulfsands Petroleum Levant Limited owns 25% of the voting shares in Dijla Petroleum Company (“DPC”), a company 
incorporated in Syria. DPC is a joint venture undertaking between the General Petroleum Corporation and the other parties 
participating in the production of hydrocarbons from Block 26 in Syria. DPC is responsible for administering these production 
operations and, as such, all its costs are ultimately borne equally between the Group and its joint venture partner, Emerald 
Energy plc. Further information on the status of the Syrian producing operations is provided in note 5.9. 
 
On 18 January 2013 Gulfsands Petroleum Morocco Ltd was incorporated in the Cayman Islands to hold the Group’s investments 
in Cabre Maroc Limited (see note 6.6). On 5 March 2013 Gulfsands Petroleum Sud America Ltd was incorporated in the Cayman 
Islands. 
 
4.2 Decommissioning  
Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field 
exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised. The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future 
expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the 
provision is also created (included in development and production assets) and depleted on a unit of production basis. Changes in 
estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset.  
 
The provision for decommissioning relates to the expected present value of costs of plugging and abandoning the exploration 
and development assets held by Gulfsands Petroleum Tunisia Limited, Gulfsands Petroleum USA, Inc and Darcy Energy LLC. 
The provision for decommissioning is estimated after taking account of inflation, years to abandonment and an appropriate 
discount rate. At 31 December 2012, the oil and gas properties had estimated abandonment dates between 2013 and 2027.  
 
Actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the decommissioning work required, which will 
reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields 
cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently 
uncertain. 
  
The actual amounts paid for decommissioning may ultimately vary significantly from the provision at 31 December 2012 requiring 
potentially material adjustments to the carrying value of the obligations.  
 
The movement in the provision for decommissioning was as follows: 
 
$’000 
At 1 January 2011 28,156 
Changes in estimates 1,917 
Disposals (9,999)

At 31 December 2012 17,661 
Current portion 2,352 
Non-current portion 15,309 
 
4.3 Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale (“AFS”) financial assets are stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in notes 5.9 
and 6.2. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where 
the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Section 5 – Results for the year  
 
 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group, with disclosures including segmental information, components 
of the operating loss, results from discontinued operations, taxation and earnings per share. 
 
Significant Accounting Judgements in this Section: 
Details of the impairment of intangible exploration/appraisal assets and depletion can be found in sections 2.1 and 2.3. 
 
There are no other significant accounting judgements in this section. 
 
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: 
 
Revenue recognition 
Sales revenue represents amounts invoiced exclusive of sales-related taxes and royalties for the Group’s share of hydrocarbon 
sales in the year. Hydrocarbon sales are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. No allowance is made for 
the Group’s share of future revenues from costs incurred to date that have yet to be allowed for cost recovery purposes. 
 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable. 
 
Details of share-based payments can be found in note 5.3. 
 
 
5.1 Segmental Analysis 
Total revenue and segmental information 
The total revenue of the Group, as defined by IAS 18, for 2012 was $5,997,000 (2011: $125,219,000) comprising sales of 
hydrocarbons and incidental income of $5,622,000 (2011: $124,948,000) and interest income of $375,000 (2011: $271,000). 
 
For management purposes, at 31 December 2012 the Group operated in three geographical areas, Syria, Tunisia and the US. 
All segments are involved with production and exploration of oil and gas. As discussed in note 5.9, the Group has lost control of 
its production activities in Syria and these are separately disclosed in the analysis below.

The operating lease rentals shown for 2012 include $212,000 (2011: $5,465,000) in respect of the hire of drilling rigs and 
operating staff. 
 
Operating leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
5.3 Share-based payments  
The Company has made equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and directors by way of issues of share 
options. The fair value of these payments is calculated at grant date by the Company using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period from the date of award to the date of vesting, based on the Company’s best estimate of the number of options that will 
eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options expected to vest as a 
result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to 
the share-based payments reserve. 
 
The Group operates two share-based remuneration plans issuing options and restricted shares. Options are issued to directors 
and certain senior management personnel. Restricted shares are available to other staff. 
 
Options are issued with an exercise price equivalent to the underlying share price averaged over a period immediately prior to 
the date of grant, or such other higher exercise price as the Remuneration Committee may determine. Restricted shares are 
issued with an exercise price equivalent to the par value of the shares. Both options and restricted shares will usually have a 
deferred vesting period and a maximum validity period of five years.  
 
The share-based payment charge for the period is based upon the requirements of IFRS 2 regarding share-based payments. For 
this purpose, the weighted average estimated fair value of the share options and restricted shares granted was calculated using 
a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected average life of options and restricted shares was assumed to be four years. 
No dividends were factored into the model. Volatility has been estimated based on the historical volatility of the underlying 
shares.

5.8 Taxation  
Accounting Policies  
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the 
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and are measured using the enacted, or substantively enacted, tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are 
expected to reverse. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and an impairment provision is made if it is 
more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not give rise to future benefits in the Group’s tax returns.

The Group’s tax liabilities in Tunisia and Syria are settled on its behalf by the national oil companies out of the latter’s share of 
royalties and profit oil and, as such, are not reflected in the Group’s tax charge for the year.  
 
Deferred Tax

Unprovided deferred tax asset  (37,080) (18,935) 
Deferred tax asset/(liability) at 31 December –  – 
 
$2 million (2011: nil) of the Group’s unutilised tax losses expire between 2014 and 2017, $31 million (2011: $22 million) have 
expiry dates between 2024 and 2032. The remaining tax losses of the Group have no expiry date. 
 
Deferred tax assets are not provided where the Group does not consider it probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be 
made to offset the deductions represented by those deferred tax assets. In performing this calculation the Group considers 
deferred tax balances relating to each tax authority separately.

5.9 Effect of sanctions applied to the Group’s operations in the Syrian Arab Republic 
The Group is party to a Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) for the exploitation of hydrocarbon production in Block 26 in Syria. 
Pursuant to the PSC the Group operates its Syrian oil and gas production assets through a joint venture administered by Dijla 
Petroleum Company in which the Group has a 25% equity interest. The Group lost control of DPC on 1 December 2011 following 
the publication of European Union Council Decision 2011/782/CFSP which significantly increased sanctions against the oil 
industry in Syria. For the purposes of EU sanctions DPC is considered to be controlled by General Petroleum Corporation. 
 
The Group has followed the guidance in International Accounting Standard 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures” and has derecognised 
its share of the assets and liabilities of DPC from 1 December 2011. Until 1 December 2011 DPC had been proportionally 
consolidated, as explained in note 4.1 to the Financial Statements. Subsequent to this date the Group’s interest in DPC has been 
recognised as an available-for-sale investment, at an estimate of fair value as given the current exceptional circumstances in 
Syria the Group has neither joint control nor significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.  
 
The fair value of the investment in DPC has been calculated based upon estimated future cash flows that could be generated 
from the entitlement reserves at 31 December 2012 discounted at a rate of 15% per annum and then the net present value is 
reduced further by 80% to reflect a market view of other risks of investments in the Syrian oil and gas sector at the current time. 
It has also been referenced, as a practical matter, to the Group’s year-end market capitalisation (as adjusted for its substantial 
net cash balance). The fair value attributed to DPC at 31 December 2012 was $102.0 million (2011: $102.0 million) as the 
Directors do not consider that there has been any significant change in the underlying situation. 
 
The fair value included within the Group‘s investments reflects an estimate of fair value taking into account the current 
exceptional circumstances in Syria and the consequential difficulty of predicting the timing of future activities in the country  
as a consequence of the impact of the EU’s sanctions and is not necessarily reflective of the value of the Group’s investments in 
its Syrian operations over the long term. 
 
In deriving the figure of 80% the Directors have assumed, inter alia, a delay to resumption of oil production in Syria, deferred 
revenue receipts for a period after resumption of production, potential further costs associated with restarting operations and the 
possibility of a change to the terms of the PSC or even expropriation. There is a high degree of subjectivity inherent in the 
valuation due to the unknown duration of the sanctions and the eventual outcome of events in Syria. Accordingly it may change 
materially in future periods depending on a wide range of factors. 
 
The Group’s share of the results of DPC up to 1 December 2011, which were included in the Consolidated Income Statement for 
the year ended 31 December 2011, together with the accounting gain recognised at the date of derecognition, were as follows: 
 
 
Period 
ended 30 
November 
2011 
$’000 
Revenue 117,041  
Expenses (18,268) 
Profit before taxation and net profit attributable to suspended activities 98,774  
Profit on derecognition of DPC (see below) 8,702  
Profit for the year from suspended activities 107,476 
 
The result of these suspended activities has been treated as “discontinued operations” in the Income Statement as required by 
IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”. There was no corresponding amount in 2012. 
 
On 1 December 2011 the Group’s ability to exercise joint control over its Syrian interests ceased. In the period ended 30 
November 2011, the revenues arising from this production amounted to $117.0 million. The cash inflows associated with these 
revenues amounted to $114.1 million. There were no corresponding amounts in 2012. 
 
During the year, suspended Syrian operations consumed $1.1 million (2011: $12.8 million) of cash in operating activities and 
paid $1.1 million (2011: $21.0 million) for investing activities. This cash was provided by entities within the Group. The amounts 
incurred in 2012 were used to settle obligations incurred prior to the suspension of activities on 1 December 2011 and in full 
compliance with all applicable sanctions.   
 
As noted above, during the year ended 31 December 2011 a gain of $8.7 million arose on the loss of joint control of DPC, being an 
estimate of the fair value of the remaining investment, taking into consideration the current exceptional circumstances in Syria and 
the consequential difficulty of predicting the timing of future activities in the country, less the carrying amount of the Group’s share 
of the net assets of DPC at the date of loss of joint control. This is summarised below.

5.10 (Loss) / Earnings per share 
The basic and diluted (loss) / earnings per share have been calculated using the loss for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 
$27,030,000 (2011: profit of $55,076,000). The basic (loss) / earnings per share was calculated using a weighted average 
number of shares in issue less treasury shares held, of 117,844,680 (2011: 121,028,071). The weighted average number of 
ordinary shares, allowing for the exercise of share options, for the purposes of calculating the diluted (loss) / earnings per share 
was 118,202,604 (2011: 122,943,300).  
 
The loss per share from continuing operations is calculated before profits attributable to suspended Syrian activities. In 2011 this 
loss from continuing activities amounted to $52,400,000. In 2012 the loss from continuing activities is the same as the total loss 
for the period.  
 
Where there is a loss, the impact of share options is anti-dilutive and hence, basic and diluted loss per share are the same.

6.1 Share capital continued 
Pursuant to a share buyback programme in 2011 the Company holds 4,144,820 shares in Treasury at 31 December 2012 (2011: 
4,245,681). During 2012, 100,681 shares were issued from Treasury to satisfy the exercise of options and restricted shares. 
 
In 2010 a Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) was established to complement the existing Share Option Plan. Under the RSP 
restricted (deferred) shares are awarded at par value to employees. Other than the lower exercise price the restricted shares 
operate in the same manner as the ordinary share options.

All restricted shares have an exercise price of £0.06 per restricted share. 
  
Options are exercisable at prices from £1.02 to £3.20 per share and had a weighted estimated remaining contractual life of  
1.2 years at 31 December 2012. The weighted remaining contractual life of the restricted shares is approximately 3.8 years. 
 
Of the total outstanding options at 31 December 2012, the options granted to the Directors numbered 6,300,000 (2011: 
7,575,000) and those granted to other staff numbered 1,061,000 (2011: 1,156,000). The remaining 75,000 (2011: 75,000)  
were granted to ex-employees and ex-Directors or consultants who are currently involved with or have performed work  
for the Group. All restricted shares outstanding were granted to non-Directors employed by the Group. 
 
The average share price during 2012 was £1.21 (2011: £2.43). The highest share price during the year was £1.87 and the lowest 
price was £0.78 (2011: £4.03 and £1.41).  
 
6.2 Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management 
Risk assessment 
The Group’s oil and gas activities are subject to a range of financial risks, as described below, which can significantly impact its 
performance. 
 
Liquidity risk 
At the end of the year the Group had cash in hand of $91.0 million, and further bank balances of $7.8 million held in escrow to 
cover expected decommissioning liabilities and other obligations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
 
6.2 Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management continued 
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced frequently. These are reviewed regularly by 
management and the Board to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least 12 months. At present the Group has 
no loan facilities in place and has no obvious need for such facilities based upon its current projects in hand and its available 
cash resources. However this position will continually be reviewed in the light of developments with existing projects and new 
project opportunities as they arise. 
 
Currency risk 
 
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions of individual companies within the Group are translated to the functional and reporting currency of 
US Dollars at the rates prevailing when the transactions occurred. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Income Statement. 
 
The Group has currency exposure arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the 
Company and all its subsidiaries, US Dollars. These transactions relate to certain costs of its oil and gas exploration and 
production operations which are denominated in local currencies or in Euro, and its head office costs which are denominated in 
Pounds Sterling.  
 
Although sales of crude oil by the Group’s Syrian operations have been invoiced in US Dollars payment has previously  
been made in Euro or Syrian Pounds according to the exchange rates pertaining between US Dollars and these currencies 
shortly before the payment is made. The Group manages any further risk through the use of short-term foreign currency forward 
contracts of not more than two weeks duration. Each contract is entered into with the aim of exactly covering any foreign 
currency risk on Euro receivables. There was no significant exposure to forward exchange contracts in place as at  
31 December 2012 or 2011. 
 
In Syria and Tunisia where the operations are covered by Production Sharing Contracts (“PSCs”) costs incurred in currencies 
other than Dollars are recoverable under the terms of the PSC at the rate of exchange between US Dollars and that currency at 
the date of payment.   
 
The Group maintains part of its cash balances in Pounds Sterling to defray head office costs but limits exposure to other 
currencies as far as practicable. 
 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to changes in the US Dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, 
on the Group’s profit before tax and the Group’s equity: 
 
Change in 
US Dollar 
rate 
Effect on 
profit before 
tax $’000 
2012 (+ or –) 5% 125 
2011 (+ or –) 5% 423 
 
Credit risk 
During the year ended 31 December 2012 79% of the Groups’ revenues, which were all derived from the US segment, were 
received from Sunoco Inc and 11% from Southwest Energy LP. During the year end 31 December 2011 94% of the Group’s 
revenues were derived from sales to the Oil Marketing Bureau of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic (“OMB”).  
 
In the USA the Group trades only with a small number of recognised, creditworthy third parties. The Group manages the 
exposures to credit risk by performing credit evaluations on such of their major customers as require credit. 
 
In Syria, the Group’s share of crude oil has previously been sold to OMB. The Group has yet to receive payment for oil sales for 
the period August 2011 to December 2011 amounting to $26.2 million. Although the resultant debt has been acknowledged by 
the government of the Syrian Arab Republic the ultimate recoverability of this amount is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
and the Group has impaired the outstanding amount in full. No revenue has been recorded in Syria for the period since 1 
December 2011.  
 
The Directors do not consider that any further provision is necessary against any financial assets. 
 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  
 
The Group considers capital to be its equity reserves. At the current stage of the Group’s life cycle, the Group’s objective in 
managing its capital is to ensure funds raised meet the exploration expenditure commitments.  
 
The Group ensures it is meeting its objectives by reviewing its KPIs and other management information to ensure its activities 
are progressing in line with expectations, controlling costs and placing unused funds on deposit to conserve resources and 
increase returns on surplus cash held.  66 | Page

The UK Sterling, Euro and Syrian Pound assets principally comprise cash on hand, cash in instant access accounts and short-
term money market deposits. The US Dollar assets represent an available-for-sale financial asset, cash on call accounts, money 
market accounts, and short-term receivables. The Group earned interest on its interest bearing financial assets at rates between 
0.01% and 1.0%. All financial assets, except the investment in DPC, are considered to be immediately available to turn into cash 
on demand. 
 
In the current economic climate with exceptionally low interest rates, the Group is not sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate 
received on bank and money market deposits and accordingly no sensitivity analysis is published. 
 
Included in financial assets on which no interest is earned at 31 December 2012 and 2011 was a gross amount of $26.2 million 
of trade receivables that has been impaired down to a recoverable amount of nil. This amount is due from the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic in respect of oil sales in Syria. The receivable is acknowledged by General Petroleum Corporation of the 
Syrian Arab Republic but due to the ongoing sanctions against the country’s oil industry the payment of this amount has been 
delayed and, taking into account the current exceptional circumstances in Syria and the consequential difficulty of predicting the 
timing of future payment, has been fully impaired. The remaining trade receivables consist of amounts receivable from various 
counter-parties where the Group considers the credit risk to be low. This risk is monitored by the Group.  
 
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of short-term payables. None of these liabilities bear interest to external parties.

6.2 Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management continued 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group has in previous periods entered into regular forward-dated foreign exchange transactions as a means of reducing the 
exposure of the Group to exchange rate differences. These transactions were normally of a duration of less than two weeks and 
the amounts sold forward approximated to the monthly hydrocarbon invoicing for the Group’s Syrian operations. No forward or 
derivative financial instruments have been entered into since September 2011. 
 
The Group does not enter into derivative contracts in respect of its exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and gas.  
 
The Group sells its hydrocarbon production on the spot market and has exposure to changes in oil and gas prices. The Directors 
consider the Group has the financial strength to withstand such changes under all reasonable prognoses and, accordingly, no 
commodity derivative contracts are currently outstanding. The potential future use of derivatives will be kept under review should 
the Group feel that the exposure to commodity price risk significantly impacts the liquidity risk of the Group. The Group incurred 
no expense in respect of oil and gas price derivatives in 2012 or 2011. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The Group has recognised a fair value of $102.0 million for the investment as described in more detail in note 5.9, this  
valuation is substantially different from the potential long-term value of the asset. It is based upon the entitlement reserves  
at 31 December 2012 discounted at a rate of 15% per annum and then the net present value is reduced further by 80% to reflect 
current market view of other risks of investments in the Syrian oil and gas sector. In deriving the figure of 80% we have assumed,  
inter alia, a long-term Brent oil price assumption of $90/bbl, a delay to resumption of oil production in Syria, deferred revenue 
receipts for a period after resumption of production, potential further costs associated with restarting operations and the 
possibility of a change to the terms of the PSC or even expropriation. The valuation represents a level 3 measurement basis as 
defined by IFRS 7. 
 
The following table sets out the impact that changes in the key variables would have on the carrying value of the asset:

Fair values 
The Group has an available-for-sale financial asset valued by the Directors at $102 million as described further below.  
At 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Directors considered the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial assets  
and liabilities to be materially the same. 
 
6.3 Related party transactions and key management 
Key management of the Group are considered to be the Directors of the Company. There were no transactions with Directors, 
other than interests in shares and their remuneration and share options as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 38 and 39. 
 
The remuneration of Directors is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related Party

6.4 Commitments 
At 31 December 2012 the Group had minimum work commitments in respect of Chorbane Permit, onshore Tunisia. This 
obligation is to drill one exploration well. In addition to this, the Group has entered into an undertaking with ADX Energy Limited 
to provide funding for their share of a seismic programme to be undertaken on the permit area. The total estimated cost to the 
Group for these items is $4.8 million. 
 
The Group has a minimum work commitment for the Kerkouane Permit, offshore Tunisia to re-enter and test the Lambouka well 
and to drill one further exploration well. The total estimated cost to the Group for these items is $25.0 million. 
 
On 18 December 2012 the Company entered into an agreement with Caithness Petroleum Limited (“Caithness”) for the 
acquisition of its subsidiary undertaking, Cabre Maroc Limited. Upon completion of this agreement the Group became liable for 
several work programmes relating to the assets of Cabre Maroc Limited and the provision of funding for Caithness’s residual 
interests as set out in the table below. The agreement completed on 16 January 2013.

Tauonate 10,000 line km of gravity survey and 350 line km of 2D seismic 1.0 4.5 
  
 
In December 2010 Dijla Petroleum Company (“DPC”) signed a contract with Saipem S.p.A for the construction of a  
central processing facility to be installed at the Khurbet East Field on Block 26, Syria. The total contract cost is denominated  
in Euro and the Group’s share of the current approved value is approximately $65 million. The Group has not recognised a 
commitment in respect of this amount as the operations of DPC are no longer included within the consolidated results of the 
Group. On 19 December 2011 Saipem,S.p.A issued notice of force majeure and the contract is currently suspended.  
 
There were no other material obligations or contracts outstanding in relation to ongoing projects not provided for at  
31 December 2012 or 2011. 
 
6.5 Contingent liabilities 
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, some contamination of the property owned or leased by the Group is possible. 
Environmental site assessments of the property would be necessary to adequately determine remediation costs, if any.  
The Directors do not consider the amounts that would result from any environmental site assessments to be significant to the 
financial position or results of operations of the Group. Accordingly, except for the provision made against decommissioning 
costs (note 4.2), no further provision for potential remediation costs is required. 
 
The Group has entered into a Production Sharing Contract with the government of the Syrian Arab Republic under which it  
is responsible for bearing 50% of the costs and expenses of all operations in the Block 26 area, Syria. As discussed in note 5.9, 
a notice of force majeure was issued to the General Petroleum Corporation (“GPC”) in December 2011 after which the GPC has 
continued to operate the fields through Dijla Petroleum Company (“DPC”). It is anticipated that once sanctions are lifted and the 
Group is able to legally resume operations DPC will seek to reclaim costs incurred during the pendency of the force majeure 
period. At 31 December 2012 the Group could not reliably estimate these costs but does not believe them to be significant.

6.6 Post balance sheet events 
Acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited 
On 17 January 2013 the Company announced that, following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the 
transaction, it had completed the acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited (“Cabre”) from Caithness Petroleum Limited. Cabre is a 
Cyprus registered company with oil and gas exploration and production operations in the Kingdom of Morocco. Further details of 
its activities are included in the Operations Review on pages 8 – 15. The purchase of Cabre delivers to Gulfsands a large, 
contiguous and highly prospective acreage position in an area with proven petroleum systems, revenues from near term 
production and multiple drilling targets. 
 
Following completion of the transaction the Group owns the entire issued share capital of Cabre. 
 
The provisional fair value of the Cabre assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Group to be recognised in the financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 include:

completion and $1.7 million paid to settle creditors of Cabre Maroc Limited at the transaction date. In addition the Group has 
committed to the provision to Caithness Petroleum Limited of funding for their portion of certain work programmes to be 
conducted on the Fes and Taounate blocks, totalling approximately $11.0 million. 
 
No amounts are relating to Cabre are included in the Income Statement for the period ending 31 December 2012.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
Section 1 – Basis of Preparation
 
 
 
This section contains the Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. 
Significant accounting policies specific to one note have been included in that note. Accounting policies deter-
mined non-significant are not included in these financial statements. There have been no changes to the Group’s 
accounting policies that are no longer disclosed in the financial statements. 
 
This section also includes new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their 
expected impact, if any, on the performance of the Group. 
 
1.1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs 
Gulfsands Petroleum plc is a public limited company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock 
Exchange and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The principal activity of the Company is that of provision of services to its 
subsidiaries which are engaged in oil and gas production, exploration and development activities. 
 
The Company’s Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors 
on 8 April 2013 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Richard Malcolm. 
 
The Company’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in note 1.3 below. 
 
The risks faced by the Company include those related to EU sanctions, described in note 5.9 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
 
1.2 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 
The Company’s Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and for the comparative year ended 31 December 
2011 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
and IFRIC (International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

1.3. Significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation and accounting standards 
The Company’s significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements are set out below. 
 
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union and, except for share-based payments, under the historical cost convention. They have also 
been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, for the reasons set out in the “Going concern” section of the Directors’ 
Report.

Assets and Investments 
Section 3 – Investments in and loans to subsidiaries 
 
 
This section focuses on the Company’s investments and loans. 
 
 
3. Investments 
The Company’s investments in subsidiary companies are included in the Company Balance Sheet at cost, less provision for any 
impairment.  
 
The Company’s fixed asset investment of $7,306,000 represents the historic cost of acquisition of the entire share capital of 
Gulfsands Petroleum Ltd. by means of a share for share exchange in 2005, less any required provision for impairment. 
 
Loans to subsidiary undertakings comprise a revolving loan from the Company to Gulfsands Petroleum USA, Inc. for 
$49,737,000 (2011: $46,039,000) including accrued interest of $8,426,000. Interest is charged at 8.5% per annum on the 
outstanding principal and is payable in full on 31 December annually. The principal balance may be paid in part or in full at 
anytime with no penalty. On 1 January 2015 the loan converts to a term loan and the payments will be made in four instalments 
over the next three years.  
 
A total impairment provision of $36,447,000 (2011: $32,760,000) has been recognised against the carrying value of this loan in 
the Company’s Financial Statements. This provision writes down the value of the loan to Gulfsands Petroleum USA, Inc. to the 
amount expected to be realisable after the anticipated disposal of the Company’s assets in the Gulf of Mexico. The fair value less 
costs to sell has been estimated following discussions with external specialist transaction advisors retained by the Group. 
 
The Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown below. All investments are in ordinary shares and are directly 
or indirectly owned by the Company as stated below:

Assets and Investments 
Section 4 – Working Capital 
 
 
This section focuses on the funding available and the working capital position of the Company at the year end. 
 
 
4.1 Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amounts less any provision made for impairment of receivables. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the debt.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable. 
 
Income statement and total revenue 
No individual Income Statement is presented in respect of the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s loss for the year was $38,368,000 (2011: profit of $62,153,000). The total revenue of the Company, as defined 
by IAS 18, for 2012 was $6,425,000 (2011: $7,431,000) comprising management fees of $2,365,000 (2011: $2,809,000) and 
interest income of $4,060,000 (2011: $4,622,000).

Section 5 – Results for the year 
  
 
5.3 Share-based payments 
The Company has made equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and directors by way of issues of share 
options. The fair value of these payments is calculated at grant date by the Company using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period from the date of award to the date of vesting, based on the Company’s best estimate of the number of options that will 
eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options expected to vest as a 
result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to 
the share-based payments reserve.  
 
See note 5.3 within the financial statements of the Group 
 
5.4 Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and are measured using the enacted, or substantively enacted, tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are 
expected to reverse. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and an impairment provision is provided if it 
is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not give rise to future benefits in the Company’s tax returns.

be made to offset the deductions represented by those deferred tax assets.  
 
5.5 Earnings per share

6.5 Post balance sheet events 
Acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited 
On 17 January 2013 the Company announced that, following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the 
transaction, it had completed the acquisition of Cabre Maroc Limited (“Cabre”) from Caithness Petroleum Limited. Cabre is a 
Cyprus registered company with oil and gas exploration and production operations in the Kingdom of Morocco. Further details of 
its activities are included in the Operations Review on pages 8 – 15. The purchase of Cabre delivers to Gulfsands a large, 
contiguous and highly prospective acreage position in an area with proven petroleum systems, revenues from near term 
production and multiple drilling targets. 
 
Following completion of the transaction the Company, indirectly, owns the entire issued share capital of Cabre. 
 
The total consideration for the transaction included approximately $17.3 million which was paid in cash to the vendor upon 
completion and $1.7 million paid to settle creditors of Cabre Maroc Limited at the transaction date. In addition the Group has 
committed to the provision to Caithness Petroleum Limited of funding for their portion of certain work programmes to be 
conducted on the Fes and Taounate blocks, totalling approximately $11.0 million.

P+P Proved and Probable reserves  83 | Page 
 
Possible reserves Possible reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data 
suggests are less likely to be recoverable than Probable reserves. The total quantities ultimately 
recovered from the project have a low probability to exceed the sum of Proved plus Probable plus 
Possible (“3P”) reserves, which is equivalent to the high estimate scenario. In this context, when 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be more than a 10% probability that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the 3P estimate. 
Probable reserves Probable reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data 
suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be more than a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed 
the sum of estimated Proved plus Probable reserves. 
Proved reserves Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, 
can be estimated with reasonable certainty (normally over 90% if measured on a probabilistic basis) to be 
commercially recoverable, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under defined economic 
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.

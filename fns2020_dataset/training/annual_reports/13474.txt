2013 Annual report riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 Performance highlights 
2013 financial results focus on greater value for shareholders 
Rio Tinto’s strong results reflect the progress the Group is making to transform the business and demonstrate how  
it is fulfilling its commitments to improve performance, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver results. The Group 
achieved underlying earnings of US$10.2 billion, exceeded cost reduction targets and set production records. In turn, 
this has enhanced cash flow generation and lowered net debt. The 15 per cent increase in the dividend reflects  
Rio Tinto’s confidence in the business and its attractive prospects. 
Underlying earnings of US$10.2 billion were up ten per cent on 2012. 
Operating cash cost improvements of US$2.3 billion exceeded the 2013 target of US$2.0 billion. 
Exploration and evaluation savings delivered US$1 billion, against the 2013 target of US$750 million. 
Production records set for iron ore, bauxite and thermal coal and a strong recovery in copper volumes.  
Iron ore volumes were bolstered by the completion in August of the Pilbara phase one infrastructure expansion  
in Western Australia to 290 Mt/a, with ramp-up on track to reach nameplate capacity before the end of the first  
half of 2014. 
Net earnings of US$3.7 billion reflect non-cash exchange losses of US$2.9 billion and impairments of US$3.4 billion, 
notably the impairment of a previous non-cash accounting uplift on first consolidation of Oyu Tolgoi, a significant 
project cost overrun at Kitimat and the previously announced curtailment of the Gove alumina refinery. 
Cash flows from operations of US$20.1 billion were up 22 per cent and capital expenditure was down 26 per cent  
to US$12.9 billion. 
Net debt reduced to US$18.1 billion at 31 December 2013, US$4.0 billion down on the half year and US$1.1 billion 
down on the previous year end. 
15 per cent increase in full year dividend to 192 US cents per share reflects the sustainable growth of the business.

Navigating through Rio Tinto’s  
Annual and Strategic report 
As of 2013, the UK’s regulatory reporting 
framework requires companies to produce  
a strategic report. The intention is to provide 
investors with the option of receiving a 
document which is more concise than the 
full annual report, and which is strategic in 
its focus.  
The first 40 pages of Rio Tinto’s 2013 
Annual report constitute its 2013 Strategic 
report. References to page numbers beyond 
40 are references to pages in the full 2013 
Annual report. This is available online at 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 or 
shareholders may obtain a hard copy free of 
charge by contacting Rio Tinto’s registrars, 
whose details are set out on the inside back 
cover of this document.   
In light of the new regulatory requirement 
to produce a strategic report in lieu of 
summary financial statements, and the 
Group’s focus on delivering greater value  
for shareholders, Rio Tinto is no longer 
producing an Annual review. Please visit  
Rio Tinto’s website to learn more about  
the Group’s performance in 2013.   
 
This Annual report, which includes the Group’s 
2013 Strategic report, complies with Australian  
and UK reporting requirements. 
Copies of Rio Tinto’s shareholder documents – the 
2013 Annual report and 2013 Strategic report, along

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Introduction to Rio Tinto 
Rio Tinto is a leading global mining group that focuses on finding, mining and 
processing the Earth’s mineral resources. Our vision is to be a company that  
is admired and respected for delivering superior value, as the industry’s most 
trusted partner. 
With a view to sustaining returns to shareholders over time, we take a long-
term approach to our activities. This means concentrating on developing  
Tier 1 orebodies into long-life, low-cost, expandable operations that are  
capable of providing competitive returns throughout business cycles. 
We have a diverse portfolio and a global presence: our 66,000 people work  
in more than 40 countries. Our five product groups summarised below are 
supported by our Exploration and Technology & Innovation groups (also see 
pages 26 to 37). We are committed to creating a culture of high performance – 
providing challenging work and opportunities to grow, and rewarding those  
who help deliver superior value. 
Sustainable development is integrated into everything we do. Our operations 
give us the opportunity to bring long-lasting positive change to the 
communities, regions and countries in which we work, and our metals  
and minerals are transformed into end products that contribute to higher  
living standards. 
The safety of our people, and our values – accountability, respect, teamwork 
and integrity – are at the core of our way of working. Our responsible approach 
to mineral development ensures we gain and maintain our licence to operate.  
It means we provide confidence to our stakeholders, and improve our access  
to the mineral resources, people and capital we need. 
Aluminium product group 
Building on more than a century of experience and expertise, Rio Tinto Alcan  
is a global leader in the aluminium industry. Our fully-integrated facilities 
include high-quality bauxite mines, large-scale alumina refineries, and  
some of the world’s lowest-cost, most technologically-advanced primary  
aluminium smelters. 
Products 
Bauxite 
Bauxite is the natural ore used to make aluminium. It is refined into alumina 
which is smelted into aluminium metal. Our wholly-owned and joint venture 
bauxite mines are located in Australia, Brazil and Guinea. 
Alumina 
Alumina (aluminium oxide) is extracted from bauxite via a refining process. 
Approximately four tonnes of bauxite are required to produce two tonnes of 
alumina, which in turn makes one tonne of aluminium metal. Our wholly-
owned and joint venture alumina refineries are located in Australia, Brazil  
and Canada. 
Aluminium 
Aluminium is a unique and versatile modern metal. Light, strong, flexible,  
non-corrosive and infinitely recyclable, aluminium is one of the most widely-
used metals in the world. Its largest markets are transportation, machinery  
and construction. Our smelters are mainly concentrated in Canada. We also 
have plants in France, Australia, New Zealand, Cameroon, Iceland, Norway,  
the UK and Oman. 
Strategic advantages 
Access to the largest and best-quality bauxite reserves in the industry. 
Strong hydropower position, which delivers significant cost and other 
advantages in today’s carbon-constrained world.  
Rio Tinto Alcan has a first-quartile cost position for aluminium smelting,  
with industry-leading smelting technology, and a solid second-quartile  
cost position for alumina refining. 
One of the lowest-cost quartile bauxite producers.

Copper product group 
Rio Tinto’s Copper product group is made up of four operating assets and  
two key development projects. Our operating assets are world-class and  
our project pipeline of longer-term opportunities will help ensure we will  
continue to be well positioned to meet demand for one of the world’s  
most sought-after resources. 
Products 
Copper 
The world uses more than 26 million tonnes of copper every year.  
It is malleable, durable, resistant to corrosion, hygienic and an excellent 
conductor of heat and electricity, making it useful in a broad range of building, 
construction and electrical applications. Copper is a metal at the forefront  
of green innovation. Hybrid and electric cars rely on it, as do renewable  
energy sources such as solar power, wind farms, thermal and hydroelectricity. 
Copper is known for its antibacterial properties and is increasingly used in 
hospitals and other medical facilities. 
Gold 
Gold’s conductivity and non-corrosive properties make it a vital fabrication 
material in technology, electronics, jewellery, space exploration and dentistry. 
We are one of the world’s top 15 gold producers, and the largest among  
the diversified miners. We have interests in two copper-gold mines that  
rank among the world’s largest gold resources, at Oyu Tolgoi and Grasberg. 
Silver 
Silver has very good electrical and thermal properties. It is used in many 
electrical and electronic applications, such as photovoltaic cells, and is the 
principal ingredient of x-ray film. Silver is also regarded as a precious metal 
used for investment and in jewellery. 
Molybdenum 
Molybdenum is a metallic element frequently used to produce stainless steel 
and other metal alloys. It enhances the metal’s toughness, high-temperature 
strength and corrosion resistance. 
Strategic advantages  
A phased and structured approach to development investment, while 
maintaining optionality. 
Participation in, and ownership of, large, long-life, low-cost and expandable 
assets, with the potential to generate substantial and sustainable value. 
Industry-leading technology and innovation.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Chairman’s letter 
Dear shareholders, 
In 2013 your company was focused on improving the performance of the  
business, strengthening capital allocation processes and reducing our level of 
indebtedness – all with a view to ensuring a greater commitment to creating 
real value for shareholders.  
I am pleased to report that substantial progress had been made on meeting 
these priorities. We achieved underlying earnings of US$10.2 billion and 
significantly improved cash flow by 22 per cent over 2012. We exceeded  
our cost reduction targets and set production records. Our net earnings 
performance of US$3.7 billion takes account of non-cash exchange rate losses 
and impairments.  
We are deeply saddened by the deaths of three of our employees at our 
managed sites last year and improving safety at all of our operations during  
the year ahead is of paramount importance. 
Our overall performance gave the board the confidence to raise the 2013 full 
year dividend by 15 per cent. This increased dividend represents an important 
milestone on the road to improved shareholder value. 
Stronger business, creating options  
During 2013 greater discipline and accountability was restored throughout  
the business, particularly in the allocation and management of capital.  
We simplified and strengthened our systems in this area and improved  
decision-making capability across the organisation.  
Your board regularly evaluates opportunities put forward by the business 
against all competing uses for cash, striving to achieve the right balance 
between disciplined investment, strengthening our balance sheet and  
returning cash to investors. 
The reduction in our net debt during 2013 is an indication of our commitment 
to a stronger balance sheet and provides flexibility in terms of returns and 
investment. We are building more resilience in our business, which gives  
your board greater flexibility to respond to macroeconomic developments  
as they arise. 
Strategy development and disciplined delivery 
During the year your board supported Sam Walsh on the implementation of his 
plan to improve performance, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver results. 
We worked with him on reviewing the company’s strategy and reaffirmed our 
commitment to invest in and operate long-life, low-cost, expandable mines  
and businesses. The board also took the time to visit our world-class iron ore 
operations in the Pilbara in Western Australia to get a deeper understanding  
of the strategic and operational issues at play. 
Sam, his executive team, and all of our 66,000 employees across the world have 
worked hard during a challenging year and made a large contribution to restore 
the company to a position of strength. I thank all of our people for their efforts 
and commend Sam for this leadership during a tough time. But there is more 
we must do. 
Amidst continued market uncertainty, impacts of quantitative easing  
and austerity programmes still washing through markets around the world, 
your board has tasked the executive team with ensuring they successfully 
execute our strategy and make sure the gains delivered are sustained. The 
discipline of 2013 must be carried forward into the year ahead and beyond,  
with a specific focus on delivering our growth projects and producing further 
productivity improvements at all of our sites. 
As geopolitical and social risk increase, we remain convinced that businesses 
which form effective relationships and partnerships around the world will 
prosper over the longer term. Rio Tinto has always taken its role as a 
responsible business very seriously and throughout the year ahead we will 
continue to build our capabilities in stakeholder engagement and sustainable 
development. We believe earning the trust of our host communities and 
governments is vital in creating sustainable shareholder value.  
Maintaining good governance 
Good governance is essential for the long-term success of the Group. In 2013, 
we have seen a greater level of focus, discipline and accountability throughout 
the organisation. This continues to be underpinned by your board’s oversight  
of a robust corporate governance framework to support our business and 
strategic delivery.  
My role as chairman is to lead the board and to ensure it is focused on its 
oversight of management and the delivery of our strategy. Sam Walsh’s role  
as chief executive is to focus on sustained operational excellence and growth  
of the business – and to do so with safety top of mind. Our roles are 
complementary but distinct. The separation of executive and non-executive 
accountabilities is essential to good governance: the executives have an 
operational role, whereas the non-executives have an oversight role, ensuring 
accountability and exercising strong and deliberate challenge through the 
board decision-making process to ensure appropriate control mechanisms  
are in place to safely implement our strategy and plans.  
Your board devotes much of its time to reviewing, debating and challenging 
proposals for investment from management, as well as dealing with a wide 
range of other issues including safety and the Group’s strategic direction, 
monitoring business performance, optimising capital allocation and expenditure 
whilst carefully evaluating the wide range of risks facing the business.  
Leadership 
Leadership is critical at all levels – at board level, at executive level, and 
throughout the business. We are committed to effective succession planning  
at both the board and executive level. My goal is to make sure your board 
combines the diverse blend of skills and international experience that is 
available to it now and to enhance it further for the future. Rio Tinto’s board 
should have the best blend of appropriately skilled and experienced people 
from our industry, but also outside of it.  
2013 saw a number of changes to the executive team, starting with the 
appointment of Sam Walsh as chief executive. Following Guy Elliott’s decision 
to retire at the end of 2013, your board appointed Chris Lynch as chief financial 
officer with effect from April 2013. The board announced the promotion of  
Jean-Sébastien Jacques as chief executive, Copper, following Andrew Harding’s 
move to become chief executive, Iron Ore and appointed Greg Lilleyman as 
Group executive, Technology & Innovation with effect from 1 January 2014, 
following the retirement of Preston Chiaro from the Executive Committee  
at the end of 2013. 
Preston retires as an executive on 1 April 2014. I would like to thank  
Guy and Preston for their significant contributions to Rio Tinto over their many 
years with the Group and we wish them well in their retirement as executives. 
Moving forward, I am very pleased to announce today the appointment of  
two new non-executive directors. Anne Lauvergeon and Simon Thompson will 
bring a wealth of experience to your board given their combined experience  
in a number of leading international businesses. We also announced today  
that Vivienne Cox will stand down at the end of the annual general meeting  
in London in April, after nine years on the board. I would like to thank Vivienne 
for her significant contribution to Rio Tinto over this time and wish her well  
for the future. 
We are a balanced and diverse board, comprising myself as chairman, two 
executive directors and eight (soon to be nine after the new appointments and 
Vivienne Cox’s retirement) independent non-executive directors, all of whom 
are rigorously assessed to ensure they continue to meet strict independence 
criteria. The directors bring with them truly international experience from a  
wide range of professional, business and public office backgrounds.

oversight of management and the delivery of our strategy. Sam Walsh’s role  
as chief executive is to focus on sustained operational excellence and growth  
of the business – and to do so with safety top of mind. Our roles are 
complementary but distinct. The separation of executive and non-executive 
accountabilities is essential to good governance: the executives have an 
operational role, whereas the non-executives have an oversight role, ensuring 
accountability and exercising strong and deliberate challenge through the 
board decision-making process to ensure appropriate control mechanisms  
are in place to safely implement our strategy and plans.  
Your board devotes much of its time to reviewing, debating and challenging 
proposals for investment from management, as well as dealing with a wide 
range of other issues including safety and the Group’s strategic direction, 
monitoring business performance, optimising capital allocation and expenditure 
whilst carefully evaluating the wide range of risks facing the business.  
Leadership 
Leadership is critical at all levels – at board level, at executive level, and 
throughout the business. We are committed to effective succession planning  
at both the board and executive level. My goal is to make sure your board 
combines the diverse blend of skills and international experience that is 
available to it now and to enhance it further for the future. Rio Tinto’s board 
should have the best blend of appropriately skilled and experienced people 
from our industry, but also outside of it.  
2013 saw a number of changes to the executive team, starting with the 
appointment of Sam Walsh as chief executive. Following Guy Elliott’s decision 
to retire at the end of 2013, your board appointed Chris Lynch as chief financial 
officer with effect from April 2013. The board announced the promotion of  
Jean-Sébastien Jacques as chief executive, Copper, following Andrew Harding’s 
move to become chief executive, Iron Ore and appointed Greg Lilleyman as 
Group executive, Technology & Innovation with effect from 1 January 2014, 
following the retirement of Preston Chiaro from the Executive Committee  
at the end of 2013. 
Preston retires as an executive on 1 April 2014. I would like to thank  
Guy and Preston for their significant contributions to Rio Tinto over their many 
years with the Group and we wish them well in their retirement as executives. 
Moving forward, I am very pleased to announce today the appointment of  
two new non-executive directors. Anne Lauvergeon and Simon Thompson will 
bring a wealth of experience to your board given their combined experience  
in a number of leading international businesses. We also announced today  
that Vivienne Cox will stand down at the end of the annual general meeting  
in London in April, after nine years on the board. I would like to thank Vivienne 
for her significant contribution to Rio Tinto over this time and wish her well  
for the future. 
We are a balanced and diverse board, comprising myself as chairman, two 
executive directors and eight (soon to be nine after the new appointments and 
Vivienne Cox’s retirement) independent non-executive directors, all of whom 
are rigorously assessed to ensure they continue to meet strict independence 
criteria. The directors bring with them truly international experience from a  
wide range of professional, business and public office backgrounds.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Rio Tinto’s turnaround on track 
Rio Tinto is a truly great business with renewed vigour and purpose,  
focused on delivering greater shareholder value.  
Dear shareholders, 
2013 was a challenging and very rewarding year for Rio Tinto. I was proud  
to be appointed chief executive of your company a year ago at a time when 
shareholders had lost some confidence in the business. Change was needed. 
Trust and confidence in management had to be rebuilt. While I was determined 
that Rio Tinto would not repeat the mistakes of the past, I also recognised the 
solid foundations of an outstanding company with extremely good people  
and assets.  
Transforming our business to focus on greater value for shareholders 
So, while Rio Tinto was in many ways an outstanding business, we needed to 
refocus on meeting the expectations of the owners of our company. I defined 
our 2013 goal as delivering greater value for our shareholders and during the 
year, I personally met with and listened to hundreds of investors and analysts, 
as well as our employees, customers and suppliers across the world.  
They all told me, we want to see Rio Tinto return to a position of strength. 
Similarly, I too want Rio Tinto to be a company admired and recognised not  
just for superior performance but for embodying our values in all that we do.  
In February 2013, I set out my plan to improve and build upon the strong 
foundations of the company. This included creating a tightly-run, and more 
disciplined and accountable business. In 2013, we have done just this and 
forged ahead with a single-minded emphasis on delivering our priorities to 
improve performance, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver results in  
every market in which we operate, everywhere around the world. 
Our performance in 2013 reflects the efforts of all of our 66,000 employees  
to turn this business around. I am humbled by the enthusiasm, passion and 
talent I have seen, and the willingness of all our people to embrace the change 
required and improve performance. Against a backdrop of continuing market 
uncertainty, we have improved earnings and cash flows. We have reduced 
costs, net debt and capital expenditure. We have delivered greater value for 
you, our shareholders, which is reflected in the 15 per cent increase in our  
2013 full year dividend.  
In short, last year, we did what we said we would do. But we are restless to 
improve further. Our 2013 net earnings reflected impairments on some of  
our assets and we are absolutely focused on making sure we improve project 
execution and deliver further business improvements. This, together with 
improving our safety performance, will be our continuing focus in 2014. 
Building a safer business 
While we can look back with pride at the many successes we delivered in 2013, 
we failed to meet our critical goal of no fatalities in our business. Three of our 
colleagues died working at Rio Tinto managed operations last year. Thirty seven 
people died at non-managed operations, including 33 at the Grasberg mine in 
Papua, Indonesia. These are terrible tragedies. With regard to Grasberg, we are 
continuing to work with our joint venture partner to share our safety capabilities 
and learnings so we can both improve our safety performance, and this process 
is ongoing.  
All of these deaths weigh heavily on me personally and I, and my management 
team, feel enormous sorrow for the families and friends of these colleagues. I 
was also deeply saddened by a further fatality at Grasberg and another at the 
Gove refinery this year. I am determined that we will turn our safety 
performance around. We have made significant gains over the course of our 
safety journey but we have more to do. Strong safety leadership, improved 
management of critical risks, and learning from all significant incidents are of 
paramount importance.  
Delivering our strategy  
We are still operating in a volatile macroeconomic environment. Despite more 
optimistic signs coming through from OECD economies, and growth remaining 
relatively strong in developing economies, the underlying structural fragilities 
remain. With volatility expected to continue over the short term, we will stand 
by the priorities we set for ourselves a year ago: to improve performance, 
strengthen the balance sheet and deliver results. These priorities have already 
proved effective in making us a more robust organisation, and with continuing 
focus, we will grow stronger still. 
1. Improving performance 
We exceeded our targets for reducing operating cash costs and exploration  
and evaluation expenditure in 2013. These results demonstrate the exceptional 
work being done across the business to address our cost base. These efforts  
will continue in 2014, in order to reach a US$3 billion improvement in operating 
cash costs versus 2012. Our aim is to sustain exploration and evaluation spend 
at around 2013 levels in 2014 and beyond. 
Our 2013 performance was further bolstered by increased production.  
We set new production records in bauxite, thermal coal and iron ore, and  
across the Group, our total production grew by nine per cent in 2013 on a 
copper equivalent basis. Our focus on productivity will persist in 2014, in 
tandem with our keen eye on costs. Our efforts to reduce costs and increase 
performance, resulted in improved underlying earnings of US$10.2 billion,  
up ten per cent on 2012. 
2. Strengthening our balance sheet 
The excellent performance achieved in reducing costs, together with volume 
growth, is leading to stronger cash flows. Combined with cash inflows from 
divestments and lower capital expenditure, we were more than able to reverse 
the increase in net debt we saw in the first half of the year. 
In November, we announced our breakthrough pathway for expanding our 
Pilbara operations towards 360 million tonnes per annum at a US$3 billion 
lower capital cost than previously planned. This is a clear example of our 
disciplined approach to capital allocation. I am confident we have stronger, 
stricter processes in place for how we allocate capital. As we move forward  
with reinforced systems embedded at the core of our investment approach,  
you have my absolute commitment that each and every dollar we are investing 
on your behalf is being rigorously scrutinised. 
Our focus for the year ahead will be to continue to pay down debt and further 
strengthen the balance sheet. Our aim is to provide the board with options for 
how best to deliver value to you, whether this is through value-accretive growth, 
or returning cash, or a combination of both. 
3. Delivering results 
In keeping with our strategy, 2013 saw the completion of five major capital 
projects that have already started delivering results: the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold 
mine; the first phase of our Pilbara iron ore expansion; the Argyle underground 
diamond mine; the Kestrel coal mine extension; and the AP60 aluminium 
smelter. We expect to deliver strong returns from these key assets in our 
portfolio over the coming years. 
Ongoing commitment 
In 2013 we rose to the challenge and navigated difficult times to emerge as  
a leaner and much stronger company. 2014 will be about locking in the gains 
achieved last year and continuing to strengthen the business. 
I would like to close by paying tribute to all of our employees across the world. 
Without their efforts we would not have been able to turn around the performance 
of the business and I am energised by the effort, enthusiasm and passion for 
improvement which I have seen first-hand in every part of our organisation. Over 
the next 12 months and beyond we will remain focused on safety and upholding 
our values wherever we operate in the world. Above all, we will continue our 
single-minded focus on delivering greater value for you, our shareholders.

The board committees have always played an important oversight role, freeing 
your board to focus on strategic matters. The board committees, under the 
effective leadership of their respective chairs, carry out important and 
demanding roles on your board’s behalf and facilitate the embedding of 
effective governance across the organisation. You can read more about the 
work that they do on pages 61 to 63. 
The 2013 board and committee performance is described on page 58. I remain 
comfortable with the effectiveness of your board and the contribution each 
member of your board is making. 
Looking ahead 
I feel very privileged to be the chairman of this wonderful organisation.  
Rio Tinto had to make some significant changes over the last year. Through our 
transformation we are a simpler and stronger company. Through our improved 
earnings and reduced costs we are financially stronger. Through our actions we 
are reducing risk and increasing discipline. Our strategy and priorities are clear.  
I see great opportunities ahead as we build a long-term future for our business. 
The work we do is important, we provide the raw materials used in everyday life 
and as hundreds of millions of people move from rural to urban areas over the 
coming decades, there will be increased demand for the metals and minerals 
we produce.  
I look forward to reporting on the further progress of your company in  
a year’s time.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
External pressures 
The mining industry is cyclical and, following a decade-long growth phase, it is 
now experiencing a period of lower prices and compressed margins. Meanwhile, 
volatility – a characteristic of the macroeconomic environment since the global 
financial crisis – has been ongoing and is expected to continue, bringing with it 
further short-term risk. 
Our response to this has been to focus on costs, cash flow and capital 
discipline. Others in the sector have embarked upon similar paths. Inefficiencies 
are also being exposed, and so reductions in costs and capital expenditure, 
productivity improvements, and project deferrals and cancellations have 
become a prominent part of mining industry strategy. 
Despite the uncertain conditions that we currently face, the long-term outlook 
for our sector remains positive.  
The world’s population is forecast to increase by 30 per cent in the next  
40 years. Seventy million people enter the middle classes every year. In  
China alone, around 170 million people are expected to move to an urban 
environment by 2025. These factors are driving demand for the minerals and 
metals we produce, as essential ingredients of modern life. They make our 
business a good and valuable one to be in.  
Consistent strategy, sharper focus 
Rio Tinto’s vision is to be a company that is admired and respected for 
delivering superior value as the industry’s most trusted partner. 
The world we operate in today, and the future we are preparing for, require us  
to have a clear and consistent strategy. In 2013, we reaffirmed our direction of 
travel and recommitted to the strategy that has worked for us for many years: 
to invest in and operate long-life, low-cost, expandable operations in the most 
attractive industry sectors. This strategy will allow us to take advantage of the 
opportunities ahead, and we are confident that it is the right one for Rio Tinto. 
In 2013 we reset our focus on executing the strategy by becoming a leaner, 
more cash-oriented and tightly-run business. We refocused our Group  
on improving performance, strengthening our balance sheet, and delivering 
results – to deliver greater value for shareholders.  
We are doing what we said we would: reliably and relentlessly executing our 
strategy. We are making every dollar count, looking for ways to do things safer, 
smarter and better, and ensuring that we only invest in activities that add value.  
2013 marked our 140th year in business. We have been around this long  
by being very good at what we do. Looking to the future, disciplined execution 
of our strategy is vital to building on our recent successes, and our industry-
leading capabilities will equip us to do this. 
We have world-class people and assets, and have developed pioneering  
and industry-leading systems and technologies. We pride ourselves on being 
innovative – finding solutions that help us operate more efficiently, sustainably 
and responsibly. We are recognised and respected for our exploration and 
operations expertise, for our values and our commitment to safety, and for 
creating benefits for our diverse stakeholders.  
While these things will not change, our sharpened focus aims to transform  
us into the highest performer in our sector and will make sure we are fighting  
fit for the next 140 years and beyond.

riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Global economy 
The global economy grew by just three per cent in 2013. Yet, there is a  
strong sense that developed economies are finally on the path to a more robust 
recovery. Significant growth headwinds remain in the form of continued fiscal 
contraction and high debt levels, but construction and manufacturing activity  
is improving and supporting labour markets. This renewed momentum appears 
strongest in the US with growth in parts of Europe still proving more hesitant. 
The improved US outlook led the Federal Reserve to start tapering its 
accommodative Quantitative Easing (QE) programme towards the end of 2013, 
with indirect implications for emerging markets. Loose monetary policies in the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 
are believed to have supported investment and growth in developing 
economies, putting the short-term growth outlook in these countries at  
risk from changing money flows. Asian economies risk seeing this effect 
compounded by a structural, although very gradual, slowdown in China’s 
economic expansion. 
Having firmly established itself over the past year, China’s new leadership  
set the agenda for a gradual reform process at the Third Plenum meetings  
in November 2013. After several years of growth dominated by investment,  
the country’s economic growth model is beginning to rebalance towards 
consumption. This process poses significant challenges for the new 
government, with scope for a volatile transition period. While planned reforms 
should gradually deliver a more sustainable growth model, the pace of growth 
is expected to continue to slow. More importantly, slowing growth is now 
acknowledged by the leadership as inevitable and necessary. As demonstrated 
in 2013, China’s central government is likely to be more considered and 
cautious in future policy responses to cyclical growth weakness. Fiscal support 
for investment and associated short-term spikes in commodity demand are 
expected to be less frequent and smaller in scale. 
Financial markets were less volatile in 2013, and the risk of shocks in Europe 
much less pronounced than the previous year. Nevertheless, several macro 
risks still simmer under the surface, with the potential to derail the more 
positive short-term global outlook at any time. The US government shutdown  
in late 2013 and protracted negotiations over the debt ceiling are a further 
reflection of the challenges to bringing US sovereign debt back onto a  
more sustainable path. Similar tensions extend to Europe where, although 
intervention from the European Central Bank returned bond yields to more 
manageable levels, the pace of reforms and structural readjustments necessary 
for a sustainable monetary union remains slow. Meanwhile, the unwinding of 
QE policies represents uncharted territory with many potential pitfalls including 
inflation, significant bond market sell-offs and the formation of new asset 
bubbles. Added to the uncertainty around China’s reform process and 
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the impact of these key US and 
European macro risks on future market volatility should not be discounted. 
Short-term consensus expectations about India’s growth prospects have  
been revised downward over the past year, reflecting concerns over the pace of 
reforms, monetary and fiscal policies and lagging infrastructure development. 
However, looking further into the future, the rising prosperity in Asia and other 
emerging markets remains the main global economic trend of relevance to the 
mining industry. We continue to believe that this will ultimately help to support 
and sustain an elevated level of global economic growth and commodity 
demand over the next couple of decades.  
Drivers of commodity prices 
Long-term structural economic trends are important drivers of future 
commodity prices through their effects on commodity demand. The economic 
development and urbanisation of emerging countries goes through an initial 
investment-led growth phase, which is particularly commodity-intensive.  
This benefits commodities such as steel and copper used in construction and 
infrastructure applications. The structure of economies evolves through time 
and, as the capital stock matures, other commodities such as aluminium, 
energy products and industrial minerals tend to take over as the main enablers 
of consumption-led growth models. 
While the macroeconomic environment provides a common demand context, 
supply-side factors can result in stark structural differences across commodity 
sectors. In principle, commodity prices will tend to have a relationship with  
the cost of developing and extracting metal and mineral resources. However, 
the exact nature of that relationship will depend on barriers to entry and exit, 
which are specific to each sector. 
Across many commodity sectors, the general supply trends in recent years 
have pointed towards fewer discoveries, falling ore grades and maturing existing 
operations as well as greater complexity of projects and of non-developed 
orebodies. Technology trends are likely to offer some long-term solutions  
to these supply challenges, but it is also likely that prices above historical  
levels will be required for markets to balance the structural demand and  
supply trends. 
Commodity markets 
After several years of elevated prices and record investment by mining 
companies, supply for several commodities has finally started to catch up  
with demand, at least temporarily. Better-supplied commodity markets have 
resulted in downward pressures on some prices during 2013, for example on 
thermal and coking coal. Despite strong Chinese imports, prices for both 
commodities were down 12 per cent and 22 per cent respectively from 2012 
levels. Similar trends have been seen for base metals, although price declines 
in 2013 were more moderate. Mined copper supply is starting to expand at  
a faster pace than demand after a long period of constrained and disrupted 
output growth. In the case of aluminium, there are still no signs of inventories 
falling, as capacity expansions in western China and the Middle East have 
outweighed the curtailment of higher-cost smelters. In 2013, prices of 
exchange-traded metals were also influenced by shifting market expectations 
on QE tapering. This effect was particularly pronounced in the gold market, 
where some large daily price corrections resulted in an overall 27 per cent 
decline between the start and end of the year. 
Contrary to consensus expectations at the start of 2013, the iron ore market  
has so far been one of the most resilient to the commissioning of new supply. 
Major iron ore producers added about 100 million tonnes per annum of new 
seaborne capacity last year without the market experiencing a significant price 
correction. In fact, not only did iron ore prices average four per cent above 2012 
levels at US$135/t delivered to China, they also displayed much less volatility 
throughout 2013 compared to the cycles that this market had become 
accustomed to since the global financial crisis. The steady iron ore price 
performance reflected sustained elevated steel output levels in China during 
most of 2013. Chinese steel demand growth of about seven to eight per cent 
last year highlighted the continued gap in construction and infrastructure  
needs in second and third tier cities and in western provinces. 
The generally softer price environment and stronger supply growth have  
refocused the mining industry on dealing with margin compression in 2013. 
Across the industry, mining companies are reprioritising cost improvements 
and productivity initiatives, and cutting back on capital expenditure plans.  
Outlook 
On balance, the short-term economic outlook points to a further consolidation 
of the global recovery as we start 2014. However, macro risks abound and the 
potential for continued volatility remains significant. In the mining industry this 
is likely to drive further prudent investment behaviours while new supply gets 
absorbed by the market. Looking to the future, our view remains that there  
will be a high average demand growth setting for our markets and that the 
complexity of future mining projects will continue to increase.

External pressures 
The mining industry is cyclical and, following a decade-long growth phase, it is 
now experiencing a period of lower prices and compressed margins. Meanwhile, 
volatility – a characteristic of the macroeconomic environment since the global 
financial crisis – has been ongoing and is expected to continue, bringing with it 
further short-term risk. 
Our response to this has been to focus on costs, cash flow and capital 
discipline. Others in the sector have embarked upon similar paths. Inefficiencies 
are also being exposed, and so reductions in costs and capital expenditure, 
productivity improvements, and project deferrals and cancellations have 
become a prominent part of mining industry strategy. 
Despite the uncertain conditions that we currently face, the long-term outlook 
for our sector remains positive.  
The world’s population is forecast to increase by 30 per cent in the next  
40 years. Seventy million people enter the middle classes every year. In  
China alone, around 170 million people are expected to move to an urban 
environment by 2025. These factors are driving demand for the minerals and 
metals we produce, as essential ingredients of modern life. They make our 
business a good and valuable one to be in.  
Consistent strategy, sharper focus 
Rio Tinto’s vision is to be a company that is admired and respected for 
delivering superior value as the industry’s most trusted partner. 
The world we operate in today, and the future we are preparing for, require us  
to have a clear and consistent strategy. In 2013, we reaffirmed our direction of 
travel and recommitted to the strategy that has worked for us for many years: 
to invest in and operate long-life, low-cost, expandable operations in the most 
attractive industry sectors. This strategy will allow us to take advantage of the 
opportunities ahead, and we are confident that it is the right one for Rio Tinto. 
In 2013 we reset our focus on executing the strategy by becoming a leaner, 
more cash-oriented and tightly-run business. We refocused our Group  
on improving performance, strengthening our balance sheet, and delivering 
results – to deliver greater value for shareholders.  
We are doing what we said we would: reliably and relentlessly executing our 
strategy. We are making every dollar count, looking for ways to do things safer, 
smarter and better, and ensuring that we only invest in activities that add value.  
2013 marked our 140th year in business. We have been around this long  
by being very good at what we do. Looking to the future, disciplined execution 
of our strategy is vital to building on our recent successes, and our industry-
leading capabilities will equip us to do this. 
We have world-class people and assets, and have developed pioneering  
and industry-leading systems and technologies. We pride ourselves on being 
innovative – finding solutions that help us operate more efficiently, sustainably 
and responsibly. We are recognised and respected for our exploration and 
operations expertise, for our values and our commitment to safety, and for 
creating benefits for our diverse stakeholders.  
While these things will not change, our sharpened focus aims to transform  
us into the highest performer in our sector and will make sure we are fighting  
fit for the next 140 years and beyond.

Global economy 
The global economy grew by just three per cent in 2013. Yet, there is a  
strong sense that developed economies are finally on the path to a more robust 
recovery. Significant growth headwinds remain in the form of continued fiscal 
contraction and high debt levels, but construction and manufacturing activity  
is improving and supporting labour markets. This renewed momentum appears 
strongest in the US with growth in parts of Europe still proving more hesitant. 
The improved US outlook led the Federal Reserve to start tapering its 
accommodative Quantitative Easing (QE) programme towards the end of 2013, 
with indirect implications for emerging markets. Loose monetary policies in the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 
are believed to have supported investment and growth in developing 
economies, putting the short-term growth outlook in these countries at  
risk from changing money flows. Asian economies risk seeing this effect

How we create value 
We create and preserve value by investing in and operating long-life, low-cost, 
expandable operations in the most attractive industry sectors. From the earliest 
stages of exploration, during our assets’ productive lives, and throughout the 
closure and restoration phase beyond, we commit to high standards of 
sustainable development. Read more on pages 18 to 25. 
Explore and evaluate 
Our experienced in-house exploration team has a proven track record of 
discovering Tier 1 orebodies: the highest-value deposits that are profitable 
throughout the commodity cycle. 
We maximise opportunities by exploring for and evaluating deposits in new 
geographies (such as the La Granja copper project in Peru). We also explore  
the orbits of our current operations (like the Caliwingina iron ore resource in  
the Pilbara), which sustains the value of our existing businesses. We operate  
the majority of exploration programmes ourselves rather than outsourcing, so 
we can keep focus on targets that are important to Rio Tinto. We will, however, 
partner with others if it gives us access to attractive opportunities, or skills, that 
we do not possess in-house. 
Our orebody knowledge allows us to find value-enhancing ways of developing 
our resources and positioning our products in the market. Our geological 
expertise gives us the confidence to keep hunting for the most elusive 
discoveries. And we have a strong tradition of developing and applying 
innovative technologies to resolve specific exploration challenges. 
Develop 
We develop orebodies for long-term value delivery. We aim to deliver projects 
on time and on budget – such as commissioning the first major expansion 
phase of our Pilbara iron ore operations and the Oyu Tolgoi concentrator in 
2013. Through our reinforced capital allocation process, we approve investment 
only in assets that, after prudent assessment, offer attractive returns that are 
well above our cost of capital.  
During this phase, we plan the most efficient configuration for developing  
the orebody and for getting the products to market. We work closely and 
strategically with our customers, to create demand for the optimal suite of 
products, thus maximising value over the deposit’s lifetime. Once the value  
of the resource is confirmed, and internal and external approvals are received, 
the project moves into implementation and construction. 
Mine and process 
We create value by safely and efficiently operating assets that fit with our  
Group strategy. Our global operating model allows us to implement standard 
processes and systems across the Group, for instance in procurement, 
operations and maintenance. This globally-consistent approach reduces our 
use of consumables, increases the life of our equipment and optimises the 
extraction of ore. In turn, we enjoy higher production and reduced costs, and  
we maximise value.  
We use world-class technologies during mining and processing to increase  
our efficiency and productivity, and to produce material that is tailored to our 
customers’ needs. Through networked partnering with academia, technology 
suppliers and other experts, we gain access to knowledge and technical 
prowess that augment our own capabilities. 
Market and deliver 
Our diverse portfolio of metals and minerals allows us to respond to demand 
across the development cycle: we supply basic raw materials and refined 
products that are the building blocks of added-value goods. Most of our 
customers are industrial companies that process our products further  
and supply numerous sectors – including construction and infrastructure, 
automotive, machinery, energy and consumer goods.  
We innovate and improve our products and services to maximise value to 
customers. We are constantly adding to our market knowledge, allowing us  
to improve our investment decision-making process. In many cases, we are 
responsible for delivering product to our customers, and do so efficiently, 
reliably and cost-effectively. We have significant in-house logistical capability, 
including through our own networks of rail, ports and ships. 
Close down and rehabilitate 
We integrate closure planning throughout an asset’s life cycle, from the earliest 
stages of project development. When a resource reaches the end of its life, we 
seek sustainable and beneficial future land uses, to minimise financial, social 
and environmental risks. By partnering with external conservation 
organisations, we access expertise that helps us improve our rehabilitation 
performance. Our approach helps us to maintain a positive reputation for 
sustainable development and ensures we meet the expectations of our current 
and future stakeholders. 
Delivering value for our stakeholders 
Rio Tinto’s primary focus is on the delivery of value for our shareholders.  
We balance disciplined investment with prudent management of our balance 
sheet and cash returns to shareholders. We offer a long-term investment 
opportunity, and commit to sustainable growth in cash returns to shareholders 
through our progressive dividend policy. As we work, fixed on this core aim, our 
activities also give us the opportunity to create value for our other stakeholders, 
in a variety of ways. 
Customers 
We supply our customers with the right products at the right time. They then 
add further value, by turning them into the end products that society needs  
to make modern life work.  
Communities 
Our operations create employment and career development opportunities  
for our local communities, as well as business opportunities for local suppliers. 
Communities often benefit from the infrastructure we put in place to serve our 
facilities and, once our operations are closed, we restore the sites – often for 
community use, new industry, or back to native vegetation. 
Our people 
We invest in our people throughout their careers, offering diverse employment 
prospects, opportunities for development, and competitive rewards and benefits 
that have a clear link to performance. As employees spend their wages, the 
value we share with them is spread more widely. 
Governments 
We are often a major economic contributor to the local, state and national 
jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax and sovereign equity contributions 
enable governments to develop and maintain public works, services and 
institutions. We work together to facilitate growth of diverse and sustainable 
economies that endure far beyond the active life of our operations.  
Suppliers 
By seeking a balance of global, national and local supply capability we drive 
value for our shareholders and deliver economic benefits for the communities 
in which we operate.

extraction of ore. In turn, we enjoy higher production and reduced costs, and  
we maximise value.  
We use world-class technologies during mining and processing to increase  
our efficiency and productivity, and to produce material that is tailored to our 
customers’ needs. Through networked partnering with academia, technology 
suppliers and other experts, we gain access to knowledge and technical 
prowess that augment our own capabilities. 
Market and deliver 
Our diverse portfolio of metals and minerals allows us to respond to demand 
across the development cycle: we supply basic raw materials and refined 
products that are the building blocks of added-value goods. Most of our 
customers are industrial companies that process our products further  
and supply numerous sectors – including construction and infrastructure, 
automotive, machinery, energy and consumer goods.  
We innovate and improve our products and services to maximise value to 
customers. We are constantly adding to our market knowledge, allowing us  
to improve our investment decision-making process. In many cases, we are 
responsible for delivering product to our customers, and do so efficiently, 
reliably and cost-effectively. We have significant in-house logistical capability, 
including through our own networks of rail, ports and ships. 
Close down and rehabilitate 
We integrate closure planning throughout an asset’s life cycle, from the earliest 
stages of project development. When a resource reaches the end of its life, we 
seek sustainable and beneficial future land uses, to minimise financial, social 
and environmental risks. By partnering with external conservation 
organisations, we access expertise that helps us improve our rehabilitation 
performance. Our approach helps us to maintain a positive reputation for 
sustainable development and ensures we meet the expectations of our current 
and future stakeholders. 
Delivering value for our stakeholders 
Rio Tinto’s primary focus is on the delivery of value for our shareholders.  
We balance disciplined investment with prudent management of our balance 
sheet and cash returns to shareholders. We offer a long-term investment 
opportunity, and commit to sustainable growth in cash returns to shareholders 
through our progressive dividend policy. As we work, fixed on this core aim, our 
activities also give us the opportunity to create value for our other stakeholders, 
in a variety of ways. 
Customers 
We supply our customers with the right products at the right time. They then 
add further value, by turning them into the end products that society needs  
to make modern life work.  
Communities 
Our operations create employment and career development opportunities  
for our local communities, as well as business opportunities for local suppliers. 
Communities often benefit from the infrastructure we put in place to serve our 
facilities and, once our operations are closed, we restore the sites – often for 
community use, new industry, or back to native vegetation. 
Our people 
We invest in our people throughout their careers, offering diverse employment 
prospects, opportunities for development, and competitive rewards and benefits 
that have a clear link to performance. As employees spend their wages, the 
value we share with them is spread more widely. 
Governments 
We are often a major economic contributor to the local, state and national 
jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax and sovereign equity contributions 
enable governments to develop and maintain public works, services and 
institutions. We work together to facilitate growth of diverse and sustainable 
economies that endure far beyond the active life of our operations.  
Suppliers 
By seeking a balance of global, national and local supply capability we drive 
value for our shareholders and deliver economic benefits for the communities 
in which we operate.

riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Our key performance indicators (KPIs) enable us to measure our financial and sustainable development performance.  
Their relevance to our strategy, and our performance against these measures in 2013, are explained below. 
Some KPIs are used as a measure in the long-term incentive arrangements for remuneration of executives. These are identified with this symbol:

Relevance to strategy The safety of our people is core to 
everything we do. Our goal is zero harm, 
including, above all, the elimination of 
workplace fatalities. We are committed to 
reinforcing our strong safety culture, and 
improving safety leadership.  
This is the key financial performance 
indicator used across the Group. It gives 
insight to cost management, production 
growth and performance efficiency.  
We are focused on reducing our costs  
and increasing productivity to improve 
earnings and deliver greater value  
for shareholders. 
Operating cash flow is a complementary 
measure to underlying earnings. It also 
provides insight to how we are managing 
costs and increasing efficiency and 
productivity across the business. 
  
Performance 
 
  
  Our AIFR has improved by 20 per cent  
over the last five years. We reduced  
our AIFR by three per cent in 2013. 
Underlying earnings have increased  
by US$948 million compared with  
2012. This reflects operating cash cost 
improvements, favourable exchange rates 
and strong volumes offsetting the impact 
of lower average market prices for the 
Group’s commodities (other than Iron Ore) 
and industry-wide cost inflation pressures. 
 
 
 
 
 
Operating cash flows of US$20,131 million, 
which include US$600 million of  
dividends from equity accounted units,  
are 22 per cent higher than in 2012, 
primarily as the result of higher volumes 
and cost reduction initiatives. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Definition AIFR is calculated based on the number  
of injuries per 200,000 hours worked.  
This includes medical treatment cases, 
and restricted work-day and lost-day 
injuries for employees and contractors. 
 
 
 
 
Items excluded from net earnings to arrive 
at underlying earnings are explained in 
note 2 to the 2013 financial statements. 
Operating cash flow represents the cash 
generated by the Group’s consolidated 
operations, before payment of interest, 
taxes, capital expenditure and cash flows 
relating to financing activities.

Notes
(a) The accounting information in these charts is drawn up in accordance with EU IFRS.  
(b) Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator which management  
uses internally to assess performance. It is presented here as a measure of earnings to 
provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of the Group’s 
operations. Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are 
explained in note 2 to the 2013 financial statements. Both net earnings and underlying 
earnings deal with amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. However, EU IFRS 
requires that the profit for the year reported in the income statement should also 
include earnings attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.

  The aim of our strategy is to maximise 
total shareholder return. This KPI 
measures performance in terms of 
shareholder wealth generation. We also 
monitor our relative TSR performance 
against peers. 
Net debt is a measure of how we are 
managing our balance sheet and capital 
structure. We constantly evaluate and 
balance the alternative uses for our cash 
between disciplined investment, 
strengthening our balance sheet, and 
returning cash to investors. 
We are prioritising investment in the 
highest-returning projects in the most 
attractive sectors. We are committed to  
a disciplined and rigorous investment 
process – investing capital only in assets 
that, after prudent assessment, offer 
attractive returns that are well above  
our cost of capital. 
Our GHG performance is important in 
upholding and extending our licence  
to operate. We are focusing on reducing  
the energy intensity of our operations  
as well as the carbon intensity of our 
energy, including through the 
development and implementation of 
innovative technologies. 
  
 
Rio Tinto’s TSR performance over the  
five-year period from 2009 to 2013 was 
characterised by continued volatility in 
global equity markets and commodity 
prices. Total dividends paid in calendar 
year 2013 were 178 US cents per share,  
a nine per cent increase on 2012. Global 
investor sentiment improved in the last 
quarter of the year and both the Rio Tinto 
plc and Rio Tinto Limited share prices 
ended the year close to their opening 
levels. These factors resulted in Rio Tinto 
registering a TSR of 2.1 per cent in 2013. 
Net debt decreased from US$19,192 
million at 31 December 2012 to 
US$18,055 million at 31 December 2013 
as operating cash inflows and divestment 
proceeds fully offset the outflows relating 
to capital expenditure and the increase in 
the dividend payment. 
Capital expenditure of US$12,944 million 
was US$4,631 million lower than in 2012. 
This was mainly due to the completion of 
five major capital projects during the year: 
the Pilbara iron ore infrastructure 
expansion to 290Mt/a; Oyu Tolgoi  
copper-gold mine and concentrator; 
Kestrel coking coal underground  
mine; the Argyle underground diamond 
mine; and the AP60 aluminium smelter 
in Quebec. 
We have reduced our total GHG emission 
intensity by 17.3 per cent between 2008 
and 2013. This is largely a result of the 
Ningxia aluminium smelter divestment  
in 2009, the closure of the Lynemouth 
smelter in 2012, divestment of the  
Sebree smelter in 2013 and improved 
measurement methodology for coal  
seam gas at our Australian coal mines.  
  TSR combines share price appreciation 
and dividends paid to show the total 
return to the shareholder. 
Net debt is calculated as: the net 
borrowings after adjusting for amounts 
due to equity accounted units originally 
funded by Rio Tinto, cash and cash 
equivalents, other liquid resources and 
derivatives related to net debt. This is 
further explained in note 24 
“Consolidated net debt” to the  
2013 financial statements. 
Capital expenditure comprises the net 
cash outflow on purchases less disposals 
of property, plant and equipment, 
capitalised evaluation costs and 
purchases less disposals of other 
intangible assets. 
Our GHG emissions intensity measure  
is the change in total GHG emissions per 
unit of commodity production relative to a 
base year. Total GHG emissions are direct 
emissions, plus emissions from imports  
of electricity and steam, minus electricity 
and steam exports and net carbon  
credits purchased from, or sold to, 
recognised sources.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Cash returns to shareholders 
The aim of Rio Tinto’s progressive dividend policy is to increase the US dollar value of ordinary dividends per share over time. The rate of the total dividend, in  
US dollars per share, is determined annually, taking into account the results for the past year and the outlook for the Group. Under our progressive dividend policy, 
the total dividend for each year should be equal to or greater than the total dividend for the previous year. The interim dividend is set at one half of the total dividend 
for the previous year. 
The full year dividend in respect of 2013 was increased by 15 per cent, to 192 US cents per share, reflecting the board’s confidence in the business and its attractive 
prospects. This follows a 15 per cent increase in the 2012 full year dividend, and a 34 per cent increase for 2011. 
In 2011 and 2012, Rio Tinto bought back US$7 billion of shares. US$5.5 billion of shares were repurchased in 2011 and the remaining US$1.5 billion were 
repurchased in 2012. 
Divestments and acquisitions 
During 2013, Rio Tinto announced or completed US$3.5 billion of divestments, including a binding agreement for the sale of the Clermont thermal coal mine  
in Queensland for just over US$1 billion, due to complete in the first half of 2014.

and the robustness of our balance sheet. This is achieved through an evaluation and prioritisation of the Group’s portfolio of investment opportunities over a number 
of years to determine what will be the best use of capital. 
In 2013, Rio Tinto enhanced the systems and controls in place to ensure that capital expenditure is kept at a suitable level, while continuing to invest in the best 
projects. Key considerations in determining the best use of capital include the progressive dividend policy, and the strength of the balance sheet. This, together  
with financial policies, existing capital commitments and operating cash flow forecasts set the boundaries for how much capital is available for investment.  
In today’s capital-constrained environment, only the highest-returning investments will be approved. The Group analyses each investment based on net present 
value but also considers a number of further factors, including internal rate of return, payback period and risk profile. This suite of ranking criteria, together with  
the application of strategic judgment, ensures that capital is deployed to the best opportunities. 
Rio Tinto’s capital expenditure reduced by 26 per cent to US$12.9 billion in 2013, compared to the peak level in 2012 of US$17.6 billion. It is expected to be reduced 
further to around US$11 billion in 2014.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Cash returns to shareholders 
The aim of Rio Tinto’s progressive dividend policy is to increase the US dollar value of ordinary dividends per share over time. The rate of the total dividend, in  
US dollars per share, is determined annually, taking into account the results for the past year and the outlook for the Group. Under our progressive dividend policy, 
the total dividend for each year should be equal to or greater than the total dividend for the previous year. The interim dividend is set at one half of the total dividend 
for the previous year. 
The full year dividend in respect of 2013 was increased by 15 per cent, to 192 US cents per share, reflecting the board’s confidence in the business and its attractive 
prospects. This follows a 15 per cent increase in the 2012 full year dividend, and a 34 per cent increase for 2011. 
In 2011 and 2012, Rio Tinto bought back US$7 billion of shares. US$5.5 billion of shares were repurchased in 2011 and the remaining US$1.5 billion were 
repurchased in 2012. 
Divestments and acquisitions 
During 2013, Rio Tinto announced or completed US$3.5 billion of divestments, including a binding agreement for the sale of the Clermont thermal coal mine  
in Queensland for just over US$1 billion, due to complete in the first half of 2014.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
External risks 
Factor   Nature 
Commodity prices and global 
demand for the Group’s 
products are expected to 
remain uncertain 
  
Commodity prices and demand are volatile and strongly influenced by world economic conditions. The Group’s normal  
policy is to sell its products at prices that reflect the value of our products in the market and not to enter into price hedging 
arrangements. Recent volatility in commodity prices and demand may continue, which could adversely affect the Group’s 
earnings, cash flow and mineral reserves. The basis on which the Group prices iron ore in Asia is evolving and to the extent  
this results in prices or pricing mechanisms that are less favourable to the Group, its earnings and cash flow could be adversely 
affected. Furthermore, iron ore prices are typically determined on a landed in China basis, and increases in the freight market 
would adversely impact Group earnings. 
Past strong demand for the 
Group’s products in China  
could be affected by future 
developments in that country 
  
The Group is heavily reliant on the Chinese market. A micro-economic slowdown, sudden economic disruption (whether caused 
by sharp curtailment of bank credit or otherwise) or the significant shift from infrastructure-led to consumer spending-focused 
growth could substantially decrease China’s demands for the Group’s commodities, adversely affecting the Group’s profitability 
and cash position.  
Rio Tinto is exposed to 
fluctuations in exchange rates 
  The great majority of the Group’s sales are denominated in US dollars, which is also the currency used for holding surplus 
cash, financing operations, and presenting external and internal results. Although many costs are incurred in US dollars, a 
significant portion are incurred in or influenced by the local currencies of the countries where the Group operates, principally 
the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The Group’s normal policy is to avoid hedging of foreign exchange rates and so the 
Group may be adversely affected by appreciation in the value of other currencies against the US dollar, or to prolonged periods 
of exchange rate volatility. Currency fluctuations may negatively impact the Group’s profitability and dividend payments as well 
as rating agency metrics and asset carrying values. 
Political, legal and commercial 
changes in the places where  
the Group operates 
  The Group has operations in jurisdictions where governments and communities are seeking a greater share of mineral wealth. 
Some operations are conducted under specific agreements with respective governments and associated acts of relevant 
legislative bodies. In several countries, land title and rights to land and resources (including Indigenous title) may be unclear. 
Political and administrative change, policy reform, and changes in law or government regulation can result in expropriation or 
nationalisation of the Group’s rights or assets. In some jurisdictions, commercial instability can arise from a culture of bribery 
and corruption. 
In its operations and development projects, Rio Tinto is exposed to: 
difficulty in obtaining agreements, leases or permits for new activities; 
renegotiation, unilateral variation or nullification of existing agreements, leases and permits; 
changes in government ownership of operations; 
significant restoration and environmental clean-up costs; 
currency and foreign investment restrictions; 
changes in taxation rates, regimes or international tax agreements; 
limitations to power, water, energy and infrastructure access; and 
general increases in regulation, including compliance costs. 
Political instability and uncertainty or government changes to terms applicable to the Group’s operations may result in 
increased costs for the Group, may curtail or negatively impact existing operations and prevent the Group from making  
future investments. 
Community disputes in the 
countries and territories in 
which the Group operates 
  Some of the Group’s current and potential operations are located in or near communities that may regard these operations  
as being detrimental to them. Community expectations are typically complex with the potential for multiple inconsistent 
stakeholder views that may be difficult to resolve. Stakeholder opinion and community acceptance can be subject to many 
influences, for example, related industries, operations of other groups, or local, regional or national events in other places 
where we operate. These disputes can disrupt our operations and may increase our costs, thereby potentially impacting our 
revenue and profitability. In the extreme, our operations may be a focus for civil unrest or criminal activity, which can impact 
our operational and financial performance, as well as our reputation. 
Increased regulation of 
greenhouse gas emissions 
could adversely affect the 
Group’s cost of operations 
  Rio Tinto’s operations are energy-intensive and depend on fossil fuels. Worldwide, there is increasing regulation of greenhouse 
gas emissions, tighter emission reduction targets and progressive introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms. These are likely 
to raise significantly worldwide energy, production and transport costs over the medium to long term, which will increase the 
Group’s cost base and potentially negatively impact the Group’s profitability. 
Regulations, standards and 
stakeholder expectations 
regarding health, safety, 
environment and community 
evolve over time and 
unforeseen changes could  
have an adverse effect on  
the Group’s business  
and reputation 
  The resources sector is subject to extensive health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and standards alongside 
community and stakeholder expectations. Evolving regulation, standards and stakeholder expectations could result in 
increased costs, regulatory action, litigation or, in extreme cases, threaten the viability of an operation. 
  
Principal risks and uncertainties 
14 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Overview of Rio Tinto’s risk management framework 
Rio Tinto recognises that dealing with risk is an integral part of how we protect and create value. It is fundamental to our business success. Our risk 
management framework recognises this, and reflects the importance of leaders retaining ownership of risk management in each part of the business.  
The responsibility for identifying and managing risks lies with all of Rio Tinto’s managers and business leaders, who operate within a Group-wide framework 
that ensures risks are managed within agreed thresholds.  
The framework, underpinned by Rio Tinto’s Risk policy and standard, includes clearly-defined oversight responsibilities for the board of directors and the 
Executive Committee, supported by the Risk Management Committee, in ensuring key risks to Group objectives are identified, understood, and managed.  
It also defines the roles played by central support functions, by Group Risk, and by Group Audit & Assurance in support of effective risk analysis and 
management across Rio Tinto. More information on the Group’s approach to risk management can be found in the corporate governance section on page 66. 
 
 
Risk factors 
Rio Tinto’s business units and functions assess the potential economic and  
non-economic consequences of their respective risks using the framework 
defined by the Group’s Risk policy and standard. Principal risks and uncertainties 
are identified when the Risk Management Committee, business unit or  
function determines that the potential consequences are material at a Group 
level or where the risk is connected and may trigger a succession of events  
that, in aggregate, become material to the Group. Once identified, each  
principal risk or uncertainty is reviewed by the relevant internal experts and  
by the Risk Management Committee. 
The following describes all currently-known principal risks and uncertainties  
that could materially affect Rio Tinto. There may be additional risks unknown  
to Rio Tinto and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could 
turn out to be material. The risk factors outlined do not include the management 
detail on how each is managed and mitigated, which is discussed in more detail 
on page 66. 
Risks may materialise individually, simultaneously or in combination and could 
significantly affect the Group’s: 
short, medium and long-term business and prospects; 
earnings, cash flow and financial position; 
overall financial results and product demand; 
current asset values; 
future asset values and growth potential; 
safety record and the long, medium and short-term health of its employees; 
environmental effects; or 
Group or business unit reputation. 
The principal risks and uncertainties should be considered in connection with 
any forward-looking statements in this document and the cautionary statement 
on the inside front cover.

management framework recognises this, and reflects the importance of leaders retaining ownership of risk management in each part of the business.  
The responsibility for identifying and managing risks lies with all of Rio Tinto’s managers and business leaders, who operate within a Group-wide framework 
that ensures risks are managed within agreed thresholds.  
The framework, underpinned by Rio Tinto’s Risk policy and standard, includes clearly-defined oversight responsibilities for the board of directors and the 
Executive Committee, supported by the Risk Management Committee, in ensuring key risks to Group objectives are identified, understood, and managed.  
It also defines the roles played by central support functions, by Group Risk, and by Group Audit & Assurance in support of effective risk analysis and 
management across Rio Tinto. More information on the Group’s approach to risk management can be found in the corporate governance section on page 66. 
 
 
Risk factors 
Rio Tinto’s business units and functions assess the potential economic and  
non-economic consequences of their respective risks using the framework 
defined by the Group’s Risk policy and standard. Principal risks and uncertainties 
are identified when the Risk Management Committee, business unit or  
function determines that the potential consequences are material at a Group 
level or where the risk is connected and may trigger a succession of events  
that, in aggregate, become material to the Group. Once identified, each  
principal risk or uncertainty is reviewed by the relevant internal experts and  
by the Risk Management Committee. 
The following describes all currently-known principal risks and uncertainties  
that could materially affect Rio Tinto. There may be additional risks unknown  
to Rio Tinto and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could 
turn out to be material. The risk factors outlined do not include the management 
detail on how each is managed and mitigated, which is discussed in more detail 
on page 66. 
Risks may materialise individually, simultaneously or in combination and could 
significantly affect the Group’s: 
short, medium and long-term business and prospects; 
earnings, cash flow and financial position; 
overall financial results and product demand; 
current asset values; 
future asset values and growth potential; 
safety record and the long, medium and short-term health of its employees; 
environmental effects; or 
Group or business unit reputation. 
The principal risks and uncertainties should be considered in connection with 
any forward-looking statements in this document and the cautionary statement 
on the inside front cover.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Factor   Nature 
Joint ventures, strategic 
partnerships or non-managed 
operations may not be 
successful and may not comply 
with the Group’s standards 
  The Group participates in several joint venture and partnership arrangements, and it may enter into others, all of which 
necessarily involve risk. Whether or not the Group holds majority interests or maintains operational control in its joint ventures, 
its partners may: 
have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of the Group; 
exercise veto rights to block actions that the Group believes are in its or the joint venture’s best interests; or 
be unable or unwilling to fulfil their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements, such as contributing capital  
to expansion or maintenance projects. 
Where these joint ventures are controlled and managed by others, the Group may provide expertise and advice but has limited 
control over compliance with its standards and objectives, such that partners may take action contrary to the Group’s interests 
or policies with respect to its investment. 
The Group’s operations are 
vulnerable to a range of 
interruptions, not all of which 
are covered fully by insurance 
  1. Natural disasters and events 
Mining, smelting, refining and infrastructure installations are vulnerable to natural events including earthquakes, subsidence, 
drought, flood, fire, storm and the possible effects of climate change. 
2. Sustained operational difficulties 
Operating difficulties are many and various, ranging from geological variations that could result in significant ground or 
containment failure to breakdown of key capital equipment. 
Reliable roads, rail networks, ports, power generation and transmission, and water supplies are required to access and conduct 
our operations. 
Limitations, or interruptions in transport infrastructure, including as a result of third parties gaining access to our integrated 
facilities, could impede our ability to deliver products. 
3. Information technology and cyber security 
The Group relies heavily on information technology and process control systems to support our business. In common with 
most large global companies, the Group has experienced cyber attacks and is faced with ongoing threats to the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of such systems. Whilst no material losses related to cyber security breaches have been discovered, 
given the increasing sophistication and evolving nature of this threat, we cannot rule out the possibility of them occurring  
in the future. An extended failure of critical system components, caused by accidental or malicious actions, including those 
resulting from a cyber security attack, could result in a significant environmental, health or safety incident, commercial loss  
or interruption to operations. 
4. Major operational failure 
The Group’s operations involve chemicals and other substances stored under high temperature and pressure, with the 
potential for fire, explosion or other loss of control of the process, leading to a release of hazardous materials. This could  
occur by accident or a breach of operating standards, and could result in a significant environmental, health or safety incident. 
The Group’s insurance does not cover every potential loss associated with its operations and adequate coverage at reasonable 
rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance provision may not fully cover its liability or the consequences of any 
business interruption. Any occurrence not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business. 
The Group depends on  
the continued services of  
key personnel 
  The Group’s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent on the services of a wide range of highly-skilled and 
experienced personnel available in the locations where they are needed. Failure to recruit and retain key staff, and the inability 
to deploy staff worldwide, where they are most needed, could affect the Group’s business. Similar constraints may be felt by 
the Group’s key consultants, contractors and suppliers, thereby impacting the Group’s operations, expansion plans or business 
more generally. 
The Group’s costs of close-
down, reclamation, and 
rehabilitation could be higher 
than expected 
  Close-down and reclamation works to return operating sites to the community can be extensive and costly. Estimated costs 
are provided for, and updated annually, over the life of each operation but the provisions might prove to be inadequate due  
to changes in legislation, standards and the emergence of new reclamation techniques. In addition, the expected timing of 
expenditure could change significantly due to changes in the business environment that might vary the life of an operation. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties continued 
16 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Strategic risks 
Factor   Nature 
The Group’s exploration and 
development of new projects 
might be unsuccessful 
  Rio Tinto identifies new orebodies and mining properties through its exploration programme, and develops or expands  
other operations as a means of generating shareholder value. Exploration is not always successful and there is a high degree  
of competition to develop world-class orebodies. The Group may also not be able to source or maintain adequate project 
financing, or may be unable to find willing and suitable joint venture partners to share the cost of developing large projects. 
Furthermore, project execution may not proceed as planned and project budgets and schedules may prove inaccurate, all  
of which may negatively impact the Group’s profitability. 
Rio Tinto may fail to 
successfully execute 
divestments and acquisitions 
  The Group may not be able to successfully divest non-core assets resulting in unforeseen pressure on its cash position.  
In addition, potential acquisitions may not succeed, reducing the Group’s ability to expand operations as a means of generating 
shareholder value. All business combinations or acquisitions entail a number of risks including the cost of effectively 
integrating acquisitions to realise synergies, significant write-offs or restructuring charges, and unanticipated costs and 
liabilities. The Group may also be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities it has acquired that are unforeseen or greater 
than anticipated. The Group may also face liabilities for divested entities if the buyer fails to honour all commitments or the 
Group agrees to retain certain liabilities. 
Financial risks 
Factor   Nature 
The Group’s reported results 
could be adversely affected  
by the impairment of assets  
and goodwill 
  The Group may be required to record impairment charges as a result of adverse developments in the recoverable values of its 
assets (including goodwill). Significant assumptions in the determination of recoverable value include, but are not limited to: 
pricing of the Group’s commodities and products, reserves and resources, infrastructure availability, discount and exchange 
rates, operating and development cost projections, and timing of expenditure and revenues related to major projects. In 
addition, the occurrence of unexpected events, or events beyond the Group’s control that adversely impact its business, may 
have an impact on the assumptions underlying the recoverable value of its assets. The foregoing items are not exhaustive and 
impairments may be caused by factors currently unknown to the Group. To the extent that the recoverable value of an asset  
is impaired, such impairment may negatively impact the Group’s profitability during the relevant period. 
The Group’s liquidity and cash 
flow expectations may not  
be realised, inhibiting  
planned expenditure 
  The Group’s ability to fund planned expenditure such as capital growth, mergers and acquisitions, innovation and other 
obligations may be hindered if its cash position proves inadequate. Our ability to weather a major economic shock could be 
compromised by insufficient cash reserves, a reduction in the value of existing cash reserves, or restricted access to these  
and other sources of cash, including bank financing or international capital markets. 
Failure to reduce costs both in 
operations and projects may 
result in reduced margins and 
threaten the viability of our 
capital projects 
  Input costs in the resources sector can increase at a disproportionate rate, adversely affecting the economics of current 
operations and increasing the cost of our capital expansion projects. Many of these input costs are linked to commodity prices 
and, in the case of capital expansion projects, the time lag between incurring project costs and receiving revenue can result  
in additional exposure to commodity markets. Failure to reduce these costs may have an adverse impact on our operating 
margins and the viability of our capital expansion projects. 
Operational risks 
Factor   Nature 
Estimates of ore reserves are 
based on uncertain 
assumptions that, if changed, 
could result in the need to 
restate ore reserves 
  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, including subjective judgments and determinations  
that are based on available geological, technical, contract and economic information. Previously valid assumptions may 
change significantly with new information, which may result in changes to the economic viability of some reserves and the 
need for them to be restated. 
Labour disputes could lead to 
lost production and/or 
increased costs 
  Some of the Group’s employees, including employees in non-managed operations, are represented by labour unions  
under various collective labour agreements. The Group may not be able to renegotiate agreements satisfactorily when they  
expire and may face difficult negotiations, higher wage demands or industrial action. In addition, labour agreements may not 
prevent a strike or work stoppage. 
Some of the Group’s 
technologies are unproven and 
failures could adversely impact 
costs and/or productivity 
  The Group has invested in and implemented new technologies both in information systems and in operational initiatives, some 
of which are unproven and their eventual viability cannot be assessed with certainty. The actual benefits of these technologies 
may differ materially from expectations. 
The Group may be exposed to 
major failures in the supply 
chain for specialist equipment 
and materials 
  Rio Tinto operates within a complex supply chain depending on suppliers of materials, services, equipment, and infrastructure, 
and on providers of logistics. Supply chain failures, or significantly increased costs within the supply chain, for whatever reason, 
could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business.

riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
We recognise that we have a responsibility to all our stakeholders and to  
the wider world, and so we endeavour to integrate sustainable development 
into everything we do. Our ability to operate globally is supported by this 
commitment. It allows us to access high-quality resources, effectively manage 
risks and opportunities, engage with communities, and attract talented people – 
and it strengthens our licence to operate. 
As a global company, we seek to understand the risks we face – both threats 
and opportunities – that relate to social wellbeing, environmental stewardship 
and economic prosperity. We do this in order to deliver sustainable 
contributions to the places we work and greater value to our shareholders. 
The way we work – our global code of business conduct – is the foundation  
of our sustainable development framework. This is supported by our corporate 
policies and standards that lay down the minimum acceptable requirements  
for behaviour or operating conditions. Our policies are also supported by 
management systems to make sure they are implemented appropriately across 
the Group. These pieces of the framework and our relentless focus on living  
our values – accountability, respect, teamwork and integrity – work together  
to achieve great performance and effective risk management.  
Performance overview 
In 2013, we: 
– Did not achieve our target of zero fatalities. Sadly, three people lost their  
lives while working at Rio Tinto managed operations. 
– Established a process safety directorate and developed associated risk 
management processes and metrics. 
– Achieved a 31 per cent reduction in all injury frequency rate (AIFR) compared 
with 2008. 
– Exceeded our targeted 30 per cent reduction in the rate of new cases  
of occupational illness between 2008 and 2013. We reduced this rate by  
68 per cent over this period. 
– Fell short of our ten per cent noise reduction target, achieving a 3.1 per cent 
reduction compared with 2008. 
– Implemented our Malaria Management Framework at affected sites. 
– Achieved a 17.3 per cent reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions 
intensity from 2008. 
– Achieved a 6.1 per cent decrease in freshwater used per tonne of product 
compared with 2008. 
– Did not meet our communities target, which required all operations to  
have locally-appropriate, publicly-reported social performance indicators  
in place by 2013. 
– Implemented a corporate approach to Indigenous communities’ free,  
prior, informed consent (FPIC) which has been recognised as best practice  
by non-governmental organisations. 
– Rolled out our Why human rights matter guide, providing our operations with 
a resource for understanding how to integrate human rights considerations 
into communities work. 
– Launched the Procurement Academy as part of the Rio Tinto College.  
This provides employees with globally-endorsed learning opportunities on 
the importance of our procurement practices to the communities in which 
we operate. 
– Introduced scenario-based compliance training which provides practical 
advice on our compliance principles and policies. 
– Developed new Group-level health, safety, environment and communities 
(HSEC) targets that focus on local imperatives and are representative  
of the Group’s diversity and geographic reach.  
– Retained our listing as a leading company on the FTSE4Good and  
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, which investors use to monitor  
businesses’ sustainability performance. 
 
Key priorities 
Our key priorities for 2014 are to: 
– Deliver performance that positions us to meet or exceed our new  
Group HSEC performance targets. 
– Complete our review of the core HSEC management processes, including  
a review of our HSEC performance standards. Strengthen the focus  
on the control of material HSEC risks and use of effective control 
management plans. 
– Seek greater consistency of approach in closure planning across the  
Group, and focus planning efforts on operations closest to the end of  
their life cycles. 
– Improve how we learn from health, safety, environment and community 
incidents, so we can eliminate workplace fatalities and reduce injuries,  
illness and disruptions to operations. 
– Continue to work closely with leadership teams at non-managed  
operations and joint ventures to improve safety performance. 
– Support our employees’ fitness for work through effective fatigue 
management programmes based upon leading scientific research  
and technology applications. 
– Improve the integration of human rights considerations into existing 
corporate processes, including risk analysis, impact assessment, and 
complaints, disputes and grievances procedures, to facilitate a more  
co-ordinated approach to avoiding and addressing involvement in  
potential human rights harm. 
– Review our Integrity and compliance programme to increase the use of  
risk assessment, as well as the programme’s accessibility to employees. 
– Implement a career framework to help employees develop and manage  
their careers more effectively, by providing clarity and transparency 
regarding roles and career pathways available within our business.  
Goals and targets 
As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we have set new 
Group targets for a range of sustainable development metrics, including: 
– Measuring progress against our goal of zero fatalities with an annual target  
of zero fatalities. 
– Measuring progress towards our goal of zero injuries with a year-on-year 
improvement in our all injury frequency rate. 
– A year-on-year improvement in the rate of new cases of occupational  
illness per 10,000 employees annually. 
– All managed operations will have reviewed – and increased their focus on 
managing – their health risks, through implementation of critical control 
management plans to address their specific material health risks, by 2015. 
– All operations having in place locally-appropriate, publicly-reported social 
performance indicators that demonstrate a positive contribution to the 
economic development of the communities and regions where we work, 
consistent with the Millennium Development Goals, by 2015. 
– In 2008 we set a target of ten per cent reduction in total greenhouse gas 
emissions intensity, to be achieved by 2015. Current performance exceeds 
this target. We will continue to seek opportunities to maintain and improve  
our performance, and will establish a new target beyond 2015 that takes 
account of our performance to date.  
– All managed operations with material water risk will have reviewed  
and improved their management of their material water risks, and  
have achieved their approved local water performance targets, by 2018. 
We intend to report our performance against these targets in the 2014  
Annual report.

riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
We recognise that we have a responsibility to all our stakeholders and to  
the wider world, and so we endeavour to integrate sustainable development 
into everything we do. Our ability to operate globally is supported by this 
commitment. It allows us to access high-quality resources, effectively manage 
risks and opportunities, engage with communities, and attract talented people – 
and it strengthens our licence to operate. 
As a global company, we seek to understand the risks we face – both threats 
and opportunities – that relate to social wellbeing, environmental stewardship 
and economic prosperity. We do this in order to deliver sustainable 
contributions to the places we work and greater value to our shareholders. 
The way we work – our global code of business conduct – is the foundation  
of our sustainable development framework. This is supported by our corporate 
policies and standards that lay down the minimum acceptable requirements  
for behaviour or operating conditions. Our policies are also supported by 
management systems to make sure they are implemented appropriately across 
the Group. These pieces of the framework and our relentless focus on living  
our values – accountability, respect, teamwork and integrity – work together  
to achieve great performance and effective risk management.  
Performance overview 
In 2013, we: 
– Did not achieve our target of zero fatalities. Sadly, three people lost their  
lives while working at Rio Tinto managed operations. 
– Established a process safety directorate and developed associated risk 
management processes and metrics. 
– Achieved a 31 per cent reduction in all injury frequency rate (AIFR) compared 
with 2008. 
– Exceeded our targeted 30 per cent reduction in the rate of new cases  
of occupational illness between 2008 and 2013. We reduced this rate by  
68 per cent over this period. 
– Fell short of our ten per cent noise reduction target, achieving a 3.1 per cent 
reduction compared with 2008. 
– Implemented our Malaria Management Framework at affected sites. 
– Achieved a 17.3 per cent reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions 
intensity from 2008. 
– Achieved a 6.1 per cent decrease in freshwater used per tonne of product 
compared with 2008. 
– Did not meet our communities target, which required all operations to  
have locally-appropriate, publicly-reported social performance indicators  
in place by 2013. 
– Implemented a corporate approach to Indigenous communities’ free,  
prior, informed consent (FPIC) which has been recognised as best practice  
by non-governmental organisations. 
– Rolled out our Why human rights matter guide, providing our operations with 
a resource for understanding how to integrate human rights considerations 
into communities work. 
– Launched the Procurement Academy as part of the Rio Tinto College.  
This provides employees with globally-endorsed learning opportunities on 
the importance of our procurement practices to the communities in which 
we operate. 
– Introduced scenario-based compliance training which provides practical 
advice on our compliance principles and policies. 
– Developed new Group-level health, safety, environment and communities 
(HSEC) targets that focus on local imperatives and are representative  
of the Group’s diversity and geographic reach.  
– Retained our listing as a leading company on the FTSE4Good and  
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, which investors use to monitor  
businesses’ sustainability performance. 
 
Key priorities 
Our key priorities for 2014 are to: 
– Deliver performance that positions us to meet or exceed our new  
Group HSEC performance targets. 
– Complete our review of the core HSEC management processes, including  
a review of our HSEC performance standards. Strengthen the focus  
on the control of material HSEC risks and use of effective control 
management plans. 
– Seek greater consistency of approach in closure planning across the  
Group, and focus planning efforts on operations closest to the end of  
their life cycles. 
– Improve how we learn from health, safety, environment and community 
incidents, so we can eliminate workplace fatalities and reduce injuries,  
illness and disruptions to operations. 
– Continue to work closely with leadership teams at non-managed  
operations and joint ventures to improve safety performance. 
– Support our employees’ fitness for work through effective fatigue 
management programmes based upon leading scientific research  
and technology applications. 
– Improve the integration of human rights considerations into existing 
corporate processes, including risk analysis, impact assessment, and 
complaints, disputes and grievances procedures, to facilitate a more  
co-ordinated approach to avoiding and addressing involvement in  
potential human rights harm. 
– Review our Integrity and compliance programme to increase the use of  
risk assessment, as well as the programme’s accessibility to employees. 
– Implement a career framework to help employees develop and manage  
their careers more effectively, by providing clarity and transparency 
regarding roles and career pathways available within our business.  
Goals and targets 
As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we have set new 
Group targets for a range of sustainable development metrics, including: 
– Measuring progress against our goal of zero fatalities with an annual target  
of zero fatalities. 
– Measuring progress towards our goal of zero injuries with a year-on-year 
improvement in our all injury frequency rate. 
– A year-on-year improvement in the rate of new cases of occupational  
illness per 10,000 employees annually. 
– All managed operations will have reviewed – and increased their focus on 
managing – their health risks, through implementation of critical control 
management plans to address their specific material health risks, by 2015. 
– All operations having in place locally-appropriate, publicly-reported social 
performance indicators that demonstrate a positive contribution to the 
economic development of the communities and regions where we work, 
consistent with the Millennium Development Goals, by 2015. 
– In 2008 we set a target of ten per cent reduction in total greenhouse gas 
emissions intensity, to be achieved by 2015. Current performance exceeds 
this target. We will continue to seek opportunities to maintain and improve  
our performance, and will establish a new target beyond 2015 that takes 
account of our performance to date.  
– All managed operations with material water risk will have reviewed  
and improved their management of their material water risks, and  
have achieved their approved local water performance targets, by 2018. 
We intend to report our performance against these targets in the 2014  
Annual report.

as well as impacting general health. Its reduction can also result in increased 
efficiencies in the work environment. Advances in fatigue risk management 
were achieved via the use of a number of scientific tools such as  
bio-mathematical modelling (to improve our shift roster designs) and 
actigraphy (to quantify actual fatigue risk and other health-related factors).  
We also had a team of researchers from Harvard Medical School conduct a 
mental health review for our Iron Ore operations, looking at gaps between our 
current mental health strategy and global best practice, among other aspects. 
The key recommendation from this review will be used to develop a mental 
health management framework, aimed at sharing good practices and to provide 
support to our employees. In addition, we established a new Rio Tinto Health 
risk profile based on a Health risk assessment and biometric data gathering  
in 2012 and 2013. 
People 
Having great people and an inclusive culture are key to our success. Our core 
values of accountability, respect, teamwork and integrity are expressed through  
the principles and standards of conduct set out in The way we work. We are 
committed to providing a work environment in which everyone is treated  
fairly and with respect and has the opportunity to maximise their potential.  
In line with our Employment policy, we seek safe and effective working 
relationships at all levels within the Group. We employ on the basis of job 
requirements and do not discriminate on grounds of age, ethnic or social  
origin, gender, sexual orientation, politics, religion or disability. We do not 
employ forced, bonded or child labour. We recognise the right of all employees 
to choose to belong to a union and seek to bargain collectively. We employ 
people with disabilities and make considerable efforts to offer suitable 
alternative employment and retraining to employees who become disabled  
and can no longer perform their regular duties. 
Our Group-wide performance, talent and remuneration systems support 
consistent and transparent assessment of talent across Rio Tinto.  
They also drive a performance-focused culture by making clear linkages  
between performance and reward, and enable employees to articulate  
their career aspirations. 
It is important to represent the diversity of our surrounding communities  
in our workforce, by employing people from these communities who meet job 
requirements. Our employees’ diversity of skills, ideas and experiences helps  
to ensure that we respond with innovation and sensitivity to the challenges 
faced across the Group.  
We are focused on increasing the representation of women and of people from 
nationalities and local groups under-represented in our workforce. In 2013, 
women represented 28 per cent (female: 118; male: 305) of our graduate 
intake, 17 per cent (female: two; male: ten) of the board, 14 per cent (female: 
102; male: 608) of our senior management, and 19 per cent (female: 11,090; 
male: 48,435)
(1)
 of our total workforce. Thirty per cent of our graduate intake  
in 2013 were nationals from regions where we are developing new businesses. 
Further information on diversity and inclusion can be found on page 64 in the 
Corporate governance section.  
In 2013, we employed 66,000 people, including the Group’s share of joint 
arrangements and associates. Of these, approximately 28,000 were located  
in Australasia, 17,000 in North America, 8,000 in Africa, and 7,000 in Europe. 
See page 199 for a breakdown of employees by business units. 
Throughout 2013, we remained the largest private sector employer of 
Indigenous Australians, who represented approximately 7.5 per cent of our 
Australian workforce. Our local employment commitments are often managed 
through directly negotiated community benefit agreements. 
The global economic outlook remains challenging. So we continue to focus  
on transforming the Group’s service and support activities, both within product 
groups and Group functions, by implementing a new operating model –  
with the right people doing the right work, in the right location. In some  
areas there have been significant employee reductions as a result of the 
transformation required to deliver simpler and more cost-effective support 
services. These changes will ensure that we become a leaner, stronger and 
more resilient organisation. 
In 2013, the Rio Tinto College launched the Procurement Academy, having 
already established five Academies in the areas of health, safety, environment 
and communities, human resources, leadership, marketing and stakeholder 
engagement. The College is a virtual learning environment available to all 
employees. The Academies’ learning tools comprise videos, events, documents, 
interactive courses, audio courses, languages and webinars. Employees  
can access a wealth of globally-endorsed learning opportunities anywhere  
and any time. 
Approximately 884,000 attendances were recorded for training in leadership, 
technical and operational skills, and health, safety, and environment courses 
across the business in 2013.  
Engaged employees ensure unified operations. We use a number of 
communication tools to keep our employees informed of Group updates, news 
and announcements. This has included developing myRioTinto, an employee 
portal dedicated to their employment needs.  
Communities and regional development 
We seek to understand the social, environmental and economic implications  
of our activities for host communities through regular, open and honest 
engagement with those communities, representative organisations and  
local governments.  
The way we work provides the foundation of our Communities and Social 
Performance work. Our Communities policy and standard provide the 
performance framework, while guidance notes describe preferred worksite 
practices. We refer to external policies such as the International Finance 
Corporation’s standards. We work to a common Communities and Social 
Performance approach of:  
(1) building a community and socioeconomic knowledge base, including the 
identification of potential positive and negative impacts of our operations;  
(2) engaging with communities, local governments and other concerned 
agencies; and  
(3) undertaking mitigation and delivering programmes that reflect  
the priorities of local communities.  
We strive for mutually-beneficial outcomes within our host communities. We 
accept that we cannot meet everybody’s concerns and expectations; however, 
wherever we operate we seek to do so with broad-based community support.  
In 2013, our businesses contributed to just under 2,200 socioeconomic 
programmes covering a wide range of activities such as health, education, 
business development, environmental protection, housing and agricultural 
development. We spent US$331 million on these community assistance 
programmes.  
Our communities target, adopted in 2009, required all operations to have 
locally-appropriate, publicly-reported social performance indicators in place by 
2013, which demonstrate a positive contribution to the economic development 
of the communities and regions where we work, consistent with the UN 
Millennium Development Goals. In 2013, further progress was made in 
establishing these indicators; 98 per cent of operations had these indicators  
in place and 90 per cent had reported them publicly. The target is being 
extended to 2015 to better align with the timeline for the UN Millennium 
Development Goals.

Performance data 
Our sustainable development performance data are reported for calendar years 
and, unless stated otherwise, represent 100 per cent of the parameters at each 
managed operation, even though Rio Tinto may have only partial ownership. 
Data reported in previous years may be modified if verification processes detect 
material errors, or if changes are required to ensure comparability over time. 
Wherever possible, data for operations acquired prior to 1 October of the 
reporting period are included. Divested operations are included in data 
collection processes up until the transfer of management control. 
We have incorporated the requirements of the ten sustainable development 
principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the 
mandatory requirements set out in ICMM Position statements into our own 
policies, strategies and standards, and report in line with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines at Application level A+. 
Further information on our data definitions, our GRI-checked report and our 
alignment with the ICMM sustainable development principles and supporting 
position statement can be found on: riotinto.com/sustainabledevelopment2013 
Materiality  
We use a materiality assessment to focus our report on our most significant 
sustainable development issues. 
Our process was developed in line with the GRI guidance on materiality and 
completeness (www.globalreporting.org). It involves identifying and prioritising 
issues affecting our business and stakeholders over the next three years from 
internal and external perspectives.  
Performance data for a selection of our most material sustainable development 
issues are subject to external assurance. We also discuss financial performance, 
safety and greenhouse gas emissions in the product group section of this report 
(see pages 26 to 37). 
Omission of issues from our report does not mean that they are not managed 
by the Group. Visit our website for additional information.

Social 
Safety  
Our goal is zero harm, including, above all, the elimination of workplace 
fatalities. We strive to create a positive safety culture in all parts of our 
organisation, where everyone is committed to their own safety and the safety of 
their workmates. Our safety performance is underpinned by a set of global 
standards that is fully integrated with Rio Tinto’s Health, Safety, Environment 
and Quality management system.  
Our integrated safety approach combines a focus on injury reduction, 
elimination of fatalities and catastrophic risk management. Central to our 
approach is that passionate and effective safety leaders engage with their teams 
to build a zero harm culture. During 2013, all product groups have continued to 
strengthen safety leadership. 
We continued to reduce injury rates across the Group in 2013. Our performance 
is measured by the all injury frequency rate (AIFR), which includes data for 
employees and contractors. At the end of 2013 our AIFR was 0.65. Over the last 
five years we have reduced our AIFR by 20 per cent. This improvement is being 
driven by the successful zero harm programmes within each of our businesses.  
Our lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), was 0.42 per 200,000 hours worked 
in 2013. While our LTIFR compares favourably within the industry and across 
sectors, we are committed to making further improvements as we strive for  
our zero harm goal. 
Regrettably, we did not meet our goal of zero fatalities in 2013. Three people 
lost their lives while working at Rio Tinto managed operations. The fatalities 
were caused by a mobile equipment incident during road maintenance  
at the La Granja project in Peru, a crush incident at Rio Tinto Alcan’s  
Alma smelter in Canada, and a crush incident at Richards Bay Minerals  
in South Africa.  
We provided support and counselling to the families and workmates affected by 
these tragic events and we have shared the lessons from these incidents across 
the Group. It is essential that we learn from these events if we are to achieve 
our target of zero fatalities. We are also placing significant focus on the effective 
investigation of incidents that have the potential to cause fatalities, so that we 
learn from them. 
This focus on investigation and sharing lessons learned extends to our  
non-managed operations. Further discussion of this is covered on page 22. 
During 2013, we continued with our rigorous risk assessment processes  
and the deployment of critical control monitoring plans to drive effective risk 
management at an operational level. We also continued to improve specific  
risk management processes for catastrophic risks such as process and  
aviation safety.  
Health  
Protecting the long-term health and wellbeing of our workers, by promoting  
the fundamentals of fitness for work and controlling occupational exposures,  
is a priority. Our occupational health performance standards and our focus  
on health risks support this commitment.  
We met our five-year target to reduce the rate of new cases of occupational 
illness per 10,000 employees by 30 per cent. We reduced the rate of new  
cases by 68 per cent over the 2008 to 2013 target period. In 2013, we realised 
significant decreases in the number of reported cases of noise-induced  
hearing loss (81 per cent), musculo-skeletal disorders (59 per cent) and  
stress (66 per cent). Whilst we have significantly reduced the number of new 
occupational illness cases reported over the last five years, we will continue  
to target a year-on-year improvement in the rate of new cases of occupational 
illness per 10,000 employees annually.  
In 2013, the rate of employees potentially exposed to an average eight hour 
noise dose of more than 85 decibels (absent of hearing protection) decreased 
by 3.1 per cent compared with 2008. This reduction fell short of our ten per cent 
reduction target. Influencing factors were: better quantification of actual noise 
exposures throughout the target period, particularly in the last year, and 
divestment of some operations. We achieved genuine reduction in noise 
exposures at a number of our operations through such interventions as 
replacing noisy heavy mobile and fixed equipment through our formalised  
“buy quiet” policies and retrofitting sound-proofing technologies on heavy 
mobile equipment and operator booths.  
We remain focused on the identification, management and reduction of 
material health risks at each operation. In addition to our health standards and 
policy, we have set a new Group target that all managed operations will have 
reviewed – and increased their focus on managing – their health risks, through 
implementation of critical control management plans to address their specific 
material health risks, by the end of 2015. The plans establish an approach that 
will be applied for monitoring ongoing performance of critical controls against 
material risks at individual sites. Performance measures and targets will be 
established for each critical control and this will enable operations to improve 
their focus on their material risks at a local level. We will begin reporting our 
performance against this target in the 2014 Annual report.  
We increased our focus on fitness for work during 2013. A focal point was 
fatigue, which is known to be a contributing factor in many safety incidents

Performance data 
Our sustainable development performance data are reported for calendar years 
and, unless stated otherwise, represent 100 per cent of the parameters at each 
managed operation, even though Rio Tinto may have only partial ownership. 
Data reported in previous years may be modified if verification processes detect 
material errors, or if changes are required to ensure comparability over time. 
Wherever possible, data for operations acquired prior to 1 October of the 
reporting period are included. Divested operations are included in data 
collection processes up until the transfer of management control. 
We have incorporated the requirements of the ten sustainable development 
principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the 
mandatory requirements set out in ICMM Position statements into our own 
policies, strategies and standards, and report in line with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines at Application level A+. 
Further information on our data definitions, our GRI-checked report and our 
alignment with the ICMM sustainable development principles and supporting 
position statement can be found on: riotinto.com/sustainabledevelopment2013 
Materiality  
We use a materiality assessment to focus our report on our most significant 
sustainable development issues. 
Our process was developed in line with the GRI guidance on materiality and 
completeness (www.globalreporting.org). It involves identifying and prioritising 
issues affecting our business and stakeholders over the next three years from 
internal and external perspectives.  
Performance data for a selection of our most material sustainable development 
issues are subject to external assurance. We also discuss financial performance, 
safety and greenhouse gas emissions in the product group section of this report 
(see pages 26 to 37). 
Omission of issues from our report does not mean that they are not managed 
by the Group. Visit our website for additional information.

Social 
Safety  
Our goal is zero harm, including, above all, the elimination of workplace 
fatalities. We strive to create a positive safety culture in all parts of our 
organisation, where everyone is committed to their own safety and the safety of 
their workmates. Our safety performance is underpinned by a set of global 
standards that is fully integrated with Rio Tinto’s Health, Safety, Environment 
and Quality management system.  
Our integrated safety approach combines a focus on injury reduction, 
elimination of fatalities and catastrophic risk management. Central to our 
approach is that passionate and effective safety leaders engage with their teams 
to build a zero harm culture. During 2013, all product groups have continued to 
strengthen safety leadership. 
We continued to reduce injury rates across the Group in 2013. Our performance 
is measured by the all injury frequency rate (AIFR), which includes data for 
employees and contractors. At the end of 2013 our AIFR was 0.65. Over the last 
five years we have reduced our AIFR by 20 per cent. This improvement is being 
driven by the successful zero harm programmes within each of our businesses.  
Our lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), was 0.42 per 200,000 hours worked 
in 2013. While our LTIFR compares favourably within the industry and across 
sectors, we are committed to making further improvements as we strive for  
our zero harm goal. 
Regrettably, we did not meet our goal of zero fatalities in 2013. Three people 
lost their lives while working at Rio Tinto managed operations. The fatalities 
were caused by a mobile equipment incident during road maintenance  
at the La Granja project in Peru, a crush incident at Rio Tinto Alcan’s  
Alma smelter in Canada, and a crush incident at Richards Bay Minerals  
in South Africa.  
We provided support and counselling to the families and workmates affected by 
these tragic events and we have shared the lessons from these incidents across 
the Group. It is essential that we learn from these events if we are to achieve 
our target of zero fatalities. We are also placing significant focus on the effective 
investigation of incidents that have the potential to cause fatalities, so that we 
learn from them. 
This focus on investigation and sharing lessons learned extends to our  
non-managed operations. Further discussion of this is covered on page 22. 
During 2013, we continued with our rigorous risk assessment processes  
and the deployment of critical control monitoring plans to drive effective risk 
management at an operational level. We also continued to improve specific  
risk management processes for catastrophic risks such as process and  
aviation safety.  
Health  
Protecting the long-term health and wellbeing of our workers, by promoting  
the fundamentals of fitness for work and controlling occupational exposures,  
is a priority. Our occupational health performance standards and our focus  
on health risks support this commitment.  
We met our five-year target to reduce the rate of new cases of occupational 
illness per 10,000 employees by 30 per cent. We reduced the rate of new  
cases by 68 per cent over the 2008 to 2013 target period. In 2013, we realised 
significant decreases in the number of reported cases of noise-induced  
hearing loss (81 per cent), musculo-skeletal disorders (59 per cent) and  
stress (66 per cent). Whilst we have significantly reduced the number of new 
occupational illness cases reported over the last five years, we will continue  
to target a year-on-year improvement in the rate of new cases of occupational 
illness per 10,000 employees annually.  
In 2013, the rate of employees potentially exposed to an average eight hour 
noise dose of more than 85 decibels (absent of hearing protection) decreased 
by 3.1 per cent compared with 2008. This reduction fell short of our ten per cent 
reduction target. Influencing factors were: better quantification of actual noise 
exposures throughout the target period, particularly in the last year, and 
divestment of some operations. We achieved genuine reduction in noise 
exposures at a number of our operations through such interventions as 
replacing noisy heavy mobile and fixed equipment through our formalised  
“buy quiet” policies and retrofitting sound-proofing technologies on heavy 
mobile equipment and operator booths.  
We remain focused on the identification, management and reduction of 
material health risks at each operation. In addition to our health standards and 
policy, we have set a new Group target that all managed operations will have 
reviewed – and increased their focus on managing – their health risks, through 
implementation of critical control management plans to address their specific 
material health risks, by the end of 2015. The plans establish an approach that 
will be applied for monitoring ongoing performance of critical controls against 
material risks at individual sites. Performance measures and targets will be 
established for each critical control and this will enable operations to improve 
their focus on their material risks at a local level. We will begin reporting our 
performance against this target in the 2014 Annual report.  
We increased our focus on fitness for work during 2013. A focal point was 
fatigue, which is known to be a contributing factor in many safety incidents

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Tragically, there were 33 industrial fatalities at PTFI in 2013; 31 underground 
and two at the surface involving light vehicles. Twenty-eight people lost their 
lives in the catastrophic underground tunnel collapse incident in May. We have 
worked closely with, and continue to support, the PTFI leadership team both  
in the investigation and in the post-investigation lesson implementation to 
develop practices to avoid catastrophic failures in the future.  
PTFI manages complex social, community and environmental issues.  
There have also been instances of violence in areas near the operation, 
including a series of shooting incidents that resulted in one injury in 2013.  
PTFI continues to implement prudent measures of security for personnel  
and material transport. Both Rio Tinto and Freeport-McMoRan support  
the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) and work 
together to ensure practice is consistent with these principles. Rio Tinto 
continues to monitor the situation.  
The operation employs controlled riverine tailings transport, a process that the 
World Bank does not consider as good industry practice, on the basis that it is 
contrary to International Finance Corporation’s 2007 Environmental, Health, 
and Safety Guidelines for mining. However, several independent expert reviews 
concluded that this method represents the best practicable management 
solution for this operation because of the extremely rugged topography,  
high rainfall and significant seismic activity. We continue to believe that this 
method is appropriate given these conditions.  
Significant improvements continue to be made to limit the surface area 
disturbed by tailings placement, to enhance retention within the engineered 
deposition area, to minimise geochemical risks, to protect adjacent river 
systems and to rehabilitate inactive tailings surfaces. In addition, PTFI uses 
tailings to make cement that supports local infrastructure projects. 
Governance 
Closure 
Our Closure standard requires Rio Tinto businesses to begin planning for 
closure from the earliest stages of project development, to seek sustainable  
and beneficial future land uses when an operation eventually closes, and to 
minimise financial, social and environmental risks. 
We require our sites to develop integrated management plans to promote a 
sustainable approach throughout the life cycle of the operations. An important 
component of improving our land management and rehabilitation performance 
is the integration of closure and operations planning through strong technical 
support and knowledge sharing. This includes an aim to progressively 
rehabilitate as much land as possible prior to the closure of an operation by 
optimising areas that can be rehabilitated without compromising production.  
In 2013, 25 per cent of our disturbed land (excluding land disturbed for 
hydroelectricity dams) had been rehabilitated. 
Our closure strategy is also closely connected to our biodiversity goal.  
Rio Tinto’s biodiversity goal is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity by 
closure of the operations, or earlier, at sites with high or very high biodiversity 
values. This is determined by proximity to biodiversity-rich habitats, species of 
conservation significance and the site conservation context. In 2013, 33 of our 
operations were prioritised with either high (nine) or very high (24) biodiversity 
values. These sites are required to develop and implement biodiversity action 
plans that outline what is required to achieve our goal.  
We also have a portfolio of non-operational sites inherited through acquisitions 
and mergers, which either are no longer economically viable or that have  
been closed by their previous owners and require additional remediation.  
Regardless of these legacy sites’ ownership history, we endeavour to 
decommission and remediate them safely, making the land available  
for beneficial reuse. 
Stakeholder consultation is a key element in all our closure planning. Both  
our Closure and Communities standards require that our operations engage 
regularly with stakeholders, including employees, traditional landowners, local 
communities and governments. Together, we identify options for post-closure 
land uses, and seek stakeholders’ consensus for a preferred closure strategy  
as early as we can in an operation’s life cycle. 
Good performance in legacy management and closure can enhance our 
reputation and enable us to maintain access to land, resources, people  
and capital – to continue establishing new projects with the support of  
local communities.  
Human rights 
Rio Tinto has diverse operations across more than 40 countries with very 
different social, economic, political and cultural landscapes. The actions we  
take to respect and support human rights help us build enduring and  
active relationships with local communities, employees and business partners. 
We respect and promote fundamental human rights consistent with the  
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our human rights 
approach is founded in The way we work, voluntary commitments and  
our Human Rights policy. It draws together relevant internal controls  
that incorporate the broad range of issues encompassed by human rights.  
This includes those associated with communities, security, human  
resources, procurement, and health, safety and the environment. Our  
approach is consistent with the human rights due diligence process in  
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We understand  
this includes avoiding involvement in human rights harm by others,  
including business partners.  
We integrate human rights into our risk analysis, impact assessment, 
complaints, disputes and grievance processes. At locations that are  
high risk, we may conduct additional human rights risk analyses and  
impact assessments. 
In implementing our policies, we are subject to the local laws of the many 
countries in which we operate. We build on compliance with local laws  
and, where our policy and procedures are more stringent, we operate to  
these standards.  
To ensure our employees and other key stakeholders understand how these 
tools work together, we developed a Human Rights guidance note, which  
will replace our 2003 guidance. We also rolled out updated human rights  
e-learning across the company and developed site-specific human rights 
training. In 2013 a human rights section was included in mandatory training  
for The way we work. To continue to build internal networks and identify  
Group-wide challenges, we refreshed the mandate of our multi-function and 
cross-product group human rights working group.  
Rio Tinto has made voluntary commitments to the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact, and is a member of  
its Human Rights Working Group. We also participate in the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights. We are committed to avoiding 
violations of fundamental human rights through our security arrangements and 
to taking steps to avoid complicity in such violations by private and public 
security personnel. This includes training for security personnel and conducting 
security and human rights assessments at all critical risk sites. To assist sites in 
this regard we have also developed a security and human rights toolkit. 
We strive to achieve the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous 
communities as defined in the 2012 International Finance Corporation 
Performance Standard 7 and supporting guidance. Because we must respect 
the law of the countries in which we operate, we seek consent as defined in 
relevant jurisdictions, and ensure agreement-making processes are consistent 
with such definitions. We respect the land connection of Indigenous 
communities and seek agreements with affected communities in the 
development and performance of our operations. 
Integrity and compliance 
Good governance helps us to operate ethically, wherever we are in the world.  
It requires open and transparent dealings with our stakeholders, and it supports 
our commitment to conducting our business with integrity. The way we work, 
our global code of business conduct, is the foundation of this commitment.

Environment 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
We recognise the need to understand and adapt to the physical impacts  
of climate change, which will affect our operations, particularly through  
the availability of water and the occurrence of extreme weather events. We 
believe that global energy and climate challenges are best met by companies, 
governments and society working together. Our strategy is to maximise 
shareholder returns by making our assets more resilient against uncertain 
carbon and energy market risks.  
Rio Tinto both produces and consumes energy. Our smelting and mineral 
processing operations are energy intensive and depend on electricity, coal,  
oil, diesel and gas to keep them running. The majority of our electricity use  
is from greenhouse gas-friendly hydro and nuclear power.  
We met our five-year target for a six per cent reduction in total greenhouse gas 
emissions intensity and are on track to achieve our 2015 target of a ten per cent 
reduction. We had reduced our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity 
by 17.3 per cent at the end of 2013 compared with 2008. Our total GHG 
emissions were 37.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 
-e)  
in 2013, 3.4 million tonnes lower than in 2012.  
There are also significant GHG emissions associated with the transportation, 
processing and use of our products. In 2013, the three most significant sources 
of indirect emissions associated with our products were:  
– Approximately 5.3 million tonnes of CO
2 
-e associated with third party 
transport of our products and raw materials.  
– An estimated 139.4 million tonnes of CO
2 
-e associated with customers  
using our coal in electricity generation and steel production.  
– Approximately 395 million tonnes of CO
2 
-e associated with customers using 
our iron ore to produce steel (these emissions are not all in addition to the 
coal-use emissions above, as some customers use both our iron ore and  
our coal to produce steel). 
Despite the lack of progress towards a global agreement on climate change, 
legislation that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions is in place in Europe, 
Australia, New Zealand, various US states and Canadian provinces. As a result, 
over two-thirds of our emissions from our operations are covered by market-
based carbon regulation.  
Water 
Water is a vital resource for communities and ecosystems and is essential  
to our operations. Our operations rely on the ability to obtain water of suitable 
quality and quantity and are committed to using water responsibly. Our 
approach to water management is based on the identification, assessment  
and control of water-related risks.  
Material water risks have been identified at over 40 per cent of Rio Tinto 
operations and almost 75 per cent of our projects, with the greatest exposure  
in Australia, followed by Africa and Canada. Each operation has its own set of 
water challenges, and risks vary by region and site. These risks cover technical 
challenges, regulatory requirements, financial impacts and stakeholder 
expectations. Beyond risks to individual businesses, more complex, and often 
long-term, regional water risks pose a threat that can require collaboration  
with stakeholders. 
At the end of the 2008-2013 target period, we met the targeted six per cent 
reduction in our freshwater use per tonne of product. We achieved a  
6.1 per cent reduction during this period. In 2013, our freshwater withdrawal 
decreased by 3.9 per cent to 516 billion litres. Through specific programmes, 
such as recycling, businesses improved their freshwater use. However, this 
metric does not accurately reflect the improvement in water efficiency at many 
sites, with the target impacted by production levels and extreme rainfall events 
unrelated to water efficiency. 
As our approach to water-use has matured, and with better understanding  
of site-specific factors, we have reviewed and reset our water targets to better 
reflect local or regional conditions. Our new Group target requires all managed 
operations with material water risk to have reviewed and improved their 
management of their material water risks, and have achieved their approved 
local water performance targets, by 2018. The target reflects the geographic 
diversity of our operations, and the nature of their water challenges. This 
approach allows our sites to have targets that focus on issues of water supply, 
the management of surplus water, or water quality. All of our sites have plans in 
place to manage their specific material risk and in 2014 we will begin reporting 
our performance against this target. 
Environmental regulation 
We are subject to various environmental regulations and are required to 
disclose Group-level environmental incidents and fines. Further information  
on the Group’s environmental regulation is included in the Directors’ report  
on page 45. 
Economic 
Economic contributions 
Our aim is to bring sustainable economic benefit to the regions and countries  
in which we have a presence. This approach helps us build a reputation as  
an organisation that facilitates economic growth in the places where we work.  
Due to the scale and capital intensity of our mining and processing activities, 
we are a major employer and tax contributor to the local, state, and national 
jurisdictions in which we operate. Our high levels of productivity and the  
value we add to resources create prosperity for our shareholders, employees, 
communities, governments and business partners.  
Globally, the Group’s direct economic contribution was US$57,872 million  
in 2013. This includes: 
– US$31,818 million in value add, made up of labour, payments to 
governments and returns to capital. 
– US$26,054 million as payments to suppliers. 
These figures include the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates. 
Details of the payments to governments that are included in our direct 
economic contribution are available in our report on Taxes paid in 2013,  
which is available on the Group’s website. 
Non-managed operations and joint ventures 
Rio Tinto holds interests in companies and joint ventures that it does not 
manage, including the Escondida copper mine in Chile and the Grasberg 
copper-gold mine in Indonesia. We actively engage with our partners around 
sustainable development through formal governance structures and technical 
exchanges. In this way we endeavour to ensure that the principles in  
The way we work are respected at all times.  
Escondida 
Rio Tinto has a 30 per cent interest in Escondida, which is managed by BHP 
Billiton. Our seats on the Owners’ Council allow us regular input on strategic 
and policy matters. In 2013, Escondida successfully negotiated a four-year 
contract with their union employees, which allows Escondida to continue to  
be focused on safety and the environment. Also during the year, the Escondida 
Water Supply project to construct a new 2,500 litre per second seawater 
desalination facility was approved. This project will ensure a continued  
water supply to sustain operations while minimising Escondida’s need  
to use groundwater.  
Grasberg 
PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, 
Inc., owns and operates the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia. We have a joint 
venture interest attributable to the 1995 mine expansion, which entitles us to  
a 40 per cent share of production above specified levels until the end of 2021 
and 40 per cent of all production after 2021. We have the ability to engage and 
influence through our representation on the Operating, Technical & Sustainable 
Development Committees.

Despite the lack of progress towards a global agreement on climate change, 
legislation that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions is in place in Europe, 
Australia, New Zealand, various US states and Canadian provinces. As a result, 
over two-thirds of our emissions from our operations are covered by market-
based carbon regulation.  
Water 
Water is a vital resource for communities and ecosystems and is essential  
to our operations. Our operations rely on the ability to obtain water of suitable 
quality and quantity and are committed to using water responsibly. Our 
approach to water management is based on the identification, assessment  
and control of water-related risks.  
Material water risks have been identified at over 40 per cent of Rio Tinto 
operations and almost 75 per cent of our projects, with the greatest exposure  
in Australia, followed by Africa and Canada. Each operation has its own set of 
water challenges, and risks vary by region and site. These risks cover technical 
challenges, regulatory requirements, financial impacts and stakeholder 
expectations. Beyond risks to individual businesses, more complex, and often 
long-term, regional water risks pose a threat that can require collaboration  
with stakeholders. 
At the end of the 2008-2013 target period, we met the targeted six per cent 
reduction in our freshwater use per tonne of product. We achieved a  
6.1 per cent reduction during this period. In 2013, our freshwater withdrawal 
decreased by 3.9 per cent to 516 billion litres. Through specific programmes, 
such as recycling, businesses improved their freshwater use. However, this 
metric does not accurately reflect the improvement in water efficiency at many 
sites, with the target impacted by production levels and extreme rainfall events 
unrelated to water efficiency. 
As our approach to water-use has matured, and with better understanding  
of site-specific factors, we have reviewed and reset our water targets to better 
reflect local or regional conditions. Our new Group target requires all managed 
operations with material water risk to have reviewed and improved their 
management of their material water risks, and have achieved their approved 
local water performance targets, by 2018. The target reflects the geographic 
diversity of our operations, and the nature of their water challenges. This 
approach allows our sites to have targets that focus on issues of water supply, 
the management of surplus water, or water quality. All of our sites have plans in 
place to manage their specific material risk and in 2014 we will begin reporting 
our performance against this target. 
Environmental regulation 
We are subject to various environmental regulations and are required to 
disclose Group-level environmental incidents and fines. Further information  
on the Group’s environmental regulation is included in the Directors’ report  
on page 45. 
Economic 
Economic contributions 
Our aim is to bring sustainable economic benefit to the regions and countries  
in which we have a presence. This approach helps us build a reputation as  
an organisation that facilitates economic growth in the places where we work.  
Due to the scale and capital intensity of our mining and processing activities, 
we are a major employer and tax contributor to the local, state, and national 
jurisdictions in which we operate. Our high levels of productivity and the  
value we add to resources create prosperity for our shareholders, employees, 
communities, governments and business partners.  
Globally, the Group’s direct economic contribution was US$57,872 million  
in 2013. This includes: 
– US$31,818 million in value add, made up of labour, payments to 
governments and returns to capital. 
– US$26,054 million as payments to suppliers. 
These figures include the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates. 
Details of the payments to governments that are included in our direct 
economic contribution are available in our report on Taxes paid in 2013,  
which is available on the Group’s website. 
Non-managed operations and joint ventures 
Rio Tinto holds interests in companies and joint ventures that it does not 
manage, including the Escondida copper mine in Chile and the Grasberg 
copper-gold mine in Indonesia. We actively engage with our partners around 
sustainable development through formal governance structures and technical 
exchanges. In this way we endeavour to ensure that the principles in  
The way we work are respected at all times.  
Escondida 
Rio Tinto has a 30 per cent interest in Escondida, which is managed by BHP 
Billiton. Our seats on the Owners’ Council allow us regular input on strategic 
and policy matters. In 2013, Escondida successfully negotiated a four-year 
contract with their union employees, which allows Escondida to continue to  
be focused on safety and the environment. Also during the year, the Escondida 
Water Supply project to construct a new 2,500 litre per second seawater 
desalination facility was approved. This project will ensure a continued  
water supply to sustain operations while minimising Escondida’s need  
to use groundwater.  
Grasberg 
PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, 
Inc., owns and operates the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia. We have a joint 
venture interest attributable to the 1995 mine expansion, which entitles us to  
a 40 per cent share of production above specified levels until the end of 2021 
and 40 per cent of all production after 2021. We have the ability to engage and 
influence through our representation on the Operating, Technical & Sustainable 
Development Committees.

The way we work is also core to our Integrity and compliance programme, 
supported by our standards covering antitrust, anti-corruption, fraud,  
conflicts of interest, data privacy and third party due diligence. One of the key 
components of our programme focuses on acting with integrity. This translates 
into our compliance with the law and the Group’s own policies and standards. 
One of our main objectives is preventing misconduct before it occurs. Through 
our training and guidelines, our employees are made aware of their 
responsibility to act with integrity at all times.  
The programme reflects the size and geographical spread of the Group  
as well as the diverse activities of our businesses. It also implements a 
communications strategy to raise awareness of our values, principles and 
internal controls. 
We encourage employees to raise any concerns directly with management  
but, if they are uncomfortable in doing so, they can use Speak-OUT, the  
Group’s confidential and independently-operated whistleblowing programme.  
Speak-OUT offers an avenue where employees can choose to report 
anonymously, subject to local law, any significant concerns about the business, 
or behaviour of individuals. This could include suspicion of violations in financial 
reporting, safety or environmental procedures, or business integrity issues  
in general.  
During 2013, 618 Speak-OUT reports were lodged, which was approximately 
eight per cent less than 2012. Twenty one per cent of cases raised issues 
relating to business integrity, 62 per cent to personnel issues, ten per cent  
to safety and sustainability, and the remaining seven per cent of cases raised 
miscellaneous concerns. Fifty eight per cent of matters raised and closed 
through Speak-OUT resulted in action being taken in relation to the reported 
issue after it was examined or investigated. 
Rio Tinto is committed, in principle and practice, to maximum transparency 
consistent with good governance and commercial confidentiality. We issue 
information in a timely way on the Group’s operational, financial and 
sustainable development performance through a number of channels.  
We communicate views to governments and others on matters affecting  
our business interests. By furthering public dialogue, we contribute to  
the development of sound legislation and regulation that is relevant  
and appropriate to our business interests.

Inherent limitations 
Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements 
due to the selective testing of the information being 
examined. Therefore fraud, error or non-compliance may 
occur and not be detected. Additionally, non-financial 
data may be subject to more inherent limitations than 
financial data, given both its nature and the methods 
used for determining, calculating and sampling or 
estimating such data. 
 
Restriction on use 
This report has been prepared in accordance with our 
engagement terms to assist Rio Tinto in reporting its 
sustainable development performance. We do not accept 
or assume responsibility for the consequences of any 
reliance on this report for any other purpose or to any 
other person or organisation. Any reliance on this report 
by any third party is entirely at its own risk.  
We consent to the inclusion of this report in the Rio Tinto 
2013 Annual report and the Rio Tinto 2013 Strategic 
report to assist Rio Tinto’s members in assessing whether 
 
the directors have discharged their responsibilities by 
commissioning an independent assurance report in 
connection with the selected subject matter. 
Limited assurance 
This engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance 
for our conclusions. As a limited assurance engagement 
is restricted primarily to enquiries and analytical 
procedures and the work is substantially less detailed 
than that undertaken for a reasonable assurance 
engagement, the level of assurance is lower than would 
be obtained in a reasonable assurance engagement.

Following the conclusion of a comprehensive review in August 2013, the Group determined 
that the divestment of Pacific Aluminium for value was not possible in the current economic 
conditions. On 29 November 2013, Rio Tinto announced that it intended to suspend 
alumina production at Gove, Australia and focus on its bauxite operations after determining 
the refinery was no longer a viable business in the current market conditions. The four 
Pacific Aluminium smelters and the Gove bauxite mine were therefore reintegrated into  
Rio Tinto Alcan during the second half of 2013. The Gove alumina refinery continues to be 
reported in Other Operations. Comparative numbers have been reclassified accordingly. 
Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Aluminium product group’s ultimate objective is to be the most profitable 
primary aluminium producer in the world. In today’s challenging environment, 
this is only achievable by continuing to drive the transformation of the business, 
focusing on top-tier assets and continuing to improve cost structure in a 
sustainable way. 
The second wave of a comprehensive transformation strategy launched  
in 2011 is committed to continuing improvement by: 
– Improving performance through significant, widespread cost reductions  
and productivity gains. 
– Focusing on top-tier assets by curtailing high-cost capacity and divesting 
non-core assets.  
– Delivering key brownfield and modernisation projects that will enable  
Rio Tinto Alcan to leverage its leading bauxite and unrivalled renewable 
power positions, as well as its industry-leading proprietary AP technology. 
Safety 
In 2013, the Aluminium group’s all injury frequency rate showed incremental 
improvement to 0.66 versus its target of 0.68
(1)
. Sadly, however, there was  
one fatality in April, which resulted from an accident at the Alma smelter  
in Quebec, Canada.  
Rio Tinto Alcan’s ongoing priority is to press ahead with implementing the  
Zero Harm by Choice leadership development programme, while continuing  
to learn from significant potential incidents and improving the effectiveness  
of critical control monitoring plans, in order to reach the ultimate goal of zero 
injuries. Vehicle and pedestrian safety, working at height and lifting loads 
remain the most important personal safety risks to manage. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Rio Tinto Alcan reduced its greenhouse gas intensity by 29 per cent since  
2008, making a substantial contribution to Rio Tinto’s overall GHG intensity 
improvements
(2)
. This significant reduction came from the divestment or 
closure of outdated or higher-carbon energy plants, as well as ongoing 
operational improvements that have combined to give Rio Tinto Alcan one  
of the lowest carbon footprints in the aluminium industry. 
Following the recent reintegration of Pacific Aluminium into Rio Tinto Alcan,  
78 per cent of Rio Tinto Alcan’s power supply is carbon-free. Seventy two per 
cent comes from hydroelectricity, one of the cleanest forms of electricity 
production, and the remaining six per cent comes from nuclear power sources. 
Rio Tinto Alcan works closely with stakeholders to address sustainability 
concerns and help identify ways to foster greater transparency and 
sustainability throughout the aluminium industry. In 2013 the results of the 
Quebec Government-led assessment of the carbon footprint of Rio Tinto Alcan 
ingot made in Quebec, relative to the industry average, showed a 50 per cent 
lower global warming potential than the industry average (excluding China). 
Review of operations  
Rio Tinto Alcan’s ongoing transformation is strengthening its position as the 
world’s leading aluminium business in terms of quality of assets, productivity 
and profitability.  
The Aluminium group delivered underlying earnings of US$557 million −  
US$503 million higher than 2012, including increased EBITDA margins, despite 
a nine per cent decline in average London Metal Exchange (LME) prices period-
over-period and the negative impact of severe weather in Australia in the first 
half of 2013.  
The average aluminium market price in 2013 was US$1,845 per tonne, which 
compares to an average of US$2,018 per tonne in 2012. Rio Tinto Alcan’s 
average realised price, which includes market and product premiums, for 
primary metal products in 2013 was US$2,268 per tonne, compared with 
US$2,383 per tonne in 2012. The growing momentum from the cost reduction 
initiatives combined with increased volumes and a rise in market premia were 
the main drivers of the positive change in earnings. 
Rio Tinto Alcan pursued more than 500 cost reduction initiatives and in  
2013 these improvements lifted underlying earnings by US$392 million 
(US$574 million pre-tax). The savings included greater production efficiencies 
and lower prices of raw materials, lower functional costs and increased 
production from Yarwun and Alma. The impact of the heavy rainfalls in 
Queensland impacted cost reduction efforts by US$58 million pre-tax. 
Higher volumes were boosted by record operational performances at the 
bauxite operations, notably at the Weipa and Gove mines in Australia, taking 
advantage of higher demand and the steady ramp-up of production at the 
expanded Yarwun alumina refinery. Aluminium volumes realised a return to full 
production at the Alma, Quebec smelter, and completion of the leading-edge 
AP60 smelter which were in part offset by the curtailment of the Shawinigan 
smelter and the divestment of the Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne smelter and 
Castelsarrasin casting facility in France. 
The Aluminium group continued to strengthen its portfolio during 2013, 
building on the momentum of the past five years. To date, it has curtailed or 
closed 600,000 tonnes of high-cost aluminium smelting capacity, including 
100,000 tonnes curtailed at the Shawinigan smelter in Quebec in December 
2013. The group is in the process of curtailing 2.6 million tonnes of alumina 
capacity at Gove. Major divestments during 2013 included the sale of Rio Tinto 
Alcan’s 50 per cent stake in the Vigelands Metal Refinery and associated power 
station in Norway, the sale of the St. Jean-de-Maurienne smelter and 
Castelsarrasin business in France, and the sale of the Sebree smelter in the US. 
The group is continuing to review appropriate future pathways for other  
non-Tier 1 assets. 
An impairment charge of US$1,293 million was recognised relating  
to the Group’s aluminium business, primarily for Gove alumina refinery  
(US$555 million)
(3)
, following the 29 November announcement to curtail 
production, and for the Kitimat assets (US$696 million) where a significant 
project cost overrun has been identified which diminished the value  
of the associated intangible assets.
 
(1)  The figure excludes Pacific Aluminium and Gove. Pacific Aluminium had an all  
injury frequency rate of 0.88 in 2013. Gove had an all injury frequency rate of 0.93. 
(2)  The figure excludes Pacific Aluminium and Gove. Pacific Aluminium accounted  
for 26 per cent of Rio Tinto’s total GHG emissions in 2013, and Gove accounted  
for five per cent of total GHG emissions.

Development projects 
Rio Tinto Alcan’s primary focus is on delivering key existing brownfield and 
modernisation projects − investments that will enable it to leverage the group’s 
strong bauxite and low-cost hydropower positions. 
The new Arvida Smelter and AP60 Technology Centre in Quebec’s Saguenay–
Lac-Saint-Jean region is complete and has ramped up successfully. With an 
initial capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year, the smelter provides an industrial-
scale research and development platform for commercialising Rio Tinto Alcan’s 
latest-generation AP Technology™. AP60 is designed to deliver significantly 
lower full economic costs of production once at full capacity, including  
40 per cent higher metal output per pot and 15 per cent higher labour 
productivity. This new facility, which will eventually replace the existing  
Arvida smelter, has the potential for two additional phases that would  
boost annual capacity of the new facility from 60,000 to 450,000 tonnes.  
In British Columbia, the modernisation of the Kitimat smelter will enable  
the Aluminium group to fully leverage its wholly-owned Kemano hydropower 
resource. A project cost overrun has been identified, and a process to validate 
the extent of the overrun is currently under way. Any additional capital  
required to complete the project will be subject to board approval. Subject  
to that approval, the Kitimat Modernisation Project is now expected to be 
commissioned and produce first metal during the first half of 2015. This project 
will increase Kitimat’s annual capacity by some 48 per cent to approximately 
420,000 tonnes, while moving production into the first decile of the cost  
curve and achieving a reduction of more than 50 per cent in the smelter’s 
emissions intensity. 
Ramp-up at the expanded Yarwun alumina refinery in Australia, a project 
known as Yarwun 2, is now complete and contributing to reduced alumina 
operating costs. Production capacity at Yarwun has more than doubled, to  
3.4 million tonnes per year: an initiative that strengthens Rio Tinto Alcan’s 
second-quartile position on the industry cost curve for alumina production. 
Bauxite growth projects include the South of the Embley expansion project  
in Queensland, which, subject to approval, will extend the life of the Weipa 
bauxite mine by about 40 years (depending on production rates). This will 
ensure continuity of supply for Rio Tinto Alcan’s Gladstone refineries, while  
also facilitating exports to meet rapidly increasing demand from China and  
the developing Middle East market. This project can be developed at the 
appropriate time. 
Due to current market conditions, it is unlikely that Rio Tinto Alcan will make 
further significant investments in aluminium and alumina growth projects for  
the foreseeable future. 
Outlook 
Looking to the near term, bauxite should continue to be the healthiest segment 
of the industry, driven largely by strong demand in China. Rio Tinto Alcan is well 
positioned to take advantage of this strong demand through its industry-leading 
bauxite assets, especially against the backdrop of the supply uncertainty 
created by Indonesia’s export ban, which was implemented in January 2014. 
Global demand for alumina and aluminium is also strong, however these 
segments face continued challenges going forward.  
At the end of 2013, the aluminium market was nearly balanced following  
recent curtailments and production disruptions. Aluminium inventories are 
likely to remain high as warehouse deals are driven by the attractiveness of low 
interest rates and a strong contango (ie indicative of expected higher prices). 
The market for alumina, currently trading at or around the marginal cost  
of production, is expected to remain near balanced for the near term. 
Metal prices remain under pressure – as do many marginal producers. 
Nonetheless, market premiums have reached unprecedented levels. Despite 
markedly-increasing premiums, a good portion of the industry remains in  
a loss-making position. This could intensify pressure for more curtailments,  
which over the longer term could put upward pressure on the LME base price. 
Recent proposals by the LME regarding warehousing rules could soften  
regional premiums from their recent record levels to a more historic range,  
but this will take time to unfold. 
Despite the short-term challenges, the longer-term outlook for aluminium 
remains robust and Rio Tinto Alcan believes that strong margins will be 
available for the well-positioned, low-cost operator. Medium to long-term 
compound annual demand growth rates (from a 2013 base) are forecast  
to average five per cent until 2020 and to be near four per cent until 2030. 
Transportation will be the stand-out growth end-use sector supported by 
substitution of other materials by aluminium.

one fatality in April, which resulted from an accident at the Alma smelter  
in Quebec, Canada.  
Rio Tinto Alcan’s ongoing priority is to press ahead with implementing the  
Zero Harm by Choice leadership development programme, while continuing  
to learn from significant potential incidents and improving the effectiveness  
of critical control monitoring plans, in order to reach the ultimate goal of zero 
injuries. Vehicle and pedestrian safety, working at height and lifting loads 
remain the most important personal safety risks to manage. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Rio Tinto Alcan reduced its greenhouse gas intensity by 29 per cent since  
2008, making a substantial contribution to Rio Tinto’s overall GHG intensity 
improvements
(2)
. This significant reduction came from the divestment or 
closure of outdated or higher-carbon energy plants, as well as ongoing 
operational improvements that have combined to give Rio Tinto Alcan one  
of the lowest carbon footprints in the aluminium industry. 
Following the recent reintegration of Pacific Aluminium into Rio Tinto Alcan,  
78 per cent of Rio Tinto Alcan’s power supply is carbon-free. Seventy two per 
cent comes from hydroelectricity, one of the cleanest forms of electricity 
production, and the remaining six per cent comes from nuclear power sources. 
Rio Tinto Alcan works closely with stakeholders to address sustainability 
concerns and help identify ways to foster greater transparency and 
sustainability throughout the aluminium industry. In 2013 the results of the 
Quebec Government-led assessment of the carbon footprint of Rio Tinto Alcan 
ingot made in Quebec, relative to the industry average, showed a 50 per cent 
lower global warming potential than the industry average (excluding China). 
Review of operations  
Rio Tinto Alcan’s ongoing transformation is strengthening its position as the 
world’s leading aluminium business in terms of quality of assets, productivity 
and profitability.  
The Aluminium group delivered underlying earnings of US$557 million −  
US$503 million higher than 2012, including increased EBITDA margins, despite 
a nine per cent decline in average London Metal Exchange (LME) prices period-
over-period and the negative impact of severe weather in Australia in the first 
half of 2013.  
The average aluminium market price in 2013 was US$1,845 per tonne, which 
compares to an average of US$2,018 per tonne in 2012. Rio Tinto Alcan’s 
average realised price, which includes market and product premiums, for 
primary metal products in 2013 was US$2,268 per tonne, compared with 
US$2,383 per tonne in 2012. The growing momentum from the cost reduction 
initiatives combined with increased volumes and a rise in market premia were 
the main drivers of the positive change in earnings. 
Rio Tinto Alcan pursued more than 500 cost reduction initiatives and in  
2013 these improvements lifted underlying earnings by US$392 million 
(US$574 million pre-tax). The savings included greater production efficiencies 
and lower prices of raw materials, lower functional costs and increased 
production from Yarwun and Alma. The impact of the heavy rainfalls in 
Queensland impacted cost reduction efforts by US$58 million pre-tax. 
Higher volumes were boosted by record operational performances at the 
bauxite operations, notably at the Weipa and Gove mines in Australia, taking 
advantage of higher demand and the steady ramp-up of production at the 
expanded Yarwun alumina refinery. Aluminium volumes realised a return to full 
production at the Alma, Quebec smelter, and completion of the leading-edge 
AP60 smelter which were in part offset by the curtailment of the Shawinigan 
smelter and the divestment of the Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne smelter and 
Castelsarrasin casting facility in France. 
The Aluminium group continued to strengthen its portfolio during 2013, 
building on the momentum of the past five years. To date, it has curtailed or 
closed 600,000 tonnes of high-cost aluminium smelting capacity, including 
100,000 tonnes curtailed at the Shawinigan smelter in Quebec in December 
2013. The group is in the process of curtailing 2.6 million tonnes of alumina 
capacity at Gove. Major divestments during 2013 included the sale of Rio Tinto 
Alcan’s 50 per cent stake in the Vigelands Metal Refinery and associated power 
station in Norway, the sale of the St. Jean-de-Maurienne smelter and 
Castelsarrasin business in France, and the sale of the Sebree smelter in the US. 
The group is continuing to review appropriate future pathways for other  
non-Tier 1 assets. 
An impairment charge of US$1,293 million was recognised relating  
to the Group’s aluminium business, primarily for Gove alumina refinery  
(US$555 million)
(3)
, following the 29 November announcement to curtail 
production, and for the Kitimat assets (US$696 million) where a significant 
project cost overrun has been identified which diminished the value  
of the associated intangible assets.
 
(1)  The figure excludes Pacific Aluminium and Gove. Pacific Aluminium had an all  
injury frequency rate of 0.88 in 2013. Gove had an all injury frequency rate of 0.93. 
(2)  The figure excludes Pacific Aluminium and Gove. Pacific Aluminium accounted  
for 26 per cent of Rio Tinto’s total GHG emissions in 2013, and Gove accounted  
for five per cent of total GHG emissions.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Northparkes (formerly Rio Tinto: 80 per cent)  
Located in New South Wales, Australia, Northparkes was a joint venture with  
the Sumitomo Group. Northparkes produced 51 thousand tonnes of copper  
and 62 thousand ounces of gold up to December 2013 (100 per cent basis).  
In July 2013, Rio Tinto announced an agreement to sell its 80 per cent interest 
in Northparkes to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for US$820 million.  
The transaction closed on 1 December 2013.  
Palabora (formerly Rio Tinto: 57.7 per cent)  
Palabora Mining Company is a South African company formerly listed on  
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The mine produced 26 thousand tonnes  
of refined copper up to July 2013 (100 per cent basis). In December 2012,  
Rio Tinto announced an agreement to sell its interest in Palabora for 
consideration totalling US$373 million. The transaction closed on 31 July 2013.  
Development projects 
The Copper group’s investment focus is on improving productivity and mine  
life at key operating assets and retaining development optionality on high 
quality projects, with production to come online when the market dictates.  
It employs a phased approach to development to maximise the value of a 
project to shareholders and to manage project risks and capital exposure. 
Productivity and mine life extension 
Kennecott  
Rio Tinto is investing US$660 million to extend the life of Kennecott’s Bingham 
Canyon Mine from 2018 to 2030. The project, known as Cornerstone, involves 
pushing back the south wall of Bingham Canyon to gain access to 515 million 
tonnes of 0.79 per cent copper equivalent ore, with first ore expected to be 
accessed in 2017. 
Escondida 
At Escondida, production was approximately seven per cent higher in 2013, 
primarily as a result of higher ore grades and improved throughout rates.  
In addition, Escondida will construct a new dynamic leach pad to maintain 
current levels of oxide leaching. The project should be complete in mid-2014, 
when the existing heap leach is exhausted. 
Grasberg 
PT Freeport Indonesia continues to develop the large-scale, high-grade 
underground orebodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit.  
In aggregate, these underground orebodies are expected to ramp up over 
several years to approximately 240,000 tonnes of ore per day following the 
anticipated transition from the Grasberg open pit in 2017.  
Oyu Tolgoi 
On 29 July 2013, Rio Tinto announced that all funding and work on 
underground development of Oyu Tolgoi would be delayed. Since then,  
Rio Tinto has continued to engage with the Government of Mongolia with the 
aim of resolving a number of outstanding shareholder issues and to progress 
project finance. An option to restart underground development, subject to 
certain conditions being met, has been proposed, but further delays may occur 
if these conditions are not met before lender commitments on existing project 
finance arrangements expire. Such delays could lead to further impairments. 
Greenfield projects 
La Granja (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent) 
The La Granja project, located in northern Peru, has the potential to be  
a Tier 1 asset and one of Rio Tinto’s highest-value opportunities. 
The project strategy is focused on delivering a risk-managed and staged entry 
to a world-class mining district. The mine development strategy is designed to 
manage social, environmental and technical challenges by starting at a small 
scale and preserving options to grow the project over time. 
Resolution Copper (Rio Tinto: 55 per cent) 
The Resolution Copper project, located in Arizona, US, is among the top ten 
largest undeveloped copper assets in the world, and could eventually become 
the largest copper producer in North America.  
In November 2013, the company submitted a Mine Plan of Operations to  
initiate Federal permitting on the project. Approval of the plan would allow 
mining to occur on lands where the company currently holds mineral title. 
Resolution is also seeking approval in the US Congress to acquire full legal  
title to 671 hectares of public land held under its mineral claim and to revoke  
a mineral withdrawal on 307 hectares of adjacent land. In exchange, the  
project would give the public more than 2,400 hectares of high-quality Arizona 
conservation lands. While exchange legislation faces opposition from special-
interest groups, it is moving through the US Congress with bi-partisan support.  
Technology and innovation 
The Copper group recently established a Growth and Innovation organisation 
responsible for developing a focused, attractive portfolio of value-producing 
growth and innovation opportunities. The group invests in value-creating, 
leading-edge technology to drive the efficiency and safety of its mining 
processes and reduce environmental impact, above and below ground.  
Taking in real-time data, the new Excellence Centre uses the latest in modelling 
and simulation tools to significantly improve copper processing performance 
across the globe. 
Rio Tinto is evaluating a range of incremental and step-change technologies  
to improve the safety and productivity of current mines and expansions,  
with a particular focus on mineral processing and block cave mining. This  
has included large-scale copper sulphide leach testwork on the La Granja 
mineralisation and a successful pilot sulphide leach facility using ore  
at Kennecott.  
Outlook 
While Rio Tinto expects volatility in the near term, long-term fundamentals  
for the copper industry remain positive. The continued urbanisation, 
industrialisation and electrification of China and other large markets such  
as India and South East Asia, combined with greater energy-efficiency 
requirements and the move toward more renewable energy sources, will 
continue to drive long-term copper demand. Against those demand dynamics, 
the supply picture will remain constrained, with continued cost escalation in 
some jurisdictions, falling grades, technical challenges from increasing depth  
at existing operations and new discoveries, water and power constraints, and 
continued political and social risks, especially for new projects. 
Rio Tinto Copper is well positioned to benefit from of these strong market 
dynamics. It is currently the industry’s sixth largest copper producer, with 
existing Tier 1 assets. In addition, the group is pursuing high-value growth 
opportunities, using a phased and structured approach to development 
investment while maintaining optionality. The group is carefully managing  
costs and capital exposure, and its leadership in technological innovations 
allows it to safely and efficiently access lower grade ores and deposits, at 
greater depths. This strategy will generate significant and sustainable value for 
shareholders and all partners, as it is expected to reposition the group from the 
third quartile of the copper cost curve into a low-cost, first quartile producer.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Copper product group’s 4+2 strategy aims to create substantial and 
sustainable value for shareholders. It is focused on building a core portfolio  
of four operating assets (Kennecott Utah Copper, Oyu Tolgoi, Escondida and 
Grasberg) and two world-class greenfield projects (La Granja and Resolution 
Copper) that are or are expected to be large, long-life, low-cost and expandable 
operations. The Copper group will deliver this strategy through:  
Relentlessly focusing on health, safety, environmental responsibility and 
community engagement, and sustainable partnerships with governments 
and communities.  
Improving productivity via safer, better and smarter practices and selected 
investments in technologies that generate long-term value.  
Driving maximum value out of the products the group mines and optimising 
the entire supply chain.  
Developing strong leadership, matching the group’s employees and skills to 
its current and future requirements, and creating a culture that establishes 
accountability for delivery of business objectives. 
Safety 
In 2013, the Copper group’s all injury frequency rate was 0.49, compared  
to 0.50 in 2012. The group regrettably had a fatality at La Granja, one  
of its managed projects, in 2013. Tragically, there were 33 fatalities at the  
non-managed Grasberg mine, of which 28 were related to a devastating 
underground accident. There was also a fatality at the SouthGobi Resources 
non-managed infrastructure project. 
Rio Tinto Copper’s safety programmes are focused on four facets:  
Eliminating fatality risks and catastrophic events, and developing sound 
mitigation plans.  
Helping employees at all levels understand safety risks and how to manage 
them. The group’s new Underground performance safety standards are 
believed to be the most thorough and inclusive in the mining industry. 
Strong focus on reducing injuries. 
Safe design and engineering standards.  
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Copper group’s 2013 greenhouse gas emissions were 8.34 tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of copper cathode produced, compared 
with 10.66 tonnes in 2012. The increase in efficiency resulted from an 
incremental improvement at Kennecott Utah Copper and from the divestment 
of the Palabora smelter in mid-2013.  
Review of operations  
The Copper portfolio is made up of large, long-life, low-cost and expandable 
operations that are capable of creating substantial and sustainable value for 
shareholders. In 2013, the group produced 631 thousand tonnes of mined 
copper (Rio Tinto share), making Rio Tinto the world’s sixth largest supplier. 
The group also produced 340 thousand ounces of mined gold, 4,765 thousand 
ounces of mined silver and 5.7 thousand tonnes of molybdenum as by-
products of its copper operations. 
The group’s underlying earnings of US$821 million were 22 per cent lower than 
2012. Excluding the impact of the US$131 million write-down of the investment 
in Northern Dynasty Minerals, which owns 100 per cent of the Pebble Project in 
the Bristol Bay region of western Alaska, underlying earnings were ten per cent 
lower than 2012. This reflected lower prices, the impact of the pit wall slide at 
Bingham Canyon and decreased gold and molybdenum volumes at Kennecott 
Utah Copper from lower grades. These were partly offset by US$352 million of 
cash cost savings (US$514 million pre-tax) achieved across the Copper group, 
notably at Kennecott Utah Copper. A post-tax and non-controlling interest 
impairment charge of US$1,655 million has been recognised as an exclusion 
from underlying earnings. This includes US$1,565 million related to the 
impairment of previous non-cash accounting uplifts on first consolidation of 
certain assets of Turquoise Hill (including Oyu Tolgoi). In addition, charges of 
US$283 million have been excluded from underlying earnings related to the 
Kennecott Utah Copper slide. 
In 2013, the group repositioned its portfolio and delivered significant 
improvements in productivity and costs, with a 15 per cent increase in mined 
copper despite challenges at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi, a 12 per cent reduction 
in costs at managed operations − including a 23 per cent reduction in service 
and support costs. It also completed US$1.8 billion of divestments. 
Core operating assets 
Kennecott Utah Copper (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent)  
As the second largest copper producer in the US, Kennecott accounts for nearly 
25 per cent of the country’s copper production. In 2013, Kennecott produced 
194 thousand tonnes of refined copper, 192 thousand ounces of refined gold, 
and 5.7 thousand tonnes of molybdenum. On 10 April 2013, the Bingham 
Canyon Mine experienced a 135 million tonne landslide on the north-east wall. 
As a result of Kennecott’s sophisticated monitoring systems and advanced 
planning, no one was injured. Recovery work will continue until the end of 2015, 
with production in the near and medium term constrained by the slide. In 2013, 
Kennecott’s underground project was paused until further value-engineering 
work is completed to assess the most profitable path forward for the project.  
Oyu Tolgoi (Rio Tinto: 51 per cent interest in Turquoise Hill Resources) 
Located in Mongolia’s South Gobi Desert, Oyu Tolgoi is the largest new  
copper-gold operation in the world. Commercial operations began in mid-2013 
and Oyu Tolgoi’s open pit is now operating at full capacity. In 2013, Oyu Tolgoi 
produced 77 thousand tonnes of copper and 157 thousand ounces of gold. 
Customers began collecting concentrate from the Chinese warehouse during 
the fourth quarter of 2013, and had withdrawn approximately 26,400 tonnes  
of concentrate by year end.  
Escondida (Rio Tinto: 30 per cent)  
Located in Chile’s Atacama Desert, Escondida is the world’s largest copper mine 
in terms of copper production. In 2013, Escondida produced 1.1 million tonnes 
of copper (100 per cent basis). 
Grasberg (a joint venture that gives Rio Tinto a 40 per cent share of 
production above specified levels until the end of 2021 and 40 per cent  
of all production after 2021) 
Grasberg is owned and operated by PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of  
US-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Located in the province of 
Papua in Indonesia, it is one of the world’s largest copper mines. Rio Tinto’s 
share of mined copper production at Grasberg was six thousand tonnes  
in 2013. 
Divested operations  
In 2013, Rio Tinto Copper made solid progress in repositioning its portfolio  
to focus on a core portfolio of Tier 1 assets, with US$1.8 billion of divestments 
completed, including Northparkes, Palabora, Eagle, Altynalmas Gold and Inova. 
The group has also committed to reviewing the strategic fit of its minority 
interest in Northern Dynasty Minerals, which owns 100 per cent of the Pebble 
Project in Alaska.

improvements in productivity and costs, with a 15 per cent increase in mined 
copper despite challenges at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi, a 12 per cent reduction 
in costs at managed operations − including a 23 per cent reduction in service 
and support costs. It also completed US$1.8 billion of divestments. 
Core operating assets 
Kennecott Utah Copper (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent)  
As the second largest copper producer in the US, Kennecott accounts for nearly 
25 per cent of the country’s copper production. In 2013, Kennecott produced 
194 thousand tonnes of refined copper, 192 thousand ounces of refined gold, 
and 5.7 thousand tonnes of molybdenum. On 10 April 2013, the Bingham 
Canyon Mine experienced a 135 million tonne landslide on the north-east wall. 
As a result of Kennecott’s sophisticated monitoring systems and advanced 
planning, no one was injured. Recovery work will continue until the end of 2015, 
with production in the near and medium term constrained by the slide. In 2013, 
Kennecott’s underground project was paused until further value-engineering 
work is completed to assess the most profitable path forward for the project.  
Oyu Tolgoi (Rio Tinto: 51 per cent interest in Turquoise Hill Resources) 
Located in Mongolia’s South Gobi Desert, Oyu Tolgoi is the largest new  
copper-gold operation in the world. Commercial operations began in mid-2013 
and Oyu Tolgoi’s open pit is now operating at full capacity. In 2013, Oyu Tolgoi 
produced 77 thousand tonnes of copper and 157 thousand ounces of gold. 
Customers began collecting concentrate from the Chinese warehouse during 
the fourth quarter of 2013, and had withdrawn approximately 26,400 tonnes  
of concentrate by year end.  
Escondida (Rio Tinto: 30 per cent)  
Located in Chile’s Atacama Desert, Escondida is the world’s largest copper mine 
in terms of copper production. In 2013, Escondida produced 1.1 million tonnes 
of copper (100 per cent basis). 
Grasberg (a joint venture that gives Rio Tinto a 40 per cent share of 
production above specified levels until the end of 2021 and 40 per cent  
of all production after 2021) 
Grasberg is owned and operated by PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of  
US-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Located in the province of 
Papua in Indonesia, it is one of the world’s largest copper mines. Rio Tinto’s 
share of mined copper production at Grasberg was six thousand tonnes  
in 2013. 
Divested operations  
In 2013, Rio Tinto Copper made solid progress in repositioning its portfolio  
to focus on a core portfolio of Tier 1 assets, with US$1.8 billion of divestments 
completed, including Northparkes, Palabora, Eagle, Altynalmas Gold and Inova. 
The group has also committed to reviewing the strategic fit of its minority 
interest in Northern Dynasty Minerals, which owns 100 per cent of the Pebble 
Project in Alaska.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Diamonds & Minerals product group has an attractive portfolio of 
businesses that connect customers and consumers all around the world with 
products that enhance the quality of life. Demand growth for diamonds and 
industrial minerals typically follows peak requirements for commodities such as 
iron ore and copper as mid-to-late economic development cycle minerals. The 
group’s strategy is focused on operating safe, low-cost, demand-led businesses. 
Through its integrated marketing strategies, the group can create and grow 
global markets for its products that produce value for Rio Tinto and  
its shareholders. 
The product group’s strategy is focused on: 
Creating demand-led, integrated operations that can respond quickly  
to the changing external environment. 
Generating and exploiting proprietary market insights. 
Growing global markets through business-focused research and  
market development. 
Strengthening its position in traditional segments and entering attractive  
new markets. 
Improving operating performance by cutting costs, driving productivity  
and delayering the organisation. 
Safety 
Diamonds & Minerals continues to focus on fostering a culture of accountability 
and awareness among employees and improving contractor safety in our 
pursuit of zero harm. The product group’s all injury frequency rate (AIFR) 
increased to 0.75 in 2013 from 0.57 in 2012. Regrettably, there was one fatality 
in November 2013 at Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa. 
The product group faces some unique challenges in health and safety.  
The workforce spans multiple nationalities, ethnicities, languages and cultures 
in developing countries. In response, management is employing innovative 
strategies and visible safety leadership to train the workforce. 
Diamonds & Minerals is focused on eliminating fatality risks by placing  
an emphasis on critical controls and robust process safety. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity increased slightly in 2013. 
This was largely due to lower production at Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium (RTIT);  
the reduction in capacity utilisation of its smelters led to an increase in  
GHG emissions per tonne of product – reflected in a four per cent increase  
in emissions intensity for RTIT compared to 2012. GHG emissions per tonne  
of product were marginally higher at Rio Tinto Minerals, but improved across  
Rio Tinto Diamonds operations. The product group continues to invest in the 
implementation of more efficient equipment and technology, such as the  
wind farm at Diavik. 
Review of operations  
The group’s underlying earnings of US$350 million include evaluation costs  
in respect of Simandou of US$43 million. Excluding Simandou expenditure, 
underlying earnings of US$393 million were four per cent lower than in 2012. 
Prices were lower for titanium dioxide feedstocks, zircon, metallics and borates, 
while titanium dioxide sales volumes were also lower. This was offset by higher 
diamond prices, favourable exchange rate movements and lower evaluation 
study costs. The acquisition of BHP Billiton’s interests in Richards Bay Minerals 
in September 2012 also contributed an increase in earnings. 
On a like-for-like basis, cash operating costs of production in 2013 were  
US$358 million lower than in 2012, reflecting the impact of targeted cost 
reduction initiatives and favourable exchange rate movements. A large number 
of initiatives were launched to remove significant structural costs from the 
business, including delayering the organisation, driving productivity initiatives 
and removing costs. In parallel, temporary plant closures in response to market 
conditions generated significant savings in variable costs during the year.  
Rio Tinto Diamonds (RTD) 
RTD is a leading producer of rough diamonds with a product portfolio that 
provides a presence in all major markets. Rio Tinto’s diamonds assets comprise 
the Argyle Diamond Mine in Australia (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent), the Diavik 
Diamond Mine in Canada (60 per cent), Murowa Diamonds in Zimbabwe  
(78 per cent) and the Bunder diamond project in India (100 per cent). RTD  
sells its share of production through its centralised marketing office in Belgium 
and has a niche cutting and polishing factory in Australia for its high-end  
pink diamonds from the Argyle mine, and sells them to an international  
customer base. 
In June 2013, Rio Tinto announced its intention to retain its diamonds 
businesses after concluding a strategic review which considered a range of 
options, including potential divestment. The medium to long-term market 
fundamentals for diamonds remain robust, and the high quality diamonds 
business is well positioned to capitalise on the positive market outlook. 
RTD produced 16.0 million carats in 2013, a 22 per cent increase from 2012 
that reflected higher tonnes processed and higher grades at Argyle following 
the commissioning of the underground mine in April 2013. Revenue in 2013 
was 15 per cent higher than in 2012, reflecting higher volumes and increased 
prices. RTD reported earnings of US$53 million in 2013, compared to a loss of 
US$25 million in 2012, reflecting higher revenues and cost savings. 
The ramp-up of the Argyle underground mine to full operation is on schedule 
to be completed by 2015, extending the life of mine until at least 2020.  
Production from Diavik’s underground mine commenced in early 2010  
in parallel with open pit operations. Diavik has now completed the transition  
to a fully underground mine, with all three pipes now at full production. 
Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium (RTIT) 
RTIT is the largest producer of high-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks. It mines 
ilmenite at its wholly-owned Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT) operation in Canada; 
its managed operation Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa (Rio Tinto:  
74 per cent); and its QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operation (80 per cent). 
RTIT produces high-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks at its world-class 
metallurgical complexes at RTFT and RBM as well as valuable co-products 
including high purity iron, steel, metal powders, zircon and rutile.  
In 2013, titanium dioxide feedstock production increased by two per cent  
year-on-year to 1.6 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share). This includes an increase 
in attributable volumes at RBM resulting from Rio Tinto doubling its stake in 
September 2012. Due to challenging market conditions for high grade titanium 
dioxide feedstock, RTFT brought forward a planned shutdown of one of nine 
furnaces in Canada and deferred the rebuild until market conditions improve. 
The RTFT upgraded slag (UGS) production was also taken offline for part of  
the year, together with zircon and rutile production at RBM. 
RTIT’s revenues increased by one per cent as the impact of the RBM 
transaction was largely offset by lower prices for titanium dioxide feedstocks, 
zircon and metallics and lower sales volumes of titanium dioxide feedstocks. 
Earnings fell by 35 per cent to US$264 million, despite the benefit of the RBM 
transaction, which increased Rio Tinto’s share of earnings with effect from 
September 2012.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Rio Tinto Minerals (RTM) 
RTM (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent) supplies over 30 per cent of the world’s refined 
borates from its world-class deposit in Boron, California. RTM also has borates 
refineries and shipping facilities in China, France, Malaysia, the Netherlands, 
Spain and the US. 
Borates production of 495,000 tonnes boric oxide equivalent was seven per cent 
higher than in 2012, following cuts to production in 2012 in response to market 
conditions. Global demand for RTM refined borates improved slightly with 
revenue remaining flat on lower prices. Earnings of US$131 million were six  
per cent lower than 2012 due to the decrease in product prices. 
Rio Tinto Minerals is delivering the modified direct dissolving of kernite (MDDK) 
project, which allows for more efficient orebody utilisation. The project is on 
track for completion in 2014. 
Dampier Salt (DSL) 
Dampier Salt Limited, the world’s largest solar salt exporter, produces industrial 
salt by solar evaporation of seawater at Dampier and Port Hedland, and from 
underground brine at Lake MacLeod, all in Western Australia. Salt is sold 
principally to the base chemical industry markets in Asia. Salt production of  
6.7 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share) was two per cent lower than 2012. During 
2013, gypsum mining operations and sales were resumed. 
Development projects 
In 2011, Diamonds & Minerals re-entered the potash business through an 
exploration joint venture with North Atlantic Potash Inc., a subsidiary of  
JSC Acron. Acron is a world leader in fertiliser production and holds multiple 
potash exploration permits in Saskatchewan, Canada. Drilling results indicate 
encouraging potash grade and thickness. Higher nutritional standards, 
population growth and limited arable land make potash a critical factor in 
maintaining global food security, and a natural complement to RTM’s existing 
borate fertiliser business. 
Progress continued at the group’s Jadar lithium-borate deposit in Serbia.  
A pilot plant for processing Jadar material was commissioned at Boron and  
core samples processed at the plant yielded encouraging and positive results.  
If developed, the deposit has the potential to supply a significant proportion  
of global lithium demand. Lithium carbonate’s fastest-growing application  
is in batteries that provide clean power to industrial systems and electric and  
hybrid vehicles. 
In January 2013, against a backdrop of weaker market conditions for its 
products and the need to manage and reduce its costs, RTIT reviewed the 
economic viability of the TiO4 project and cancelled prefeasibility studies  
for the project in Canada and Madagascar. The Zulti South mine expansion  
at RBM, the mineral sands exploration programme in Mozambique and other 
brownfield studies at the group’s operations continue. 
The Bunder diamond project is progressing its prefeasibility study, which  
began in July 2010. These studies have confirmed the economic potential  
of the orebody and work is under way to define the best development option. 
Mine plan approval was received during the year and environmental approvals  
are under way. 
The Simandou iron ore project in Guinea is one of the largest-known 
undeveloped high-grade iron ore resources in the world. The concession will 
enable the development of the largest mine and infrastructure project ever 
undertaken in Africa. This will include the progressive development of a  
100 million tonne per annum mine, a 650-kilometre trans-Guinean railway  
and a new deep-water port.  
The project is adopting a “stage gate” approach for investment to be made  
in line with Government of Guinea approvals and funding processes. 
In February 2013, the Government of Guinea approved the Social and 
Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) conducted on the Simandou project. 
The SEIA is the result of a consultation programme involving more than 10,000 
members of the local communities and ensures the project is developed in a 
way that maximises long-term benefits for the people of Guinea and minimises 
impact on the communities and the environment. Also during the year, the 
project sponsors – the Government of Guinea, Rio Tinto, Chinalco and the 
International Finance Corporation  signed a letter of mutual intent setting  
out the key principles that will serve as the basis of the Investment Framework 
that the partners intend to finalise in the first half of 2014. The Investment 
Framework is instrumental in governing the Simandou project successfully,  
and in setting a stable and durable operating model and environment for all 
partners and investors.  
In parallel, the partners are seeking funding for the project infrastructure. This 
may include outsourcing to a third-party consortium in a strategy to embed a 
broad partnership approach to developing the multi-user infrastructure, and to 
reduce the risk and capital commitments of the Simandou project sponsors. 
Outlook 
The group serves a range of different industries, but are linked through their 
track record of creating and defining new and profitable markets for their 
products. Demand softened in these markets in 2013 in response to broader 
economic trends, and the outlook for 2014 remains uncertain, although there  
is some sense that developed economies are on the path to a more robust 
recovery, which is a driver for industrial mineral demand. However, the  
medium to long-term outlook continues to be positive across all products  
as urbanisation and rising standards of living drive higher levels of demand. 
RTM will continue to seek to capture profitable growth in emerging economies 
and maintain its position in its established markets. Ongoing supply chain 
improvements will facilitate speed and flexibility in shifting supply to promising 
sectors and regions. Demand for borates is expected to remain stable in the 
near term, and the long-term industry fundamentals remain attractive. RTM  
will focus on increasing refined borates capacity to meet higher-than-GDP 
demand growth while achieving world-class safety performance and improving 
its cost position.  
Demand for titanium dioxide feedstock is expected to continue to grow in  
the medium to long term, in line with improving global economic conditions, 
urbanisation and demand growth in emerging markets supported by rising  
per capita incomes. In response to weak demand and excess inventory in the 
feedstock supply chain, and in order to reduce operating costs and inventory, 
RTIT has taken action at a number of its operations, including temporary 
closures of the UGS plant and deferral of a planned furnace rebuild at RTFT. 
Pigment inventory has returned to historical levels and it is expected that 
feedstock inventories within the supply chain will return to historical levels  
over the course of 2014.  
The medium to long-term fundamentals for the diamond industry are positive 
and expected to support sustainable future price growth. The global mineral 
reserve base is steadily declining, compounded by limited exploration 
investment and success, and expected reductions in supply over the medium  
to longer term. Demand in India and China is expected to continue to grow,  
and to represent nearly 50 per cent of global diamond consumption by 2020. 
Demand in mature markets is expected to continue to grow in line with GDP.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Energy product group aims to sustainably extract full value from its assets 
to serve growing global energy demand. It will achieve this by transforming  
the business to deliver sector-leading performance in all of its large,  
option-rich orebodies.  
The group is focused on: 
Maximising productivity and significantly reducing cost. 
Optimising the portfolio and deriving maximum value from mine to market. 
Embedding innovative and value-adding technology. 
Building trust and partnering to earn the right to operate. 
Safety 
In 2013, the Energy product group’s all injury frequency rate was 0.67 
compared to 0.66 in the previous year. In a challenging year of transformation 
there were no fatalities recorded at any operations. 
In 2013, Kestrel Mine’s strong commitment to health and safety was recognised 
with the mine winning the Chief Executive Safety Award for most improved 
operation. The Kestrel team has consistently improved its safety performance 
over recent years through increasing employee engagement on safety, and 
embedding the leadership commitment to ensure everyone returns home 
safely after every work shift. 
The Energy product group’s safety efforts are focused on: 
Understanding and eliminating critical safety risks.  
Fostering a culture of shared and personal accountability for safety. 
Reducing injuries as well as achieving zero fatalities. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Over the past 15 years, Rio Tinto has spent more than US$100 million on 
research and development into technologies that will reduce emissions from 
coal-fired power plants. This investment has been targeted at ensuring coal 
retains a significant role in the global energy mix in an increasingly carbon-
constrained environment. In 2013, the Energy product group continued its  
A$6 million sponsorship of The Otway Project, Australia’s first industrial-scale 
demonstration of geological carbon dioxide capture and storage.  
The Energy product group’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased to 
approximately 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2013, 
compared with 4.0 million tonnes in 2012. This reduction was mainly due  
to the implementation of a new industry methodology applicable only at  
the Energy product group’s New South Wales sites, which more accurately 
estimates fugitive emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. These gases 
naturally occur in coal seams and are released during the mining process. 
In 2013, Energy’s Australian coal and uranium operations completed energy-
use assessments in accordance with requirements under the Energy Efficiency 
Opportunities Act. More than 40 opportunities were identified relating to fuel 
usage, coal handling and processing, and process control. The opportunities 
identified will now undergo detailed evaluation. 
Review of operations  
The profitability of the uranium and Australian coal industries continues  
to be significantly impacted by lower commodity prices and high input costs. 
However, the long-term fundamentals for the Energy product group remain 
strong. The group has large option-rich assets and a programme of more than 
1,500 cost saving initiatives aimed at transforming the business to ensure it 
remains competitive throughout the cycle. 
In 2013 the Energy product group delivered underlying earnings of  
US$33 million compared with 2012 earnings of US$309 million. The decline  
in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower prices and the absence  
of gains on divestment of exploration properties, which amounted to  
US$258 million in 2012. This was partly offset by a weaker Australian dollar, 
lower operating costs and record production across a number of sites.  
A transformation programme of aggressive cost and productivity improvements 
continued to deliver results during the year, boosting earnings by US$442 
million (US$646 million pre-tax) compared with 2012. An impairment  
charge of US$470 million post-tax was also recognised relating to Rio Tinto  
Coal Mozambique.  
Rio Tinto Coal Australia (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent) 
In Queensland, Rio Tinto Coal Australia (RTCA) manages the Hail Creek  
(Rio Tinto: 82 per cent), Kestrel (80 per cent) and Clermont (50.1 per cent)  
coal mines. 
In New South Wales, RTCA manages Coal & Allied’s coal mines which include 
the Hunter Valley Operations (80 per cent), Bengalla (32 per cent), Mount 
Thorley (64 per cent) and Warkworth (44.5 per cent).  
RTCA is taking action across a wide front to improve the competitiveness  
of its operations during challenging conditions for the Australian coal industry. 
A transformation programme of business improvement initiatives has reduced 
operating costs significantly and increased productivity. Reduced expenditure 
on capital projects and improved management of working capital has further 
contributed to reducing costs. 
Australian coal production increased by eight per cent (Rio Tinto share) in 2013 
compared to 2012, with four mines (Hunter Valley Operations, Mount Thorley 
Warkworth, Bengalla and Clermont) achieving annual records. This substantial 
production increase was delivered through operational improvements, the 
completion of brownfield mine developments and the ramp-up of Clermont 
Mine. Net earnings of US$367 million represent a nine per cent decrease from 
2012, due to significantly lower prices for all types of coal. 
On 15 October 2013, the US$2 billion Kestrel Mine Extension in central 
Queensland was officially opened. The extension is expected to add 20 years  
to the life of the mine. Also in October, a binding agreement was signed to sell 
Clermont Mine for just over US$1 billion and a conditional sale and purchase 
agreement for Blair Athol Mine was reached.  
RTCA is working to secure a long-term future for the Mount Thorley Warkworth 
mine, following the NSW Land and Environment Court’s decision to overturn 
government planning approvals. Rio Tinto has also appealed against the Court’s 
decision, with support from the NSW Government. In early 2014, a short-term 
planning approval was granted that will enable the mine to resume normal 
operations for around two years.  
Energy Resources of Australia (Rio Tinto: 68.39 per cent)  
Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) is a publicly-listed company. Following  
the completion of open pit mining at its Ranger mine in December 2012, ERA 
continued production in 2013 by processing stockpiled ore. The majority of 
high-grade stockpiled ore was processed during the first half of 2013. In the 
second half of 2013, the mill was primarily fed with lower-grade stockpiled 
material and as a result uranium oxide production was reduced.  
On 7 December 2013, ERA voluntarily suspended ore processing operations 
following the failure of a leach tank in its processing plant. No one was injured 
in the incident which was fully contained by the mine’s containment system, 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013
32  
 
and there was no impact to the surrounding environment or to Kakadu National 
Park. The incident is being fully investigated.  
In September 2013, ERA’s A$220 million brine concentrator was officially 
opened. Managing water is central to ERA’s operations and the brine 
concentrator will help improve its ability to treat water and progressively 
rehabilitate the site. 
Since 2011 ERA has achieved total cumulative cash savings of A$127 million  
of its A$150 million in targeted reductions. This has been delivered through  
a number of initiatives, including merging management roles, reducing the  
use of contractors, reducing support and services roles, improvement in 
procurement and maintenance practices, and rationalisation of corporate costs. 
Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent) 
Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM) manages the Zambeze Project (100  
per cent), Tete East Project (100 per cent), and Benga Mine (65 per cent) in 
Mozambique, and the Zululand Anthracite Colliery (74 per cent) in South Africa. 
The Energy product group is working to secure a new pathway for its coal 
business in Mozambique. Its Benga mine has established itself as a hard coking 
coal producer and has been working to improve performance by reducing 
operating costs and increasing productivity.  
A post-tax impairment charge of US$470 million relating to RTCM was 
recognised. This impairment follows a review of RTCM’s development plan, 
discount rate and associated country risk premium and brings the total 
impairments relating to RTCM to US$3.3 billion.  
In 2013, RTCM delivered an operating cost reduction of US$20 per tonne,  
a 129 per cent increase in total coal production to 1.6 million tonnes (100 per 
cent basis) compared with 2012, a hard coking coal yield increase of five per 
cent and a reduction in overall headcount in excess of 25 per cent.  
Notwithstanding these improvements, challenges remain due to infrastructure 
constraints and difficult market conditions combined with instances of civil 
unrest and ongoing political tensions. While the families of expatriate workers 
were temporarily moved home in November, business operations were not 
impacted. Separate to this, from mid-December 2013 to mid-January 2014, 
RTCM suspended mining operations at the Benga mine to reduce stockpiled 
coal. Customer commitments continued to be met during the suspension.  
Rössing Uranium (Rio Tinto: 68.58 per cent) 
Rössing Uranium Mine is located near Arandis in Namibia’s Erongo region.  
Like the rest of the Energy product group, in 2013 Rössing focused on business 
improvement strategies to reduce unit costs and achieved its target of 
US$30 million in savings for 2013. Rössing’s overall strip ratios dropped from 
almost 4:1 in 2011 to 2:1 during 2013. Uranium production in 2013 was 5,312 
thousand pounds (100 per cent basis) compared with 5,950 thousand pounds 
in 2012. Production was impacted by lower-than-planned throughput and  
a leach tank failure in December which halted production. Some processing 
operations were restarted on 11 January 2014 and operations will continue  
to be progressively restored during the first quarter. 
Rio Tinto Canada Uranium (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent)  
Rio Tinto Canada Uranium’s Roughrider project is an exploration site located in 
North-Eastern Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, which supplies approximately 
20 per cent of the world’s uranium. An exploration programme is under way 
that is focused on obtaining orebody knowledge and a better appreciation of 
geotechnical, hydrological and hydrogeological conditions. Roughrider is near 
competitor deposits and existing uranium mills in the same geological terrain 
as all of Canada’s currently-producing uranium mines. 
In 2013, the Canadian Government agreed to enter into an Agreement in 
Principle with the European Union on the Comprehensive Economic Trade 
Agreement. The Agreement provides an exemption to eligible companies  
from the Non-Resident Ownership Policy as it applies to foreign ownership  
of uranium mines. Once enacted, this change means Rio Tinto could, if 
economical to do so, develop a uranium operation without the requirement  
of first finding a Canadian majority partner.  
Development projects 
The Energy product group continues to review the optimal growth profile  
for all business units in light of market conditions for coal and uranium, the 
high-cost operating environment in Queensland and New South Wales, and 
infrastructure constraints in Mozambique. The Energy product group’s resource 
base in Australia’s Hunter Valley is unique due to its premium quality coal,  
and proximity to existing infrastructure. The resources based in this region  
are large, adjacent and option-rich orebodies that have the potential to support 
substantial open cut or underground mines for many decades to come and  
are difficult to replicate. With Energy’s ability to operate its New South Wales 
operations as a network, and a range of development options not yet realised, 
there is further potential for these assets to deliver material, long-term value  
to shareholders. 
Work continues to determine the optimum pathway for the potential 
development of the Mount Pleasant project, a greenfield coal site in the Hunter 
Valley. In Queensland, the Energy product group is progressing a pre-feasibility 
study and government approvals to provide options for ongoing open-cut 
operations as well as underground development at Hail Creek Mine. 
Evaluation and exploration of the Ranger 3 Deeps mineral resource in ERA, 
which is estimated to contain over 33,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, progressed 
in 2013. Construction of an exploration decline, to conduct underground  
close-spaced drilling to further define and evaluate the resource, began in May 
2012 and underground drilling commenced a year later. In addition, ERA began 
a pre-feasibility study on the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine in 
July 2012. The study is on schedule and a decision on the viability and design  
of an operational mine is expected by 2015. ERA has also formally commenced 
the statutory approval process for the proposed underground mine with the 
Northern Territory and Commonwealth Governments. 
Outlook 
In the short term, the coal and uranium mining industries are expected to 
continue to suffer from increased costs, and weak commodity prices. The 
medium and long-term outlook, though, is positive. Energy demand continues 
to rise steadily driven by economic growth in emerging markets and further 
urbanisation and industrialisation in China and India. Much of this new demand 
is expected to be met by coal as it is the most secure, affordable, and readily-
available source of energy, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.  
After two decades of remarkable development and transformation, China is  
only now reaching world average levels of electricity and energy consumption. 
Previously a major net exporter of coal, China is now the world’s largest net 
importer of both thermal and coking coal. It is estimated that China will have 
imported over 300 million tonnes of coal in 2013. China will also need to import 
uranium to meet the requirements of its fourth-generation nuclear power 
programme. India, with low per capita electricity consumption and 300 million 
people still without access to electricity, requires substantial investment in 
energy infrastructure to sustain the country’s growth and development. 
Asia remains the dominant market for Australian seaborne coal. Japan,  
South Korea and Taiwan remain important customers for Rio Tinto and growth 
from other South East Asian countries is expected. Coking coal is experiencing 
downward pricing pressure in the current market. However, fundamentals  
for this product remain strong over the long term, due to continued steel 
demand growth in China, India and other emerging Asian economies, as well  
as underlying global resource scarcity of premium coking coal. Rio Tinto’s 
Australian coal, due to its quality, supply reliability and location, is well 
positioned to supply the growth in demand in these Asian countries. Uranium 
production will need to grow in the long term to meet China’s large future 
requirements, but in the medium term the market remains under considerable 
price pressure.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Energy product group aims to sustainably extract full value from its assets 
to serve growing global energy demand. It will achieve this by transforming  
the business to deliver sector-leading performance in all of its large,  
option-rich orebodies.  
The group is focused on: 
Maximising productivity and significantly reducing cost. 
Optimising the portfolio and deriving maximum value from mine to market. 
Embedding innovative and value-adding technology. 
Building trust and partnering to earn the right to operate. 
Safety 
In 2013, the Energy product group’s all injury frequency rate was 0.67 
compared to 0.66 in the previous year. In a challenging year of transformation 
there were no fatalities recorded at any operations. 
In 2013, Kestrel Mine’s strong commitment to health and safety was recognised 
with the mine winning the Chief Executive Safety Award for most improved 
operation. The Kestrel team has consistently improved its safety performance 
over recent years through increasing employee engagement on safety, and 
embedding the leadership commitment to ensure everyone returns home 
safely after every work shift. 
The Energy product group’s safety efforts are focused on: 
Understanding and eliminating critical safety risks.  
Fostering a culture of shared and personal accountability for safety. 
Reducing injuries as well as achieving zero fatalities. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Over the past 15 years, Rio Tinto has spent more than US$100 million on 
research and development into technologies that will reduce emissions from 
coal-fired power plants. This investment has been targeted at ensuring coal 
retains a significant role in the global energy mix in an increasingly carbon-
constrained environment. In 2013, the Energy product group continued its  
A$6 million sponsorship of The Otway Project, Australia’s first industrial-scale 
demonstration of geological carbon dioxide capture and storage.  
The Energy product group’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased to 
approximately 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2013, 
compared with 4.0 million tonnes in 2012. This reduction was mainly due  
to the implementation of a new industry methodology applicable only at  
the Energy product group’s New South Wales sites, which more accurately 
estimates fugitive emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. These gases 
naturally occur in coal seams and are released during the mining process. 
In 2013, Energy’s Australian coal and uranium operations completed energy-
use assessments in accordance with requirements under the Energy Efficiency 
Opportunities Act. More than 40 opportunities were identified relating to fuel 
usage, coal handling and processing, and process control. The opportunities 
identified will now undergo detailed evaluation. 
Review of operations  
The profitability of the uranium and Australian coal industries continues  
to be significantly impacted by lower commodity prices and high input costs. 
However, the long-term fundamentals for the Energy product group remain 
strong. The group has large option-rich assets and a programme of more than 
1,500 cost saving initiatives aimed at transforming the business to ensure it 
remains competitive throughout the cycle. 
In 2013 the Energy product group delivered underlying earnings of  
US$33 million compared with 2012 earnings of US$309 million. The decline  
in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower prices and the absence  
of gains on divestment of exploration properties, which amounted to  
US$258 million in 2012. This was partly offset by a weaker Australian dollar, 
lower operating costs and record production across a number of sites.  
A transformation programme of aggressive cost and productivity improvements 
continued to deliver results during the year, boosting earnings by US$442 
million (US$646 million pre-tax) compared with 2012. An impairment  
charge of US$470 million post-tax was also recognised relating to Rio Tinto  
Coal Mozambique.  
Rio Tinto Coal Australia (Rio Tinto: 100 per cent) 
In Queensland, Rio Tinto Coal Australia (RTCA) manages the Hail Creek  
(Rio Tinto: 82 per cent), Kestrel (80 per cent) and Clermont (50.1 per cent)  
coal mines. 
In New South Wales, RTCA manages Coal & Allied’s coal mines which include 
the Hunter Valley Operations (80 per cent), Bengalla (32 per cent), Mount 
Thorley (64 per cent) and Warkworth (44.5 per cent).  
RTCA is taking action across a wide front to improve the competitiveness  
of its operations during challenging conditions for the Australian coal industry. 
A transformation programme of business improvement initiatives has reduced 
operating costs significantly and increased productivity. Reduced expenditure 
on capital projects and improved management of working capital has further 
contributed to reducing costs. 
Australian coal production increased by eight per cent (Rio Tinto share) in 2013 
compared to 2012, with four mines (Hunter Valley Operations, Mount Thorley 
Warkworth, Bengalla and Clermont) achieving annual records. This substantial 
production increase was delivered through operational improvements, the 
completion of brownfield mine developments and the ramp-up of Clermont 
Mine. Net earnings of US$367 million represent a nine per cent decrease from 
2012, due to significantly lower prices for all types of coal. 
On 15 October 2013, the US$2 billion Kestrel Mine Extension in central 
Queensland was officially opened. The extension is expected to add 20 years  
to the life of the mine. Also in October, a binding agreement was signed to sell 
Clermont Mine for just over US$1 billion and a conditional sale and purchase 
agreement for Blair Athol Mine was reached.  
RTCA is working to secure a long-term future for the Mount Thorley Warkworth 
mine, following the NSW Land and Environment Court’s decision to overturn 
government planning approvals. Rio Tinto has also appealed against the Court’s 
decision, with support from the NSW Government. In early 2014, a short-term 
planning approval was granted that will enable the mine to resume normal 
operations for around two years.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  
30 operational AHS trucks driving 2.4 million kilometres and moving more  
than 130 million tonnes of material at three mine sites – West Angelas, 
Yandicoogina and Nammuldi. 
Hope Downs 4, Iron Ore’s newest mine site, successfully and safely delivered  
its one millionth tonne of ore in the third quarter − an important milestone 
leading to the ramp-up of mining operations in 2014. 
Iron Ore’s automated train programme, AutoHaul™, made progress during  
the year with the upgrade of numerous level crossings, hardware and software 
development of the system. The Iron Ore group purchased 1,100 ore cars and 
commissioned ten new fully-fitted locomotives in 2013. Ore cars and existing 
locomotives were also fitted with Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) 
brakes, which has resulted in a decrease in train cycle times. 
Iron Ore progressed key participation agreements with Traditional Owners  
in the Pilbara, allowing the group to secure land access for the life of mining 
operations. New agreements with the Yinhawangka and Yindjibarndi people 
were finalised during the year. Aligned with previous agreements, these 
recognise a strong commitment to regional standards, and incorporate  
mutual obligations to deliver outcomes relating to employment, financial 
compensation, education and training, heritage surveys and practices, 
environmental care and land use. 
In 2013, the group continued to be one of the largest private employers of 
Indigenous people in Western Australia employing over 1,700 employees and 
contractors. Over A$1.8 billion in contracts for Pilbara expansion were awarded 
to Aboriginal businesses both individually and through joint ventures between 
January 2010 and end of 2013. Rio Tinto Iron Ore continues to be an industry 
leader in regional FIFO programmes across Australia, with eight regional  
FIFO centres in Western Australia alone. A three-year memorandum of 
understanding was signed with the Shire of Broome in 2013 and a new regional 
office was opened in Busselton. Community initiatives stemming from the 
programme focused on education, skills development and support for regional 
families, including workshops and online support resources. 
The Wickham town expansion continued to support the growing Cape Lambert 
rail and port operations workforce. Developments in 2013 included the opening 
of Cajuput Village, a 155 room FIFO accommodation and community facility, 
and the completion of phase one of the Wickham South sub-division, 
comprising of 212 new residential homes. The Wickham project also delivered 
upgrades to town services and local park redevelopments to accompany the 
recreational precinct finalised in 2012. 
In 2013, Rio Tinto Marine shipped 191 million tonnes of dry bulk cargo, an 
increase of 7.7 per cent on 2012. The final vessel in the current new build 
programme was delivered during December and completed the suite of eight 
new vessels for the year. Average freight rates rose year-on-year in 2013 and 
forward markets suggest stronger freight market conditions in the future, given 
slower growth in the industry’s fleet and increased cargo tonnages of bulk 
commodities entering the market from mine expansions.  
IOC (Rio Tinto share 58.7 per cent) made good progress in 2013. The company 
capitalised on the benefits derived from commissioning the first stage of the 
Concentrate Expansion Project (CEP1), and produced 8.6 million tonnes of 
pellets and 6.8 million tonnes of concentrate for sale, which is an annual 
production record for concentrate. Despite severe weather disruptions, the final 
commissioning of CEP1 during the first half of the year provided the capacity  
to deliver a step change in production performance, efficiency gains and overall 
operational improvement. 
Development projects 
The Iron Ore group reached a major milestone in the second half of 2013,  
with the commissioning of the 290Mt/a port and rail capacity expansion.  
With this achievement, Iron Ore has delivered the first phase of the major 
expansion of its integrated iron ore operations in the Pilbara. 
The successful commissioning of this expansion at a capital intensity of less 
than US$140 per tonne (100 per cent) added an extra annual capacity of  
70 million tonnes to the 220Mt/a Pilbara nameplate capacity. The port and  
rail project was constructed four months ahead of the original schedule, and 
delivered US$400 million below the approved budget. In addition to the new 
port, all major coastal and rail infrastructure for the 290Mt/a capacity is now 
constructed and includes: 
– installation of a new 55Mt/a ship loader at Cape Lambert; 
– commissioning of the new car dumper 5 at Cape Lambert and associated 
stockyards; and 
– construction of new fuel distribution facilities at Cape Lambert (tug fuel 
facility), the 10KP rail yard and the West Angelas fuel hub. 
Development of mining operations at Hope Downs 4, Marandoo and Western 
Turner Syncline (stage 1), which includes an overland conveyor to the  
Tom Price processing plant, are currently in the commissioning and ramp-up 
phase. Construction of the Nammuldi Below Water Table Project continues on 
schedule for commissioning later this year, and the West Angelas Power Station 
is currently in commissioning. 
While completing the 290Mt/a port and rail expansion, the group made 
significant progress with the infrastructure to support further expansion  
towards 360Mt/a capacity. All marine piling activity for 360Mt/a was completed 
at the start of the third quarter. Two major structural, mechanical and piping 
packages, valued at approximately US$390 million, were awarded for the same 
project during August. 
In December 2013, the US$310 million Bungaroo water facility and associated 
87 kilometre pipeline was commissioned, providing water for Pilbara coastal 
operations and domestic requirements in the towns of Dampier and Wickham. 
In November, the business unveiled a breakthrough pathway to match the 
upgraded port and rail capacity, which will see mine production capacity 
increase towards 360Mt/a through a series of low-cost brownfield expansions  
at a targeted all-in capital intensity of US$120-130 per tonne. Combined with  
low-cost productivity gains, the expansion is now forecast to be delivered at 
US$3 billion below previous expectations. 
In conjunction with the announcement, US$400 million of capital expenditure 
was approved for plant equipment and modification, and additional heavy 
machinery for use at various mine sites in the Pilbara. This will enable a 
targeted production of more than 330Mt/a in 2015 and support the expected 
delivery of over 350Mt/a in 2017. Iron Ore’s Pilbara expansion programme 
remains the largest integrated mining project in Australian history and has  
a proven record of delivering project stages on time and budget. 
The ramp-up of CEP stage two at IOC in the second half of the year delivered  
an additional 700,000 tonnes of spiral capacity, allowing the operation  
to increase volumes of Concentrate For Sinter (CFS) processed by gravity 
separation. The project remains on track to commission an additional ball  
mill and mining equipment, and to make upgrades to power distribution 
infrastructure during the second quarter of 2014. 
Outlook 
In line with the overall global economic outlook, the long-term fundamentals 
for iron ore remain sound, with demand growth tightly linked to rapid 
urbanisation and rising incomes in China and the developing world. However, 
iron ore prices are expected to moderate over the coming years as growth  
in low-cost seaborne supply outpaces growth in demand. Seaborne suppliers 
are estimated to have added more than 100Mt/a of iron ore supply capacity  
in 2013, and exports are expected to continue gaining momentum in the short 
to medium term. The majority of seaborne supply growth is expected to go  
into China, and supply-side exits from Chinese domestic suppliers and some  
high-cost seaborne suppliers are likely. With its low-cost position and proximity 
to China, Rio Tinto is well placed to take advantage of demand growth for 
seaborne iron ore through its expansions.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Iron Ore product group’s strategy is based around three strategic pillars: 
Producing at the right cost, through the utilisation of unrivalled technology 
and high-performing teams. 
Focusing on value-driven growth through disciplined phasing and low-cost 
growth options. 
Maximising portfolio value by leveraging growth options, product strategy, 
and sales and supply chain capabilities. 
Safety 
Iron Ore’s safety performance improved in 2013, attaining an all injury 
frequency rate of 0.70, compared to 0.74 in 2012. The group achieved  
this improved level of performance despite facing the safety challenges  
of commissioning the 290 million tonne per annum (Mt/a) expansion in  
the Pilbara, and preparation for, and recovery from, four tropical cyclones.  
All of these challenges were accomplished without a fatality or serious injury.  
The group did experience an increase in significant potential incidents in 2013, 
particularly those involving light vehicles. There was also a trend of more severe 
injuries leading to an increase in lost time at work. This led to the introduction 
of programmes to address the root causes of such incidents, covering 
management systems, procedures and training. 
Throughout 2013, Iron Ore continued to embed a number of safety 
improvement programmes and initiatives with a particular emphasis on critical 
risk management, safety leadership, training and hazard awareness, and on 
simplifying the way safety is managed and achieved within the organisation. 
Initiatives designed to recognise and reward a positive safety culture were  
also a feature of the group’s safety commitment for 2013, with more than  
1,500 employee-led safety improvements recognised and shared through the 
Make a Difference programme. New safety interaction training and a pre-start 
safety pilot project were also introduced. The Lifesaving Commitments hazard 
awareness programme, which began in 2012, continued roll-out in 2013. 
Iron Ore maintained a major focus on health issues, particularly emerging 
issues impacting on the mental health of employees. A number of programmes 
providing support for mental health and depression, rail safety education, and 
fly-in fly-out (FIFO) support networks for workers and their families were 
implemented and developed further throughout the year. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Iron Ore implemented a number of measures during the year to ensure full 
compliance with its environmental performance obligations. In accordance  
with the Australian Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006, the group 
conducted energy assessments across 15 operations in the Pilbara region  
of Western Australia. 
More than 80 efficiency opportunities were identified, which have the potential 
to reduce energy consumption of the entire Pilbara operations by ten per cent. 
This includes energy-intensive areas such as rail and utilities and at larger 
mining operations in the east Pilbara. 
The decommissioning of the existing Cape Lambert power station − to make 
way for a new combined-cycle power station − led to improvement in the 
efficiency of Rio Tinto’s power generation network. Energy efficiency continued 
to be a focus for future mine expansions, with energy reviews being conducted 
at the project design stage. Modifications to mine planning and fixed plant will 
deliver significant savings when these projects move into the operational phase. 
For instance, the electric motor replacement programme that began in 2012  
is now replacing failed motors with more energy-efficient alternatives. 
Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) operations delivered and contributed 
significantly to the group’s reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
intensity in 2013, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of saleable 
product produced as concentrate versus pellets. Concentrate is the less  
GHG-intensive form of IOC’s product. 
Iron Ore met all Australian Federal Government requirements for the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme, Clean Energy Act and Energy 
Efficiency Opportunities Act in 2013. Since 2008, the group’s total greenhouse 
gas emissions intensity has improved by 7.4 per cent. 
Review of operations  
Rio Tinto is the second largest supplier to the world’s seaborne iron ore trade. 
Operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia comprise 15 mines,  
four ports, the largest privately-owned heavy freight railway in Australia, and 
supporting infrastructure including the Operations Centre in Perth. IOC operates 
a mine, concentrator and pelletising plant in the province of Newfoundland  
and Labrador, together with port facilities in Sept-Îles, Quebec. Rio Tinto Marine 
delivers shipping services to the Group, including Iron Ore. 
In 2013 the Iron Ore business achieved underlying earnings of US$9,858 
million, seven per cent higher than 2012, attributable to record sales volumes  
in the Pilbara, a weaker Australian dollar, marginally higher prices, and cost 
savings initiatives which enhanced earnings by US$240 million (US$351 million  
pre-tax). This was partly offset by a royalty claim and higher taxes following  
the introduction of Mineral Resources Rent Tax in July 2012. The five per cent 
decline in capital expenditure reflects the early completion of the port and rail 
element of the 290Mt/a Pilbara expansion in August 2013. 
The Iron Ore group’s production levels exceeded previous records in 2013, 
despite volatile weather and a fast-tracked expansion schedule, to produce  
266 million tonnes of iron ore globally. Rio Tinto’s share of production was 
209 million tonnes, an increase of five per cent on 2012. 
Iron ore prices were marginally higher in 2013, predominantly due to strong 
demand in China. According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the 
country’s apparent consumption of finished steel rose by 7.2 per cent in 2013  
to 692 million tonnes. This reflected strong construction activity supported by 
favourable credit conditions in the first half of the year. Iron Ore’s total global 
shipments in 2013 were 259 million tonnes. 
Quarter-on-quarter production records were achieved, despite interruptions 
caused by conveyor belt breakage, cyclone activity and significant flooding  
in the Pilbara following unseasonal weather in the second quarter of 2013. 
Heavy tropical cyclone activity closed the ports in January and December 2013, 
the latter impacting the first weeks of January 2014 and causing the closure of 
all coastal operations and all inland mine sites. Throughout these events, the 
Operations Centre in Perth was fundamental to ensuring optimal supply chain 
performance, including minimising any impacts to production. 
The challenge of operating in remote locations remained in 2013 and Iron Ore 
will continue to manage this closely in 2014. During the year, the group ran 
improvement initiatives that focused heavily on reducing costs and driving 
productivity gains. This included reducing the use of contractors, reviewing  
the supplier base, challenging the tactics used for equipment maintenance,  
and optimising support functions. 
The integration of next-generation technology via the Mine of the Future™ 
programme improved efficiencies further in 2013, across production, health, 
safety and environmental performance. For example, the autonomous haulage 
system (AHS) has delivered significant improvements in truck cycle times  
and real-time data generation, has extended tyre life, and reduced fuel usage  
and maintenance costs. This has been reported through the fleet of  
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013
34  
30 operational AHS trucks driving 2.4 million kilometres and moving more  
than 130 million tonnes of material at three mine sites – West Angelas, 
Yandicoogina and Nammuldi. 
Hope Downs 4, Iron Ore’s newest mine site, successfully and safely delivered  
its one millionth tonne of ore in the third quarter − an important milestone 
leading to the ramp-up of mining operations in 2014. 
Iron Ore’s automated train programme, AutoHaul™, made progress during  
the year with the upgrade of numerous level crossings, hardware and software 
development of the system. The Iron Ore group purchased 1,100 ore cars and 
commissioned ten new fully-fitted locomotives in 2013. Ore cars and existing 
locomotives were also fitted with Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) 
brakes, which has resulted in a decrease in train cycle times. 
Iron Ore progressed key participation agreements with Traditional Owners  
in the Pilbara, allowing the group to secure land access for the life of mining 
operations. New agreements with the Yinhawangka and Yindjibarndi people 
were finalised during the year. Aligned with previous agreements, these 
recognise a strong commitment to regional standards, and incorporate  
mutual obligations to deliver outcomes relating to employment, financial 
compensation, education and training, heritage surveys and practices, 
environmental care and land use. 
In 2013, the group continued to be one of the largest private employers of 
Indigenous people in Western Australia employing over 1,700 employees and 
contractors. Over A$1.8 billion in contracts for Pilbara expansion were awarded 
to Aboriginal businesses both individually and through joint ventures between 
January 2010 and end of 2013. Rio Tinto Iron Ore continues to be an industry 
leader in regional FIFO programmes across Australia, with eight regional  
FIFO centres in Western Australia alone. A three-year memorandum of 
understanding was signed with the Shire of Broome in 2013 and a new regional 
office was opened in Busselton. Community initiatives stemming from the 
programme focused on education, skills development and support for regional 
families, including workshops and online support resources. 
The Wickham town expansion continued to support the growing Cape Lambert 
rail and port operations workforce. Developments in 2013 included the opening 
of Cajuput Village, a 155 room FIFO accommodation and community facility, 
and the completion of phase one of the Wickham South sub-division, 
comprising of 212 new residential homes. The Wickham project also delivered 
upgrades to town services and local park redevelopments to accompany the 
recreational precinct finalised in 2012. 
In 2013, Rio Tinto Marine shipped 191 million tonnes of dry bulk cargo, an 
increase of 7.7 per cent on 2012. The final vessel in the current new build 
programme was delivered during December and completed the suite of eight 
new vessels for the year. Average freight rates rose year-on-year in 2013 and 
forward markets suggest stronger freight market conditions in the future, given 
slower growth in the industry’s fleet and increased cargo tonnages of bulk 
commodities entering the market from mine expansions.  
IOC (Rio Tinto share 58.7 per cent) made good progress in 2013. The company 
capitalised on the benefits derived from commissioning the first stage of the 
Concentrate Expansion Project (CEP1), and produced 8.6 million tonnes of 
pellets and 6.8 million tonnes of concentrate for sale, which is an annual 
production record for concentrate. Despite severe weather disruptions, the final 
commissioning of CEP1 during the first half of the year provided the capacity  
to deliver a step change in production performance, efficiency gains and overall 
operational improvement. 
Development projects 
The Iron Ore group reached a major milestone in the second half of 2013,  
with the commissioning of the 290Mt/a port and rail capacity expansion.  
With this achievement, Iron Ore has delivered the first phase of the major 
expansion of its integrated iron ore operations in the Pilbara. 
The successful commissioning of this expansion at a capital intensity of less 
than US$140 per tonne (100 per cent) added an extra annual capacity of  
70 million tonnes to the 220Mt/a Pilbara nameplate capacity. The port and  
rail project was constructed four months ahead of the original schedule, and 
delivered US$400 million below the approved budget. In addition to the new 
port, all major coastal and rail infrastructure for the 290Mt/a capacity is now 
constructed and includes: 
– installation of a new 55Mt/a ship loader at Cape Lambert; 
– commissioning of the new car dumper 5 at Cape Lambert and associated 
stockyards; and 
– construction of new fuel distribution facilities at Cape Lambert (tug fuel 
facility), the 10KP rail yard and the West Angelas fuel hub. 
Development of mining operations at Hope Downs 4, Marandoo and Western 
Turner Syncline (stage 1), which includes an overland conveyor to the  
Tom Price processing plant, are currently in the commissioning and ramp-up 
phase. Construction of the Nammuldi Below Water Table Project continues on 
schedule for commissioning later this year, and the West Angelas Power Station 
is currently in commissioning. 
While completing the 290Mt/a port and rail expansion, the group made 
significant progress with the infrastructure to support further expansion  
towards 360Mt/a capacity. All marine piling activity for 360Mt/a was completed 
at the start of the third quarter. Two major structural, mechanical and piping 
packages, valued at approximately US$390 million, were awarded for the same 
project during August. 
In December 2013, the US$310 million Bungaroo water facility and associated 
87 kilometre pipeline was commissioned, providing water for Pilbara coastal 
operations and domestic requirements in the towns of Dampier and Wickham. 
In November, the business unveiled a breakthrough pathway to match the 
upgraded port and rail capacity, which will see mine production capacity 
increase towards 360Mt/a through a series of low-cost brownfield expansions  
at a targeted all-in capital intensity of US$120-130 per tonne. Combined with  
low-cost productivity gains, the expansion is now forecast to be delivered at 
US$3 billion below previous expectations. 
In conjunction with the announcement, US$400 million of capital expenditure 
was approved for plant equipment and modification, and additional heavy 
machinery for use at various mine sites in the Pilbara. This will enable a 
targeted production of more than 330Mt/a in 2015 and support the expected 
delivery of over 350Mt/a in 2017. Iron Ore’s Pilbara expansion programme 
remains the largest integrated mining project in Australian history and has  
a proven record of delivering project stages on time and budget. 
The ramp-up of CEP stage two at IOC in the second half of the year delivered  
an additional 700,000 tonnes of spiral capacity, allowing the operation  
to increase volumes of Concentrate For Sinter (CFS) processed by gravity 
separation. The project remains on track to commission an additional ball  
mill and mining equipment, and to make upgrades to power distribution 
infrastructure during the second quarter of 2014. 
Outlook 
In line with the overall global economic outlook, the long-term fundamentals 
for iron ore remain sound, with demand growth tightly linked to rapid 
urbanisation and rising incomes in China and the developing world. However, 
iron ore prices are expected to moderate over the coming years as growth  
in low-cost seaborne supply outpaces growth in demand. Seaborne suppliers 
are estimated to have added more than 100Mt/a of iron ore supply capacity  
in 2013, and exports are expected to continue gaining momentum in the short 
to medium term. The majority of seaborne supply growth is expected to go  
into China, and supply-side exits from Chinese domestic suppliers and some  
high-cost seaborne suppliers are likely. With its low-cost position and proximity 
to China, Rio Tinto is well placed to take advantage of demand growth for 
seaborne iron ore through its expansions.

Strategy and strategic priorities 
The Iron Ore product group’s strategy is based around three strategic pillars: 
Producing at the right cost, through the utilisation of unrivalled technology 
and high-performing teams. 
Focusing on value-driven growth through disciplined phasing and low-cost 
growth options. 
Maximising portfolio value by leveraging growth options, product strategy, 
and sales and supply chain capabilities. 
Safety 
Iron Ore’s safety performance improved in 2013, attaining an all injury 
frequency rate of 0.70, compared to 0.74 in 2012. The group achieved  
this improved level of performance despite facing the safety challenges  
of commissioning the 290 million tonne per annum (Mt/a) expansion in  
the Pilbara, and preparation for, and recovery from, four tropical cyclones.  
All of these challenges were accomplished without a fatality or serious injury.  
The group did experience an increase in significant potential incidents in 2013, 
particularly those involving light vehicles. There was also a trend of more severe 
injuries leading to an increase in lost time at work. This led to the introduction 
of programmes to address the root causes of such incidents, covering 
management systems, procedures and training. 
Throughout 2013, Iron Ore continued to embed a number of safety 
improvement programmes and initiatives with a particular emphasis on critical 
risk management, safety leadership, training and hazard awareness, and on 
simplifying the way safety is managed and achieved within the organisation. 
Initiatives designed to recognise and reward a positive safety culture were  
also a feature of the group’s safety commitment for 2013, with more than  
1,500 employee-led safety improvements recognised and shared through the 
Make a Difference programme. New safety interaction training and a pre-start 
safety pilot project were also introduced. The Lifesaving Commitments hazard 
awareness programme, which began in 2012, continued roll-out in 2013. 
Iron Ore maintained a major focus on health issues, particularly emerging 
issues impacting on the mental health of employees. A number of programmes 
providing support for mental health and depression, rail safety education, and 
fly-in fly-out (FIFO) support networks for workers and their families were 
implemented and developed further throughout the year. 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Iron Ore implemented a number of measures during the year to ensure full 
compliance with its environmental performance obligations. In accordance  
with the Australian Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006, the group 
conducted energy assessments across 15 operations in the Pilbara region  
of Western Australia. 
More than 80 efficiency opportunities were identified, which have the potential 
to reduce energy consumption of the entire Pilbara operations by ten per cent. 
This includes energy-intensive areas such as rail and utilities and at larger 
mining operations in the east Pilbara. 
The decommissioning of the existing Cape Lambert power station − to make 
way for a new combined-cycle power station − led to improvement in the 
efficiency of Rio Tinto’s power generation network. Energy efficiency continued 
to be a focus for future mine expansions, with energy reviews being conducted 
at the project design stage. Modifications to mine planning and fixed plant will 
deliver significant savings when these projects move into the operational phase. 
For instance, the electric motor replacement programme that began in 2012  
is now replacing failed motors with more energy-efficient alternatives. 
Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) operations delivered and contributed 
significantly to the group’s reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
intensity in 2013, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of saleable 
product produced as concentrate versus pellets. Concentrate is the less  
GHG-intensive form of IOC’s product. 
Iron Ore met all Australian Federal Government requirements for the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme, Clean Energy Act and Energy 
Efficiency Opportunities Act in 2013. Since 2008, the group’s total greenhouse 
gas emissions intensity has improved by 7.4 per cent. 
Review of operations  
Rio Tinto is the second largest supplier to the world’s seaborne iron ore trade. 
Operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia comprise 15 mines,  
four ports, the largest privately-owned heavy freight railway in Australia, and 
supporting infrastructure including the Operations Centre in Perth. IOC operates 
a mine, concentrator and pelletising plant in the province of Newfoundland  
and Labrador, together with port facilities in Sept-Îles, Quebec. Rio Tinto Marine 
delivers shipping services to the Group, including Iron Ore. 
In 2013 the Iron Ore business achieved underlying earnings of US$9,858 
million, seven per cent higher than 2012, attributable to record sales volumes  
in the Pilbara, a weaker Australian dollar, marginally higher prices, and cost 
savings initiatives which enhanced earnings by US$240 million (US$351 million  
pre-tax). This was partly offset by a royalty claim and higher taxes following  
the introduction of Mineral Resources Rent Tax in July 2012. The five per cent 
decline in capital expenditure reflects the early completion of the port and rail 
element of the 290Mt/a Pilbara expansion in August 2013. 
The Iron Ore group’s production levels exceeded previous records in 2013, 
despite volatile weather and a fast-tracked expansion schedule, to produce  
266 million tonnes of iron ore globally. Rio Tinto’s share of production was 
209 million tonnes, an increase of five per cent on 2012. 
Iron ore prices were marginally higher in 2013, predominantly due to strong 
demand in China. According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the 
country’s apparent consumption of finished steel rose by 7.2 per cent in 2013  
to 692 million tonnes. This reflected strong construction activity supported by 
favourable credit conditions in the first half of the year. Iron Ore’s total global 
shipments in 2013 were 259 million tonnes. 
Quarter-on-quarter production records were achieved, despite interruptions 
caused by conveyor belt breakage, cyclone activity and significant flooding  
in the Pilbara following unseasonal weather in the second quarter of 2013. 
Heavy tropical cyclone activity closed the ports in January and December 2013, 
the latter impacting the first weeks of January 2014 and causing the closure of 
all coastal operations and all inland mine sites. Throughout these events, the 
Operations Centre in Perth was fundamental to ensuring optimal supply chain 
performance, including minimising any impacts to production. 
The challenge of operating in remote locations remained in 2013 and Iron Ore 
will continue to manage this closely in 2014. During the year, the group ran 
improvement initiatives that focused heavily on reducing costs and driving 
productivity gains. This included reducing the use of contractors, reviewing  
the supplier base, challenging the tactics used for equipment maintenance,  
and optimising support functions. 
The integration of next-generation technology via the Mine of the Future™ 
programme improved efficiencies further in 2013, across production, health, 
safety and environmental performance. For example, the autonomous haulage 
system (AHS) has delivered significant improvements in truck cycle times  
and real-time data generation, has extended tyre life, and reduced fuel usage  
and maintenance costs. This has been reported through the fleet of

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Rio Tinto’s Technology & Innovation group (T&I) collectively seeks to maximise 
total shareholder returns by partnering with, supporting, and constructively 
challenging product groups and functions in productivity improvement, 
technical assurance, project delivery, and innovation. T&I focuses on creating 
sustainable value and competitive advantage by making improvements to  
the way Rio Tinto operates. T&I also provides technical insights and support  
to review and mitigate critical risk factors across Rio Tinto. 
T&I’s gross costs in 2013 were US$370 million, compared with US$415 million 
in 2012 and US$343 million in 2011. 2013 costs decreased compared with  
2012 due to reductions in headcount, innovation spend and travel. 
The total number of employees in T&I decreased from 1,031 at year-end  
2012 to 730 at year-end 2013.  
Strategy and strategic priorities  
T&I is focused on four strategic pillars of work to support the broader Rio Tinto 
Group: Productivity Improvement, Innovation, Technical Assurance and Project 
Development and Implementation. Each of these four pillars is underpinned  
by a centralised team of industry experts and professionals, leveraging their 
collective technical capability across Rio Tinto’s businesses to deliver enhanced 
value for shareholders.  
Safety  
T&I is committed to the safe operation of its facilities and to the safe 
deployment of its personnel. The all injury frequency rate for T&I in 2013  
was 0.63 compared to 1.57 in 2012. The improvement of this measure was 
primarily attributed to a tighter focus on existing safety efforts, particularly 
across Rio Tinto’s capital projects.  
Performance 
Innovation  
Innovation is the research and development group within T&I. Its focus is  
on developing step-change technologies, including the Mine of the Future
TM
 
programme, which addresses the significant challenges facing the  
mining industry. In 2013, Innovation continued to support the Iron Ore product 
group in its drive to capture safety and productivity benefits, by way of ongoing 
deployment of what will be amongst the world’s largest fleet of autonomous 
haulage vehicles, in its Pilbara mining operations. The Rio Tinto Mine 
Automation System and advanced visualisation technology were deployed  
to selected Group operations with further deployments scheduled. 
Encouraging progress continues in the area of advanced mineral recovery. 
Innovation’s copper recovery technology, Peak Air Recovery, progressed 
through initial trials and is now undergoing final trials prior to commercial 
deployment. Building upon experience gained from the Iron Ore Operations 
Centre in Perth, Australia, a new range of systems for remote production 
process monitoring and optimisation have been commissioned. This next 
generation “Excellence Centre” (EC) technology platform allows for near  
real-time monitoring and optimisation of remote operating facilities. It utilises 
advanced data management, integrated with human systems. The EC provides 
Rio Tinto with the capability for continuous global coverage of managed 
business unit production facilities. The first processing EC was successfully 
operated throughout 2013, delivering technical support and measurable value 
to operating business units. Connections to remote copper concentrators  
and, most recently, coal washing facilities have been successfully established. 
The EC platform will be further deployed across the Group and will encompass 
the next generation of advanced remote technical support to operations. 
Innovation uses a network of partnerships with organisations and institutions 
around the world, which provides a vast and interconnected group of world-
class experts to generate solutions. The University of Nottingham, UK was 
added to this network in 2013, with the Rio Tinto Centre for Emergent 
Technologies inaugurated on 3 December. Also in 2013, Rio Tinto and  
Chinalco agreed to explore a partnership to bring forward the next era of  
mining technology aimed at delivering significant value and re-shaping  
industry best practice.  
Productivity Improvement  
With the organisational focus on improving productivity across Rio Tinto, the 
Mineral Technology Services and the Mining and Asset Management Centre 
were combined to form Productivity Improvement. The focus of this team is to 
help the business identify and implement significant productivity improvements 
by aligning performance with clear productivity metrics; improving productivity 
diagnostics; establishing internal and external benchmarking; and by 
constructively challenging and testing proposed plans for productivity 
improvements. This team also provides technical insights into risk mitigation, 
with expertise in the areas of geology, geotechnics, mining, mineral processing, 
dams and tailings, process control and hydrogeology.  
T&I also includes a Strategic Production Planning (SPP) team that works  
with business units to develop comprehensive plans and valuations of strategic 
development options. Results from SPP provide a logical resource development 
framework for detailed studies and investment decision-making. 
Project Development & Implementation  
During 2013, Project Development & Implementation (PDI) reshaped its 
operating structure to align with the completion of existing capital projects, the 
general streamlining of organisational hierarchies, and the reduction in capital 
spending across Rio Tinto over the next few years. Under the revised structure, 
Rio Tinto is committed to an independent project management office (PMO) 
and two regionally-based Project Delivery Hubs, one for Australasia and the 
other for the Americas & Africa. 
In line with Rio Tinto’s commitment to pursue greater value for shareholders, 
PDI is now delivering capital projects within a recently-developed Capital 
Projects framework. The framework provides Rio Tinto with a disciplined 
approach to managing its projects, and provides processes and tools, 
governance, reporting, and assurance to those who are responsible for capital.  
Throughout this past year of change, PDI remained focused on the safe 
transition and handover of US$7 billion of capital projects, including: Kestrel 
Mine Extension, Argyle Underground Project, Energy Resources of Australia’s 
brine concentrator, Port Waratah Kooragang, Kemano Power Stage 1, and the 
AP60 aluminium smelter.  
Technical Assurance  
Technical Assurance is a team of internal professionals responsible for 
rigorously reviewing all major project proposals. Their role is to ensure that  
Rio Tinto’s Investment Committee and board are provided with independent 
technical assessments to support their decision-making. Throughout 2013, 
Technical Assurance focused its attention on strengthening the Group’s due 
diligence and Investment Committee processes. Technical Assurance also 
provides support to the business for a range of other technical compliance  
and governance activities such as post-investment reviews, due diligence, 
management of the Group’s reserves and resources, and general  
technical reviews.  
Outlook  
T&I will continue to add value to the Group by working with the business  
units on productivity improvements. In addition, T&I will look for alternative 
approaches for funding of Innovation projects to react to changes in the  
Group’s cash position and capital spend constraints. Despite these changes  
and challenges, T&I will continue to maintain a culture that places a high 
priority on safety and safety improvement. In 2014, T&I will focus on four  
main areas: partnering with product groups and functions on productivity 
improvement; the safe and efficient development and implementation of capital 
projects; the pursuit of the Mine of the Future™ programme as well as the 
development of innovative alliances and relationships; and technical assurance. 
All of these will create competitive advantage for the Group. This will position 
T&I to support the business where commercial and technical expertise and 
external networks will have the largest benefit to Rio Tinto and its shareholders. 
Exploration 
36 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Rio Tinto has had a sustained commitment to exploration since 1946 and  
an exceptional track record in mineral discovery success. Mature operations, 
such as Weipa, the Pilbara and Rössing, were Tier 1 greenfield discoveries  
by Rio Tinto where value is still being realised after more than 40 years of 
production. In March 2013, restructuring resulted in the Exploration group 
reporting to the chief financial officer.  
Strategy 
The goal of Exploration is to create value for Rio Tinto through discovery  
or acquisition of Tier 1 resources that are well located and high grade, to 
supplement the Group’s existing high-quality resource base. The Exploration 
group performs both greenfield and brownfield exploration programmes and 
undertakes focused research and development to aid the exploration effort. 
Greenfield exploration aims to establish completely new operating business 
units, involving, among other objectives, geographic or commodity 
diversification. Brownfield exploration is directed at sustaining or growing 
existing Group businesses in the orbit of existing operations and provides 
significant value to the product groups.  
Additionally, Exploration supports the product groups with orebody knowledge 
expertise, and supports the business development groups in evaluating merger 
and acquisition opportunities. It also supports the Economics team with supply 
forecasts. To pass community, sustainability and investment hurdles, the 
exploration process can take ten to 20 years to progress from target generation 
to development decisions. Enhancing and reaffirming the core exploration 
strategy, linked to the application of a rigorous global prioritisation process,  
has accelerated in Tier 1 discoveries since 2000. Tier 1 discoveries over the  
past decade are: 
Year Discovery Commodity  Location 
2004 Simandou  Iron ore Guinea 
2005 La Granja Copper Peru 
2005 Caliwingina  Iron ore Australia 
2008 Sulawesi Nickel Indonesia 
2008 Mutamba  Titanium Mozambique 
2009 Jadar Lithium/borates Serbia 
2011 Amargosa Bauxite Brazil 
2013 KP405 Potash Canada 
 
At the end of 2013, the Exploration group was active in 20 countries, and 
assessing opportunities in others, for a range of commodities including iron ore, 
copper, bauxite, coking coal, nickel, potash, uranium, diamonds and mineral 
sands. Exploration activities in China were conducted through CRTX, the joint 
venture between Chinalco (51 per cent) and Rio Tinto (49 per cent). Diamond 
exploration was transitioned from the Diamonds & Minerals group back to 
Exploration during 2013, and features an active project in India. 
The Exploration group is organised into regional multi-commodity teams, 
headquartered in Singapore, London, Salt Lake City, Brisbane and Beijing,  
and supported by a team of technical and commodity professionals. This 
structure provides a global reach and a local presence that allows for effective 
community engagement and development of the Group’s social licence  
to operate. 
Safety 
The Exploration group’s all injury frequency rate improved significantly  
from 1.41 at the end of 2012 to 0.49 at the end of 2013. The improvement, 
across all regions, coincided with the Exploration group implementing the 
Improving Project Performance initiative. This also produced results in 
operational performance. 
Performance 
The Order of Magnitude study was completed on the Saskatchewan potash 
project in Canada (a joint venture with North Atlantic Potash Inc., a subsidiary  
of JS Acron) in early 2013, and the project handed over to Rio Tinto Minerals.  
A drilling programme at the Tamarack project in Minnesota, US has continued  
to further extend the nickel-copper-precious metal resource. Additional  
drilling is planned in 2014 to follow up extensions to the known mineralisation. 
Drilling at the Roughrider uranium project in Saskatchewan has increased the 
understanding of the resources and indicated further extensions to the known 
mineralisation. Regional exploration across Rio Tinto’s Saskatchewan tenure 
has generated numerous targets for follow-up drilling in 2014. In Laos, orebody 
knowledge at the Sanxai bauxite project advanced through auger drilling  
across the prospective areas. The Amargosa bauxite project in Brazil has also 
progressed through an Order of Magnitude study with drilling and mapping 
advancing a number of brownfield areas in the Amargosa orbit. 
Brownfield projects generated good drilling results at the Yandi Braid and 
Munjina iron ore projects in the Pilbara and coking coal projects at Winchester 
South, Mt Robert, Hillalong and Valeria in the Bowen Basin, Australia. Drilling 
out of the Z20 uranium resource on the Rössing mine lease in Namibia was 
completed and the project handed over to the Energy product group. 
Effective data and information management lies at the heart of the Exploration 
group. Significant efficiency improvements have been achieved by organising 
data in structured, managed systems accessible via intuitive user interfaces. 
Progress continued on the development of the VK1 airborne gravity 
gradiometer, with further test flying undertaken in 2013. In addition to 
Exploration’s projects, the Group’s major evaluation projects in 2013 were:  
Project Commodity Country  
La Granja Copper Peru 
Resolution Copper US 
Pilbara Iron ore Australia 
Bowen Basin Coking coal Australia 
Simandou Iron ore Guinea 
 
In 2013, the Group reduced its exploration and evaluation expenditure to 
US$948 million, exceeding the reduction target of US$750 million by more than 
a third. This represented a 52 per cent decrease compared to 2012 expenditure 
of US$1,971 million. In addition to gross expenditure, the Group wrote down 
US$159 million of exploration assets. Of the 2013 spend, US$178 million  
relates to global Exploration group activity. In total, Rio Tinto’s exploration  
and evaluation activity covered ten commodities in 2013, across a range  
of greenfield and brownfield environments. 
Outlook 
The Exploration group will continue to work on a prioritised portfolio of 
greenfield and brownfield projects in 2014. Maintaining a robust exploration 
pipeline by identifying and securing access to the best quality opportunities  
will be a key enabler of long-term success. Continuing challenges are expected 
to include the decreasing grade and quality for most commodities and 
exploring in more difficult jurisdictions and at depth. The Exploration group  
will focus on project generation in a number of key environments, as well  
as testing of targets within the portfolio. For 2014, the projects at a more  
advanced stage include:

T&I’s gross costs in 2013 were US$370 million, compared with US$415 million 
in 2012 and US$343 million in 2011. 2013 costs decreased compared with  
2012 due to reductions in headcount, innovation spend and travel. 
The total number of employees in T&I decreased from 1,031 at year-end  
2012 to 730 at year-end 2013.  
Strategy and strategic priorities  
T&I is focused on four strategic pillars of work to support the broader Rio Tinto 
Group: Productivity Improvement, Innovation, Technical Assurance and Project 
Development and Implementation. Each of these four pillars is underpinned  
by a centralised team of industry experts and professionals, leveraging their 
collective technical capability across Rio Tinto’s businesses to deliver enhanced 
value for shareholders.  
Safety  
T&I is committed to the safe operation of its facilities and to the safe 
deployment of its personnel. The all injury frequency rate for T&I in 2013  
was 0.63 compared to 1.57 in 2012. The improvement of this measure was 
primarily attributed to a tighter focus on existing safety efforts, particularly 
across Rio Tinto’s capital projects.  
Performance 
Innovation  
Innovation is the research and development group within T&I. Its focus is  
on developing step-change technologies, including the Mine of the Future
TM
 
programme, which addresses the significant challenges facing the  
mining industry. In 2013, Innovation continued to support the Iron Ore product 
group in its drive to capture safety and productivity benefits, by way of ongoing 
deployment of what will be amongst the world’s largest fleet of autonomous 
haulage vehicles, in its Pilbara mining operations. The Rio Tinto Mine 
Automation System and advanced visualisation technology were deployed  
to selected Group operations with further deployments scheduled. 
Encouraging progress continues in the area of advanced mineral recovery. 
Innovation’s copper recovery technology, Peak Air Recovery, progressed 
through initial trials and is now undergoing final trials prior to commercial 
deployment. Building upon experience gained from the Iron Ore Operations 
Centre in Perth, Australia, a new range of systems for remote production 
process monitoring and optimisation have been commissioned. This next 
generation “Excellence Centre” (EC) technology platform allows for near  
real-time monitoring and optimisation of remote operating facilities. It utilises 
advanced data management, integrated with human systems. The EC provides 
Rio Tinto with the capability for continuous global coverage of managed 
business unit production facilities. The first processing EC was successfully 
operated throughout 2013, delivering technical support and measurable value 
to operating business units. Connections to remote copper concentrators  
and, most recently, coal washing facilities have been successfully established. 
The EC platform will be further deployed across the Group and will encompass 
the next generation of advanced remote technical support to operations. 
Innovation uses a network of partnerships with organisations and institutions 
around the world, which provides a vast and interconnected group of world-
class experts to generate solutions. The University of Nottingham, UK was 
added to this network in 2013, with the Rio Tinto Centre for Emergent 
Technologies inaugurated on 3 December. Also in 2013, Rio Tinto and  
Chinalco agreed to explore a partnership to bring forward the next era of  
mining technology aimed at delivering significant value and re-shaping  
industry best practice.  
Productivity Improvement  
With the organisational focus on improving productivity across Rio Tinto, the 
Mineral Technology Services and the Mining and Asset Management Centre 
were combined to form Productivity Improvement. The focus of this team is to 
help the business identify and implement significant productivity improvements 
by aligning performance with clear productivity metrics; improving productivity 
diagnostics; establishing internal and external benchmarking; and by 
constructively challenging and testing proposed plans for productivity 
improvements. This team also provides technical insights into risk mitigation, 
with expertise in the areas of geology, geotechnics, mining, mineral processing, 
dams and tailings, process control and hydrogeology.  
T&I also includes a Strategic Production Planning (SPP) team that works  
with business units to develop comprehensive plans and valuations of strategic 
development options. Results from SPP provide a logical resource development 
framework for detailed studies and investment decision-making. 
Project Development & Implementation  
During 2013, Project Development & Implementation (PDI) reshaped its 
operating structure to align with the completion of existing capital projects, the 
general streamlining of organisational hierarchies, and the reduction in capital 
spending across Rio Tinto over the next few years. Under the revised structure, 
Rio Tinto is committed to an independent project management office (PMO) 
and two regionally-based Project Delivery Hubs, one for Australasia and the 
other for the Americas & Africa. 
In line with Rio Tinto’s commitment to pursue greater value for shareholders, 
PDI is now delivering capital projects within a recently-developed Capital 
Projects framework. The framework provides Rio Tinto with a disciplined 
approach to managing its projects, and provides processes and tools, 
governance, reporting, and assurance to those who are responsible for capital.  
Throughout this past year of change, PDI remained focused on the safe 
transition and handover of US$7 billion of capital projects, including: Kestrel 
Mine Extension, Argyle Underground Project, Energy Resources of Australia’s 
brine concentrator, Port Waratah Kooragang, Kemano Power Stage 1, and the 
AP60 aluminium smelter.  
Technical Assurance  
Technical Assurance is a team of internal professionals responsible for 
rigorously reviewing all major project proposals. Their role is to ensure that  
Rio Tinto’s Investment Committee and board are provided with independent 
technical assessments to support their decision-making. Throughout 2013, 
Technical Assurance focused its attention on strengthening the Group’s due 
diligence and Investment Committee processes. Technical Assurance also 
provides support to the business for a range of other technical compliance  
and governance activities such as post-investment reviews, due diligence, 
management of the Group’s reserves and resources, and general  
technical reviews.  
Outlook  
T&I will continue to add value to the Group by working with the business  
units on productivity improvements. In addition, T&I will look for alternative 
approaches for funding of Innovation projects to react to changes in the  
Group’s cash position and capital spend constraints. Despite these changes  
and challenges, T&I will continue to maintain a culture that places a high 
priority on safety and safety improvement. In 2014, T&I will focus on four  
main areas: partnering with product groups and functions on productivity 
improvement; the safe and efficient development and implementation of capital 
projects; the pursuit of the Mine of the Future™ programme as well as the 
development of innovative alliances and relationships; and technical assurance. 
All of these will create competitive advantage for the Group. This will position 
T&I to support the business where commercial and technical expertise and 
external networks will have the largest benefit to Rio Tinto and its shareholders. 
Exploration 
36 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Rio Tinto has had a sustained commitment to exploration since 1946 and  
an exceptional track record in mineral discovery success. Mature operations, 
such as Weipa, the Pilbara and Rössing, were Tier 1 greenfield discoveries  
by Rio Tinto where value is still being realised after more than 40 years of 
production. In March 2013, restructuring resulted in the Exploration group 
reporting to the chief financial officer.  
Strategy 
The goal of Exploration is to create value for Rio Tinto through discovery  
or acquisition of Tier 1 resources that are well located and high grade, to 
supplement the Group’s existing high-quality resource base. The Exploration 
group performs both greenfield and brownfield exploration programmes and 
undertakes focused research and development to aid the exploration effort. 
Greenfield exploration aims to establish completely new operating business 
units, involving, among other objectives, geographic or commodity 
diversification. Brownfield exploration is directed at sustaining or growing 
existing Group businesses in the orbit of existing operations and provides 
significant value to the product groups.  
Additionally, Exploration supports the product groups with orebody knowledge 
expertise, and supports the business development groups in evaluating merger 
and acquisition opportunities. It also supports the Economics team with supply 
forecasts. To pass community, sustainability and investment hurdles, the 
exploration process can take ten to 20 years to progress from target generation 
to development decisions. Enhancing and reaffirming the core exploration 
strategy, linked to the application of a rigorous global prioritisation process,  
has accelerated in Tier 1 discoveries since 2000. Tier 1 discoveries over the  
past decade are: 
Year Discovery Commodity  Location 
2004 Simandou  Iron ore Guinea 
2005 La Granja Copper Peru 
2005 Caliwingina  Iron ore Australia 
2008 Sulawesi Nickel Indonesia 
2008 Mutamba  Titanium Mozambique 
2009 Jadar Lithium/borates Serbia 
2011 Amargosa Bauxite Brazil 
2013 KP405 Potash Canada 
 
At the end of 2013, the Exploration group was active in 20 countries, and 
assessing opportunities in others, for a range of commodities including iron ore, 
copper, bauxite, coking coal, nickel, potash, uranium, diamonds and mineral 
sands. Exploration activities in China were conducted through CRTX, the joint 
venture between Chinalco (51 per cent) and Rio Tinto (49 per cent). Diamond 
exploration was transitioned from the Diamonds & Minerals group back to 
Exploration during 2013, and features an active project in India. 
The Exploration group is organised into regional multi-commodity teams, 
headquartered in Singapore, London, Salt Lake City, Brisbane and Beijing,  
and supported by a team of technical and commodity professionals. This 
structure provides a global reach and a local presence that allows for effective 
community engagement and development of the Group’s social licence  
to operate. 
Safety 
The Exploration group’s all injury frequency rate improved significantly  
from 1.41 at the end of 2012 to 0.49 at the end of 2013. The improvement, 
across all regions, coincided with the Exploration group implementing the 
Improving Project Performance initiative. This also produced results in 
operational performance. 
Performance 
The Order of Magnitude study was completed on the Saskatchewan potash 
project in Canada (a joint venture with North Atlantic Potash Inc., a subsidiary  
of JS Acron) in early 2013, and the project handed over to Rio Tinto Minerals.  
A drilling programme at the Tamarack project in Minnesota, US has continued  
to further extend the nickel-copper-precious metal resource. Additional  
drilling is planned in 2014 to follow up extensions to the known mineralisation. 
Drilling at the Roughrider uranium project in Saskatchewan has increased the 
understanding of the resources and indicated further extensions to the known 
mineralisation. Regional exploration across Rio Tinto’s Saskatchewan tenure 
has generated numerous targets for follow-up drilling in 2014. In Laos, orebody 
knowledge at the Sanxai bauxite project advanced through auger drilling  
across the prospective areas. The Amargosa bauxite project in Brazil has also 
progressed through an Order of Magnitude study with drilling and mapping 
advancing a number of brownfield areas in the Amargosa orbit. 
Brownfield projects generated good drilling results at the Yandi Braid and 
Munjina iron ore projects in the Pilbara and coking coal projects at Winchester 
South, Mt Robert, Hillalong and Valeria in the Bowen Basin, Australia. Drilling 
out of the Z20 uranium resource on the Rössing mine lease in Namibia was 
completed and the project handed over to the Energy product group. 
Effective data and information management lies at the heart of the Exploration 
group. Significant efficiency improvements have been achieved by organising 
data in structured, managed systems accessible via intuitive user interfaces. 
Progress continued on the development of the VK1 airborne gravity 
gradiometer, with further test flying undertaken in 2013. In addition to 
Exploration’s projects, the Group’s major evaluation projects in 2013 were:  
Project Commodity Country  
La Granja Copper Peru 
Resolution Copper US 
Pilbara Iron ore Australia 
Bowen Basin Coking coal Australia 
Simandou Iron ore Guinea 
 
In 2013, the Group reduced its exploration and evaluation expenditure to 
US$948 million, exceeding the reduction target of US$750 million by more than 
a third. This represented a 52 per cent decrease compared to 2012 expenditure 
of US$1,971 million. In addition to gross expenditure, the Group wrote down 
US$159 million of exploration assets. Of the 2013 spend, US$178 million  
relates to global Exploration group activity. In total, Rio Tinto’s exploration  
and evaluation activity covered ten commodities in 2013, across a range  
of greenfield and brownfield environments. 
Outlook 
The Exploration group will continue to work on a prioritised portfolio of 
greenfield and brownfield projects in 2014. Maintaining a robust exploration 
pipeline by identifying and securing access to the best quality opportunities  
will be a key enabler of long-term success. Continuing challenges are expected 
to include the decreasing grade and quality for most commodities and 
exploring in more difficult jurisdictions and at depth. The Exploration group  
will focus on project generation in a number of key environments, as well  
as testing of targets within the portfolio. For 2014, the projects at a more  
advanced stage include: 
Project Commodity Country  Type Stage

Group Finance 
Overview of the Group Finance functions 
The chief financial officer leads a multidisciplinary team tasked with  
delivering and implementing Group financial strategy, in addition to providing  
decision-making support and guidance to the Group’s key management and  
its operating business units. Separate specialist functions are established  
with responsibility for: financial reporting, management reporting, economic 
analysis, investor relations, taxation, treasury, assurance, business 
development, and project evaluation. Specialists in tax, financial reporting and 
treasury monitor regulatory compliance and financial developments, frequently 
engaging with industry-wide discussion groups and regulatory bodies. These 
specialists work across the disciplines to evaluate the impact of changes in 
regulatory, fiscal, economic, and other business conditions on planning and 
forecasting, financial reporting, key decision-making within the organisation, 
and on external stakeholders. The Exploration group also reports to the  
chief financial officer. 
The Group’s operating model also includes the use of shared services for 
supporting the business in process delivery. Shared services are focused on 
efficient and effective delivery of transactional, professional or specialised 
services to our entire business. Shared services work relates to business 
processes which are not unique to Rio Tinto, allowing value improvements 
through outsourcing. These support services report to the Group executive, 
Organisational Resources and have responsibility for transactional aspects of 
financial management and reporting, human resources, information systems 
and technology, procurement and group property. 
Role of the Group Finance function in 2013 
With market conditions remaining volatile, the Finance function has played  
a key role in helping the business to reduce costs, improve capital allocation, 
and strengthen the balance sheet. During 2013, the Group raised a total of 
US$3 billion of fixed and floating rate bonds.  
The Finance function was closely involved with supporting the implementation 
and monitoring of cost reduction initiatives. The Group achieved a US$2.3 
billion improvement in operating cash costs for 2013, exceeding the target  
of US$2 billion. This, in conjunction with a US$1,023 million reduction in 
exploration and evaluation costs (exceeding the reduction target of US$750 
million), demonstrates that the Group has made strong progress to sustainably 
reduce its operating cost base and realise productivity gains across its portfolio.  
These initiatives were supported by the expanded use of the shared services 
operating model to streamline process delivery. 
Furthermore, the function has been instrumental in enhancing the Group’s 
capital allocation process. It has provided strategic support and guidance to 
senior management, with evaluation and analysis that allows decision makers 
to prioritise only the highest-returning projects. Capital expenditure is expected 
to almost halve from a peak of US$17.6 billion in 2012 to around US$8.0 billion 
in 2015, in the pursuit of maximising returns to shareholders whilst 
strengthening the balance sheet. 
In further support of the Group’s 2013 priorities, the Finance team worked  
on reshaping the portfolio by selling non-core assets. Divestments totalling 
US$3.5 billion were announced or completed in 2013, with proceeds of  
US$2.5 billion received during the year. 
In addition, in 2013 the Group published its third comprehensive Taxes  
Paid report, which covered the year ended 31 December 2012. The report  
provided detailed analysis of Rio Tinto’s US$11.6 billion contribution in  
global tax payments. 
During 2014, Rio Tinto’s Finance function will continue its focus on supporting 
senior management and product groups to achieve the target of US$3 billion  
in operating cash cost improvements compared with 2012, and leveraging 
opportunities to re-shape the portfolio. The Finance function will remain 
focused on providing high-quality financial strategy and decision-making 
support, together with compliant and informative reporting, whilst pursuing 
capital management and development opportunities that are consistent with 
the Group’s strategy. 
2013 performance highlights 
The key metrics for Group financial management and planning are summarised 
below. More detailed information, including reconciliation to the appropriate 
statutory financial statement measures, is included in the additional financial 
information section of the Directors’ report on pages 47 to 52.

(a) Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator which management 
uses internally to assess performance. It is presented here as a measure of earnings  
to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of the Group. 
Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are explained in  
note 2 to the financial statements. Both net earnings and underlying earnings deal 
with amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. However, EU IFRS requires that 
the profit for the year reported in the income statement should also include earnings 
attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Comparative information has 
been restated to reflect a number of new accounting standards; see note 2 to the 
financial statements.  
Increased underlying earnings reflect the favourable impact of operating  
cash cost improvements (including exploration and evaluation savings), 
improved sales volumes and overall strengthening of the US dollar against  
local currencies. This was offset by lower prices in all of the Group’s main 
commodities other than iron ore, inflation, and increased tax charges  
(primarily attributable to utilisation of Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) 
deferred tax assets). 
Net earnings of US$3.7 billion reflect non-cash exchange losses of  
US$2.9 billion and impairments of US$3.4 billion, including impairment of 
previous years’ non-cash accounting uplifts on initial consolidation of certain 
Turquoise Hill assets (including Oyu Tolgoi), a significant project cost overrun  
at Kitimat and of the Gove alumina refinery following an announcement to  
curtail production. 
Cash flows from operations, which include dividends from equity accounted 
units, at 22 per cent above 2012, reflect the positive impact of higher volumes 
and cost reduction initiatives. 
Net debt decreased from US$19.2 billion at 31 December 2012 to US$18.1 
billion at 31 December 2013 as operating cash inflows and divestment proceeds 
fully offset the outflows relating to capital expenditure and the increased 
dividend payment. Net debt to total capital was 25 per cent at 31 December 
2013 and interest cover was 13 times, both unchanged from the prior year.  
The board’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the business  
as a going concern whilst maximising returns for the Group’s shareholders.  
In practice, this involves regular reviews by the board and senior management. 
These reviews take into account the Group’s strategic priorities, economic and 
business conditions, and opportunities that are identified to invest across all 
points of the commodities cycle. The resulting capital structure provides the 
Group with a high degree of financial flexibility at a low cost of capital.

US$3.5 billion were announced or completed in 2013, with proceeds of  
US$2.5 billion received during the year. 
In addition, in 2013 the Group published its third comprehensive Taxes  
Paid report, which covered the year ended 31 December 2012. The report  
provided detailed analysis of Rio Tinto’s US$11.6 billion contribution in  
global tax payments. 
During 2014, Rio Tinto’s Finance function will continue its focus on supporting 
senior management and product groups to achieve the target of US$3 billion  
in operating cash cost improvements compared with 2012, and leveraging 
opportunities to re-shape the portfolio. The Finance function will remain 
focused on providing high-quality financial strategy and decision-making 
support, together with compliant and informative reporting, whilst pursuing 
capital management and development opportunities that are consistent with 
the Group’s strategy. 
2013 performance highlights 
The key metrics for Group financial management and planning are summarised 
below. More detailed information, including reconciliation to the appropriate 
statutory financial statement measures, is included in the additional financial 
information section of the Directors’ report on pages 47 to 52.

Total capital  71,557 76,932 67,226
(a) Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator which management 
uses internally to assess performance. It is presented here as a measure of earnings  
to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of the Group. 
Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are explained in  
note 2 to the financial statements. Both net earnings and underlying earnings deal 
with amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. However, EU IFRS requires that 
the profit for the year reported in the income statement should also include earnings 
attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Comparative information has 
been restated to reflect a number of new accounting standards; see note 2 to the 
financial statements.  
Increased underlying earnings reflect the favourable impact of operating  
cash cost improvements (including exploration and evaluation savings), 
improved sales volumes and overall strengthening of the US dollar against  
local currencies. This was offset by lower prices in all of the Group’s main 
commodities other than iron ore, inflation, and increased tax charges  
(primarily attributable to utilisation of Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) 
deferred tax assets). 
Net earnings of US$3.7 billion reflect non-cash exchange losses of  
US$2.9 billion and impairments of US$3.4 billion, including impairment of 
previous years’ non-cash accounting uplifts on initial consolidation of certain 
Turquoise Hill assets (including Oyu Tolgoi), a significant project cost overrun  
at Kitimat and of the Gove alumina refinery following an announcement to  
curtail production. 
Cash flows from operations, which include dividends from equity accounted 
units, at 22 per cent above 2012, reflect the positive impact of higher volumes 
and cost reduction initiatives. 
Net debt decreased from US$19.2 billion at 31 December 2012 to US$18.1 
billion at 31 December 2013 as operating cash inflows and divestment proceeds 
fully offset the outflows relating to capital expenditure and the increased 
dividend payment. Net debt to total capital was 25 per cent at 31 December 
2013 and interest cover was 13 times, both unchanged from the prior year.  
The board’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the business  
as a going concern whilst maximising returns for the Group’s shareholders.  
In practice, this involves regular reviews by the board and senior management. 
These reviews take into account the Group’s strategic priorities, economic and 
business conditions, and opportunities that are identified to invest across all 
points of the commodities cycle. The resulting capital structure provides the 
Group with a high degree of financial flexibility at a low cost of capital.

Indemnities and insurance 
The Articles of Association and Constitution of the Companies provide for  
them to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, officers of the Companies, 
including officers of wholly owned subsidiaries, against liabilities arising from  
the conduct of the Group’s business. The directors and the company secretary 
of Rio Tinto plc and the joint company secretaries of the Companies, and certain 
employees serving as directors of subsidiaries at the Group’s request have been 
indemnified in accordance with these provisions. No amount has been paid 
under any of these indemnities during the year. 
The Group has purchased directors’ and officers’ insurance during the year.  
In broad terms, the insurance cover indemnifies individual directors’ and 
officers’ personal legal liability and legal defence costs for claims arising out  
of actions taken in connection with Group business. It is a condition of the 
insurance policy that detailed terms and premiums paid cannot be disclosed. 
Employment policies and communication 
Information about the Group’s employment policies and our employees is 
available on page 21. 
Political donations 
No donations were made during 2013 for political purposes in the EU,  
Australia or elsewhere, as defined by the UK Companies Act 2006.  
Government regulations 
Rio Tinto is subject to extensive government regulations affecting all aspects  
of its operations. Our product diversity and geographical spread reduces the 
likelihood of any single government regulation having a material effect on the 
Group’s business. Rio Tinto consistently seeks to apply best practice in all of  
its activities, which also mitigates against the impact of regulation.  
In each of the countries in which we operate, Rio Tinto is subject to local, state, 
provincial and federal regulations governing mining and processing, land  
tenure and use, environmental requirements, workplace health and safety,  
data privacy, trade and export, corporations, competition, intellectual property, 
access to infrastructure, foreign investment, securities and taxation. Some 
operations are conducted under specific agreements with the respective 
governments and associated acts of parliament.  
In Canada, our hydroelectric power generation assets are regulated by the 
Quebec and British Columbia provincial agencies covering issues of water  
rights, power sales and purchases. 
In Australia and Namibia, Rio Tinto’s uranium operations are subject to specific 
regulations covering the mining and export of uranium. 
In South Africa, our operations are subject to black economic empowerment 
legislation which includes the requirement to transfer (for fair value) 26 per cent 
of the Group’s South African mining assets to historically disadvantaged South 
Africans by 2014. In 2009, Rio Tinto successfully concluded a 26 per cent 
empowerment transaction. Rio Tinto also complies with the mining legislation’s 
transformation imperatives which includes empowerment of South Africa’s 
Historically Disadvantaged Employees and Communities. 
Environmental regulation 
Rio Tinto measures its performance against environmental regulation to which 
its operations are subject, by rating incidents according to their environmental 
impact potential. Issues of Group-level importance are reported to the Executive 
Committee and the Sustainability Committee. Prosecutions and other breaches 
are also used to gauge Rio Tinto’s performance. 
Rio Tinto is subject to various environmental regulations including regulations 
that cover air, land, water and noise pollution in the countries where it has 
operations. In 2013, there were 15 environmental incidents reported to the 
Executive Committee with the potential to impact the environment or to 
concern local communities, several of which were minor. Five resulted from  
air discharges, four from water discharges, five were spills and one related to 
exceeding noise limits.  
The incidents were: 
– Air emissions exceeded limits due to scrubber maintenance issues at an 
aluminium smelter in the Quebec, Canada. 
– Dust was emitted on a number of occasions from a carbon cathode 
production facility in France. 
– Air emissions exceeded criteria at a coal mine in New South Wales, Australia.  
– Air emissions exceeded limits on a number of occasions at an aluminium 
smelter in France. 
– Para aromatic hydrocarbon emissions exceeded limits at an aluminium 
smelter in British Columbia, Canada. 
– Noise levels exceeded limits on a number of occasions at a coal mine  
in New South Wales, Australia. 
– Various water quality discharge parameters were exceeded during heavy  
rain at an alumina refinery in Queensland, Australia. 
– Mine-affected water was discharged to the environment at a coal mine  
in Queensland, Australia. 
– Water quality discharges exceeded seawater discharge limits at an alumina 
refinery in Queensland, Australia. 
– Sediment in run-off entered a fish habitat at an aluminium smelter site  
in British Columbia, Canada.  
– Two leach tanks ruptured at uranium processing plants: one in the Northern 
Territory, Australia and the other in Namibia. 
– Tailings overflowed from a pipe into a neighbouring property at a copper 
facility in Utah, US. 
– Diesel spilled from an open pump at a coal mine in Queensland, Australia. 
– Water run-off occurred at a hazardous substances storage area at an 
aluminium smelter site in Canada.  
During 2013, 16 operations incurred fines amounting to US$190,279  
(2012: US$47,102).  
In addition, Australian corporations that exceed specific greenhouse gas 
emissions or energy use thresholds have obligations under the Australian 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, the Australian Energy 
Efficiency Opportunities Act 2006 (EEO), and the Australian Clean Energy Act 
2011 which establishes the carbon pricing mechanism.  
Three main Rio Tinto entities, Rio Tinto Limited, Alcan Gove Pty Limited and 
Pechiney Consolidated Australia Limited, are covered under each of these Acts. 
Each submitted their National Greenhouse and Energy reports by the required  
31 October 2013 deadline and completed the required EEO public reporting. 
Twenty-eight EEO assessments for the second five-year assessment cycle  
have now been completed. One remaining assessment is scheduled in 2014.  
All compliance obligations under the carbon pricing mechanism, including 
reporting and surrender of carbon units by liable entities, were completed  
in the required timeframes. Liability information is publicly available on the  
Clean Energy Regulator’s website (as per legislative requirements). 
Further information on the Group’s environmental performance is included in 
the sustainable development section of this Annual report, on pages 18 to 24, 
and on the website. 
Exploration, research and development 
The Group carries out exploration as well as research and development  
in support of its activities as described more fully under Exploration and 
Technology & Innovation on pages 36 to 37. Amounts charged for the year,  
net of any gains on disposal, generated a net loss before tax for exploration and 
evaluation of US$1,109 million (2012 restated: US$1,477 million). Research and 
development costs were US$231 million (2012 restated: US$246 million).

Auditors  
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers (together, PwC)  
are the auditors of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited respectively. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue  
in office as auditors of Rio Tinto plc and a resolution to reappoint them as 
auditors of Rio Tinto plc will be proposed at the 2014 annual general meetings. 
A separate resolution will seek authority for the Audit Committee to determine 
their remuneration. PricewaterhouseCoopers will continue in office as auditors 
of Rio Tinto Limited. 
A copy of the declaration given by PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Group’s 
external auditors to the directors in relation to the auditors’ compliance with  
the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and  
the professional code of conduct for external auditors is set out on page 203  
in the financial statements. 
No person who was an officer of Rio Tinto during 2013 was a director or  
partner of the auditors at a time when they conducted an audit of the Group. 
Each person who held the office of director at the date the board resolved  
to approve this report makes the following statements: 
– so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the auditors are unaware; and 
– each director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as  
a director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.

(c) All other fees include services in connection with the divestment programme  
and similar corporate projects. 
Further information on auditor’s remuneration see note 39 to the  
financial statements. 
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of PwC  
for Group audit and local, statutory audit work. The evaluation took the form  
of a survey comprising a range of questions covering objectivity, quality and 
efficiency and was completed by individual Rio Tinto business units. In addition, 
in the current year a further review was completed in October 2013 of the 
overall relationship with the auditors. The results of this survey and review  
were presented to the Audit Committee which concluded that PwC continued  
to provide a high-quality audit and an effective and independent challenge  
to management. The Audit Committee was satisfied with the external audit 
process and the independence of the external auditors.  
PwC have been the external auditors since before the formation of the dual 
listed companies structure in 1995. For the reasons noted on page 62 the Audit 
Committee does not consider it necessary at the present time to undertake a 
tender process for the Group’s external audit. Since 2002, PwC have followed 
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and APB Ethical Standards 
and rotated both the lead UK and Australian audit partners at least every five 
years. In the UK, the audit engagement partner was appointed in 2011, and in 
Australia the audit engagement partner was appointed in 2012. They are due  
to transition after 2015 and 2016 respectively. This continued refreshing of the 
team brings new perspectives to the audit and promotes healthy debate 
between auditors and management as well as the Committee.  
Based on advice provided by the Audit Committee as set out in the report  
of the Audit Committee on pages 61 and 62, the directors are satisfied that the 
provision of non-audit services by PwC is compatible with the general standard 
of independence for auditors and the standards imposed by Australian, UK and  
US legislation.

Prices 
2013 vs 2012 
The effect of price movements on all major commodities was to decrease 
underlying earnings by US$1,289 million compared with 2012. The average 
Platts price for 62 per cent iron Pilbara fines was three per cent higher on 
average compared with 2012, while hard coking coal benchmark prices were  
24 per cent lower, and thermal coal spot prices averaged 14 per cent lower. 
Copper prices were down eight per cent and LME prices for gold and aluminium 
averaged 16 and nine per cent lower respectively. 
2012 vs 2011 
The effect of price movements on all major commodities in 2012 was to 
decrease underlying earnings by US$5,315 million compared with 2011.  
Average prices declined from record highs experienced in 2011 for nearly all of  
Rio Tinto’s major commodities, with the exception of gold which was up six per 
cent on 2011, and minerals (mainly borates and titanium dioxide feedstocks). 
The average Platts price for 62 per cent Pilbara fines declined by 24 per cent 
compared with 2011. Copper prices were down ten per cent, aluminium prices 
averaged 16 per cent lower and molybdenum was 17 per cent lower. 
Commodity prices and other drivers of sales revenue are discussed further  
on pages 49 to 50. 
Exchange rates 
2013 vs 2012 
The US dollar strengthened significantly during 2013, in particular in the second 
half of the year. Compared with 2012, the US dollar, on average, rose by six per 
cent against the Australian dollar, by three per cent against the Canadian dollar, 
and by 15 per cent against the South African Rand. The effect of all currency 
movements was to increase underlying earnings relative to 2012 by  
US$1,008 million. 
2012 vs 2011 
Compared with 2011, on average, the US dollar depreciated by one per cent 
against the Australian dollar but strengthened by one per cent against the 
Canadian dollar, by seven per cent against the Euro and by 14 per cent against 
the South African Rand. The effect of all currency movements was to increase 
underlying earnings relative to 2011 by US$154 million. 
Volumes 
2013 vs 2012 
Volume increases enhanced earnings by US$538 million compared with 2012. 
These were achieved primarily in Iron Ore, where a new annual sales volume 
record was achieved, due to increased capacity at the Pilbara ports, and 
productivity improvements. Volumes also rose in copper, from Escondida in  
line with higher ore grades and increased throughput, in bauxite from record 
production volumes, and in aluminium following the return of the Alma smelter 
to full production. These additional tonnes more than offset the impact of lower 
gold production at Kennecott Utah Copper and lower demand for titanium 
dioxide feedstocks. 
2012 vs 2011 
Volume increases enhanced earnings by US$634 million compared with 2011. 
These were achieved primarily in iron ore, where sales volumes rose three  
per cent due to increased capacity at the Pilbara ports, and at Escondida in line 
with higher ore grades. Volume declines lowered earnings by US$943 million 
compared with 2011, reflecting lower mill throughput and gold grades at 
Kennecott Utah Copper and no metal share from Grasberg.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Cash costs, exploration and evaluation 
2013 vs 2012 
Rio Tinto made strong progress on its cost reduction programme and exceeded 
its 2013 targets. In 2013, the Group realised US$2,279 million pre-tax  
(US$1,559 million post-tax) in operating cash cost savings which exceeded  
the target of US$2 billion. 
Exploration and evaluation spend was reduced by US$1,023 million  
(on a consolidated, pre-tax basis) which exceeded the target reduction of 
US$750 million. Evaluation spend has been prioritised on those projects  
with the greatest potential to deliver value in the medium term, with spend on 
certain longer-dated options reduced. On a net earnings basis this resulted in  
an improvement of US$557 million. These are offset by the absence of a gain  
on disposal, and write-down of exploration properties in 2013. The Group wrote 
down its investment in Northern Dynasty Minerals, which owns 100 per cent of 
the Pebble Project in Alaska, by US$131 million following the announcement  
of a strategic review. In 2012, Rio Tinto reported net gains of US$346 million  
on divestment of various exploration properties, including its interests in Extract 
Resources and Kalahari Minerals. 
In 2013, the Group reduced headcount by 4,000, net of new roles in the Iron Ore 
group to support the Pilbara 290 expansion. A further 3,300 roles left the Group 
through divested assets. 
2012 vs 2011 
Industry-wide cost pressures continued during 2012, in particular at some  
of the key mining regions where Rio Tinto has significant operations, such as 
New South Wales, Queensland and the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  
Higher energy costs across the Group lowered underlying earnings by  
US$23 million compared with 2011. In 2012, many operations were impacted  
by higher fuel, diesel and power rates. 
Higher other cash costs during 2012 decreased underlying earnings by  
US$304 million compared with 2011 due to a combination of fixed production 
cost inefficiencies associated with lower volumes due to grade, higher 
maintenance costs, and costs associated with operational readiness for the 
Pilbara expansion of iron ore production. 
During 2012, Rio Tinto divested various exploration properties, including 
interests in Extract Resources and Kalahari Minerals. The impact from 
movements in exploration and evaluation expenditure net of gains realised  
from divestments was to increase underlying earnings by US$80 million 
compared with 2011. 
Non-cash/interest/tax, other 
The effective corporate income tax rate on underlying earnings, excluding  
equity accounted units was 35 per cent compared with 30 per cent in 2012  
(2012: 30 per cent, unchanged from 2011). The increased charge was primarily 
attributable to utilisation of the MRRT deferred tax asset. As in 2012 and 2011, 
the effective corporate tax on net earnings, excluding equity accounted units,  
is significantly impacted by the impairment of goodwill, which is non-deductible 
for tax purposes. 
The Group net interest charge was US$130 million higher than in 2012  
(2012: US$128 million lower than in 2011), mainly reflecting higher average  
net debt in 2013 (2012: mainly reflecting an increase in capitalised interest). 
Exclusions from underlying earnings 2011-2013

2013 
Total impairment charges of US$3,428 million (net of tax and non-controlling 
interests) were recognised in 2013, of which US$1,655 million related to the 
Group’s copper businesses. This includes a charge of US$1,565 million related  
to the impairment of previous years’ fair value adjustments on consolidation  
of certain assets of Turquoise Hill (including Oyu Tolgoi). On 29 July 2013,  
Rio Tinto announced that funding and work on the underground development 
would be delayed pending resolution of outstanding shareholder issues, 
including finalising project finance. The consequent impact of updates to timing 
of revenues and expenditure resulted in the carrying value being higher than  
fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). 
Impairments to the Group’s copper businesses also include adjustments to 
reduce the carrying value of the Eagle nickel-copper project to FVLCD prior  
to divestment on 17 July 2013, the impact of medium and long-term coking  
and thermal coal prices on non-cash fair value acquisition adjustments to 
undeveloped projects at SouthGobi Resources, and adjustment to the carrying 
value of Inova Resources, which was sold on 1 November 2013.  
In addition, there was a post-tax impairment of US$1,293 million relating to  
the Group’s aluminium businesses. This includes US$555 million for the  
Gove refinery, following an announcement on 29 November 2013 to suspend 
alumina production and focus on the bauxite operation. As a result of this 
decision, the timing and scope of site restoration and environmental 
rehabilitation cash flows have been revised, together with the write-off of 
operating assets not fully depreciated. The remaining post-tax charge of  
US$738 million related to the Group’s Canadian aluminium operations, primarily 
at Kitimat in British Columbia, resulting from a change in assumptions about 
future capital required to complete the modernisation project, which diminished 
the value of the associated intangible assets, and another site closure within  
the Aluminium portfolio. 
A post-tax impairment charge of US$470 million relating to Rio Tinto Coal 
Mozambique (RTCM) has been recognised. An assessment of FVLCD derived 
from future cash flows, which included a reassessment of the development plan 
and review of the discount rate and associated country risk premium, resulted  
in the recoverable value being below carrying value.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: 
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
 
Net gains on disposal of interests in businesses during 2013 mainly relate to  
the Group’s divestment of its remaining interest in Constellium (formerly Alcan 
Engineered Products) and the Northparkes mine. 
Non-cash exchange and derivative losses of US$2,731 million arose primarily  
on US dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency companies, and on 
intragroup balances. These losses are largely offset by currency translation  
gains recognised in equity. 
Kennecott Utah Copper’s Bingham Canyon mine experienced a slide along  
a geological fault line of its north-eastern wall in April 2013. Charges relating  
to the slide, which have been excluded from underlying earnings, primarily 
comprise the write-off of certain deferred stripping assets and damaged 
equipment. Adjustments for settlement of insurance claims have been made to 
the amount excluded from underlying earnings, and will continue as insurance 
claims are settled. 
Adjustments in relation to Clermont and Blair Athol arose following 
reclassification to disposal groups held for sale, and reflect contractual 
obligations for product sales and funding of closure activities, which will remain 
with the Group following completion of the divestments. Further adjustments  
in respect of these obligations will be combined with the net gain/loss on 
disposal expected to be recognised in 2014. 
2012 
A post-tax impairment charge of US$14,360 million was recognised in 2012,  
of which US$11,000 million related to the Group’s aluminium businesses.  
During 2012, aluminium prices deteriorated further with strong Australian and 
Canadian currencies, high energy and raw material costs, and high volumes  
of LME inventory continuing to exert pressure on current market values in the 
industry. As in 2011, given the prevailing conditions in the aluminium market, 
FVLCD did not include the full value of the Group’s planned improvements in 
cash margins from its value-enhancement programmes. 
A post-tax impairment charge of US$2,860 million was also recognised relating 
to Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM). The development of infrastructure in 
Mozambique to support the undeveloped coal asset was found to be more 
challenging than initially anticipated which, combined with a downward revision 
to estimates of recoverable coking coal volumes, led to a reassessment of the 
overall scale and ramp-up schedule of RTCM and consequently to the 
assessment of its FVLCD. 
In addition, there were net post-tax impairments of US$460 million relating to 
the Group’s Argyle diamond mine and US$40 million in other net impairments. 
An impairment review of Argyle was triggered by the announcement during 
2012 of the Diamonds strategic review, as well as changes to the forecast  
ramp-up date for the underground mine. 
Gains and losses on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses relate 
primarily to a gain of US$965 million arising on consolidation of Richards Bay 
Minerals (RBM) in September 2012 and a US$167 million loss on consolidation 
of Turquoise Hill Resources. 
A deferred tax asset was recognised in 2012 following introduction of the MRRT 
on 1 July 2012. The legislation, which applies to companies with iron ore and 
coal operations in Australia, allows a deduction against future MRRT liability 
based on the market value of past investments in these mining assets as at  
1 May 2010. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset was recognised to reflect the 
deductibility for MRRT purposes of the market value of these mining assets  
to the extent recovery is probable. 
2011 
A post-tax impairment charge of US$9,290 million was recognised in 2011,  
of which US$8,855 million related to the Group’s aluminium businesses. 
Valuation of Rio Tinto’s aluminium businesses for impairment testing was  
based on an assessment of FVLCD derived from discounted future cash flows. 
The impairment was largely a result of the economic environment, and related 
market volatility in aluminium prices in the second half of 2011, leading to 
declines in market values for aluminium assets.  
In addition, there were net post-tax impairments of US$344 million relating  
to the Group’s diamond business and US$91 million in other net impairments.  
Profits on the disposal of businesses in 2011 related principally to the sale of  
the Group’s talc business and Colowyo mine.  
The deferred tax asset write-off in 2011 of US$342 million followed a change  
in French legislation which restricted the utilisation of tax losses.

Aluminium 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
The Aluminium group’s sales revenues are from aluminium and related 
products such as alumina and bauxite. 
Sales revenue increased by two per cent, reflecting increasing volumes  
across all products, and a rise in regional market premia more than offsetting  
a nine per cent decline in LME prices over the period. Market premia on 
aluminium shipments continued to perform strongly in 2013, supported by 
balanced physical supply/demand, despite significant LME inventories, much  
of which remains tied up in financing deals due to higher forward prices and  
low interest rates. 
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 
Gross sales revenue for Rio Tinto Alcan decreased by 17 per cent compared  
with 2011, due to the combined effects of lower market prices and reduced 
production at Alma, offset by the Yarwun refinery expansion. 
The impact of lower prices on Group sales revenue in 2012 was partially  
offset by higher market premia as significant amounts of aluminium  
inventories remained locked in financing deals and therefore unavailable  
for physical delivery. 
Copper 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
Gross sales revenue for the Copper group decreased by 11 per cent in 2013 
compared with 2012. This reflected an eight per cent decline in the copper  
price during the period, and a 16 per cent decline in the gold price, together  
with divestment of the Palabora and Northparkes operations during 2013.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group had an estimated 254 million pounds of 
copper sales (2012: 249 million pounds) that were provisionally priced at  
333 US cents per pound (2012: 360 US cents per pound). The final price of  
these sales will be determined during the first half of 2014. 
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 
Gross sales revenue for the Copper group decreased by 13 per cent in 2012 
compared with 2011. This reflected the impact of lower prices and decreased 
volumes following lower mill throughput and an anticipated period of lower gold 
grades at Kennecott Utah Copper and no metal share from Grasberg. This was 
partly offset by increasing volumes from Escondida due to higher grades and 
improvements to the crushing and conveying circuit and from Northparkes in 
line with a recovery in ore grades.  
Diamonds & Minerals 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
Gross sales revenue increased by three per cent, largely as the result of 
consolidating a full year of sales at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM), which offset 
the impact of lower prices for zircon, titanium dioxide feedstocks, borates and 
metallics and lower sales volumes of titanium dioxide feedstocks due to 
challenging market conditions. Markets for titanium dioxide and zircon have 
softened further over the course of the year as the industry continues to work 
through high levels of inventories. 
Diamonds revenue was 15 per cent above 2012 due to higher volumes and 
increased prices; polished diamond prices were relatively stable throughout 
2013 whilst slightly greater volatility was experienced in prices for rough 
diamonds. Diamond prices realised by Rio Tinto depend on the size and  
quality of diamonds in the product mix. 
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 
Revenues for Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium (RTIT) increased 41 per cent  
year-on-year due to higher prices for titanium dioxide feedstocks and the  
RBM transaction in September 2012, partially offset by the divestment of  
the talc business on 1 August 2011. The market for both titanium dioxide  
and zircon started the year strongly, although demand subsequently softened  
in the second half. RTIT continued to replace its multi-year sales contracts  
with alternative pricing mechanisms in 2012, increasing the exposure to  
market prices.  
Diamonds revenue was two per cent higher than 2011, as the effect  
of higher volumes was largely offset by lower prices.  
Energy 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
Gross sales revenue in 2013 for the Energy group decreased by ten per cent 
compared with 2012 as a result of significantly lower prices. Global thermal  
coal prices continued the weaker trend of the past two years, and excess supply 
continues to impact the coking coal market with nearly all major exporting 
countries increasing output in 2013. Excess supply and enduring closure of 
Japan’s nuclear industry continued to adversely impact the uranium market in 
2013. The uranium spot price index ended the year 20 per cent below 2012 at 
US$34.50 per pound, while the long-term price indicator lost 12 per cent to end 
the year at US$50 per pound U 3

. 
A significant proportion of Rio Tinto’s coal production is sold under long-term 
contracts. In Australia, the prices applying to sales under the long-term 
contracts are generally renegotiated annually for thermal coal, but prices are 
fixed at different times of the year and on a variety of bases. Coking coal prices 
for 2013 have been negotiated on a quarterly basis. For these reasons, average 
realised prices will not necessarily reflect the movements in any of the publicly-
quoted prices. Rio Tinto Uranium also sells predominantly on a longer-term 
contract basis. Moreover, there are significant product specification differences 
between mines. Sales volumes of all products will vary during the year and the 
timing of shipments will also result in differences between average realised 
prices and published prices.  
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 
Gross sales revenue in 2012 for the Energy group decreased by 17 per cent 
compared with 2011 as a result of lower prices. 
2012 was a difficult year in coal and uranium markets as supply and demand 
fundamentals struggled to balance in the face of global economic uncertainty, 
with prices declining across most of the year. Coking coal spot prices reached  
a low of US$140 per tonne in the third quarter of 2012 after peaking at  
US$366 per tonne in early 2011. Thermal coal spot prices reached a low of 
US$80 per tonne in the third quarter of 2012 after peaking at US$130 per tonne 
in early 2011. The uranium spot price reached a low of US$42 per pound in 
October 2012, down US$10 from the same time in 2011. 
Iron Ore 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
Gross sales revenue for the Iron Ore group increased by seven per cent 
compared with 2012, attributable to record sales volumes in the Pilbara and 
marginally higher prices; and sales volumes increased by five per cent across 
the product group. In 2013, approximately 30 per cent of sales were priced with 
reference to a quarterly average index set at the prior quarter’s average lagged 
by one month. The remainder was sold via pricing mechanisms priced closer to 
the index price at the time of shipment, such as current quarter average, current 
month average or spot index prices. Index prices are adjusted for product 
characteristics and iron and moisture content. 
2012 sales revenue compared with 2011 
Gross sales revenue for the Iron Ore group decreased by 18 per cent in 2012 
compared with 2011, reflecting lower iron ore prices partly offset by higher 
volumes. Sales increased quarter-on-quarter throughout 2012, resulting in 
record annual sales volumes despite significant volatility in the marketplace.

Aluminium 
2013 sales revenue compared with 2012 
The Aluminium group’s sales revenues are from aluminium and related 
products such as alumina and bauxite. 
Sales revenue increased by two per cent, reflecting increasing volumes  
across all products, and a rise in regional market premia more than offsetting  
a nine per cent decline in LME prices over the period. Market premia on 
aluminium shipments continued to perform strongly in 2013, supported by 
balanced physical supply/demand, despite significant LME inventories, much  
of which remains tied up in financing deals due to higher forward prices and  
low interest rates.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: 
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
 
Cash flow 
2013 compared with 2012 
A full consolidated statement of cash flows is contained in the  
financial statements. 
Cash flows from operations, including dividends from equity accounted units, 
were US$20.1 billion, 22 per cent higher than 2012, reflecting the positive impact 
of higher volumes and the cost reduction initiatives. Tax payments in 2013 of 
US$3.7 billion were US$2.1 billion lower than in 2012. The stronger cash flows 
from operations and lower taxes drove net cash generated from operating 
activities 60 per cent higher to US$15.1 billion. 
Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (net of 
proceeds of sales of fixed assets) declined by US$4.6 billion or 26 per cent to 
US$12.9 billion in 2013. Five major capital projects were completed during the 
year: the Pilbara iron ore mines and infrastructure expansion to 290Mt/a in 
Western Australia, the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine and concentrator in 
Mongolia, the Kestrel coking coal mine extension and expansion in Queensland, 
the Argyle diamond underground mine in Western Australia and the AP60 
aluminium smelter in Quebec. Ongoing capital projects include the second 
phase expansion of the Pilbara iron ore infrastructure to 360Mt/a, due to come 
on stream at the end of the first half of 2015, and the modernisation of the 
Kitimat aluminium smelter in British Columbia, which is due to be complete  
in the first half of 2015 (subject to any additional capital required to complete 
the project receiving board approval). 
Net proceeds from disposals of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
totalled US$1.9 billion in 2013, primarily reflecting the sale of the Group’s 
interests in Northparkes, Constellium, Eagle and Altynalmas Gold. Additional 
cash inflows from disposals were reflected within Sales of financial assets and 
Dividends from equity accounted units. Total disposal proceeds in 2013 of 
US$2.5 billion are presented after adjusting for working capital and other items.  
Dividends paid in 2013 of US$3.3 billion reflected the 15 per cent increase  
in the 2012 final dividend. 
2012 compared with 2011 
Cash flows from operations, including dividends from equity accounted units, 
were US$16.5 billion, 40 per cent lower than 2011, primarily as a consequence  
of lower prices. 
Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets rose to 
US$17.6 billion, an increase of US$5.1 billion from 2011. This included the 
continued expansion of the Pilbara iron ore mines and infrastructure to 290Mt/a 
in Western Australia, the construction of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine and 
concentrator in Mongolia, the modernisation of the Kitimat aluminium smelter  
in British Columbia, the extension and expansion of the Kestrel coking coal mine 
in Queensland and the continued underground development of the Argyle 
diamond mine in Western Australia. 
During 2012, the Group doubled its holding in RBM to 74 per cent through the 
acquisition of BHP Billiton’s entire interests for US$1.7 billion.  
The Group received US$1.35 billion following completion of the agreement with 
Chalco to develop and operate the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea and 
US$0.9 billion from the Turquoise Hill Resources rights offering. These amounts 
have been recognised as proceeds from issue of equity to non-controlling 
interests in the cash flow statement.  
Cash returns to shareholders totalled US$4.5 billion in 2012, comprising  
US$1.5 billion in share buy-backs with the completion of the Group’s  
US$7 billion share buy-back programme in March 2012, and dividends  
of US$3.0 billion.  
Dividend payments were US$0.8 billion higher than in 2011, reflecting a  
34 per cent increase in the 2011 total dividend. 
Statement of financial position 
Net debt decreased from US$19.2 billion to US$18.1 billion at 31 December  
2013 as operating cash inflows and divestment proceeds fully offset the outflows 
relating to capital expenditure and the increase in the dividend. Net debt at  
31 December 2013 was made up principally from adjusted total borrowings  
(as defined in note 24 to the financial statements) of US$28.3 billion, offset by 
US$10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The proportion of net debt to  
total capital stood at 25 per cent at 31 December 2013, unchanged from the 
prior year.  
Total borrowings at 31 December 2013 were US$28.5 billion. The weighted 
average cost of total borrowings was approximately four per cent and the 
weighted average maturity of total borrowings was around eight years with  
the maximum nominal amount maturing in any one calendar year currently 
US$3.2 billion. At 31 December 2013, approximately two-thirds of Rio Tinto’s 
adjusted total borrowings were at fixed interest rates. In 2013, Rio Tinto issued 
US$3.0 billion of fixed and floating rate bonds in US dollars. The offering 
comprised US$1.0 billion of three year and US$1.25 billion of 5.5 year fixed rate 
bonds at coupons of 1.375 per cent and 2.25 per cent respectively, and US$250 
million two year and US$500 million three year floating rate bonds at coupons  
of three month US$ LIBOR plus 55 and 84 basis points respectively. 
Total provisions have decreased by US$2.9 billion; this is primarily related to  
the impact of the strengthening US dollar, actuarial gains on pensions and  
other post-retirement obligations due to the impact of higher bond yields  
and significant positive returns on equities held in pension plans. 
Financial instruments and risk management 
The Group’s policies with regard to financial instruments and risk management 
are clearly defined and consistently applied. They are a fundamental part of  
the Group’s long-term strategy covering areas such as foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk and capital 
management. Further details of our Financial instruments and risk management 
are disclosed in note 30 “Financial instruments and risk management” to the 
financial statements. 
The Group’s 2013 Annual report and financial statements show the full  
extent of its financial commitments, including debt. The principal risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group is subject are summarised on page 14 to 17. 
The effectiveness of internal control procedures continues to be a high priority  
in the Rio Tinto Group. The board’s statement on internal control is set out in  
the Risk management section. 
Dividend 
The 2013 interim dividend was 83.5 US cents (2012: 72.5 US cents) and the  
final dividend is determined as 108.5 US cents (2012: 94.5 US cents). Dividends 
paid on Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares are equalised on a net cash 
basis; that is, without taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends 
are determined in US dollars. Rio Tinto plc dividends are paid and declared  
in pounds sterling and Rio Tinto Limited dividends are declared and paid in 
Australian dollars, converted at exchange rates on 13 February 2014. Details 
relating to the dividend policy, determination and payment of dividends  
in sterling, Australian dollars and other currencies and on the payment of 
dividends to holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are included  
in the Shareholder information section. 
Capital and liquidity risk management  
The Group’s total capital is defined as equity attributable to owners of  
Rio Tinto plus equity attributable to non-controlling interests and net debt,

Treasury management and financial instruments 
Details of our Treasury management and financial instruments are contained 
within the introductory paragraphs of note 30. 
Foreign exchange 
The following sensitivities give the estimated effect on underlying earnings 
assuming that each exchange rate moved in isolation. The relationship between 
currencies and commodity prices is a complex one and movements in exchange 
rates can cause movements in commodity prices and vice versa. Where the 
functional currency of an operation is that of a country for which production of 
commodities is an important feature of the economy, such as the Australian 
dollar, there is a certain degree of natural protection against cyclical fluctuations, 
in that the currency tends to be weak, reducing costs in US dollar terms when 
commodity prices are low, and vice versa.

The exchange rate sensitivities quoted above include the effect on net operating 
costs of movements in exchange rates but exclude the effect of the revaluation 
of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities. They should therefore be used 
with caution. Further details of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations

within note 30 “Financial instruments and risk management”, part A(b)(i), to the 
financial statements.

used with caution. As noted previously, the relationship between currencies  
and commodity prices is a complex one and changes in exchange rates can 
influence commodity prices and vice versa.  
Further details of our exposure to commodity price fluctuations are  
contained within note 30 “Financial instruments and risk management”

Details of our exposure to credit risks relating to receivables, financial 
instruments and cash deposits, are contained within note 30 “Financial

Disposals and acquisitions 
Information regarding disposals and acquisitions is provided in note 37 
“Purchases and sales of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other 
interests in businesses” to the financial statements. 
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use  
of judgment and/or estimates. These judgments and estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having 
regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the financial statements.  
Information about such judgments and estimation is contained under 
“Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty” in note 1 “Principal accounting policies” on page 119 of the  
financial statements.  
Off balance sheet arrangements and contractual commitments 
The table below presents information in relation to our material off balance 
sheet arrangements, and contractual commitments. Information regarding the 
Group’s pension commitments and funding arrangements is provided in note 45 
“Post retirement benefits” to the financial statements. Information regarding  
the Group’s close-down and restoration obligations is provided in note 26 
“Provisions including post retirement benefits” to the financial statements.  
We expect that these contractual commitments for expenditure, together with 
other expenditure and liquidity requirements will be met from internal cash flow 
and, to the extent necessary, from the existing facilities.

The following sensitivities give the estimated effect on underlying earnings 
assuming that each exchange rate moved in isolation. The relationship between 
currencies and commodity prices is a complex one and movements in exchange 
rates can cause movements in commodity prices and vice versa. Where the 
functional currency of an operation is that of a country for which production of 
commodities is an important feature of the economy, such as the Australian 
dollar, there is a certain degree of natural protection against cyclical fluctuations, 
in that the currency tends to be weak, reducing costs in US dollar terms when 
commodity prices are low, and vice versa.

The exchange rate sensitivities quoted above include the effect on net operating 
costs of movements in exchange rates but exclude the effect of the revaluation 
of foreign currency financial assets and liabilities. They should therefore be used 
with caution. Further details of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  
and currency derivatives, and our approach to currency hedging, are contained 
within note 30 “Financial instruments and risk management”, part A(b)(i), to the 
financial statements.

The sensitivities give the estimated impact on net earnings of changes in  
prices assuming that all other variables remain constant. These should be  
used with caution. As noted previously, the relationship between currencies  
and commodity prices is a complex one and changes in exchange rates can 
influence commodity prices and vice versa.  
Further details of our exposure to commodity price fluctuations are  
contained within note 30 “Financial instruments and risk management”  
to the financial statements. 
Credit risks 
Details of our exposure to credit risks relating to receivables, financial 
instruments and cash deposits, are contained within note 30 “Financial 
instruments and risk management” to the financial statements. 
Disposals and acquisitions 
Information regarding disposals and acquisitions is provided in note 37 
“Purchases and sales of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other 
interests in businesses” to the financial statements. 
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use  
of judgment and/or estimates. These judgments and estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having 
regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the financial statements.  
Information about such judgments and estimation is contained under 
“Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty” in note 1 “Principal accounting policies” on page 119 of the  
financial statements.

The table below presents information in relation to our material off balance 
sheet arrangements, and contractual commitments. Information regarding the 
Group’s pension commitments and funding arrangements is provided in note 45 
“Post retirement benefits” to the financial statements. Information regarding  
the Group’s close-down and restoration obligations is provided in note 26 
“Provisions including post retirement benefits” to the financial statements.  
We expect that these contractual commitments for expenditure, together with

STRATEGIC REPORT 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Rio Tinto takes a unified approach to corporate governance to comply with  
the regulatory obligations associated with its three principal stock exchange 
listings in the UK, Australia and the US. 
Statement of compliance with governance codes and 
standards in 2013 
In compiling this report, the directors have referred to the September  
2012 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), the ASX 
Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations (2nd edition with 2010 amendments) (the ASX Principles), 
and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance Standards 
(the NYSE Standards). 
Throughout 2013, and at the date of this report, the Group applied the 
principles of, and was compliant with the provisions of, the ASX Principles  
and with the Code. 
Rio Tinto plc, as a foreign issuer with American Depositary Shares listed  
on the NYSE, is obliged by the NYSE Standards to disclose any significant ways 
in which its practices of corporate governance differ from the NYSE Standards. 
The Company has reviewed the NYSE Standards and believes that its practices 
are broadly consistent with them, with the following exceptions where the strict 
requirements of the NYSE Standards are not met.  
The NYSE Standards state that companies must have a nominating/corporate 
governance committee composed entirely of independent directors which,  
in addition to identifying individuals qualified to become board members,  
develops and recommends to the board a set of corporate governance 
principles applicable to the company. Rio Tinto has a Nominations Committee, 
information about which is set out on page 63. This committee does not 
develop corporate governance principles for the board’s approval. The board 
itself performs this task. 
Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, the company is required  
to have an audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, 
compensation, retention and oversight of the work of external auditors. While 
the Rio Tinto Audit Committee makes recommendations to the board on these 
matters, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment of the external auditors 
rests with the shareholders. 
A discussion of the Group’s position on audit tenders is set out on page 62  
of this report.  
Further information about the corporate governance framework is  
available in the “Corporate governance” section of Rio Tinto’s website. 
The board 
Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a common board of directors.  
The directors are responsible for the success of the Group and, through the 
independent oversight of management, are accountable to shareholders for  
the performance of the business. 
Role and responsibilities 
The principal role of the board is to set the Group’s strategy and to review 
regularly its strategic direction. In doing this, the board also has responsibility 
for corporate governance. 
A formal schedule of matters reserved by the board has been established  
by the directors. This covers areas such as the Group’s strategy, major 
investments, acquisitions and divestments and oversight of risk. It is available 
on the website. 
Responsibility for day-to-day management of the business is delegated to  
the chief executive and the Executive Committee. In turn, authorities are  
also delegated to individual members of the Executive Committee.  
As part of the annual financial planning process, the board sets annual 
performance targets, which include personal and business performance 
measures, under the Group’s short-term incentive plan (detailed on page 81)  
for the chief executive. These performance targets are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee on behalf of the board. The chief executive 
establishes targets for the Executive Committee. Those objectives are  
cascaded throughout management teams.  
Further details of the performance evaluation of the executive directors and 
other senior executives are discussed in the Implementation Report section  
of the Remuneration Report on page 80. 
Board balance and independence 
Board composition 
The names, skills and experience of each director together with their terms in 
office are shown in the biographical details on pages 53 to 54. Details of 
changes to the board during 2013 and in the year to date are set out in the 
Directors’ report on page 44. 
Director independence 
The tests of independence of a non-executive director vary between the 
jurisdictions where Rio Tinto has listings. The board has adopted a formal  
policy for the determination of the independence of its non-executive directors 
which is available on the Group’s website.  
Among the key criteria of the independence policy are independence from 
management and the absence of any business relationship which could 
materially interfere with the director’s independence of judgment and ability  
to provide a strong, valuable contribution to the board’s deliberations, or which 
could interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Group. 
Where contracts in the ordinary course of business exist between Rio Tinto and 
a company in which a director has declared an interest, these are reviewed for 
materiality both to the Group, and the other party to the contract. “Material”  
is defined in the policy as being where the relationship accounts for more than 
two per cent of either party’s consolidated gross revenue per annum, although 
the test also takes other circumstances into account. The Code includes criteria 
to assess independence where a director has served on the board for more 
than nine years from the date of their first election. 
The chairman was considered independent upon his appointment under the 
Code, and in the board’s view he continues to satisfy the tests for independence 
under the ASX Principles and the NYSE Standards. 
Applying the criteria of the independence policy, the board is satisfied that all  
of its non-executive directors are and remain independent.

Corporate governance continued

riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Lord Kerr, Richard Goodmanson and Vivienne Cox have been non-executive 
directors since 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. Lord Kerr and Richard 
Goodmanson have both agreed to stand for re-election to the boards at the 
annual general meetings in 2014. The board considers that Lord Kerr and 
Richard Goodmanson will provide continuity to the board, given their significant 
knowledge of the business and has confirmed that they both continue to satisfy 
the tests for independence in carrying out their respective roles. Vivienne Cox  
is not seeking re-election at the annual general meetings. 
Executive directors’ other directorships 
Executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies. The Nominations Committee, on behalf of the board, operates  
a procedure under which approval may be given to accept such invitations, 
recognising the benefit to be derived to the individual and to Rio Tinto from 
such appointments.  
Election and re-election 
The directors may appoint additional members to join the board during the 
year. Directors appointed in this way will be subject to election by shareholders 
at the first annual general meetings after their appointment. In subsequent 
years, the directors are expected to submit themselves for re-election at the 
annual general meetings each year. 
Non-executive directors are normally expected to serve at least six years and 
would not normally serve more than nine years. 
Lord Kerr and Richard Goodmanson have been non-executive directors since 
2003 and 2004 respectively, and have therefore already served for ten and  
nine years respectively. For the reasons noted above, both offer themselves  
for re-election in 2014. 
On 5 March 2014, Rio Tinto announced the appointments of Anne Lauvergeon 
and Simon Thompson effective 15 March and 1 April respectively. Both  
will offer themselves for election at the annual general meetings in 2014  
and further details about them are set out in the notices of annual  
general meetings.  
Governance processes 
In 2013, there were nine scheduled board meetings and two board meetings 
convened and held at short notice. Details of the directors’ attendance at  
all of the board and committee meetings held in 2013 are set out on the 
following page. 
The board has regular discussions with senior management on the Group’s 
strategy. These discussions typically include presentations given by senior 
management during the year. The board attends an annual two-day strategy 
meeting with the Executive Committee, which includes broader, detailed review 
sessions on the Group’s strategic direction. The outputs from this event help 
underpin the board’s annual financial planning exercise and provide strategic 
direction and focus to the Executive Committee. 
Directors receive timely, regular and appropriate information to enable them  
to fulfil their duties. They also have direct access to the advice and services  
of the company secretary of Rio Tinto plc and the joint company secretaries  
of Rio Tinto Limited. The directors are also able to obtain independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense. 
The chairman and non-executive directors meet, at the start of each board 
meeting, without the executive directors, to create an opportunity for non-
executive directors to raise any issues in private session. 
In addition, the directors are in regular informal communication with members 
of the Executive Committee and other members of senior management. This 
helps to foster an open and regular exchange of knowledge and experience. 
All new non-executive directors undertake a full, formal and tailored induction 
on joining the board. The board is provided with training and development 
opportunities during the year. The directors are also encouraged to participate 
in site visits to the Group’s operations around the world and to meet with 
employees and, from time to time, shareholders and other key stakeholders. In 
2013, the board visited our copper mine in Utah, US and our iron ore operations 
in the Pilbara, Western Australia. These events are arranged by the company 
secretary on behalf of the chairman, and seek to ensure directors have 
appropriate knowledge of the company and access to its operations and staff.  
Progress against our priorities 
The progress made towards achieving the priorities set by the board during 
2013 are set out on page 8. 
Annual performance evaluation 
An annual exercise is undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the board, 
board committees and individual directors.  
For 2013, the board and committee (audit, nominations, remuneration and 
sustainability) evaluation process was conducted by the company secretary  
of Rio Tinto plc.  
The process involved a review of the findings of the externally-facilitated 2012 
evaluations of the board and its committees and interviews conducted with 
directors seeking their views with regard to progress on the actions arising  
and generally upon the performance of the board and its committees in 2013.  
The findings from the evaluation reports for the board and its committees were 
discussed with the chairman and the chairmen of the committees ahead of  
a full review at the February 2014 meetings of the board and its committees.  
Actions for 2014 were agreed at those meetings. 
The non-executive directors, led by the senior independent director, were 
responsible for the performance evaluation of the chairman. Non-executive 
directors met to give their views and the senior independent director also 
sought the views of the executive directors. The senior independent director 
gave feedback on the chairman’s performance to him in January.  
The chairman continues to be responsible for the assessment of each individual 
director’s performance and contribution.

Governance structure 
The board has established sub-committees which are responsible for audit, 
remuneration, sustainability and nominations issues. In addition, a Chairman’s 
Committee operates under delegated authority between scheduled board 
meetings. These committees support the board in ensuring that high  
standards of corporate governance are maintained across the Group.  
 
 
 
The committees are governed by terms of reference, set and approved by  
the board, which are reviewed annually. The terms of reference of the audit, 
nominations, remuneration and sustainability committees (revised versions  
of which were issued in February 2014) can be viewed in the “Corporate 
governance” section of the website. 
The chief executive is assisted by the key management committees noted

Board committees 
Audit Committee 
Members of the Committee are Ann Godbehere (chairman), Michael Fitzpatrick, 
Paul Tellier and John Varley. Chris Lynch was appointed to the Committee on  
1 June 2012 and stood down upon his appointment as chief financial officer-
designate on 1 March 2013. Lord Kerr stood down from the Committee at the 
conclusion of its meeting on 4 March 2013. John Varley was appointed to the 
Committee on 19 March 2013.  
Key responsibilities 
The objective of the Audit Committee is to assist the board to monitor decisions 
and processes designed to ensure the integrity of financial reporting, sound 
systems of internal control and risk management.  
The Committee’s terms of reference set out its main responsibilities.  
The Committee is responsible for: 
– Financial reporting;  
– Internal control, including internal control over financial reporting; 
– Group Audit & Assurance (including internal audit); 
– External auditors; 
– Risk management system effectiveness; 
– The integrity and compliance programme including the Group’s  
Speak–OUT whistleblowing programme.  
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Committee has full authority to 
investigate all matters that fall within its terms of reference. Accordingly,  
the Committee may: 
– obtain independent professional advice in the satisfaction of its duties  
at the cost of the Group; and 
– have direct access to the resources of the Group as it may reasonably  
require including the external and internal auditors. 
Financial reporting 
During 2013 the Committee considered, among others, the following matters 
which it considered to be significant in relation to the 2013 financial statements: 
– Impairments in the 2012 accounts and continued monitoring of 
management’s determination of cash-generating units, review of impairment 
triggers and consideration of potential impairment charges and reversals 
over the course of the year. 
– Management’s key accounting judgments and policies, and the application  
of these in the accounts, including: 
– the adoption of new and revised accounting standards (including IFRIC 20, 
IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 19R) that became effective in 2013 and required 
prior period restatements; and 
– accounting for the slide at the Bingham Canyon copper mine. 
To date in 2014 the Committee has considered, among others, the  
following matters which it considered to be significant in relation to the 2013 
financial statements: 
– Impairments in the 2013 accounts. 
– Management’s key accounting judgments and policies, and the application  
of these in the accounts, including: 
– reviewing the justifications for exclusion of certain items from underlying 
earnings; 
– reviewing the impact of new standards (including IFRS 12 and IFRS 13) 
which have required additional disclosure in these financial statements; 
– reviewing the Group’s tax exposure and the appropriateness of provisions 
for uncertain tax positions; and 
– reviewing the accounting treatment of the significant divestments 
announced in 2013, including contractual obligations for product sales 
and funding of closure activities which remain with the Group following 
completion of the divestments. 
Key judgments considered 
In preparing the financial statements, a number of subjective judgments  
and estimates are required involving assumptions and consideration of future 
events that are inherently uncertain. The Committee focused its work on 
assessing management’s ongoing judgments and estimates against available 
evidence, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. The 
Committee also considered the external auditors’ views on these matters.  
Of the judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty listed as critical 
accounting policies and estimates in note 1 to the financial statements, the 
following areas received specific focus from the Committee over the year: 
– Impairment review of asset carrying values 
– The Committee focused on the assessment of the carrying value and 
annual impairment reviews of goodwill (Rio Tinto Alcan, Rio Tinto  
Coal Mozambique and Oyu Tolgoi), indefinite lived intangible assets  
(Rio Tinto Alcan) and property, plant & equipment (particularly  
Rio Tinto Alcan, Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique and Oyu Tolgoi) because  
they involve complex judgments about the expected future performance 
of the business.  
– The assumptions on discount rate, long-term pricing, risk factors for 
future growth projects amongst others were considered and challenged. 
– For Rio Tinto Alcan, and in addition to the testing of individual cash 
generating units the Committee considered the combined carrying value 
of the product group and how it had been assessed against external 
market data, including comparables and broker reports. 
– Infrastructure assumptions were a key consideration for the Rio Tinto  
Coal Mozambique impairment testing and the Committee considered  
these closely. 
– For Oyu Tolgoi, the timing of the underground development was an 
important factor in determining impairment, and the Committee reviewed 
and challenged the likely timing in light of the progress of discussions  
with the Government of Mongolia. 
– Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations 
– The Committee focused on the estimates of risk free discount rates in  
light of the ongoing impact of fiscal interventions. It also focused on the 
probability weighting, where appropriate, of the different remediation  
or closure outcomes which could realistically arise when assessing  
the adequacy of the provisioning for these obligations. Both involve 
complex judgments. 
– Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets 
– The Committee focused on the appropriateness of continued recognition 
of deferred tax assets, particularly those related the Mineral Resources 
Rent Tax starting base allowance in Australia and tax losses in France, 
recovery of which are restricted by legislation 
In addition, the Committee critically assessed the future projections of cash  
flow under different future scenarios and compared this to cash balances  
and committed facilities available so the Committee could recommend to the 
board that the adoption by the Group of the going concern basis of preparation 
was appropriate. 
Governance processes 
The Committee met seven times in 2013. The chairman of the board, chief 
financial officer, other senior management and external and internal auditors 
regularly attended its meetings. The Committee carries out its business 
following an agreed annual cycle of meetings and topics for consideration. 
The members of the Committee are independent and free of any relationship 
that would affect their impartiality in carrying out their responsibilities. The 
members meet the independence requirements of the Code, the ASX Principles 
and the NYSE Standards. The Committee meets the composition, operation and 
responsibility requirements of the ASX Principles. 
The Committee is also bound by SEC requirements for audit committees’ 
financial experts and the Code and ASX Principles requirement that at least one 
committee member should have recent and relevant financial qualifications and  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

experience. Ann Godbehere, chairman of the Committee, is considered by the 
board to have recent and relevant financial experience, and financial 
qualifications, and has been designated the Committee’s financial expert.  
All other members of the Committee are, in the opinion of the Committee, 
deemed to be financially literate by virtue of their business experience. 
The Committee applies policies for the pre-approval of permitted services 
provided by the Group’s external auditors PwC. All of the engagements for 
services provided by PwC were either within the pre-approval policies or 
approved by the Committee. The Committee members are satisfied that the 
provision of non-audit services by PwC in accordance with this procedure is 
compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed  
by relevant regulations, including Australian, UK and US legislation. 
The Committee considered reports from PwC and Group Audit & Assurance  
on the activities undertaken in reviewing and auditing the control environment 
in order to assess the quality and effectiveness of the internal control system. 
This included an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
over financial reporting and the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures  
in accordance with sections 404 and 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.  
The external auditors attended all seven Committee meetings during the year. 
In advance of the Committee meetings, the audit partners brief the chairman  
on key matters. Private sessions are routinely held between PwC and the 
Committee without management present to discuss the status of the audit  
and nature of interaction with management. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of PwC for Group 
audit and local statutory audit work. The evaluation, managed by the Group’s 
financial controllers, took the form of a survey comprising a range of questions 
covering objectivity, quality, and efficiency, and was completed by individual  
Rio Tinto business units and members of the Audit Committee. The results of 
this survey and review were assessed by the Committee which concluded that 
PwC continued to provide a high-quality audit and an effective and independent 
challenge to management. The Committee was satisfied with the external audit 
process and that the independence of the external auditors was in no way 
compromised.  
PwC have been the external auditors since the formation of the dual listed 
companies (DLC) structure in 1995, and acted as external auditors to a number  
of the company’s legacy entities prior to the formation of the DLC. Since 2002, 
PwC have followed the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and APB 
Ethical Standards and rotated both the lead UK and Australian audit partners at 
least every five years. This continued refreshing of the team brings new 
perspectives to the audit and promotes healthy debate between auditors and 
management as well as the Committee. The current UK audit engagement 
partner, Richard Hughes, was appointed for the 2011 year-end and therefore 
2015 will be his last year of involvement before transition to a new engagement 
partner. The Australian audit engagement partner, Paul Bendall, was appointed 
for the 2012 year-end and therefore 2016 will be his last year of involvement 
before transition to a new engagement partner. 
The Committee continues to be satisfied both with the quality and effectiveness 
of the external audit process and with PwC’s independence. The Committee 
also continues to monitor the recent developments on audit market reform, 
including proposed mandatory audit firm rotation in Europe and proposed  
audit tendering from the Competition Commission in the UK. The provisional 
agreement that was reached between the European institutions in December 
2013 is likely (when the European legislative processes have been completed, 
and subject to agreement by the UK regulators) to require mandatory rotation 
of audit firms every ten years unless there is a tender process after ten years,  
in which case the audit firm must be replaced after 20 years at the latest.  
The Committee intends to review the position once the transitional 
arrangements under the different regimes have been clarified (which is 
expected to occur later this year) and will determine when it expects to oversee 
an orderly tender process in due course. PwC will thus remain in office and a 
resolution to reappoint them for the 2014 audit will therefore be proposed at 
the annual general meetings in 2014.  
Further information on fees paid to PwC in 2013 for audit and non-audit 
services are set out on page 46 of the Directors’ report.  
The Committee meets privately with the Head of Group Audit & Assurance from 
time to time without management present and the chairman of the Committee 
has regular discussions with him.

Remuneration Committee 
Members of the Committee are John Varley (chairman), Jan du Plessis,  
Michael Fitzpatrick, Richard Goodmanson and Paul Tellier.  
Key responsibilities 
The Remuneration Committee assists the board with fulfilling its oversight 
responsibility to shareholders. In particular, the Committee seeks to spend 
compensation resource fairly and responsibly to ensure that remuneration 
policy and practices are properly linked to corporate and individual performance 
and to the delivery of the Group’s strategy on behalf of our owners. 
The report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 68 to 108 has been 
recommended by the Committee for approval by the board, and was approved 
by the board on 5 March 2014. On page 79 we have included sections dealing 
with the responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee and how it spent its 
time in 2013.  
Governance processes 
The Committee met eight times in 2013. The Committee carries out  
its business following an agreed annual cycle of meetings and topics  
for consideration.  
In addition to the matters noted on page 79, the Committee considered the 
findings from the 2012 external evaluation of the Committee’s performance and 
implemented the recommendations. In early 2014, the Committee considered 
the findings from the 2013 evaluation of the Committee’s performance and 
agreed the actions arising. 
As set out in the Committee chairman’s annual statement on pages 68 to 69,  
we are committed to a continuing dialogue with our owners. 
Chairman’s Committee  
Members of the Committee are Jan du Plessis (chairman), Sam Walsh and  
Chris Lynch.  
Key responsibilities 
The Committee acts on behalf of the board between scheduled board meetings 
either in accordance with authority delegated by the board or as specifically set 
out within its terms of reference. It supports the functioning of the board and 
ensures that the business of the board and its committees is properly planned 
and aligned with management. When mandated by the board, the Chairman’s 
Committee will consider urgent matters between board meetings, and deals 
with the implementation of board decisions on transactions and other corporate 
matters. Other than for the chairman of the board, the Committee performs the 
annual review of non-executive directors’ fees and makes a recommendation  
to the board. 
Nominations Committee 
Members of the Committee comprise Jan du Plessis (chairman) and all  
non-executive directors.  
Key responsibilities 
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the board, for regularly assessing 
the balance of executive and non-executive directors and the composition of 
the board in terms of the diversity and capacity required to oversee the delivery 
of Rio Tinto’s strategy. 
The Committee develops and agrees in advance the desired profiles of  
potential candidates for board membership. It oversees the recruitment  
process and engages external search consultants to manage searches on its 
behalf, including constructing shortlists comprising candidates from diverse 
backgrounds. Following a final review of shortlisted candidates, the Committee 
makes recommendations for new board members to the board for approval.  
On behalf of the board, the Committee also reviews proposals for appointments 
to the Executive Committee and monitors executive succession planning. 
Governance processes 
The Committee meets as required and in 2013, met eight times. The members 
of the Committee are independent in accordance with the independence policy 
adopted by the board. 
The Committee in its proceedings takes account of the Group’s Diversity & 
Inclusion policy and progress in the diversity and inclusion arena, discussed 
further on page 64.  
In 2013, the Committee: 
Continued regular executive and non-executive succession planning reviews. 
Recommended to the board the appointments of Sam Walsh and  
Chris Lynch as chief executive and chief financial officer respectively. 
Considered the findings from the 2012 external evaluation of the 
Committee’s performance and implemented the recommendations. 
Reviewed the mix of skills required for non-executive directors and  
briefed the search firm accordingly. 
Received a leadership assessment and development report on senior 
management talent from Egon Zehnder, whom the Committee consider  
to be independent of the Company, and discussed the same with them. 
Focused on the addition of new, suitably qualified and diverse directors. 
Recommended to the board the appointment of Greg Lilleyman as Group 
executive, Technology & Innovation with effect from 1 January 2014. 
Reviewed the output from a diversity review in order to gauge progress 
against the aspiration for the right mix of skills and diversity on the board. 
In 2014, the Committee will continue its regular executive and non-executive 
succession planning reviews. In early 2014, the Committee considered the 
findings from the 2013 evaluation of the Committee’s performance and agreed 
the actions arising.

Board diversity 
More information about the board’s process for the selection, appointment  
and election of directors is available in the “Corporate governance” section  
of the website. 
The Nominations Committee regularly reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the board.  
In leading a global mining and metals company, the board seeks to continually 
evolve its membership by seeking non-executive directors with diverse and 
complementary skills and perspectives, as well as experience which reflects  
the geographic spread of the Group’s operations. Core skills required for  
non-executive membership of the board are maintained. These skills may, 
depending upon the circumstances, comprise international business, financial 
or public policy experience, strategic acumen or mining or metals industry 
experience. The board aspires to increase other aspects of diversity, including 
gender and nationality, of directors in order to bring a diversity of skills, 
experience and perspective to the governance of the Group. The board 
recognises that the evolution of the mix of skills and diversity is a long-term 
process and weighs the various factors relevant to board balance and diversity 
when vacancies arise. 
In 2012 the board established two objectives relating to diversity of the board: 
The Nominations Committee will undertake a review of board diversity. 
For each director selection and appointment process, the external search 
firm supporting the Nominations Committee will put forward at least one 
credible and suitably experienced female candidate. 
An assessment of board diversity was completed by the Committee in 2012  
and the output from that assessment was reviewed in the context of the 
Committee’s succession deliberations during 2013.  
Diversity and inclusion 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion 
We are a global company and, wherever we operate and across every part  
of our business, we strive to create an inclusive culture in which difference  
is recognised and valued. By bringing together men and women from  
diverse backgrounds and giving each person the opportunity to contribute  
their skills, experience and perspectives, we believe that we are able to  
develop the best solutions to challenges and deliver sustainable value for  
Rio Tinto and its stakeholders. 
What diversity and inclusion means for Rio Tinto 
Embracing workforce diversity – age, gender, race, national or ethnic origin, 
religion, language, political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical ability. 
Valuing diversity of perspective – leveraging the diverse thinking, skills, 
experience and working styles of our employees and other stakeholders. 
Building a flexible organisation – providing opportunities for work 
arrangements that accommodate the diverse needs of individuals at  
different career and life stages. 
Respecting stakeholder diversity – developing strong and sustainable 
relationships with diverse shareholders, communities, employees, 
governments, customers and suppliers. 
How we support diversity and inclusion 
We use the following to drive action and build awareness about diversity  
and inclusion: 
Governance models 
Policies, practices and targets 
Leadership and cultural competence 
Stakeholder relationships 
Education and communication 
We prioritise long and short-term programmes based on need and impact. 
Read a summary of our Diversity and inclusion policy in the “Corporate 
governance” section of our website. 
Our current focus  
Our goal is to have a workforce that is representative of the countries and 
communities in which we operate. Currently, our focus is to improve the 
representation of women and of people from nationalities which are under-
represented in our workforce, and to continue to build an inclusive culture  
in which all talent can thrive. 
Some of the activities and initiatives relating to diversity that we undertook 
during the year are: 
The development of executive-sponsored diversity and inclusion plans  
within the product groups and geographies which align with business goals 
and the Group Diversity and inclusion strategy, the aim being to increase  
the diversity in our workforce at all levels and build a more inclusive culture. 
Progress will be evaluated each year by the Executive Committee and Group 
Diversity Council and began in 2013.  
Embed diversity and inclusion scorecards to accompany the above plans 
with metrics in three areas:  
1. Who we are (demographics) 
2. How we behave (performance and development)  
3. What we stand for (values) 
to be applied across Rio Tinto to help baseline, trend and track progress  
as well as to address areas where we may be underperforming. 
Active involvement with Women in Mining groups, professional women’s 
associations and other targeted recruiting efforts to raise awareness about 
Rio Tinto and to increase the attraction, development and retention of 
talented women wherever we operate. 
Expansion of our diversity champions network group to include additional 
geographies and operations, and the establishment of several new business 
unit diversity councils and committees across Rio Tinto. These are increasing 
leadership engagement, cross-company collaboration, and the sharing and 
replication of best practices.  
The expansion of training programmes aimed at countering unconscious 
bias. These have targeted senior leaders, hiring managers and recruiters to 
help minimise the impact of bias in recruitment and development practices, 
as well as to improve the cross-cultural interactions and relationship-
building needed to globalise our business. 
The continuation of a three-year commitment by the chairman to mentoring 
high-potential female board candidates through the FTSE100 Cross-
company Mentoring Programme.

Other disclosures 
Policies and standards 
Rio Tinto’s commitment to integrity is set out in our global code of business 
conduct: The way we work. This contains principles and standards of conduct 
which reaffirm the Group’s commitment to integrity. It is inspired by our four 
core values: accountability, respect, teamwork and integrity. It is available on 
the website.  
It is supported by Rio Tinto’s extensive framework of policies and standards. 
Core policies are adopted after wide consultation, externally and within  
the Group.  
Once adopted, they are communicated to business units worldwide,  
together with related standards, guidance notes and resources to support 
implementation. Business unit management are required to devote the 
necessary effort to implement and report on these policies and standards. 
Rio Tinto policies and standards include policies on a variety of important 
topics. They apply to all Rio Tinto managed businesses. Where the Group  
does not have operating responsibility for a business, Rio Tinto’s policies and 
standards are communicated to its business partners and they are encouraged 
to adopt similar policies of their own.  
Rio Tinto employees are required to undertake training about the requirements 
of The way we work and other core policies. 
“Whistleblowing” programme 
The board has adopted a confidential and independently operated 
whistleblowing programme called Speak-OUT. This offers an avenue where 
employees, contractors, suppliers and customers of Rio Tinto managed sites 
can report concerns anonymously if they so choose, subject to local law.  
This can include any significant concerns about the business, or behaviour  
of individuals, including suspicion of violations of financial reporting, safety  
or environmental procedures or business integrity issues generally. The 
programme features web submission, a case management tool to better 
manage cases, and a reporting tool to allow for improved analysis of case 
statistics and reporting. Rio Tinto is also looking at ways to increase the positive 
awareness of Speak-OUT. The Audit Committee receives a report annually on 
Speak-OUT activity as does the Sustainability Committee with regard to calls  
to Speak-OUT impacting sustainable development issues. 
Dealing in Rio Tinto securities 
Rio Tinto operates rules which restrict the dealing in Rio Tinto securities  
by directors and employees with access to “inside information”. These rules 
require those people to seek clearance before any proposed dealing and place 
restrictions on when some people can deal.  
Communication with stakeholders 
Rio Tinto recognises the importance of effective timely communication with 
shareholders and the wider investment community. 
The Disclosure Committee is responsible for determining whether information 
relating to Rio Tinto may require disclosure to the markets.  
Rio Tinto makes immediate disclosure (unless an exemption applies allowing  
a delay) to the relevant listing authorities in accordance with their rules of any 
information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on 
its share price. All information released to the markets is posted on the Media 
section of the website. 
In addition to statutory documents, Rio Tinto’s website features information on 
corporate governance, and general investor information. Annual and half year 
results, as well as any major presentations, are webcast and the materials are 
available on the website. Presentation material from investor seminars is also 
made available on the website. 
The annual general meetings present an opportunity to provide a summary 
business presentation, to inform shareholders of recent developments and to 
give them the opportunity to ask questions. Generally, the chairs of all board 
committees will be available to answer questions raised by shareholders and  
all directors are expected to attend where possible. In 2013 all of the directors 
attended the annual general meetings, with the exception of Robert Brown who 
was unable to attend the annual general meeting of Rio Tinto Limited due to his 
attending the annual general meeting of another company. Rio Tinto’s external 
auditors, PwC, attend the annual general meetings and are available to answer 
questions about the conduct of the external audit and the preparation and 
content of the independent auditors’ report. Any questions received and 
answers provided ahead of the annual general meetings are made available to 
shareholders, who also have the opportunity to meet informally with directors 
after the meetings. 
The main channels of communication with the investment community are 
through the chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer, who have 
regular meetings with the Companies’ major shareholders. The senior 
independent director has a specific responsibility to be available to shareholders 
who have concerns, and where contact with the chairman, chief executive or 
chief financial officer has failed to resolve their concerns, or for whom such 
contact is inappropriate. In his capacity as Remuneration Committee chairman, 
the senior independent director meets shareholders to discuss remuneration 
issues as described in his annual statement on pages 68 and 69. 
During 2013, these meetings with the investment community focused  
on the issues of strategy, board succession, corporate governance, executive 
remuneration, and the operational and financial performance of the Group. 
Regular investor seminars provide a two-way communication opportunity  
with investors and analysts, and feedback from such engagement is routinely 
communicated to the board. Surveys of major shareholders’ opinions  
are presented to the board by the Group’s investor relations advisers on  
a regular basis.

Risk management 
Rio Tinto’s overriding objective is to generate attractive, sustainable returns to 
shareholders through a strategy of investing in long-life, low-cost, expandable 
operations in the most attractive industry sectors. The directors recognise  
that creating shareholder return is the reward for taking and accepting risk.  
The risks shareholders face are, to some extent, managed by the Group’s  
diversified portfolio of assets spread across multiple geographies, currencies 
and commodities.  
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect  
Rio Tinto is found on pages 14 to 17. 
Risk policy and standard 
The board recognises that risk is an integral component of the business and 
carefully considers the level of risk it is prepared to tolerate. The Group fosters  
a risk-aware corporate culture in all decision-making, and is committed to 
managing all risk in a proactive and effective manner through competent risk 
management that ensures that risks are managed within agreed thresholds. To 
support this commitment, risk is analysed in order to inform the management 
decisions taken at all levels within the organisation. The principles of the risk 
analysis and management process are set out in the Risk policy and standard 
which is on the website. 
Risk approach 
The Risk policy and standard is supported by an integrated framework of risk 
governance and reporting specifying how the Group organises the handling of 
risk. Together with the policy, the framework provides an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. 
Clear accountability for risk management is defined throughout the Group and 
is a key performance area of line managers.  
To support risk understanding and management at all levels, the Group Risk 
function provides the necessary infrastructure, information collation for the 
senior executive, and co-ordination between other risk-focused functions. 
Group Risk supports the Risk Management Committee in its review of risk. 
Whilst the Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management systems, the responsibility for identifying and 
managing risks rests with the chief executive and all of Rio Tinto’s managers 
and business leaders, who operate within a Group-wide framework that ensures 
that risks are managed within agreed thresholds. 
Internal controls 
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and  
for reviewing annually the effectiveness of the internal control system. This 
includes reviewing financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management procedures and their effectiveness. The directors have completed 
their annual review and assessment for 2013.  
Internal control systems 
Two of the Group’s management committees, the Executive Committee and 
the Disclosure Committee, regularly review reports related to the Group’s 
control framework in order to satisfy the internal control requirements of the 
Code, the ASX Principles, the NYSE Standards and section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act 2002. The Group Audit & Assurance function performs reviews of  
the integrity and effectiveness of control activities and provides regular  
reports to the Audit Committee, Sustainability Committee and other 
management committees. 
Each year, the leaders of the Group’s businesses and functions complete a 
representation letter confirming that adequate internal controls are in place,  
are operating effectively and are designed to capture and evaluate failings and 
weaknesses, if any exist, and that action is taken promptly, as appropriate.  
In 2013, information was reported by management to the Audit Committee  
to enable it to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management  
and internal control systems. In addition, as part of their role, the board and 
its committees routinely monitor the Group’s material business risks. 
Due to the limitations inherent in any risk management system, the process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the material business risks is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, risk and to provide reasonable, but not absolute 
assurance, against material misstatement or loss. Certain risks, for example 
natural disasters, cannot be managed to an acceptable degree using internal 
controls. Such major risks are transferred to third parties in the international 
insurance markets, to the extent considered appropriate. The Group has 
material investments in a number of jointly controlled entities and associates. 
Where Rio Tinto does not have managerial control, it cannot guarantee that 
local management of mining and related assets will comply with Rio Tinto 
standards or objectives.  
Auditors and internal assurance 
External auditors 
As indicated in the report of the Audit Committee on pages 61 and 62, Rio Tinto 
has adopted policies designed to uphold the independence of the Group’s 
external auditors by prohibiting their engagement to provide other accounting 
and other professional services that might compromise their appointment as 
independent auditors. 
The engagement of the external auditors to provide statutory audit services, 
other services pursuant to legislation, taxation services, and certain other 
services is pre-approved. Any engagement of the external auditors to provide 
other permitted services is subject to the specific approval of the Audit 
Committee or its chairman. For other services, because of their knowledge, 
experience and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it can be more efficient or 
necessary to engage the external auditor rather than another party.  
At half year and year end, the chief financial officer and the external auditors 
submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of services that were 
performed during the period. The Audit Committee may impose a financial  
limit on the total value of other permitted services that can be provided.  
Any non-audit service provided by the external auditors, where the expected  
fee exceeds a pre-determined level, must be subject to the Group’s normal  
tender procedures. 
In exceptional circumstances, the chief financial officer is authorised to engage 
the external auditors to provide such services without going to tender, but if the 
fees are expected to exceed certain pre-determined limits then the chairman  
of the Audit Committee must give prior approval of the engagement. 
Further information on audit and non-audit fees of the Group’s external auditors 
is set out in note 39 to the financial statements and in the Directors’ report. 
Group Audit & Assurance 
Group Audit & Assurance is an internal function which provides independent 
and objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems for risk management, internal control and governance together with 
recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the relevant systems and 
processes. The function has adopted international auditing standards set by  
the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).  STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Risk management 
Rio Tinto’s overriding objective is to generate attractive, sustainable returns to 
shareholders through a strategy of investing in long-life, low-cost, expandable 
operations in the most attractive industry sectors. The directors recognise  
that creating shareholder return is the reward for taking and accepting risk.  
The risks shareholders face are, to some extent, managed by the Group’s  
diversified portfolio of assets spread across multiple geographies, currencies 
and commodities.  
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect  
Rio Tinto is found on pages 14 to 17. 
Risk policy and standard 
The board recognises that risk is an integral component of the business and 
carefully considers the level of risk it is prepared to tolerate. The Group fosters  
a risk-aware corporate culture in all decision-making, and is committed to 
managing all risk in a proactive and effective manner through competent risk 
management that ensures that risks are managed within agreed thresholds. To 
support this commitment, risk is analysed in order to inform the management 
decisions taken at all levels within the organisation. The principles of the risk 
analysis and management process are set out in the Risk policy and standard 
which is on the website. 
Risk approach 
The Risk policy and standard is supported by an integrated framework of risk 
governance and reporting specifying how the Group organises the handling of 
risk. Together with the policy, the framework provides an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. 
Clear accountability for risk management is defined throughout the Group and 
is a key performance area of line managers.  
To support risk understanding and management at all levels, the Group Risk 
function provides the necessary infrastructure, information collation for the 
senior executive, and co-ordination between other risk-focused functions. 
Group Risk supports the Risk Management Committee in its review of risk. 
Whilst the Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management systems, the responsibility for identifying and 
managing risks rests with the chief executive and all of Rio Tinto’s managers 
and business leaders, who operate within a Group-wide framework that ensures 
that risks are managed within agreed thresholds. 
Internal controls 
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and  
for reviewing annually the effectiveness of the internal control system. This 
includes reviewing financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management procedures and their effectiveness. The directors have completed 
their annual review and assessment for 2013.  
Internal control systems 
Two of the Group’s management committees, the Executive Committee and 
the Disclosure Committee, regularly review reports related to the Group’s 
control framework in order to satisfy the internal control requirements of the 
Code, the ASX Principles, the NYSE Standards and section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act 2002. The Group Audit & Assurance function performs reviews of  
the integrity and effectiveness of control activities and provides regular  
reports to the Audit Committee, Sustainability Committee and other 
management committees. 
Each year, the leaders of the Group’s businesses and functions complete a 
representation letter confirming that adequate internal controls are in place,  
are operating effectively and are designed to capture and evaluate failings and 
weaknesses, if any exist, and that action is taken promptly, as appropriate.  
In 2013, information was reported by management to the Audit Committee  
to enable it to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management  
and internal control systems. In addition, as part of their role, the board and 
its committees routinely monitor the Group’s material business risks. 
Due to the limitations inherent in any risk management system, the process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the material business risks is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, risk and to provide reasonable, but not absolute 
assurance, against material misstatement or loss. Certain risks, for example 
natural disasters, cannot be managed to an acceptable degree using internal 
controls. Such major risks are transferred to third parties in the international 
insurance markets, to the extent considered appropriate. The Group has 
material investments in a number of jointly controlled entities and associates. 
Where Rio Tinto does not have managerial control, it cannot guarantee that 
local management of mining and related assets will comply with Rio Tinto 
standards or objectives.  
Auditors and internal assurance 
External auditors 
As indicated in the report of the Audit Committee on pages 61 and 62, Rio Tinto 
has adopted policies designed to uphold the independence of the Group’s 
external auditors by prohibiting their engagement to provide other accounting 
and other professional services that might compromise their appointment as 
independent auditors. 
The engagement of the external auditors to provide statutory audit services, 
other services pursuant to legislation, taxation services, and certain other 
services is pre-approved. Any engagement of the external auditors to provide 
other permitted services is subject to the specific approval of the Audit 
Committee or its chairman. For other services, because of their knowledge, 
experience and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it can be more efficient or 
necessary to engage the external auditor rather than another party.  
At half year and year end, the chief financial officer and the external auditors 
submit to the Audit Committee a schedule of the types of services that were 
performed during the period. The Audit Committee may impose a financial  
limit on the total value of other permitted services that can be provided.  
Any non-audit service provided by the external auditors, where the expected  
fee exceeds a pre-determined level, must be subject to the Group’s normal  
tender procedures. 
In exceptional circumstances, the chief financial officer is authorised to engage 
the external auditors to provide such services without going to tender, but if the 
fees are expected to exceed certain pre-determined limits then the chairman  
of the Audit Committee must give prior approval of the engagement. 
Further information on audit and non-audit fees of the Group’s external auditors 
is set out in note 39 to the financial statements and in the Directors’ report. 
Group Audit & Assurance 
Group Audit & Assurance is an internal function which provides independent 
and objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems for risk management, internal control and governance together with 
recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the relevant systems and 
processes. The function has adopted international auditing standards set by  
the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

STRATEGIC REPORT 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
The function operates independently of management, under a mandate 
approved by the Audit Committee, and has full access to all functions, records, 
property and personnel of the Group. The head of Group Audit & Assurance 
administratively reports to the chief financial officer and has direct 
communication lines with the chairs of both the Audit Committee and 
Sustainability Committee and regularly attends their meetings, providing  
each Committee with information relevant to their specific terms of reference. 
A risk-based approach is used to focus assurance activities on high-risk areas 
and audit plans are presented annually to the Audit Committee and 
Sustainability Committee for approval. 
In respect of its internal audit function, Rio Tinto utilises the services of external 
service providers. The Audit Committee has a policy which addresses conflicts 
of interest in relation to engagements of the service provider that are requested 
by management. The policy complies with the IIA’s standards on independence. 
Certain services are pre-approved under the policy as they would not be in 
conflict with the internal auditor’s role. There is a list of prohibited services 
which may not be undertaken without approval of the head of Group Audit & 
Assurance, and guidance on the consideration of services which may give rise 
to a conflict of interest. 
Financial reporting 
Financial statements 
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial 
period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group as at 
the end of the financial period, and the profit or loss and cash flows for that 
period. This includes preparing financial statements in accordance with UK 
company law which give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs, and preparing a Remuneration report which includes the information 
required by Regulation 11, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the 
Australian Corporations Act 2001. 
In addition, the Code requires that the board provides a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects in  
its external reporting. The directors were responsible for the preparation  
and approval of the Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013.  
They consider the Annual report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records,  
in accordance with UK and Australian legislation. They have a general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are  
in place to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from current and future legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of such 
developments and, accordingly, the external auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes, should any be made, to the financial statements after they are 
made available on the website. 
The directors, senior executives, senior financial managers and other members 
of staff who are required to exercise judgment in the course of the preparation 
of the financial statements are required to conduct themselves with integrity 
and honesty and in accordance with the ethical standards of their profession 
and the business. 
The directors consider that the 2013 Annual report presents a true and fair  
view and has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards, using the most appropriate accounting policies for Rio Tinto’s 
business, and supported by reasonable judgments and estimates. The 
accounting policies have been consistently applied. The directors have received 
a written statement from the chief executive and the chief financial officer to 
this effect. In accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code  
and the ASX Principles Recommendation 7.3, this written statement confirms 
that the declarations in the statement are founded on a sound system of risk 
management and internal controls, and that the system is operating effectively 
in all material respects in relation to financial reporting risks. 
Disclosure controls and procedures 
The Group maintains disclosure controls and procedures as such term is 
defined in US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Management, with the participation 
of the chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness 
of the design and operation of the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures 
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered  
by this report and has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 
The management of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
The Companies’ internal control over financial reporting is a process designed 
under the supervision of their common chief executive and chief financial officer 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation and fair presentation of the Group’s published financial 
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (EU IFRS). 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
cannot provide absolute assurance, and may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements whether caused by error or fraud, if any, within each of  
Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. 
The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and 
procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; 
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary  
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and  
that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of each of the Companies; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group’s assets that could 
have a material effect on our financial statements. 
Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2013, based on the Internal Control 
– Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) issued in 1992, and concluded that it  
was effective. 
There were no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting that 
occurred during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably 
likely to materially affect, the internal controls over financial reporting of each  
of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.

Remuneration Report: Annual statement by the Remuneration 
Committee chairman 
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce our 2013 directors’ 
remuneration report (the Remuneration Report), for which we seek your 
support at our annual general meetings (AGMs), in London in April, and in 
Melbourne in May. 
The Remuneration Report is designed to provide you with the necessary 
information to demonstrate the link between our Group’s strategy, its 
performance, and the remuneration outcomes for our executives, particularly 
the executive directors.  
With a view to sustaining returns to shareholders over time, Rio Tinto takes a 
long-term approach to its activities, and this means concentrating on 
developing long-life, low-cost, expandable operations that are capable of 
providing competitive returns throughout business cycles. Our executives’ 
performance objectives are set accordingly. 
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legislation and corporate governance guidance in the UK and Australia. 
Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of “key management 
personnel”, being those persons having authority and responsibility for 
planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. The key 
management personnel are, in addition to the directors, the non-director 
members of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises  
the executive directors, product group chief executive officers and Group 
executives. Throughout this Remuneration Report, the members of the 
Executive Committee are collectively referred to as “executives”. They are  
listed on pages 53 and 56, which also shows the positions held during the  
year and dates of appointment.  
Shareholders will be aware that we have to comply with UK and Australian 
legislation in the remuneration arena and that the rules are different. We have 
structured the voting arrangements such that all shareholders vote on all four 
resolutions that we are putting to our AGMs.  
This Remuneration Report is divided into two parts; the statement of 
remuneration policy which summarises our policies and practices in the 
compensation arena (the Remuneration Policy); and the annual report on 
remuneration which shows how the Remuneration Policy has been applied 
(the Implementation Report). 
In October 2013, the UK government introduced new legislation that gives 
shareholders a binding vote on a company’s directors’ remuneration policy  
and requires companies to communicate ever more clearly on how their 
policies are being implemented. I have described below the structure of the 
voting arrangements. As you will see in the pages that follow, an increased 
degree of disclosure and transparency has resulted from our adoption of this 
new legislation. We hope that shareholders globally will benefit from our 
enhanced reporting under the new UK legislation. 
The Remuneration Policy is subject to a binding vote at our 2014 AGMs for  
UK law purposes. The Implementation Report (including this statement) is 
subject to an advisory vote for UK law purposes. As in previous years, the 
Remuneration Report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 
AGMs for Australian law purposes. 
For the purposes of the new UK regulations on remuneration reporting,  
the Remuneration Policy will, if the resolution is passed, become effective  
in respect of payments to directors from the date of the second of our AGMs.  
In the absence of circumstances which may necessitate a change to the 
Remuneration Policy, it is our intention that it will next be put before 
shareholders at our AGMs in 2017.  
Although, as a matter of UK law, the Remuneration Policy, once approved  
by shareholders, will only apply to the remuneration of our directors, it is the 
Committee’s intention that the broad policy principles will continue to inform 
the way in which our non-director key management personnel on the Executive 
Committee are remunerated. 
 
The law in Australia governs the benefits which can be given to the holders  
of certain offices when they leave the employment of the Group. The law is 
complex. It affects our ability to apply the policies that are described in detail in 
this report, and it also constrains our ability to treat our employees consistently. 
So, as many other Australian companies have done, we are seeking approval of 
a termination benefits resolution. I emphasise that if the resolution is passed we 
intend no change to our remuneration policies or practices, and in particular we 
intend no increase in the amounts we pay on termination. 
Last year our Remuneration Report received a vote in favour of 97 per cent at  
the AGMs. Whilst the narrative of the Remuneration Policy has been updated  
to reflect the new regulations introduced for UK incorporated and listed 
companies, the substance of the policy remains unchanged from the one which 
received endorsement last year and which was applied in 2012 and 2013.  
The Remuneration Policy describes among other things: our executive 
remuneration structure; the details of the discretions available to the 
Committee; our approach to remuneration on recruitment; the details  
of executives’ service contracts and our treatment of leavers.  
Remuneration for executives comprises fixed compensation in the form  
of base salary, participation in a pension plan, superannuation fund and/or  
a cash allowance to contribute to a fund, the receipt of certain benefits, and 
performance-related remuneration, all as described in the Remuneration Policy.  
The majority of the remuneration will normally be performance-related, and  
is provided in the form of variable short and long-term incentives. 
In relation to the short-term incentive plan (STIP), the Committee each year 
sets performance criteria relative to three benchmarks: threshold, target and 
outstanding. Target performance is intended to be stretching, and is typically 
equivalent to budget for the year. 
Our new long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders  
at the 2013 AGMs. The views expressed by our owners during our extensive 
consultations in 2012 were instrumental in the design of the LTIP. The 
Committee intends to keep the Group’s long-term incentive arrangements 
under review, taking into account, among other things, the views of our owners. 
This review will include the percentage of an award under the new Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) that vests for threshold performance, recognising that this is 
an important issue for some owners with whom we consulted.  
I want to describe to you our policy relating to the disclosure of measures, 
weightings and targets. In relation to the LTIP, these will all be disclosed in 
advance, at the beginning of each five-year performance period. In relation  
to the STIP, we will, when it comes to disclosure, distinguish between safety, 
financial and individual goals. In the area of safety goals, we will disclose the 
measures, weightings and targets at the beginning of each year. In the area  
of financial and individual goals, we will, at the beginning of each year,  
disclose the measures and weightings only, because we regard the targets as 
commercially sensitive. However, we intend to disclose targets and outcomes 
retrospectively. In the rare instances where this may not be prudent on grounds 
of commercial sensitivity, I will seek to explain why and give an indication of 
when they will be disclosed. The measures, targets and performance against 
them for 2013 are disclosed in the Implementation Report.  
The chart on page 91 demonstrates the usual timeframe for the delivery of  
the components of remuneration, using 2013 as an example. This emphasises 
the long-term nature of our remuneration arrangements. 
You will see in the Remuneration Report several mechanisms that are  
intended to create alignment of interest between shareholders and executives. 
We have, for our executives, a mandatory conversion of 50 per cent of any 
annual short-term bonus payment into shares, with vesting deferred for three 
years. The performance measures under our long-term remuneration plans  
are structured to support and incentivise the creation of long-term shareholder 
value. In addition, we have reserved to the Committee such discretions as 
enable it, should circumstances warrant, to safeguard against the return  STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

experience of shareholders and the re ward experience of executives being 
materially misaligned. We want the remuneration outcomes properly to  
reflect the Group’s overall performance. We have also increased share 
ownership requirements for executives and these are described in the 
Implementation Report. 
There are many examples in the Remune ration Policy and practice of how  
our dialogue with shareholders has influenced the Committee’s decisions.  
We added, in 2013, a new performance measure to our PSP, the relative  
EBIT margin improvement measure, because many of our owners had 
expressed a wish that our PSP should incorporate some diversification beyond 
total shareholder return. We extended the performance period of the PSP  
from four to five years and have materi ally reduced the pay-out for threshold 
performance. We have ceased using share options as a mechanism for long-
term reward. We adjusted our safety measures in our STIP targets to reflect lost 
time injuries and all injury frequency ra tes. As you will see below, our decisions 
relating to base pay changes for exec utive directors and executives are now 
broadly guided by pay changes fo r the wider employee population.  
2013 performance and remuneration 
In terms of STIP for 2013, the Committee determined that the Group’s earnings 
and cash flow targets set by the board ha d been met. This is reflected in the 
financial component of the STIP awards at Group and product group level.  
However, disappointingly, the Group neither met the all injury frequency targets 
set for the year, nor the threshold level of performance set for lost time injury 
frequency rates. This has led to low leve ls of payment of the safety component 
of the award for most executives. Further reductions have also been applied as 
required for executives with portfolios where a fatality has occurred.  
Discretionary downward adjustments of between ten per cent and 40 per cent 
of the STIP award have been applied to the chief executive, the current and 
former chief financial officers, the former Group executive Technology & 
Innovation and the chief executive Aluminium for the project cost overrun in 
relation to the Kitimat modernisation project.  
The net effect of these outcomes, also taking into account the achievement  
of individual objectives, is that STIP awards for Executive Committee members 
have been made in a range from below target to above target levels. 
The Committee considered the Group’s ov erall performance in the context  
of the LTIP awards that were due to ve st at the end of 2013, namely the 2010 
award under the PSP, which had an indicative vesting of 75 per cent of face 
value, and the 2011 grant under the Share Option Plan, which has an indicative 
vesting of 100 per cent of face value. The Committee concluded that the 
vesting of awards based upon the ac hievement of the TSR measures set by 
shareholders was justified.  
Further details are provided in the Implementation Report. 
2014 decisions 
The Committee has reviewed the base salary levels for executives and, for  
the executive directors and the majori ty of the Executive Committee, made 
adjustments in line with the base sa lary budgets applying to the broader 
employee population.  
In one case, namely the chief executive, Copper, a further adjustment was  
made, taking into account individual performance and a base salary  
significantly below internal and external peers.  
The quantum of LTIP awards to be gr anted to executives in March 2014  
is broadly similar to those awards made in 2013.  
Safety, cost reduction, capital expenditure and cash flow management will 
continue to feature prominently in the individual objectives for executives  
in 2014. 
Further details are provided in the Implementation Report. 
Governance and owners’ views 
We know that there will never be pe rfect consensus among our owners  
about remuneration policy, and therefore that ultimately the Committee must 
make judgments based on its best as sessment of supporting value creation. 
However, it has been and will continue to be our intention to be alert to evolving 
best practice and to the views and guidance given to us in the conversations we  
have with you. 
We continue to ensure that the Company meets regulatory and legislative 
remuneration requirements specified by Australian and UK regulation and, as 
part of this, we held extensive meeting s with shareholders and proxy advisory 
bodies in Australia and the UK during 2012 to describe and explain our 
remuneration policies and practices in the context of the overall Group strategy.  
In preparing the Remuneration Report we have been informed by the directors’ 
remuneration reporting guidance issued jointly by GC100, the Association of 
General Counsel and Company Secretaries of the FTSE 100 and Investor Group 
on 12 September 2013, as amended.  
We are committed to a continuing dialogue with our owners. 
I am very conscious of the fact that this Remuneration Report runs to  
40 pages, 6 pages longer than last year given the impact of the new UK law 
requirements. We try to balance the need for a simple narrative of the year’s 
remuneration events with the appetite of many of our stakeholders for more 
detail. Please tell us how you think we might improve it. 
Yours sincerely,

Remuneration Report: Annual statement by the Remuneration 
Committee chairman 
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce our 2013 directors’ 
remuneration report (the Remuneration Report), for which we seek your 
support at our annual general meetings (AGMs), in London in April, and in 
Melbourne in May. 
The Remuneration Report is designed to provide you with the necessary 
information to demonstrate the link between our Group’s strategy, its 
performance, and the remuneration outcomes for our executives, particularly 
the executive directors.  
With a view to sustaining returns to shareholders over time, Rio Tinto takes a 
long-term approach to its activities, and this means concentrating on 
developing long-life, low-cost, expandable operations that are capable of 
providing competitive returns throughout business cycles. Our executives’ 
performance objectives are set accordingly. 
The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legislation and corporate governance guidance in the UK and Australia. 
Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of “key management 
personnel”, being those persons having authority and responsibility for 
planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. The key 
management personnel are, in addition to the directors, the non-director 
members of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises  
the executive directors, product group chief executive officers and Group 
executives. Throughout this Remuneration Report, the members of the 
Executive Committee are collectively referred to as “executives”. They are  
listed on pages 53 and 56, which also shows the positions held during the  
year and dates of appointment.  
Shareholders will be aware that we have to comply with UK and Australian 
legislation in the remuneration arena and that the rules are different. We have 
structured the voting arrangements such that all shareholders vote on all four 
resolutions that we are putting to our AGMs.  
This Remuneration Report is divided into two parts; the statement of 
remuneration policy which summarises our policies and practices in the 
compensation arena (the Remuneration Policy); and the annual report on 
remuneration which shows how the Remuneration Policy has been applied 
(the Implementation Report). 
In October 2013, the UK government introduced new legislation that gives 
shareholders a binding vote on a company’s directors’ remuneration policy  
and requires companies to communicate ever more clearly on how their 
policies are being implemented. I have described below the structure of the 
voting arrangements. As you will see in the pages that follow, an increased 
degree of disclosure and transparency has resulted from our adoption of this 
new legislation. We hope that shareholders globally will benefit from our 
enhanced reporting under the new UK legislation. 
The Remuneration Policy is subject to a binding vote at our 2014 AGMs for  
UK law purposes. The Implementation Report (including this statement) is 
subject to an advisory vote for UK law purposes. As in previous years, the 
Remuneration Report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 
AGMs for Australian law purposes. 
For the purposes of the new UK regulations on remuneration reporting,  
the Remuneration Policy will, if the resolution is passed, become effective  
in respect of payments to directors from the date of the second of our AGMs.  
In the absence of circumstances which may necessitate a change to the 
Remuneration Policy, it is our intention that it will next be put before 
shareholders at our AGMs in 2017.  
Although, as a matter of UK law, the Remuneration Policy, once approved  
by shareholders, will only apply to the remuneration of our directors, it is the 
Committee’s intention that the broad policy principles will continue to inform 
the way in which our non-director key management personnel on the Executive 
Committee are remunerated. 
 
The law in Australia governs the benefits which can be given to the holders  
of certain offices when they leave the employment of the Group. The law is 
complex. It affects our ability to apply the policies that are described in detail in 
this report, and it also constrains our ability to treat our employees consistently. 
So, as many other Australian companies have done, we are seeking approval of 
a termination benefits resolution. I emphasise that if the resolution is passed we 
intend no change to our remuneration policies or practices, and in particular we 
intend no increase in the amounts we pay on termination. 
Last year our Remuneration Report received a vote in favour of 97 per cent at  
the AGMs. Whilst the narrative of the Remuneration Policy has been updated  
to reflect the new regulations introduced for UK incorporated and listed 
companies, the substance of the policy remains unchanged from the one which 
received endorsement last year and which was applied in 2012 and 2013.  
The Remuneration Policy describes among other things: our executive 
remuneration structure; the details of the discretions available to the 
Committee; our approach to remuneration on recruitment; the details  
of executives’ service contracts and our treatment of leavers.  
Remuneration for executives comprises fixed compensation in the form  
of base salary, participation in a pension plan, superannuation fund and/or  
a cash allowance to contribute to a fund, the receipt of certain benefits, and 
performance-related remuneration, all as described in the Remuneration Policy.  
The majority of the remuneration will normally be performance-related, and  
is provided in the form of variable short and long-term incentives. 
In relation to the short-term incentive plan (STIP), the Committee each year 
sets performance criteria relative to three benchmarks: threshold, target and 
outstanding. Target performance is intended to be stretching, and is typically 
equivalent to budget for the year. 
Our new long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders  
at the 2013 AGMs. The views expressed by our owners during our extensive 
consultations in 2012 were instrumental in the design of the LTIP. The 
Committee intends to keep the Group’s long-term incentive arrangements 
under review, taking into account, among other things, the views of our owners. 
This review will include the percentage of an award under the new Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) that vests for threshold performance, recognising that this is 
an important issue for some owners with whom we consulted.  
I want to describe to you our policy relating to the disclosure of measures, 
weightings and targets. In relation to the LTIP, these will all be disclosed in 
advance, at the beginning of each five-year performance period. In relation  
to the STIP, we will, when it comes to disclosure, distinguish between safety, 
financial and individual goals. In the area of safety goals, we will disclose the 
measures, weightings and targets at the beginning of each year. In the area  
of financial and individual goals, we will, at the beginning of each year,  
disclose the measures and weightings only, because we regard the targets as 
commercially sensitive. However, we intend to disclose targets and outcomes 
retrospectively. In the rare instances where this may not be prudent on grounds 
of commercial sensitivity, I will seek to explain why and give an indication of 
when they will be disclosed. The measures, targets and performance against 
them for 2013 are disclosed in the Implementation Report.  
The chart on page 91 demonstrates the usual timeframe for the delivery of  
the components of remuneration, using 2013 as an example. This emphasises 
the long-term nature of our remuneration arrangements. 
You will see in the Remuneration Report several mechanisms that are  
intended to create alignment of interest between shareholders and executives. 
We have, for our executives, a mandatory conversion of 50 per cent of any 
annual short-term bonus payment into shares, with vesting deferred for three 
years. The performance measures under our long-term remuneration plans  
are structured to support and incentivise the creation of long-term shareholder 
value. In addition, we have reserved to the Committee such discretions as 
enable it, should circumstances warrant, to safeguard against the return  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Remuneration Report: Remuneration Policy 
 
Remuneration Policy introduction 
As foreshadowed in our Remuneration Report last year, the UK Parliament 
approved new legislation setting out the requirements for the reporting of,  
and voting on, directors’ remuneration by listed companies. The regulations 
apply from October 2013, and Rio Tinto is required to comply with them in  
this Remuneration Report.  
The regulations require the board to present to shareholders a policy for the 
remuneration of its directors that is subject to a binding vote for the first time  
at the 2014 AGMs and at least every three years thereafter.  
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGMs, the Remuneration Policy 
will, for the purposes of the new UK regulations, become effective in respect  
of payments to directors from the date of our Australian AGM.  
This Remuneration Policy applies specifically to our executive and non-
executive directors and the chairman. It also explains, in conformance with 
Australian law, the broad policy principles which generally apply to the  
non-director members of the Executive Committee. The policy applying  
to our chairman and non-executive directors is set out at the end of the 
Remuneration Policy on page 78.  
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legislation and corporate governance guidance in the UK and Australia. 
Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of “key management 
personnel”, being those persons having authority and responsibility for 
planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. The key 
management personnel are, in addition to the directors, the non-director 
members of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises  
the executive directors, product group chief executive officers and Group 
executives. Throughout this Remuneration Report, the members of the 
Executive Committee are collectively referred to as “executives”. They are  
listed on page 53 and 56, which also shows the positions held during the year 
and dates of appointment.  
Shareholders should note that this Remuneration Policy is binding only in  
so far as it relates to directors.  
Our remuneration policies, principles and practices 
Our first objective is to spend remuneration resource wisely in pursuit of  
the implementation of the Group’s strategy. We want our pay policies to be 
regarded as fair by shareholders and employees alike. Although we have 
appropriate remuneration structures, the Committee retains considerable 
discretions, enabling it, if it thinks fit, to override inappropriate mechanistic 
outcomes, but always within the confines of the Remuneration Policy.  
Rio Tinto operates in global and local markets where it competes for a limited 
pool of talented executives. High-quality people, who are capable of achieving 
stretching performance targets, are essential to generating superior returns for 
the Group. Our compensation strategies aim to provide this support by enabling 
the Group to attract and retain people whose contribution will increase 
shareholder value over time.  
We aim to engage our people over the long term by fostering diversity,  
providing challenging work and development opportunities, and encouraging 
strong delivery by good performance. This people strategy is underpinned  
by our values of respect, integrity, accountability and teamwork and our 
commitment to provide sustainable growth and development for both  
Rio Tinto and our employees. 
Our policy is based on the principle of aligning remuneration outcomes with  
the successful delivery of strategy. The remuneration strategy and the policies 
which support it, together with a description of how we believe they will help  
Rio Tinto achieve its vision, are set out below and in the executive remuneration 
structure table on pages 71 to 73. Complementary remuneration structures are 
designed for other employees, drawing on these strategies and policies.  
Competitive, performance-related remuneration 
We aim to provide competitive rewards that attract, retain and motivate 
executives of the high calibre required to lead the Group while ensuring rewards 
remain appropriate and proportionate, both when compared to market practice 
and to remuneration arrangements for other employees in the Group. 
– The majority of remuneration is linked to demanding performance targets 
over both the short and long term to ensure that executive rewards are 
directed at delivering good performance for shareholders. 
– For the purposes of assessing the appropriate level of executive 
remuneration, the Committee refers to the FTSE30 (excluding financial 
services companies) as the initial comparator group. The FTSE30 is 
considered the most relevant comparator group as it comprises  
organisations broadly comparable to the Group in terms of global reach, 
revenue, market capitalisation and complexity. References are also made  
to other relevant supplementary comparator groups, including a cross-
section of comparable international industrial organisations and other 
international mining companies.  
– Typically we aim to position base salaries at the median of these comparator 
groups, while our incentive plans are designed with the potential to deliver 
total remuneration outcomes across the full market range according to 
business and individual performance. 
– Benchmarking is undertaken periodically but not annually, and our intention 
is to apply judgment in evaluating market data. We will take salary increases 
in the broader employee population into account in determining any change 
to the base pay of executives. 
– We regularly consult with shareholders on the design of our policies  
and programmes, most recently on the subjects of the safety measure 
component of the STIP, the ceasing of the use of share options as a 
mechanism for long-term reward and in the performance conditions and  
the performance period for our new PSP.  
– Employee share plans provide the opportunity for employees to participate  
in the voting on executive remuneration. Employees who are shareholders – 
20 per cent of the workforce – are able to vote on the Remuneration Report. 
Employees have not been consulted on the Remuneration Policy but are free 
to ask any questions they wish and to offer any opinions they have through 
our normal employee communications channels.  
Safety 
We have a strong focus on safety in the STIP targets. 
– As an organisation, we strive for superior long-term shareholder value 
creation in a healthy, safe and environmentally appropriate way. These  
are important elements of our licence to operate. 
– Safety key performance indicators determine a significant portion of the  
STIP for executives. 
– Any fatality will have a material impact on the STIP score for the relevant 
executives. Further details on the approach to fatalities are provided on  
page 91. 
Long term focus 
Consistent with our strategy of investing in and operating long-life, low-cost, 
expandable mines and businesses, we seek to provide incentive plans that focus  
on longer-term performance. 
– Our incentive plans are designed to promote and reward decision-making 
with a positive long-term impact while avoiding excessive risk. 
– Fifty per cent of the STIP for executives is deferred into shares which vest 
after three years, through the Bonus Deferral Plan (BDP). 
– The performance-based options and shares awarded prior to 2013 have  
a three and four-year time horizon, respectively. The time horizon for 
performance shares awarded under the PSP from 2013 has moved out  
to five years. As a transitional measure, awards granted in 2013 will 
potentially vest 50 per cent after four years and 50 per cent after five years.

creation in a healthy, safe and environmentally appropriate way. These

– Options are no longer granted but existing options which vest may be 
exercised up to ten years after their grant. 
– The Committee intends to keep the Group’s long-term incentive 
arrangements under review.  
Shareholder alignment 
Our share ownership policy requires executives to build up and maintain  
a meaningful shareholding (as described on page 80). We reward executives  
for delivering shareholder value by using relative TSR as one of the measures 
for our LTIP. 
– For awards granted from 2013 under the PSP, a new relative EBIT margin 
improvement measure complements the relative TSR measures and 
incentivises executives to deliver long-term shareholder value while 
maximising operational performance in the medium term. This comprises 
one-third of the total value opportunity under the PSP awards. 
– The reward opportunity under the remaining portion of the PSP awards  
will be delivered based on relative TSR performance against both the HSBC 
Global Mining Index and the broader market of large global companies as 
measured through the Morgan Stanley Capital World Index (MSCI). 
– The choice of both the HSBC Global Mining Index and MSCI reflects the  
fact that Rio Tinto competes in a global market for investors as well as within 
the mining sector and is consistent with rewarding executives for providing 
stable returns over the long-term relative to the broader market and the 
mining sector. 
Risk management 
The Committee has authority under the “malus” provisions of the PSP to  
reduce or cancel awards made from 2013 in the event of gross misconduct 
which may have a material effect on the value or reputation of the Group,  
a materially adverse error in the Group’s or a product group’s financial 
statements, exceptional events that have a materially detrimental impact  
on the value of any Group company, or for any other reason that the  
Committee decides in a particular case.  
The Committee also has authority under the “claw back” provisions of the  
PSP to recover the value of any awards made from 2013 in the event of 
deliberate misconduct by a participant that may have a material impact on  
the value or reputation of a Rio Tinto Group company or for any other reason 
that the directors decide in a particular case.  
The Committee reserves rights to exercise discretions more generally  
as described on page 75. 
Executive remuneration structure – policy table 
The Committee seeks to achieve a remuneration mix which best reflects the 
long-term nature of the business. The total remuneration package is therefore 
designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
components, with an emphasis on long-term variable pay. The remuneration 
structure for executives including the relationship between each element of 
remuneration and Group performance is summarised below. Further details on 
the key performance indicators used to assess Group performance are provided 
on pages 10 and 11. Shareholders should note that the following remuneration 
structure is binding only in so far as it relates to directors. 
Any commitment made before this Remuneration Policy takes effect or before 
an executive became or becomes a director will be honoured even if it is not 
consistent with this Remuneration Policy or any subsequent policy.  
 
Remuneration arrangements – Fixed 
Link to Group performance  
and strategy 
Base salary – Base salary provides the main fixed element of the remuneration package. 
– Base salaries are reviewed annually, with a maximum increase of nine per cent, or inflation if higher,  
per annum. An increase may be higher than this for executives who are not directors in the 
circumstances described below. 
– Any increase is generally aligned with the average base salary increases applying to the broader 
employee population unless there were significant changes to an individual’s role and/or 
responsibilities during the year. Any increases are determined with reference to underlying Group and 
individual performance, global economic conditions, role responsibilities, an assessment against 
relevant comparator groups and internal relativities.  
– An increase above the maximum noted above for executives who are not directors may be made  
in the event of internal promotion or increase in responsibility or where the executive’s salary is 
significantly below market positioning. 
– Benchmarking is undertaken periodically but not annually, and our intention is to apply judgment  
in evaluating market data. 
 
 We pay competitive salaries to 
hire, motivate and retain highly 
competent people. 
Pension or  
superannuation 
– Employment benefits typically include participation in a pension plan, superannuation fund,  
or a cash allowance to contribute to a personal pension or superannuation fund. 
– The maximum level of Company contribution to an individual executive director’s schemes annually is 
35 per cent of base salary. 
– We provide locally competitive 
post-employment benefits in a 
cost-efficient manner in order to 
hire and retain. 
Other benefits – Include private healthcare cover for the executive and their dependants, company car or allowance, 
car parking, life insurance, accident insurance, provision of Company-provided transport/chauffeur, 
professional advice, participation in local flexible benefit programmes and certain other minor benefits 
(including modest retirement gifts in applicable circumstances, occasional spouse travel in support  
of the business and any Rio Tinto business expenses which are deemed to be taxable where the 
Company has paid the tax on their behalf). 
– Secondment and relocation payments (for example, housing, tax equalisation, the payment of school 
fees and periodic visits home for the executive and their family) may also be made to and on behalf of 
executives living outside their home country. Examples of these types of payments in 2013 are set out 
in the Implementation Report. 
– Other benefits are paid at cost and, given the nature and variety of the items, there is no formal 
maximum level of Company contribution. 
– We provide competitive other 
benefits in a cost-efficient 
manner to hire and retain.

Remuneration arrangements – Performance-related (At risk) Link to Group performance and strategy 
Short Term 
Incentive Plan 
(STIP) 
– The threshold and maximum annual bonus opportunities for commensurate performance under  
the STIP for executives are 50 per cent and 200 per cent of base salary respectively. If target 
performance is achieved, the bonus opportunity is up to 120 per cent of base salary for executive 
directors and up to 100 per cent of base salary for other executives. These percentages, with the 
exception of the maximum percentage, are subject to the exercise of discretion by the Committee. 
– A scorecard of key performance indicators (KPIs) is established for each executive at the 
commencement of the financial year. The measures and the relative weightings are selected  
by the Committee in order to drive business performance for the current year, including the 
achievement of financial, safety and other individual business outcomes that are priorities for  
the financial year in question.  
– The measures, weightings and targets are reviewed annually and are included either prospectively  
or retrospectively each year in the Implementation Report. The Committee retains flexibility to 
determine the measures, weightings and targets as appropriate, based on the outcomes of its  
annual review.  
– We expect to disclose the measures, weightings and targets for safety goals at the beginning of each 
year. In the area of financial and individual goals, we will, at the beginning of each year, disclose the 
measures and weightings only, because we regard the targets as commercially sensitive. However, 
we intend to disclose targets and outcomes retrospectively. In the rare instances where this may not 
be prudent on grounds of commercial sensitivity, we will seek to explain why and give an indication 
of when they will be disclosed.  
– Threshold, target and outstanding performance levels are established for all STIP measures to help 
drive high levels of business and individual performance.  
– The central case or “base” plan delivers what the board considers to be target performance. Target 
performance is intended to be stretching. Probability factors are then applied, based upon a range  
of potential operating and cost scenarios, to establish the threshold and outstanding performance 
levels. These threshold (below target), target, and outstanding (above target) levels are determined 
by the Committee at the beginning of each performance year. 
– The Committee seeks to ensure, in making its year end determination of STIP awards, that actual 
performance is directly comparable to the targets set at the beginning of the year. This sometimes 
results in adjustments to the targets being made by the Committee, (in particular to take account  
of events outside management’s control) to ensure a like-for-like comparison. Both upward and 
downward adjustments can be made, with reference to principles agreed by the Committee, to 
ensure the outcomes fairly reflect the board’s objectives.  
– Safety KPIs comprise a significant portion of the STIP for executives, and any fatality will have a 
material impact on the STIP score for the relevant executives.  
– STIP focuses participants on 
achieving demanding annual 
performance goals, which are based 
on the Group’s KPIs, in pursuit of 
the creation of sustainable 
shareholder value. 
– We demand that sustainable 
business practices are adhered to, 
particularly in the context of safety. 
– When reviewing the outcome of  
the awards under the STIP the 
Committee will, when evaluating 
overall safety, financial, Group and 
individual performance consider  
the overall fairness against original 
expectations and shareholder 
experience. 
– Any discretionary adjustments for 
directors will be disclosed in the 
Implementation Report for the 
financial period.  
Bonus  
Deferral Plan 
(BDP) 
– Fifty per cent of the STIP is delivered in deferred shares under the BDP, with the remainder  
delivered in cash.  
– The BDP vests in the December of the third year after the end of performance year to which  
it relates.  
– The number of BDP shares which are awarded is increased by reference to the dividends paid  
in the deferral period before vesting. 
– BDP shares lapse if the participant resigns or is dismissed for misconduct before vesting but,  
unless the Committee decides otherwise, vest on leaving for any other reason.  
– BDP shares vest on a change of control. 
– The BDP ensures ongoing 
alignment between executives and 
shareholders through deferral of  
50 per cent of STIP awards into  
Rio Tinto shares.

material impact on the STIP score for the relevant executives.  
– STIP focuses participants on 
achieving demanding annual 
performance goals, which are based 
on the Group’s KPIs, in pursuit of 
the creation of sustainable 
shareholder value. 
– We demand that sustainable 
business practices are adhered to, 
particularly in the context of safety. 
– When reviewing the outcome of  
the awards under the STIP the 
Committee will, when evaluating 
overall safety, financial, Group and 
individual performance consider  
the overall fairness against original 
expectations and shareholder 
experience. 
– Any discretionary adjustments for 
directors will be disclosed in the 
Implementation Report for the 
financial period.  
Bonus  
Deferral Plan 
(BDP) 
– Fifty per cent of the STIP is delivered in deferred shares under the BDP, with the remainder  
delivered in cash.  
– The BDP vests in the December of the third year after the end of performance year to which  
it relates.  
– The number of BDP shares which are awarded is increased by reference to the dividends paid  
in the deferral period before vesting. 
– BDP shares lapse if the participant resigns or is dismissed for misconduct before vesting but,  
unless the Committee decides otherwise, vest on leaving for any other reason.  
– BDP shares vest on a change of control. 
– The BDP ensures ongoing 
alignment between executives and 
shareholders through deferral of  
50 per cent of STIP awards into  
Rio Tinto shares. 
  
  
 
Remuneration arrangements – Performance-related (At risk) Link to Group performance and strategy 
Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) 
– A new plan was approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGMs.  
– Awards under the new PSP have a maximum face value of 438 per cent of base salary  
(ignoring dividend equivalents as described below).  
– The awards have been calculated independently by our consultants (Towers Watson since  
1 August 2013 and Deloitte LLP previously) to have an expected value of approximately  
50 per cent of face value. Expected value is face value adjusted for the probability of the  
performance target being met. 
– This means that the expected value that can be awarded under the PSP is a maximum of  
219 per cent of base salary (ie 438 per cent x 50 per cent). The threshold value is a maximum  
of 98.6 per cent of base salary (ie 438 per cent x 22.5 per cent). 
– Actual award levels vary for each executive and are included in the Implementation Report.  
– Conditional share awards vest subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions, 
comparing Rio Tinto’s performance against: 
– One-third: TSR relative to the HSBC Global Mining Index; 
– One-third: TSR relative to the Morgan Stanley Capital World Index (MSCI); and 
– One-third: improvement in EBIT margin relative to the global mining comparators which will  
be listed in the Implementation Report each year.  
– Each component of the award will be assessed independently. Details of the TSR and EBIT margin 
measures (targets and vesting schedules) will be set out in the Implementation Report each year.  
Those for 2013 can be found on page 108.  
– With respect to the EBIT margin measure, in order to ensure that outcomes are fair and that 
business performance has been appropriately taken into account, the Committee will consider,  
on a discretionary basis, any specific, significant, unusual, “below the line” items (eg impairments) 
reported by Rio Tinto or its peers during the performance period to ensure genuine comparability 
when determining any level of vesting indicated by third-party data. The application of any such 
discretion will be disclosed.  
– The outperformance required for maximum vesting under all components of the award is considered 
by the Committee to be very stretching. 
– If, but only if, vesting is achieved, participants in the PSP shall be entitled to receive a number of 
additional shares whose market value reflects the aggregate cash amount of dividends that would 
have been received had the shares which have vested at the end of the performance period been 
held throughout the performance period. 
– Awards and performance conditions can be adjusted to take account of variations of capital  
and other transactions. Subject to this policy, performance conditions may be amended in other 
circumstances if the Committee considers that a changed performance condition would be a fairer 
measure of performance.  
– If there is a change of control, awards will vest to the extent performance conditions are then 
satisfied. If the change of control happens during the first 36 months from the date of grant of the 
award, the number of shares that can vest will be reduced pro rata over that 36 months period.  
The Committee may, alternatively, with agreement of an acquiring company, replace awards with 
equivalent new awards over shares in the acquiring company.  
– As described under the malus and claw back provisions on page 71, the Committee retains the 
discretion to reduce or cancel awards before they vest (malus) or to recover the value of awards  
after vesting (claw back). 
– The Committee will seek to ensure that outcomes are fair and that they take account of the overall 
performance of the Company during the performance period.  
– The PSP incorporates a simple 
structure to align executive reward 
with shareholder returns and 
operational performance over a 
long-term horizon.  
– Award levels are set to incentivise 
executives to meet the long-term 
strategic goals of the Group, to 
provide retention for the executive 
team and to contribute towards the 
competitiveness of the overall 
remuneration package. 
– TSR rewards the delivery of superior 
returns to shareholders over the 
long-term. 
– EBIT margin improvement rewards 
sustained operational performance 
of our business and the cost-
competitive operation of our mining 
assets, a core part of our strategy.  
– How performance is generated is as 
important as what level of 
performance is delivered. Before 
vesting, the Committee must satisfy 
itself that relative TSR and EBIT 
margin performances are an 
appropriate reflection of the 
underlying performance of the 
business, and can adjust vesting 
accordingly. 
– Awards will normally have a five-
year performance period to provide 
long-term alignment with the 
interests of shareholders.  
– As a transitional measure, awards 
granted in 2013 will vest 50 per 
cent after four years and 50 per 
cent after five years. 
The long-term incentive awards made prior to 2013, and under which payments are still intended to be made should the relevant performance conditions be 
satisfied, can be paid out under this policy. The details of the awards granted prior to 2013 which have yet to vest, including the details of the performance conditions, 
are provided in the Implementation Report. riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

(a) Long-term incentives consist of share awards only, measured at 2014 (face) value as 
disclosed on pages 83 and 86 of this report. This does not constitute an estimate of the 
value of awards that may potentially vest with respect to year end 31 December 2014. 
No assumption has been made for increase in share price or payment of dividends. 
Context for outstanding performance 
Demanding performance targets are designed to ensure that the level  
of remuneration is aligned with performance delivered for shareholders. 
Outstanding business and individual performance is required to achieve  
the maximum level of remuneration. This comprises: 
– outstanding performance against all financial; health and safety and  
individual STIP measures; 
– TSR outperformance against both the HSBC and MSCI indices by  
six per cent per annum over five years; and 
– EBIT margin improvement equal to or greater than the second ranked  
company in the comparator group over five years. 
The intention of the Committee is that if these levels of reward are achieved  
by our executives then shareholders will benefit over time from superior share 
price performance.  
Discretions  
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that the outcomes  
of the Group’s executive pay arrangements described in this Remuneration 
Policy properly reflect the Group’s ov erall performance and the experience  
of its shareholders and other stakehol ders over the performance period.  
The Committee undertakes to owners that it will exercise discretion diligently 
and in a manner that is aligned with our strategy to create long-term 
shareholder value. Accordingly, when reviewing the operation of short and  
long-term incentive plans and the outcom e of awards made under these plans, 
the Committee will, when evaluating safety, financial, Group and individual 
performance, consider the overall shareholder experience during the 
performance period in question.  
It is the Committee’s intention that th e mechanistic outcome of performance 
conditions relating to awards made under such plans will routinely be subject  
to review to avoid outcomes which could be seen as contrary to shareholders’ 
expectations. To the extent provided for in the terms of any performance 
condition or in accordance with any re levant amendment power under the plan 
rules, the Committee may adjust and/or set different performance measures if 
events occur (such as a change in strateg y, a material acquisition or divestment, 
a change in control or unexpected event) which cause the Committee to 
determine that the measures are no longer appropriate or in the best interests  
of shareholders and that the amendment is required so that the measures 
achieve their original purpose. Committee discretion should not operate as an 
automatic override, and it must be exercised judiciously. 
To the extent that discretion is a pplied in any year, the Committee undertakes 
that this will be clearly explained and disclosed to shareholders in the 
Implementation Report.  
Recruitment remuneration 
Our approach to recruitment remuneration for executives (both external  
and internal) is set out below. Sharehol ders are reminded that the following 
principles are binding only in so far as th ey relate to the recruitment of directors. 
We aim to position base salary at an a ppropriate level, taking into consideration 
a range of factors including an executive’s current remuneration, experience, 
internal relativities, an assessment against relevant comparator groups and cost.  
Other elements of remuneration will be established in line with the 
Remuneration Policy set out in the ex ecutive remuneration structure table  
on pages 71 to 73. As such, annual varia ble remuneration for new appointees  
will comprise a maximum award of 200 per cent of base salary under the  
STIP and a maximum award of 438 per cent of base salary under the PSP.  
In the event that an inte rnal appointment is made, existing commitments will  
be honoured. 
If the Committee concludes that it is ne cessary and appropriate to secure an 
appointment, relocation-related support and international mobility benefits may 
also be provided depending on the circumstances. Examples of recent relocation 
arrangements are set out on page 86 of the Implementation Report.  
Any compensation provided to an executive recruited from outside the Group for 
the forfeiture of any award under variable remuneration arrangements entered 
into with a previous employer is consid ered separately to the establishment of 
forward looking annual remuneration arrangements. Our policy with respect to 
such “buy-outs” is to determine a reasonab le level of award, on a like-for-like 
basis, of primarily equity-based, but also potentially cash or restricted stock, 
taking into consideration the quantum of forfeited awards, their performance 
conditions and vesting schedules. The Committee will obtain an independent 
external assessment of the value of aw ards proposed to be bought out and 
retains discretion, subject to the above, to make such compensation as it deems 
necessary and appropriate to secure the relevant executive’s employment.  
The Committee’s intention is that buy-ou t compensation should include, where 
appropriate, performance-tested equity.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Remuneration Report: Remuneration Policy continued 
 
Executives’ service contracts and termination  
The Committee will seek to honour any commitments made in respect  
of termination of employment in the executive directors’ service contracts 
predating this Remuneration Policy which are described in this section. This 
section also sets out Rio Tinto’s policy on termination payments and notice 
periods. Shareholders are reminded that such policy is binding only in so far  
as it relates to directors.  
For new appointments where the Company terminates by making a payment  
in lieu of notice, the Committee will for executive directors (to the extent 
permitted by relevant law) have regard to the executive director’s ability to 
mitigate his loss in assessing the payment to be made. 
The executive directors have service contracts that, save as noted below, can  
be terminated by either party with 12 months’ notice in writing, or immediately 
by paying the base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice. An initial  
notice period of up to 24 months during the first two years of employment, 
reducing to 12 months thereafter, may sometimes be necessary to secure an 
external appointment.  
Sam Walsh’s employment concludes, without the need for either party  
to give notice, on 31 December 2015. The Company may also terminate his 
employment for any reason on 31 December 2014, provided it gives notice  
of this decision by 31 October 2014. The Company or Sam may terminate this 
employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser 
period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
31 December 2014. 
Chris Lynch’s employment concludes, without the need for either party to  
give notice, on 28 February 2017. The Company may terminate Chris Lynch’s 
employment for any reason on 29 February 2016, provided it gives notice of  
this decision by 31 December 2015. The Company or Chris may terminate this 
employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser 
period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
29 February 2016. 
Other executives have service contracts which can be terminated by the 
Company with 12 months’ notice in writing, and by the employee with six 
months’ notice in writing, or immediately by the Company by paying the  
base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice.  
Jacynthe Côté is eligible to receive 24 months’ base salary and target  
STIP opportunity (which if taken as salary continuance, will include ongoing 
participation in benefit programmes during that period), inclusive of notice to  
the extent paid, in line with entitlements under her Alcan Inc. contract which  
the Company inherited on the acquisition of Alcan Inc. 
Executives may be required to undertake garden leave during all or part of their 
notice period and may receive their contractual salary, STIP and benefits during 
the notice period (or the cash equivalent). Where applicable, tax equalisation  
and other expatriate benefits will continue in accordance with the executive’s 
prevailing terms and conditions. 
In the case of dismissal for cause, the Company can terminate employment 
without notice and without payment of any salary or compensation in lieu of 
notice. Deferred bonus shares and outstanding awards under the LTIP may  
be forfeited in these circumstances.  
Accrued but untaken annual leave and any long service leave will be paid out on 
termination, in accordance with the relevant country legislation and applicable 
practice applying to all employees. For eligible leavers (as defined below),  
in Australia the value of the leave is calculated on the basis of base salary,  
target STIP and car allowance. No STIP is included where the executive is  
not an eligible leaver.  
If termination is a result of redundancy, the terms of the relevant local policy 
may apply in the same way as for other local employees.  
On termination the Company will pay relocation or expatriation benefits as 
agreed on the original expatriation and/or in accordance with its applicable 
policies on travel and relocation. For example, Sam Walsh is provided with 
expatriation benefits and allowances and on termination of his employment  
by the Company repatriation expenses would be paid. 
On termination, other than for cause, the Company may make a payment in 
consideration for entry by the departing executive director into appropriate 
restrictive covenants to protect Rio Tinto and its shareholders. The amount of 
such payment will be determined by the Committee based on the content and 
duration of the covenant.  
Following termination, executive directors may be eligible to exercise long- 
term incentives awards under the conditions described in the sections following. 
They and their dependants may also be eligible for post-retirement benefits 
such as medical and life insurance. The Company may also agree to continue 
certain other benefits for a period following termination where the arrangements 
are provided under term contracts or in accordance with the terms of the service 
contract, for example, payment for financial advice, tax advice and preparation  
of tax returns for a tax year. In some cases, they may receive a modest 
retirement gift. 
The Company may pay such amount as it determines is reasonable to settle  
any claims which in the Committee’s view are legitimate which the executive 
director may have in connection with the termination of his employment.  
The Company may also pay reasonable legal and other professional fees 
(including outplacement support) to or in respect of a director in connection  
with the termination of his employment. These may include legal fees incurred 
by him in negotiating a settlement agreement with Rio Tinto. In assessing what 
is reasonable, the Company will take account of prevailing rates for such advice 
and support and determine appropriate level of contribution based on the 
complexity of the issues.

31 December 2013. 
(e) The details for other executives are provided in the Implementation Report. 
Treatment of STIP and LTIP on termination 
The STIP and share plan rules govern the entitlements that executive 
participants may have under those plans upon termination of employment. 
Usually there is a discretion for the Remuneration Committee to treat a person  
as an eligible leaver. 
An eligible leaver is an executive who leaves the Group by reason of ill-health, 
injury, disability (as determined by the executive’s employer); retirement; 
redundancy; transfer of the undertaking in which the executive works; change  
of control of the executive’s employing company; or death.

Remuneration Report: Remuneration Policy continued 
 
Executives’ service contracts and termination  
The Committee will seek to honour any commitments made in respect  
of termination of employment in the executive directors’ service contracts 
predating this Remuneration Policy which are described in this section. This 
section also sets out Rio Tinto’s policy on termination payments and notice 
periods. Shareholders are reminded that such policy is binding only in so far  
as it relates to directors.  
For new appointments where the Company terminates by making a payment  
in lieu of notice, the Committee will for executive directors (to the extent 
permitted by relevant law) have regard to the executive director’s ability to 
mitigate his loss in assessing the payment to be made. 
The executive directors have service contracts that, save as noted below, can  
be terminated by either party with 12 months’ notice in writing, or immediately 
by paying the base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice. An initial  
notice period of up to 24 months during the first two years of employment, 
reducing to 12 months thereafter, may sometimes be necessary to secure an 
external appointment.  
Sam Walsh’s employment concludes, without the need for either party  
to give notice, on 31 December 2015. The Company may also terminate his 
employment for any reason on 31 December 2014, provided it gives notice  
of this decision by 31 October 2014. The Company or Sam may terminate this 
employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser 
period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
31 December 2014. 
Chris Lynch’s employment concludes, without the need for either party to  
give notice, on 28 February 2017. The Company may terminate Chris Lynch’s 
employment for any reason on 29 February 2016, provided it gives notice of  
this decision by 31 December 2015. The Company or Chris may terminate this 
employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser 
period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
29 February 2016. 
Other executives have service contracts which can be terminated by the 
Company with 12 months’ notice in writing, and by the employee with six 
months’ notice in writing, or immediately by the Company by paying the  
base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice.  
Jacynthe Côté is eligible to receive 24 months’ base salary and target  
STIP opportunity (which if taken as salary continuance, will include ongoing 
participation in benefit programmes during that period), inclusive of notice to  
the extent paid, in line with entitlements under her Alcan Inc. contract which  
the Company inherited on the acquisition of Alcan Inc. 
Executives may be required to undertake garden leave during all or part of their 
notice period and may receive their contractual salary, STIP and benefits during 
the notice period (or the cash equivalent). Where applicable, tax equalisation  
and other expatriate benefits will continue in accordance with the executive’s 
prevailing terms and conditions. 
In the case of dismissal for cause, the Company can terminate employment 
without notice and without payment of any salary or compensation in lieu of 
notice. Deferred bonus shares and outstanding awards under the LTIP may  
be forfeited in these circumstances.  
Accrued but untaken annual leave and any long service leave will be paid out on 
termination, in accordance with the relevant country legislation and applicable 
practice applying to all employees. For eligible leavers (as defined below),  
in Australia the value of the leave is calculated on the basis of base salary,  
target STIP and car allowance. No STIP is included where the executive is  
not an eligible leaver.  
If termination is a result of redundancy, the terms of the relevant local policy 
may apply in the same way as for other local employees.  
On termination the Company will pay relocation or expatriation benefits as 
agreed on the original expatriation and/or in accordance with its applicable 
policies on travel and relocation. For example, Sam Walsh is provided with 
expatriation benefits and allowances and on termination of his employment  
by the Company repatriation expenses would be paid. 
On termination, other than for cause, the Company may make a payment in 
consideration for entry by the departing executive director into appropriate 
restrictive covenants to protect Rio Tinto and its shareholders. The amount of 
such payment will be determined by the Committee based on the content and 
duration of the covenant.  
Following termination, executive directors may be eligible to exercise long- 
term incentives awards under the conditions described in the sections following. 
They and their dependants may also be eligible for post-retirement benefits 
such as medical and life insurance. The Company may also agree to continue 
certain other benefits for a period following termination where the arrangements 
are provided under term contracts or in accordance with the terms of the service 
contract, for example, payment for financial advice, tax advice and preparation  
of tax returns for a tax year. In some cases, they may receive a modest 
retirement gift. 
The Company may pay such amount as it determines is reasonable to settle  
any claims which in the Committee’s view are legitimate which the executive 
director may have in connection with the termination of his employment.  
The Company may also pay reasonable legal and other professional fees 
(including outplacement support) to or in respect of a director in connection  
with the termination of his employment. These may include legal fees incurred 
by him in negotiating a settlement agreement with Rio Tinto. In assessing what 
is reasonable, the Company will take account of prevailing rates for such advice 
and support and determine appropriate level of contribution based on the 
complexity of the issues.

Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP)  
If an eligible leaver leaves the Grou p during a performance year, the Committee 
may determine in its absolute discretion to award a pro rata portion of the STIP 
based on the amount of the year serv ed and based on actual assessment of 
performance against targets. Any cash pa yment will be made at the normal  
STIP payment date and no portion of the award will be deferred into shares. 
If an executive provides the Company notice of their resignation during  
the performance year, but will not leave the Group until after the end of the 
performance year, the Committee may dete rmine in its absolute discretion  
to make an award under the STIP. In th ese circumstances, the executive will  
only be eligible to receive the cash po rtion of the award and will forfeit the 
deferred shares portion. Any cash paym ent will be made at the normal STIP 
payment date. 
No STIP payment will be made where an executive resigns or is terminated  
for cause prior to the end of the performance year.  
Bonus Deferral Plan (BDP) (2013 onwards) 
For grants made to executives from and including 2013, awards will normally  
be retained and vest at the schedule d vesting date, save where the Committee 
determines otherwise. There will be no pro rata reduction of awards and any 
dividend equivalent shares will be calculated on the vested shares. 
If the executive resigns or is dismissed for misconduct, or for any other reason 
that the Committee decides, the awards will lapse.  
BDP (pre-2013) 
For grants made to eligible leavers before 2013, awards will normally vest at the 
scheduled vesting date save where th e Committee determines otherwise. There 
will be no pro rata reduction of awards and any dividend equivalent shares will 
be calculated on the vested shares. 
If an executive leaves the Group for any other reason awards will lapse. 
For any BDP award, where required by la w or regulation, and the Remuneration 
Committee allows, cash may be provided in lieu of shares. 
PSP (2013 onwards) 
For grants made to executives from and including 2013, awards will normally  
be retained, and vest at the scheduled vesting date. Unvested awards remain 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions. Any dividend 
equivalent shares will be calculated on the vested shares at vesting. 
If the executive leaves the Group during the first 36 months from the date of 
grant of the award, the numb er of shares that can vest will be reduced pro rata 
over that 36-month period.  
Awards will vest immediately on death, bu t if an executive dies during the first  
36 months from the date of grant of the award, the number of shares that can 
vest will be reduced pro rata over that 36-month period.  
If the executive resigns or is dismissed for misconduct, or for any other reason 
that the Committee decides, the awards will lapse.  
PSP (pre-2013) 
For grants made to eligible leavers before 2013, awards will normally be retained 
and vest at the scheduled vesting date , although the Committee may determine 
that awards should vest early. Unve sted awards remain subject to the 
satisfaction of the performance conditions. 
Awards vest immediately on death. The number of shares vesting is determined 
on the assumption that performance conditions are met at median level or  
at the level to which they are actually sati sfied at the date of death, if higher.  
The number of shares is further reduced as described above.  
If an executive leaves the Group for any other reason awards will lapse. 
For any PSP award, where permitted, and the Remuneration Committee allows, 
awards may be made in ca sh in lieu of shares. 
 
Share Option Plan (SOP) (pre-2013) 
For grants made to eligible leavers before 2013, awards will normally be 
retained. If the executive is an eligible leaver, vested awards will lapse one year 
from the date the executive leaves th e Group and unvested awards will lapse 
one year from the vesting date or such longer period as permitted by the 
Committee. Unvested awards remain subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions.  
Awards vest in full on death. 
If an executive leaves the Group for any other reason, unvested awards and 
vested awards that have not been exercised will lapse. 
Management Share Plan (MSP)  
Awards under the MSP are only made to executives prior to their appointment  
as an Executive Committee member. All reta ined awards will be reduced pro rata 
to reflect the proportion of the period between the date of grant of the award  
and the normal vesting date which has not elapsed at the time employment 
ceased. Any dividend equivalent shares or cash equivalent will be calculated  
on the vested shares. Awards vest on death, subject to the pro rata reduction 
described above. 
MSP (2013 onwards) 
For grants made to executives from and including 2013, awards will normally  
be retained, and vest, at the Committee’s discretion, at the scheduled vesting 
date (although awards of US taxpayers may vest on leaving).

that the Committee decides, the awards will lapse. 
MSP (pre-2013) 
For grants made to eligible leavers before 2013, awards will normally be retained 
by the executive, and vest, at the Committee’s discretion, at the scheduled 
vesting date (although awards of US taxpayers may vest on leaving).

Remuneration Report: Remuneration Policy continued 
 
Chairman and non-executive directors’ remuneration 
Chairman 
It is Rio Tinto’s policy that the chairman should be remunerated on a 
competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution to the Group,  
as assessed by the board.  
The Committee determines the terms of service, including remuneration, of  
the chairman. The chairman’s fees are set by the Committee. The chairman  
has no part in the setting of his fees and is not present at any discussion at  
the Committee about his fees. 
The chairman receives a fixed annual fee and does not receive any additional  
fee or allowance either for committee membership or chairmanship, or for  
travel. The chairman does not participate in the Group’s incentive plans.  
The chairman is provided with a car and driver. Any use for transport between 
home and the office and other personal travel is a taxable benefit to the 
chairman, and the Company pays any tax arising on the chairman’s behalf.  
The chairman pays a fixed annual fee to the Company for the personal  
travel element.  
Other benefits provided include private healthcare cover, accident insurance 
(note this is neither contractual nor a taxable benefit), other minor benefits 
(including modest retirement gifts in applicable circumstances), occasional 
spouse travel in support of the business and any Rio Tinto business expenses 
which are deemed to be taxable where the Company has paid the tax on his 
behalf. Rio Tinto does not pay retirement or post-employment benefits to  
the chairman. 
Non-executive directors 
Fees paid to non-executive directors reflect their respective duties and 
responsibilities and the time required to be spent by them so as to make  
a meaningful and effective contribution to the affairs of Rio Tinto.  
The non-executive directors’ fees and other terms are set by the board upon  
the recommendation of the Chairman’s Committee (which comprises the 
chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer). 
Non-executive directors receive a fixed annual fee comprising a base fee, 
committee membership or committee chairmanship fee or senior independent 
director fee, as applicable, and allowances for attending meetings which involve 
medium or long-distance air travel. They do not participate in any of the Group’s 
incentive plans. 
Where the payment of statutory minimum superannuation contributions for 
Australian non-executive directors is required by Australian superannuation law, 
these contributions are deducted from the director’s overall fee entitlements. 
Non-executive directors may on occasion receive reimbursement for costs 
incurred in relation to professional advice. These payments, if made, are  
taxable benefits to the non-executive directors and the tax arising is paid  
by the Company on the director’s behalf.  
Other benefits provided include accident insurance (note this is neither 
contractual nor a taxable benefit), other minor benefits (including modest 
retirement gifts in applicable circumstances), occasional spouse travel in 
support of the business and any Rio Tinto business expenses which are deemed 
to be taxable where the Company has paid the tax on their behalf. Rio Tinto does  
not pay retirement or post-employment benefits to non-executive directors. 
Appointment  
The appointment of non-executive directors (including the chairman) is  
handled through the Nominations Committee and board processes. The current 
fee levels are set out in the Implementation Report on page 88. 
Details of each element of remuneration paid to the chairman and non-
executive directors during 2013 are set out in the Implementation Report in  
table 1b on page 100.  
The chairman’s letter of appointment from the Company stipulates his duties as 
chairman of the Group. His appointment may be terminated without liability on 
the part of Rio Tinto in accordance with the Group’s constitutional documents 
dealing with retirement, disqualification from office or other vacation from office. 
Otherwise, his appointment may be terminated by giving 12 months’ notice. 
There are no provisions for compensation payable on termination of his 
appointment, other than if his appointment as chairman is terminated by reason 
of his removal as a director pursuant to a resolution of shareholders in general 
meeting in which case the Company shall be liable to pay any fees accrued to 
the date of any such removal.  
The non-executive directors’ letters of appointment from the Company stipulate 
their duties and responsibilities as directors. Each non-executive director is 
appointed subject to their election and annual re-election by shareholders.  
Non-executive directors’ appointments may be terminated by giving three 
months’ notice. There are no provisions for compensation payable on 
termination of their appointment. The letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at Rio Tinto plc’s registered office, and at its annual general meeting. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Group’s constitutional documents, the 
maximum aggregate fees payable to the non-executive directors (including the 
chairman) in respect of any year, including fees received by the non-executive 
directors for serving on any committee of the boards, and any travel allowances 
received by the non-executive directors for attending meetings will not in any 
year exceed £3,000,000. Non-monetary benefits are not included in this limit.

REMUNERATION REPORT: Implementation Report FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Implementation Report introduction  
This Implementation Report is presented to shareholders for approval at the 
AGMs and outlines how our Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2013  
and how it is intended to be operated in 2014.  
Remuneration for executives set out in th e single total figure of remuneration 
tables is shown gross of tax and in the relevant currency of award or payment. 
The information reported for executives in table 1a on pages 98 and 99 is 
reported in accordance with Australian statutory disclosure requirements and  
is shown gross of tax and in US dollars. UK and Australian remuneration figures 
are generally not comparable due to the different methodologies required to 
calculate various parts of the remuneration packages, most notably LTIP 
arrangements and the value of pension or superannuation. 
In addition to executive remuneration, this report covers the remuneration 
of the chairman and the non-executive directors in table 1b on page 100.  
All figures are shown gross of tax and in US dollars. 
Remuneration Committee responsibilities 
The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which  
are available in the corporate governance section of the Rio Tinto website.  
The responsibilities of the Committee include: 
determining the remuneration structure and policies, and assessing their 
cost, including pension and superannuation arrangements for executives; 
determining the use of short and long -term incentive plans for executives; 
overseeing the operation of the Group’s short and long-term incentive plans 
as they relate to executives, includin g the approval of awards, setting of 
performance criteria, where applicable, and determination of any vesting;  
determining contractual notice periods and termination  
commitments and setting any retention and termination  
arrangements for executives; 
determining awards under the Group’s all-employee share plans; and 
determining the terms of service upon appointment and any subsequent 
changes for the chairman and executives. 
The Committee considers the level of pay and conditions throughout  
the Group when determining executive remuneration and ensures that  
the same principles are used when designing the broader employee 
remuneration policies.  
The members of the Committee are John Va rley (chairman), Jan du Plessis,  
Michael Fitzpatrick, Richard Goodmanson and Paul Tellier. 
The membership and meeting attendances are detailed in the corporate 
governance section on page 59. The Co mmittee is supported by executives  
and members of senior management who regularly attend meetings to provide 
information as requested by the Committee. These included Sam Walsh  
(chief executive), Hugo Bague (Group executive, Organisational Resources), 
John Beadle (vice president, Executive Performance and Reward) and Eleanor 
Evans (company secretary). None of the attendees mentioned above was 
present when matters associated with their own remuneration were considered 
by the Committee. 
How the Committee spent its time in 2013 
During 2013, the Committee met eight times. It fulfilled its responsibilities  
as set out in its terms of reference.  
In particular, its work in 2013 and the early part of 2014 have included: 
reviewing and determining any base salary adjustments for executives; 
reviewing and determining threshold, target and outstanding performance 
targets used in the 2013 STIP, assessing any applicable adjustments and 
those to be used in the 2014 STIP;  
reviewing actual performance against the targets in the 2013 STIP; 
reviewing and determining the outcomes for LTIP awards vesting at the  
end of 2013; 
reviewing and determining LTIP grants for the executives in 2014; 
reviewing and determining the terms of promotion or appointment for  
Sam Walsh, Chris Lynch, Andrew Harding, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and  
Hugo Bague;  
determining the terms of departure for Tom Albanese and Doug Ritchie; and 
reviewing the Group’s Remuneration Policy and preparing the Remuneration 
Report (including this Implementation Report) in the light of the new UK 
regulations and generally. 
The performance targets under the LTIP and the Company’s approach  
to establishing the performance targets under the STIP are detailed in the 
executive remuneration structure table on pages 71 to 73. The Committee’s 
approach to the commercial sensitivity of certain targets is discussed below.  
Independent advisers  
The independent advisers engaged by and reporting to the Committee from 
January to July 2013 were Deloitte LLP. 
In June 2013 the Committee appointed Towers Watson as its independent 
advisers with effect from 1 August 2013. During 2013 the Committee formally 
reviewed and determined the scope of servic es which it required to be provided 
by an independent adviser, and issued an invitation to tender to a range  
of candidates, all of which were members of the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group and had specific expertise in advisi ng UK and Australian listed companies 
on a variety of remuneration matters. The decision to appoint Towers Watson 
was made following a detailed review of tender responses, and a formal 
interview process. Towers Watson, and Deloitte LLP before them, report  
to the Committee. 
To ensure that “remuneration recommendations” (being advice relating to the 
elements of remuneration for key management personnel, as defined under  
the Australian Corporations Act) were made free from undue influence by key 
management personnel to whom they may relate, the Committee established  
a protocol for the engagement of and interaction with remuneration consultants 
and has monitored compliance with its requirements throughout 2013. 
Declarations were given by Deloitte LLP or Towers Watson to the effect that 
remuneration recommendations were made free from undue influence of  
key management personnel to whom they related. The board has received 
assurance from the Committee and is theref ore satisfied that the remuneration 
recommendations received from Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson were made 
free from undue influence by key management personnel to whom any of the 
remuneration recommendations related.   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Remuneration Report: Implementation Report continued 
Both Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under the Code of Conduct 
(the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code 
is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due 
care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Deloitte LLP 
and Towers Watson have confirmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 
2013 for all remuneration services provided to Rio Tinto. It is available at 
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.  
Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson are the only remuneration consultants which 
provided remuneration recommendations to the Committee during 2013.  
The Committee is content that Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson, in providing 
remuneration advice to the Committee, did not have any connections with  
Rio Tinto that impaired its independence.  
During 2013, as part of their respective engagements, Deloitte LLP and  
Towers Watson provided remuneration recommendations to the Committee, 
including Committee meeting attendance and advice in relation to 
management proposals. Deloitte LLP was paid US$89,588 for these services. 
Towers Watson was paid US$101,854 for these services.  
Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson respectively provided general and technical 
executive remuneration services. These services included benchmarking data 
and advice about remuneration of employees other than key management 
personnel across the Group, and advice from Towers Watson in relation to 
preparation of the 2013 Remuneration Report. Deloitte LLP was paid 
US$110,616 for these services. Towers Watson was paid US$150,575 for  
these services.  
Deloitte LLP provided various non-audit services to the Group during 2013 
(including advice in relation to taxation, project management and consulting 
and advisory services), and was paid a total of US$8.96 million for these 
services. Towers Watson provided non-audit services to the Group during  
2013 (including consultancy and advisory services) and was paid a total  
of US$387,233 for these services. Towers Watson advises various Rio Tinto 
pension fund trustees. 
Other services and publications were received from a range of advisers  
in relation to remuneration data. 
Performance review process for executives 
Rio Tinto conducts an annual performance review process for all  
of its executives. In the case of members of the Executive Committee,  
the chief executive conducts the review. In the case of the chief executive,  
his performance is assessed by the chairman of the board. 
The key objectives of the performance review process are to: 
– improve organisational effectiveness by creating alignment between  
the executive’s objectives and Rio Tinto’s strategy; and 
– provide a consistent, transparent and balanced approach to measure, 
recognise and reward executive performance. 
All such reviews took place in 2013 or early 2014. 
Share ownership policy for executives 
The Group recognises the importance of aligning executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders and they are therefore expected to build up and maintain 
a meaningful shareholding. The Committee intends that executives should  
aim to reach a share ownership (defined below) in Rio Tinto shares equivalent 
in value to:  
 Share ownership requirement
Chief executive 4 x base salary
Other executives 3 x base salary
The shareholding requirement was increased from the previous level of two 
times’ base salary for the chief executive and other executives as part of the 
changes to the Group’s long-term incentive arrangements in 2013.  
The Committee expects that this shareholding will be built up over a five-year 
period by holding shares and share options that vest under the LTIPs. For new 
hires, longer periods may be accepted to build up this shareholding, given the 
five-year vesting periods for our PSP. Details of executives’ beneficial interests 
in Rio Tinto shares are set out in table 2 on page 101 and the details of awards  
of shares and options under long-term incentive plans are set out in table 3  
on pages 102 to 108. 
Shares will be treated as “owned” if they are not subject to restriction, and  
as such include shares directly held by the executive and any shares where 
there is a beneficial interest. A beneficial interest includes any shares where  
the executive receives the benefit of ownership (such as a right to receive 
dividends) without actually directly owning the shares. 
A value for vested, but unexercised share options, is included, with a 50 per 
cent discount for the likely effects of taxation, on the basis that executives with 
unexercised vested options have a strong financial alignment with the share 
price and therefore with shareholder interests.  
Additional shareholding requirements were introduced for senior management 
below the Executive Committee in 2013.  
The following table illustrates the executive share ownership level for current 
members of the Executive Committee in office at 31 December 2013 as a 
multiple of salary as at the same date.

Remuneration Report: Implementation Report continued 
Both Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under the Code of Conduct 
(the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code 
is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due 
care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Deloitte LLP 
and Towers Watson have confirmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 
2013 for all remuneration services provided to Rio Tinto. It is available at 
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.  
Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson are the only remuneration consultants which 
provided remuneration recommendations to the Committee during 2013.  
The Committee is content that Deloitte LLP and Towers Watson, in providing 
remuneration advice to the Committee, did not have any connections with  
Rio Tinto that impaired its independence.  
During 2013, as part of their respective engagements, Deloitte LLP and  
Towers Watson provided remuneration recommendations to the Committee, 
including Committee meeting attendance and advice in relation to 
management proposals. Deloitte LLP was paid US$89,588 for these services. 
Towers Watson was paid US$101,854 for these services.

The recent vesting of the 2010 PSP has increased the multiples noted above  
for several executives. 
 
Executives’ external and other appointments 
Executives may be invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies. It is Rio Tinto’s policy that such appointments can broaden the 
experience and knowledge of executives, to the benefit of the Group. This  
policy limits each executive’s external appointment to one FTSE100 company 
directorship or equivalent. Consequently, where there is no likelihood that such 
an appointment will give rise to a conflict of interest, the board will normally 
provide consent to the appointment. The executive is typically permitted to 
retain any fees earned. 
Details of all executives’ external appointments can be found on pages 53  
and 56. 
Performance and impact on 2013 STIP 
Group financial and safety measures are included in the STIP for executive 
directors and Group executives. The STIP measures for the product group  
chief executive officers (PGCEOs) include product group financial and safety 
measures in addition to the Group financial measures.  
Safety measures for all executives in 2013 were split equally between lost time 
injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and all injury frequency rate (AIFR). The safety  
of our people is core to everything we do. Our goal is zero harm, including, 
above all, the elimination of workplace fatalities. We are committed to 
reinforcing our strong safety culture, and improving safety leadership. 
The Committee selected the current financial measures of underlying  
earnings and cash flow because they are KPIs used in managing the business. 
Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator used across  
the Group. It gives insight to cost management, production growth and 
performance efficiency. We are focused on aggressively reducing our costs  
and increasing productivity to improve earnings and deliver greater value  
for shareholders. Operating cash flow is a complementary measure to 
underlying earnings. It also provides insight to how we are managing  
costs and increasing efficiency and productivity across the business.  
In measuring financial performance against the annual plan, half is measured 
against the original plan, and half is “flexed” to exclude the impact of 
uncontrollable fluctuations in exchange rates, quoted metal and other prices. 
Earnings and cash flow results are therefore compared against equally 
weighted flexed and unflexed targets.  
The financial and safety measures and outcomes for the executive directors 
with commentary on key highlights are provided on page 91. Additional details 
for other executives are provided on page 90.

for executives are included in the following pages. 
  
Safety performance 
Regrettably, we did not meet our goal of zero fatalities in 2013. Three 
people lost their lives while working at Rio Tinto managed operations.  
The fatalities were caused by a mobile equipment incident during road 
maintenance at Rio Tinto La Granja project in Peru, a crush incident at  
Rio Tinto Alcan’s Alma smelter in Canada, and a crush incident at Richards 
Bay Minerals in South Africa. We remain committed to achieving our goal  
of zero harm, including, above all, the elimination of workplace fatalities. 
Safe operations that protect our people are a priority and we work 
systematically to mitigate risks that are critical to operating safely. This is 
supported by our management system which provides the framework for 
incorporating hazard identification, risk assessment and risk management  
into all aspects of the operations. 
The Remuneration Committee sought guidance from the Sustainability 
Committee on safety performance for 2013, as per our normal procedures.  
Both Committees noted the continued improvement in AIFR, with the Group’s 
AIFR reducing from 0.67 in 2012 to 0.65 in 2013. This did not meet the Group 
target for 2013 of 0.62, but was better than the threshold level of 0.71.  
The LTIFR has, however, increased from 0.37 in 2012 to 0.42 in 2013, which  
was less than both the target and threshold levels of 0.35 and 0.37 respectively.  
The combined performance meant that the overall Group result for safety  
was below threshold, with differentiated levels of safety performance across  
the product groups. Further reductions have also been applied as required for 
executives with portfolios where a fatality has occurred. The total safety score 
for the Group was 38 per cent (out of a maximum of 200 per cent). 
Group financial performance 
Highlights of 2013 include: 
– Delivering in excess of US$3 billion of operating cash cost and exploration  
and evaluation savings over 2012. 
– Setting new production records in iron ore, bauxite and thermal coal and 
realising productivity gains across the portfolio. 
– Increasing underlying earnings by ten per cent over 2012 and improving 
cash flows by 22 per cent. 
– Reducing capital spend by 26 per cent and strengthening capital discipline. 
– Reducing net debt and announcing or completing divestments of  
US$3.5 billion. 
Additional details on our progress against strategy are provided on page 8. 
The Group exceeded its earnings and cash flow targets set by the board,  
and this is reflected in the financial component of the STIP awards at the  
Group and product group level.  
The Group’s underlying earnings and cash flow generated from operating 
activities for 2013 were US$10.2 billion and US$15.1 billion respectively, against 
targets of US$9.9 billion and US$12.3 billion respectively. The flexed earnings  
and cash flow targets were similar to the unflexed targets at US$9.9 billion  
and US$12.1 billion respectively. The Committee seeks to ensure, in making  
its year end determination of STIP awards, that actual performance is directly 
comparable to the targets set at the beginning of the year. This resulted in 
adjustments to the targets by the Committee, to take account of events outside 
management’s control, to ensure a like-for-like like comparison. Both upward 
and downward adjustments were made to the targets by reference to principles 
agreed by the Committee, which have been consistently applied over several 
years, to ensure the outcomes fairly reflect the board’s objectives.  
Accordingly, the Group exceeded its financial target, with differentiated levels 
of financial performance across the product groups. The Group’s performance 
against the financial targets was 156 per cent (out of a maximum of 200  
per cent).

STIP individual measures for 2013 
Individual measures were set by the chairman for the chief executive and  
by the chief executive for other executives based on the following categories: 
1. Business transformation  
2. Cost reduction  
3. Performance delivery  
4. Leadership and engagement  
Details of the outcomes against the in dividual measures are provided in the 
following pages. 
Discretionary adjustments for 2013 
Discretionary downward adjustments of ten per cent of the overall 2013  
STIP award have been applied to the chief executive and the current and  
former chief financial officer for the pr oject cost overrun in relation to the 
Kitimat modernisation project. Downward adjustments of 40 per cent have  
been applied to the former Group executive, Technology & Innovation and  
20 per cent to the chief executive, Aluminium. 
Performance and impact on LTIP vesting outcome for the period  
ended 31 December 2013 
The performance shares under the PSP awarded in 2010 had a four-year 
performance period that ended on 31 December 2013. This award has an 
indicative vesting of 75 per cent of face value (50 per cent of maximum).  
Share options under the SOP granted in 2011 had a performance period that 
ended on 31 December 2013. This award had an indicative vesting of 100 per 
cent of face value. Options can be exercised from 6 May 2014 until 6 May 2021. 
The Committee considered the Group’s ov erall performance in the context of 
the LTIP awards that were due to vest at the end of 2013 and concluded that 
the vesting of awards based upon the achievement of the TSR measures set  
by shareholders was justified. 
Further details of the LTIP outcomes for the period ended 31 December 2013 
and in prior years are provided on page 95.

(a) The Committee decided that the overall STIP outcome would be reduced  
by ten per cent for the project cost overrun in relation to the Kitimat  
modernisation project. 
As a result, Sam received a STIP award of 120.2 per cent of target, equivalent  
to 144.3 per cent of base salary, 50 per cent to be delivered in cash in  
March 2014, and the remainder to be delivered in deferred shares, vesting in 
December 2016.  
LTIP outcome for the period ended 31 December 2013 
Sam received 41,881 shares in Rio Tinto Limited on 17 February 2014 from  
the vesting of the PSP awarded in 2010. He also received a cash payment of 
A$208,735 equal to the aggregate net dividends that would have been paid  
on the shares that vested had he owned them during that four-year period.  
No dividends were paid in respect of the shares that lapsed. 
In 2011, Sam elected to receive his full LTIP award under the PSP and as a 
result he has no options under the SOP that were granted in 2011 and which 
had a performance period that ended on 31 December 2013. 
Further details of the awards vesting in 2014 and in prior years are provided  
on page 95 and in table 3 on page 103.

LTIP award for 2014 
Sam’s PSP award in 2014 will have a face value of 420 per cent of base salary 
and an expected value of 210 per cent of base salary. The award may vest after 
five years in 2019, subject to the Group’s relative TSR and relative EBIT margin 
performance. The performance conditions for the award are unchanged from 
2013 and the full performance conditions are set out in detail on pages 89  
and 90. As with other participants, Sam’s award in 2014 may be subject to  
pro-rating depending on the date of his retirement from Rio Tinto.

Superannuation 
Sam is provided with superannuation through an employer funded plan as 
provided to Australian-based employees. 
In line with Australian-based employees with defined benefit provision who 
remain in service beyond age 62, Sam’s benefit is calculated as the greater of: 
(a) 20 per cent of basic salary, averaged progressively over the three years 
from age 62 to age 65, for each year of service and proportionate month 
with the Company to date of retirement; or 
(b) (i) his accrued benefit at age 62 of 4.05 times final basic salary; plus 
(ii) Company contributions at the Superannuation Guarantee rate, 
currently nine per cent of basic salary, less tax; plus 
(iii) investment earnings at the rate the trustee of the superannuation  
fund may determine from time to time for the period from age 62  
to the date of retirement. 
In line with typical market practice in Australia, Sam continues to receive an 
additional Company contribution on a defined contribution basis of 20 per cent 
of the lesser of: 
(i) 50 per cent of the annual STIP award; or 
(ii) 20 per cent of base salary. 
This benefit can be taken without employer or trustee consent and without 
actuarial reduction on cessation of employment on or after age 62. 
The accrued lump sum benefit as at 31 December 2013 was A$8,454,000  
(31 December 2012: A$7,145,000). The 2012 figure has been restated to 
include the impact of the investment earnings on Sam’s accrued benefit under 
the superannuation fund for the period from age 62 as set out in (b)(iii) above. 
The figure disclosed previously for 2012 was A$6,836,000, being the accrued 
lump sum benefit calculated by reference to Sam’s base salary as set out in  
(a) above. As the increase to the benefit arose due to investment earnings, 
there was no additional cost to the Company resulting from this restate and  
the disclosure in table 1a is therefore unchanged. The 2013 figure also reflects 
the impact of the investment earnings under the superannuation fund; the 
accrued lump sum benefit as at 31 December 2013 calculated by reference  
to Sam’s base salary as set out in (a) above was A$7,811,427. The additional 
Company contribution on a defined contribution basis for 2013 was A$66,000 
(2012: A$64,000).  
Fees received from external appointments 
In 2013 Sam received A$27,282 (2012: A$161,011) in respect of his position  
as a non-executive director of Seven West Media Limited from which he stood 
down in January 2013. 
Service contract 
Sam’s employment concludes, without the need for either party to give notice, 
on 31 December 2015. The Company may also terminate his employment for 
any reason on 31 December 2014, provided it gives notice of this decision by  
31 October 2014. The Company or Sam may terminate this employment at any 
time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser period as may exist 
between the date on which the notice is given and 31 December 2014. 
Other 
The Company paid for various standard relocation costs associated with  
Sam’s move from Perth, Australia to London of approximately A$206,000.  
He also receives a housing allowance and other assignment benefits during  
his secondment to London. His remuneration is not subject to tax equalisation 
or cost of living adjustments, both of which are standard provisions for other 
international assignees in the Group. The amounts are included in note (e) 
under the table on page 82.  
Sam will be eligible to receive the value of unused annual leave and  
long service leave at the conclusion of his employment in accordance with 
Australian legislation and applicable practice applying to all employees in 
Australia; the value of this leave as at 17 February 2014 was A$787,000 and 
A$1,592,000 respectively.  
Chief executive’s pay and employee pay 
The table below compares the changes from 2012 to 2013, in salary, benefits 
and annual incentives paid for the chief executive and the Australian workforce. 
We chose the comparison to the Australian workforce because it is the country 
where 40 per cent of the total workforce is based. This comparator group has 
been selected due to the availability of comparative data and to remove the 
impacts of year-on-year exchange rate fluctuations. The underlying elements  
of the chief executive’s pay are based on the values reported in the single total 
figure of remuneration table. 
Sam’s base salary was increased by 14.9 per cent with effect from 17 January 
2013 to reflect his promotion to chief executive. The increase in his benefits is 
primarily due to international assignment benefits and one-off costs associated 
with his relocation from Perth, Australia to London.

Superannuation 
Sam is provided with superannuation through an employer funded plan as 
provided to Australian-based employees. 
In line with Australian-based employees with defined benefit provision who 
remain in service beyond age 62, Sam’s benefit is calculated as the greater of: 
(a) 20 per cent of basic salary, averaged progressively over the three years 
from age 62 to age 65, for each year of service and proportionate month 
with the Company to date of retirement; or 
(b) (i) his accrued benefit at age 62 of 4.05 times final basic salary; plus 
(ii) Company contributions at the Superannuation Guarantee rate, 
currently nine per cent of basic salary, less tax; plus 
(iii) investment earnings at the rate the trustee of the superannuation  
fund may determine from time to time for the period from age 62  
to the date of retirement. 
In line with typical market practice in Australia, Sam continues to receive an 
additional Company contribution on a defined contribution basis of 20 per cent 
of the lesser of: 
(i) 50 per cent of the annual STIP award; or 
(ii) 20 per cent of base salary. 
This benefit can be taken without employer or trustee consent and without 
actuarial reduction on cessation of employment on or after age 62. 
The accrued lump sum benefit as at 31 December 2013 was A$8,454,000  
(31 December 2012: A$7,145,000). The 2012 figure has been restated to 
include the impact of the investment earnings on Sam’s accrued benefit under 
the superannuation fund for the period from age 62 as set out in (b)(iii) above. 
The figure disclosed previously for 2012 was A$6,836,000, being the accrued 
lump sum benefit calculated by reference to Sam’s base salary as set out in  
(a) above. As the increase to the benefit arose due to investment earnings, 
there was no additional cost to the Company resulting from this restate and  
the disclosure in table 1a is therefore unchanged. The 2013 figure also reflects 
the impact of the investment earnings under the superannuation fund; the 
accrued lump sum benefit as at 31 December 2013 calculated by reference  
to Sam’s base salary as set out in (a) above was A$7,811,427. The additional 
Company contribution on a defined contribution basis for 2013 was A$66,000 
(2012: A$64,000).  
Fees received from external appointments 
In 2013 Sam received A$27,282 (2012: A$161,011) in respect of his position  
as a non-executive director of Seven West Media Limited from which he stood 
down in January 2013. 
Service contract 
Sam’s employment concludes, without the need for either party to give notice, 
on 31 December 2015. The Company may also terminate his employment for 
any reason on 31 December 2014, provided it gives notice of this decision by  
31 October 2014. The Company or Sam may terminate this employment at any 
time by giving written notice of 12 months or such lesser period as may exist 
between the date on which the notice is given and 31 December 2014. 
Other 
The Company paid for various standard relocation costs associated with  
Sam’s move from Perth, Australia to London of approximately A$206,000.

Chris Lynch (chief financial officer) 
Single total figure of remuneration 
The table below provides a summary of actual remuneration in respect of 2013 
and the prior year in accordance with UK legislation, stated in pounds sterling, 
the currency of Chris’s arrangements. This is in addition to the Australian 
statutory disclosure requirements set out in US dollars in tables 1a and 1b on 
pages 98 to 100. The remuneration details for 2013 set out in table 1a include 
theoretical accounting values relating to various parts of the remuneration 
packages, most notably LTIP arrangements, and require a different 
methodology for calculating the pension value. Accordingly, the figures below 
are not directly comparable with those in table 1a. 
Remuneration for 2012 related to Chris’s role as a non-executive director. 
Remuneration for 2013 has been split for the period Chris was a non-executive 
director up until 28 February 2013 and for the period from 1 March 2013  
(the day he became an executive director) to 31 December 2013.

ownership in shares to three times his salary as chief financial officer. 
Pension 
Chris is employed in the UK and is provided with pension benefits on a defined 
contribution basis. 
The Company paid a pension contribution to a funded UK company pension 
arrangement of 25 per cent of £135,000, being the current maximum salary  
on which pension contributions are based under that arrangement, pro rata for 
the period from 1 March 2013. The pension contribution for 2013 was £28,000. 
Chris also received a cash supplement equal to 25 per cent of the amount by 
which his base salary exceeded £135,000, less any applicable withholdings, and 
again pro rata for the period from 1 March 2013. The gross cash supplement  
for 2013 was £139,000. 
Service contract 
Chris Lynch’s employment concludes, without the need for either party to  
give notice, on 28 February 2017. The Company may terminate Chris Lynch’s 
employment for any reason on 29 February 2016, provided it gives notice  
of this decision by 31 December 2015. The Company or Chris may terminate 
this employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such 
lesser period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
29 February 2016. 
Other 
The Company paid for various standard one-off relocation costs associated with 
Chris’s move from Melbourne to London and he received transitional housing 
support including house purchase assistance. As a UK contracted employee,  
he is not eligible for tax equalisation on his remuneration, cost of living or any 
other ongoing assignment benefits such as housing allowance. The amounts 
are included in note (e) under the table on page 85.  
Tom Albanese (former chief executive)  
Single total figure of remuneration  
The table below provides a summary of actual remuneration in respect of 2013 
and prior years in accordance with UK legislation, stated in pounds sterling, the 
currency of Tom’s arrangements. This is in addition to the Australian statutory 
disclosure requirements set out in US dollars in table 1a on pages 98 and 99. 
The remuneration details set out in table 1a include theoretical accounting 
values relating to various parts of the remuneration packages, most notably 
LTIP arrangements, and require a different methodology for calculating the 
pension value. Accordingly, the figures below are not directly comparable with 
those in table 1a.

on which pension contributions are based under that arrangement, pro rata for 
the period from 1 March 2013. The pension contribution for 2013 was £28,000. 
Chris also received a cash supplement equal to 25 per cent of the amount by 
which his base salary exceeded £135,000, less any applicable withholdings, and 
again pro rata for the period from 1 March 2013. The gross cash supplement  
for 2013 was £139,000. 
Service contract

employment for any reason on 29 February 2016, provided it gives notice  
of this decision by 31 December 2015. The Company or Chris may terminate 
this employment at any time by giving written notice of 12 months or such 
lesser period as may exist between the date on which the notice is given and  
29 February 2016.

Pension 
Tom’s target defined benefit pension was equal to two-thirds of basic salary  
at age 60, through funded and unfunded arrangements as provided to other 
UK-based employees. This was inclusive of benefits accrued in the US.  
Normal retirement date is age 60 and the accrued pension is subject to 
actuarial reduction if taken before that age. 
The accrued pension as at 16 July 2013 was £559,000 per annum,  
(31 December 2012: £522,000 per annum). 
Past-director payments 
Tom stepped down as a director on 17 January 2013 and left the Group on  
16 July 2013. Until that date, he received his base salary, benefits and pension 
contributions.  
The base salary paid, pension and other benefits for the period 18 January 2013 
through to 16 July 2013 were £520,500, £555,000 and £570,000 respectively. 
Other benefits included a one-off payment of £482,000 relating to a contractual 
tax equalisation payment relating to his employment prior to his appointment 
as chief executive, on exercised share options. 
Tom returned to the US prior to his termination date, and is eligible to receive 
post-retirement medical coverage in the US for himself and his spouse, in line 
with contractual commitments.  
He received his 2009 performance share and the 2010 share option awards,

share options prior to 16 July 2013.

annum. Tom was required to join the US defined contribution pension plan on 
his return to the US prior to 16 July 2013. Tom’s target defined benefit pension 
was reduced by the actuarial value of the Company’s contributions to the 
defined contribution pension plan so that he received no additional benefit.  
The Company’s contribution to the US defined contribution pension plan was 
£11,000 (31 December 2012: £nil). 
When he left the Group, all outstanding but unvested LTIP and BDP awards

to the Group. As reported last year, the full value of the 2013 STIP will be paid in  
March 2014. 
(c) Based on the value of the LTIP awards which vested in respect of the performance 
period that ended 31 December. The Rio Tinto plc share price used to calculate the 
value of the award vesting on 17 February 2014 of £35.59 was sourced from Investis 
Ltd. The performance conditions for awards vesting for the period ending 31 December 
2013 are detailed in the notes to table 3 on pages 106 to 108. 
(d) Pension reflects the value of the pension accrued during the year assuming that  
it was to come into payment immediately. This differs from the value reported in  
table 1a which is calculated using an IAS19 methodology and assumptions on rates  
of investment return, inflation and salary increases. The pension was subject to an 
actuarial reduction to take its early payment into account and as a result the value  
at the end of the year is less than the value at the beginning of the year. The figures 
disclosed for prior years have been restated in accordance with the new UK reporting 
requirements. The previous figures disclosed for 2012 and 2011 were £382,000 and 
£351,000 respectively.

As reported last year, Guy’s base sala ry of £738,000 was not increased effective 
1 March 2013 and his base salary remained at this level until his retirement on 
31 December 2013. 
STIP individual objectives for 2013 
Guy’s individual objectives were similar to Chris Lynch’s save that a key 
objective was to ensure an orderly successi on for the next chief financial officer. 
Guy ceased to be chief financial officer in April and left the Executive 
Committee at that time. Guy remained a director and attended all board 
meetings for the balance of the year.  
The Committee, with input from the chief executive, assessed Guy’s 
performance against his individual objectives as 60 per cent (out of 200  
per cent) for his individual contribution to the business during the year.

(a) The committee decided that the overall STIP outcome would be reduced  
by ten per cent for the project cost overrun in relation to the Kitimat  
modernisation project. 
As a result, Guy received a STIP award of 93.2 per cent of target, equivalent  
to 111.9 per cent of base salary, 100 per cent to be delivered wholly in cash 
(due to him having retired at the end of December 2013) in March 2014.  
LTIP outcomes for the period ended 31 December 2013 
Guy received 44,374 shares in Rio Tinto plc on 17 February 2014 from  
the vesting of the PSP awarded in 2010. He also received a cash payment  
of £141,495 equal to the aggregate net dividends that would have been paid  
on the shares that vested had he owne d them during that four year-period.  
No dividends were paid in respect of the shares that lapsed. 
Guy has an option over 59,708 shares at a price of £42.45 per share from  
the vesting of the SOP granted in 2011 . The market price of Rio Tinto plc  
shares at 17 February 2014 being the la test practicable date before the date  
of publication of this report was £35.59 . These options can be exercised from  
6 May 2014 and Guy will have until 6 May 2015 to exercise the options. Further 
details of the awards vesting in 2014 and in prior years are provided on page  
95 in table 3 and on pages 102 to 108. 
LTIP award granted in 2013

unfunded arrangements as provided to other UK-based employees.  
Normal retirement date is age 60 and the accrued pension is subject to 
actuarial reduction if taken before that age. 
The accrued pension as at 31 December 2013 was £531,000 per annum,  
(31 December 2012: £547,000 per annum). The pension was subject to an 
actuarial reduction to take its early pa yment into account and as a result the 
value at the end of the year is less than the value at the beginning of the year. 
Fees received from external appointments 
In 2013 Guy Elliott received US$225,764 in respect of his position as a  
non-executive director of Royal Dutch Shell (2012: US$212,147). Fees of

shares at 17 February 2014 being the la test practicable date before the date  
of publication of this report was £35.59 . These options can be exercised from  
6 May 2014 and Guy will have until 6 May 2015 to exercise the options. Further 
details of the awards vesting in 2014 and in prior years are provided on page  
95 in table 3 and on pages 102 to 108. 
LTIP award granted in 2013 
The Committee determined that no LT IP award would be granted to Guy  
for 2013.  
Pension 
Guy’s target defined benefit pension is equal to 2.3 per cent of basic salary  
for each year of service with the Company to age 60, through funded and 
unfunded arrangements as provided to other UK-based employees.  
Normal retirement date is age 60 and the accrued pension is subject to 
actuarial reduction if taken before that age. 
The accrued pension as at 31 December 2013 was £531,000 per annum,  
(31 December 2012: £547,000 per annum). The pension was subject to an 
actuarial reduction to take its early pa yment into account and as a result the 
value at the end of the year is less than the value at the beginning of the year. 
Fees received from external appointments 
In 2013 Guy Elliott received US$225,764 in respect of his position as a  
non-executive director of Royal Dutch Shell (2012: US$212,147). Fees of 
US$83,706 (2012: US$nil) received by Gu y Elliott in respect of his position  
as a non-executive director of SABMiller were paid to Rio Tinto pursuant  
to an arrangement agreed with Guy. 
Retirement 
Guy retired on 31 December 2013. During 2013, he received his contractual 
remuneration, including base pay, eligibility for STIP, benefits and pension 
contributions, until his retirement date. 
Upon his retirement, good leaver trea tment and pro-rating, where applicable, 
was applied to outstanding LTIP awards in accordance with the plan rules. He 
will also receive a payment for 23.5 days outstanding unused annual leave of 
£66,704. In accordance with his contractua l commitments, he is also eligible for 
post-retirement medical insurance under the Rio Tinto Medical Expenses Plan, 
subject to the rules of the plan.

(a) The Chairman’s fee was increased with effe ct from 1 July 2013 to £730,000 per annum 
from £700,000, the level at which it was set when he was appointed to the role in 
March 2009. This adjustment reflected the increasing demands on the role, the 
performance in the role, and comparison with external peers.  
(b) The fees payable to non-executive directors are subject to review by the board on the 
recommendation of the Chairman’s Committee. Following a review, taking into 
account the demands on directors, market and related developments, the base fee for 
non-executive directors was increased to £90,000 with effect from 1 January 2014. 
There have been no changes to other fees or allowances since 1 January 2012, save 
that the travel allowances are now based on length of flights (unchanged) rather than 
whether the travel is overseas.  
Details of each element of remuneration and the single total figure of 
remuneration paid to the chairman an d non-executive directors during  
2013 and 2012 are set out in US dollars in table 1b on page 100. No post-
employment, termination payments or share-based payments were made. 
Where the payment of statutory mini mum superannuation contributions  
for non-executive directors is required by Australian superannuation law,  
these contributions are deducted from the director’s overall fee entitlements. 
The total fee and allowances payments made to the chairman and non-
executive directors in 2013 are within the maximum aggregate annual amount 
of £3 million set out in the Group’s co nstitutional documents approved by 
shareholders at the 2009 annual general meetings. 
 
Share ownership policy for non-executive directors 
The board, in 2006, adopted a policy whereby non-executive directors are 
encouraged to build up a shareholding within three years of their appointment 
equal in value to one year’s base fee. Details of non-executive directors’  
share interests in the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2  
on page 101.

What we paid our other Executive Committee members  
and why 
Base salary 
The Committee has reviewed the base salary levels and, for the majority of  
the executives, made adjustments in line with the base salary budgets applying 
to the broader employee population.  
In one case, namely Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the chief executive, Copper,  
a further adjustment was made, taking into account performance and  
a base salary significantly below internal and external peers.

STIP objectives and outcomes for 2013 
Overview of STIP weightings and measures for 2013 
The following table provides an overview of the measures and weightings used 
to determine STIP awards for members of the Executive Committee in 2013: 
 
Weighting for 
executive 
directors and 
Group 
executives
Weighting for 
PGCEOs
Safety – split equally between LTIFR and AIFR 
and adjusted for fatalities 20% 20%
Financial measures split equally between 
underlying earnings & cash flow for the Group 50% 20%
Financial measures split equally between 
underlying earnings and cash flow for the 
relevant product group 0% 30%
Individual measures based on key strategic 
initiatives of each role and contribution to 
overall company performance 30% 30%
The average performance against individual safety goals for Executive Committee 
members was below target, and for individual financial goals, above target. 
The individual performance of Executive Committee members who are not 
executive directors was reviewed by the Committee against these measures 
and, on average, was considered above target. This reflected, among other 
things, the outstanding performance against the cost reduction targets set  
for 2013. 
Downward adjustments of 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively were 
applied to the former Group executive, Technology & Innovation and the  
chief executive, Aluminium for the project cost overrun in relation to the  
Kitimat modernisation project.

Remuneration Report: Implementation Report continued 
LTIP awards granted in 2013 
The maximum potential value of PSP awards granted in 2013 was 438 per cent 
of base salary. The Committee decided that the PSP awards in 2013 would  
have a face value of awards as shown in the table below. The eventual value  
of the award will depend on the Group’s relative TSR and relative EBIT margin 
performance during the years 2013-2017. Half of the award may vest after  
four years in 2017, and half the award may vest after five years in 2018.  
The performance conditions for the awards granted in 2013 are consistent  
with the performance conditions for awards to be granted in 2014 as set  
out below. 
LTIP awards for 2014 
The Committee has decided that the PSP awards in 2014 will have a face  
value of awards as shown in the table below. The award levels have been set  
to incentivise executives to meet the long-term strategic goals of the Group,  
to provide retention and to contribute towards the competitiveness of the 
overall remuneration package. The average face value of awards to be made  
to Executive Committee members in 2014 is 405 per cent of base salary  
(2013: 380 per cent).

The performance conditions for the awards made in 2014 and 2013 are the 
same. The expected value of the awards in both years is equal to 50 per cent of 
the face value. The percentage vesting at threshold performance in both years 
is 22.5 per cent. The 2014 award may vest after five years in 2019, subject to 
the Group’s relative TSR and relative EBIT margin performance.  
For the TSR component (constituting two-thirds of the award), where TSR 
performance is measured against both the HSBC Global Mining Index and the 
broader market of large global companies as measured through the Morgan 
Stanley Capital World Index, the award will vest as follows: 
            
 
Outperformance of the index by 6 per cent 
per annum  
1.0 x award vests 
Performance between equal to the 
index and 6 per cent outperformance  
Proportionate vesting between  
0.225 x and 1.0 x vesting 
Performance equal to the index 0.225 x award vests 
Performance less than the index Nil vesting 
For the EBIT margin measure, change in the EBIT margin of Rio Tinto and each 
of the comparator companies (measured on a “point-to-point” basis using the 
last financial year in the performance period and the financial year prior to the 
start of the performance period) will be calculated using independent third-
party data. Vesting will be subject to Rio Tinto’s interpolated ranking position 
using the following schedule: 
 
Equal to or greater than 2nd ranked company 1.0 x award vests 
Between the 5th and 2nd ranked companies Proportionate vesting between 
0.225 x and 1.0 x vesting 
Above the 6th ranked company 0.225 x award vests 
Equal to the 6th ranked company or below Nil vesting 
The 2014 comparator group (unchanged from 2013) for the EBIT margin 
measure is: Alcoa, Antofagasta, Anglo American, Barrick Gold, BHP Billiton, 
Freeport McMoRan, Glencore-Xstrata, Peabody, Teck Resources and Vale.  
Post-employment benefits 
Executives may participate in pension, superannuation and post-employment 
medical and life insurance benefits, which are typically offered to the broader 
employee population in similar locations.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: 
REMUNERATION REPORT: Implementation Report FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
STIP measures, weightings and targets for 2014 
As in 2013, the STIP measures and opportunities for executives will be weighted 
50 per cent for financial, 30 per cent for individual and 20 per cent for safety 
measures. The financial and individual targets which have been set for 2014  
are regarded by the Board to be commercially sensitive. As such, the specific 
targets for these measures, and the performance against them, will be 
described retrospectively in the 2014 Implementation Report. The Group 
financial targets relate to earnings and cash flow. The individual targets include 
objectives relating to business transformation, cost reduction, performance 
delivery and leadership and engagement. 
The safety measures, weightings and targets for 2014 are outlined below. 
2014 safety measures, weightings and targets 
The safety measures for all executives in 2013 were split equally between  
LTIFR and AIFR. For 2014, the AIFR measure will continue to apply. However,  
as LTIFR is a subset of AIFR, we have decided that the equal weighting measure 
to apply alongside AIFR will be the actual count of lost time injuries (LTIs).  
This is intended to bring a greater focus to the actual injuries resulting in lost 
time during the year.  
Threshold will be set at the average of the prior three years performance for the 
Group and target at a four per cent impr ovement over threshold for LTIs and  
seven per cent improvement over thresh old for AIFR. Outstanding performance 
will be set at twice the percentage im provement between threshold and target. 
The adjustment for fatalities, which has been applied in prior years has been 
strengthened to align with the zero fatality target and simplified. The new 
fatality adjustment, in the event a fatality occurs, is:  
For the PGCEO of the product group in which the fatality occurs, the chief 
executive and the Group executive, Organisational Resources, the safety 
score is reduced by 50 per cent. 
For the chief financial officer and the Group executive, Legal, External & 
Regulatory Affairs, the safety score is reduced by 25 per cent. 
 
When remuneration is delivered 
The following chart demonstrates the usual timeframe for the delive ry of the components of remune ration, using 2013 as an example. 
 
(a) PSP awards are typically allocated in March. The 2013 awards we re allocated on 27 May 2013 after shareholders approved the new PSP. 
(b) PSP awards have a five-year performance period to provide long-term alignment with shareholders. As a transitional measure, awa rds granted in 2013 will vest 50 per cent after four 
years and 50 per cent after five years.

Single total figure of remuneration 
The table below provides a summary of actual remuneration in respect of 2013 and 2012, stated in the currency of payment. While not required under UK or 
Australian legislation, the information is presented for consistency with the disclosures for executive directors on pages 82 to 88. This is in addition to the Australian 
statutory disclosure requirements set out in US dollars in table 1a on pages 98 and 99. The remuneration details set out in table 1a include theoretical accounting 
values relating to various parts of the remuneration packages, most notably LTIP arrangements, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension and 
superannuation values. Accordingly, the figures below are not directly comparable with those in table 1a.

Single total figure of remuneration 
The table below provides a summary of actual remuneration in respect of 2013 and 2012, stated in the currency of payment. While not required under UK or 
Australian legislation, the information is presented for consistency with the disclosures for executive directors on pages 82 to 88. This is in addition to the Australian 
statutory disclosure requirements set out in US dollars in table 1a on pages 98 and 99. The remuneration details set out in table 1a include theoretical accounting 
values relating to various parts of the remuneration packages, most notably LTIP arrangements, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension and 
superannuation values. Accordingly, the figures below are not directly comparable with those in table 1a.

Context to outcomes for the Executive Committee 
The increase in total remuneration for most executives is primarily driven by the sign ificant change in the value of LTIP award s vesting in 2013 compared to 2012  
and relatively higher STIP awards for 2013.  
Hugo Bague, Alan Davies, Andrew Harding, Harry Kenyon-Slaney an d Debra Valentine did not participate in the 2009 PSP awards whi ch vested with respect to  
the performance period that ended 31 December 2012 as their aw ards for 2009 comprised awards under the MSP and SOP. The 2009 aw ards under the 2009 MSP 
and 2009 SOP had performance periods that ended 31 December 2011. Awards under the 2010 SOP which vested with respect to the pe rformance period ending  
31 December 2012 had minimal value in terms of 2012 remuneration due to the share price at the ti me of vesting being close to o r below the option exercise price. 
Alan Davies and Debra Valentine also had awards of MSP shares wh ich vested with respect to the performance period ending 31 Dec ember 2012.  
The increase in remuneration for Alan Davies reflects that his 2012 remuneration represents part year remuneration for the peri od 1 September 2012 to  
31 December 2012. The increases for Preston Chiaro and Jacynthe Côté reflect higher STIP awards in 2013 compared to 2012 due to significantly higher  
discretionary downward adjustments being made to their 2012 STIP awards. The decreases in remuneration for Bret Clayton and Doug Ritchie reflects that  
their 2013 remuneration represents part year remuneration for the periods 1 January 2013 to 1 March 2013 and 1 January 2013 to 17 January 2013 respectively.

Long-term incentives – awards made prior to 2013 
In 2012 and prior years, awards were made in the form of options under  
the Share Option Plan (SOP) and/or performance shares under the PSP.  
From 2011, executives were able to express a preference regarding the mix  
of their long-term incentive opportunity. 
They could choose either a mix of pe rformance shares and share options 
(with a maximum face value performance share award of 200 per cent of 
base salary, and a performance “kicker” leading to a vesting up to 1.5 times 
for exceptional performance), together with a maximum share option award 
of 300 per cent of base salary.  
Or alternatively, they could choose to receive the full award in performance 
shares (with a maximum face value performance share award of 292 per cent 
of base salary, and a performance kicker leading to a vesting up to 1.5 times 
for exceptional performance). 
The maximum value of award from selecting the full award in  
performance shares was therefore 438 per cent of base salary (292 per cent  
x 150 per cent).  
The total expected value of awards ma de under either preference was the 
same, at 190 per cent of base salary.  
Both awards were based solely on relative TSR performance to reward 
executives for increasing the share price and delivering superior TSR 
performance against other companies over a long-term timeframe.  
Before awards vest, the Committee must also satisfy itself that TSR 
performance is an appropriate reflection of the underlying performance of  
the business and/or the health of th e Group. The Committee may therefore 
adjust vesting subject to the plan rules. 
Long-term incentives – vesting outcomes for the period ended 
31 December 2013 
The awards with performance periods ending 31 December 2013 were the 2010 
PSP awards and the 2011 SOP awards.

to the relevant index over the performanc e period has a direct impact on the 
levels of LTIP vesting. 
The effect of this performance on shareholder wealth, as measured by  
TSR delivered during the relevant calendar year, is detailed in the table.

(a) Tom Albanese held the role of chief executive until 17 January 2013, and left the 
Group on 16 July 2013. The single total figu re of remuneration for Tom Albanese  
for 2013 is for the period up until 17 January 2013. Sam Walsh took over as chief 
executive from 17 January 2013, having previously been the chief executive, Iron Ore 
and Australia. 
(b) In 2011, Sam Walsh elected to receive his full LTIP award under the PSP and as  
a result he has no options under the SOP that were granted in 2011 and which had  
a performance period that ended on 31 December 2013. 
(c) All outstanding but unvested LTIP awards earned in previous years lapsed and were 
forfeited when Tom Albanese left the Group. 
Employee share plans 
Management Share Plan (MSP) 
The primary focus of the MSP is to su pport the Group’s ability to attract and 
retain key staff below executive level in an increasingly tight and competitive 
labour market. Executives are not el igible to participate in the MSP.  
Retention of key individuals is also important given the long-term nature  
of the delivery of the business strategy. MSP awards are conditional awards  
not subject to a performance condition as they vest subject to continued 
employment, at the end of three years, and thus act as an effective retention 
tool. Shares to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market and no new 
shares are issued. 
All employee share plans 
Executives may participate in broad-based share and share option plans  
which are available to Group employees generally and for which performance 
conditions do not apply. These plans form part of standard remuneration 
practice whereby employees are offered participation in plans to encourage 
alignment with the long-term performance of the Group. 
Global employee share plan  
The Committee believes that all employees should be given the opportunity  
to become shareholders in our business. A global employee share purchase 
plan is normally offered to all eligible employees across the world save for any 
local jurisdictional restrictions. Under the plan employees may acquire shares 
up to the value of US$5,000 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year, capped 
at ten per cent of base salary. Each share purchased will be matched by the 
Company providing the participant holds the shares, and remains employed,  
at the end of the three-year vesting pe riod. The Committee believes this plan 
will serve to engage, retain and moti vate employees over the long-term.  
The current participation rate is now 20 per cent of employees, which means 
that over 12,000 of our employees are shareholders. 
Dilution 
Awards under the SOP, PSP and all employee plans may be satisfied by 
treasury shares, the issue of new shares or the purchase of shares in the 
market. Currently, Rio Tinto plc satisfies these awards by the issue of new 
shares or the transfer of shares from treasury. Rio Tinto Limited currently 
satisfies these awards by the market purchase and delivery of shares to plan 
participants. In the UK institutions have issued corporate governance guidelines 
in relation to the issue of new shares wi th which Rio Tinto plc complies (they  
do not apply to Rio Tinto Limited). All other share awards are satisfied by the 
use of shares which are purchased in the market. Further information in respect 
of the number of shares issued under plan arrangements can be found in note 
44 to the financial statements.

that no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt about the ability  
of the Companies and the Group to continue as a going concern have been 
identified, and they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore, these financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis.

(c) Rio Tinto gained control of the non Oyu Tolgoi LLC (OT) assets of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (Turquoise Hill, formerly Ivanhoe Mines Limited) on 24 January 2012 when its  
share reached 51 per cent.  
Within newly consolidated operations for 31 December 2012, US$2,678 million represents non-controlling interests in the non OT assets, of which US$1,439 million is the 49 per cent  
non-controlling interest in net loans receivable from Rio Tinto Group companies. Refer to note 37.  
(d) Rio Tinto acquired a controlling interest in Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in 2012, with consolidation effective from 3 September 2012 (the acquisition date). US$224 million within  
newly consolidated operations relates to the fair value of non-controlling interests at the acquisition date. Refer to note 37. 
(e) The majority of the adjustments to equity held by Rio Tinto in 2012 arose from the acquisition by a consortium led by Chalco of shares in Simfer Jersey Limited, a Rio Tinto subsidiary,  
as set out in the Simandou Joint Development Agreement (SJDA). Chalco made a payment of US$1.35 billion on 24 April 2012 in exchange for an equity interest of 47 per cent in Simfer 
Jersey, reimbursing Rio Tinto for historic project costs. The transfer on 24 April 2012 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$1.05 billion, 
relating to the amount received over Rio Tinto’s carrying value of the interest transferred. 
(f) Equity issued to holders of non-controlling interests in 2012 include US$0.9 billion of proceeds from a rights offering by Turquoise Hill, and cash calls of US$480 million following the 
transfer described in (e), which resulted in the Chalco consortium being issued with additional equity interest in proportion to its interest. 
(g) The purchase of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM, formerly Riversdale Mining Limited) in 2011 was treated as a step acquisition. Non-controlling interests of US$1,498 million arose  
at the acquisition date, when Rio Tinto’s share in RTCM reached 52.6 per cent. These non-controlling interests reversed as Rio Tinto increased its interests in RTCM to 100 per cent.  
An amount of US$479 million was recognised directly in equity in relation to Rio Tinto’s interests purchased after the acquisition date, representing the excess of consideration paid  
to acquire these additional shareholdings, over non-controlling interests acquired. Refer to note 37. 
(h) A reduction of US$339 million in non-controlling interests arose as Rio Tinto increased its economic share in OT through the acquisition of additional interests in Turquoise Hill. 
Adjustments to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$129 million related to the aggregate excess of consideration paid for the additional investments in  
Turquoise Hill, over the value of the additional economic share acquired in OT. Refer to note 37. 
(i) In relation to the Group’s purchase of an additional stake in Coal & Allied, adjustments to retained earnings of US$185 million were made for the excess of consideration paid  
to acquire shareholdings of US$45 million from non-controlling interests. 
(j) Comparative information has been restated to reflect a number of new accounting standards. See note 46 on page 191.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS), which differs in certain respects  
from the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). 
Prior to 1 January 2004, the Group’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Under EU IFRS goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998,  
which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group’s UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules  
governing the transition to EU IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity.  
As a consequence, shareholders’ funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$550 million at 31 December 2013  
(2012: US$535 million; 2011: US$537 million). 
Save for the exception described above, the Group’s financial statements drawn up in accordance with EU IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.  
Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements 
The Rio Tinto Group  
These are the financial statements of the Group formed through the merger of economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  (‘‘Merger’’), and presented 
by both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited as their consolidated accounts in accordance with both United Kingdom and Australian legislation and regulations. 
Merger terms 
On 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, which are listed respectively on Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom and  Australia, entered into  
a dual listed companies (DLC) merger. This was effected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plc’s Memorandum  
and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution.  
As a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role. 
In particular, the arrangements: 
confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups; 
provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure; 
provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions; and 
provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure  
in which the public shareholders of the two companies effectively vote on a joint basis.  
The merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares  
or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each company  
of one special voting share to a trustee company which provides the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders. During 2002, each of the parent companies 
issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure. 
Accounting standards 
The financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with EU IFRS. The Merger was accounted for as a merger under UK GAAP. As permitted under the rules 
governing the transition to EU IFRS, which are set out in IFRS 1, the Group did not restate business combinations that occurred before the transition date of 1 January 
2004. As a result, the DLC merger of economic interests described above continues to be accounted for as a merger under EU IFRS. 
The main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the statement of financial position of the merged Group includes the assets  
and liabilities of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, 
rather than at their fair values at the date of the merger. For accounting purposes Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single public parent company 
(with their respective public shareholders being the shareholders in that single company). As a result the amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto 
Limited public shareholders are included in the amounts attributed to owners of Rio Tinto on the statement of financial position, income statement and statement  
of comprehensive income. 
Australian Corporations Act 
The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities 
and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012). The main provisions of the order are that the financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with IFRS and include a reconciliation from EU IFRS to the Australian equivalents of IFRS (see above).

1  Principal accounting policies 
Corporate information 
The financial statements of the Group (as defined in (b) Basis of consolidation below) were authorised for issue in accordance with a directors’ resolution on  
5 March 2014. Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are listed and incorporated respectively on Stock Exchanges in the UK and Australia. Rio Tinto plc’s registered 
office is at 2 Eastbourne Terrace, London W2 6LG, UK. Rio Tinto Limited’s registered office is at 120 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia, 3000. 
Rio Tinto’s business is finding, mining and processing mineral resources. Major products are iron ore, aluminium, copper, diamonds, coal, uranium, gold and 
industrial minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt). Activities span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North America with significant 
businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America. Information on the Group’s structure is provided in notes 33 to 36. Information on other related party 
relationships of the Group is provided in note 40. 
Basis of preparation 
The basis of preparation and the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 are set out below. 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union (EU IFRS) and with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS) and 
interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and adopted by the EU that are mandatory or, in certain cases permitted  
to be early-adopted, for the year ended 31 December 2013, the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and in accordance with  
applicable UK law, applicable Australian law as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended  
on 17 February 2012) and Article 4 of the European Union IAS regulation. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis (page 109). 
The EU IFRS financial information has been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year to  
31 December 2012, except for the changes in accounting requirements set out below. The impact of these changes in accounting requirements on the statement  
of financial position as at 1 January 2012, together with the impact on the income statement for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, are set 
out on pages 191 to 192. Material impacts on the primary statements for prior periods presented are explained below. With the exception of IFRS 13 and IAS 19 
(revised 2011), all of the changes were effective from 1 January 2011, the earliest period presented in these financial statements. Application of IAS 19 (revised 2011) 
is fully retrospective. 
Annual Improvements 2011. These Annual Improvements address six areas, none of which materially impacted the Group’s primary statements. 
Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income”. The amendment requires  
items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) to be grouped on the basis of whether they can potentially be reclassified to the income statement 
(reclassification adjustments). Tax applicable to these items is grouped on the same basis. The Group’s statement of comprehensive income for the years  
ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012 has been re-presented accordingly. 
IAS 19 (revised 2011) “Employee Benefits” (IAS 19R). The amendment to IAS 19 requires the expected return on plan assets to assume returns in line with  
the discount rate applied in the calculation of the pension obligation, whereas the previous standard allowed an assumed rate based on plan assets actually held 
which generally gave a higher rate. The income statement impact on the expected return on assets is offset in actuarial gains and losses within the Statement  
of comprehensive income. The amendment also changes the timing of recognition of past service cost. 
IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” and IAS 28 (revised 2011) “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”. 
IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28 are not mandatory under EU IFRS until 2014, however, early adoption is permitted and the Group has chosen to early-adopt.  
IFRS 10 replaces previous guidance on control and consolidation in IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” and SIC 12 “Consolidation – Special 
Purpose Entities”. It provides a revised definition of control to be used as the basis for determining which entities are consolidated in the financial statements.  
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures”. The classification and subsequent accounting for joint arrangements now depends on the rights and 
obligations of the parties to the arrangement and not just the legal form. These standards have been adopted with effect from 1 January 2011. 
All entities and arrangements within the Group have been reviewed to assess the impact of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. As a result certain operations (including 
Queensland Alumina Limited, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited, and Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc.) that were previously equity accounted are now 
accounted for as Joint Operations. These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control indicating that the 
parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received 
from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations for the liabilities. It is these facts and circumstances that give rise to the 
classification as Joint Operations. As a result the Group no longer recognises “Investments in equity accounted units” or “Share of profit/(loss) after tax of equity 
accounted units” or “Impairment after tax of investments in equity accounted units” for these arrangements, but instead consolidates its share of their assets, 
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows on a line-by-line basis. The reduction in “Investments in equity accounted units” and increase in other assets shown 
in the restated Statement of financial position at 1 January 2012 also results in a reallocation of the 2012 impairment charge. Under IFRS the impairment charge  
is allocated to goodwill before other assets; the goodwill that is recognised in the restated Statement of financial position at 1 January 2012 is therefore impaired 
before certain other assets in 2012. This results in an increase of US$1.4 billion in the allocation of the impairment charge to goodwill, with a corresponding 
decrease in the allocation to “Property, plant and equipment”, “Investments in equity accounted units” and “Intangible assets” as well as an increase in  
“Deferred tax liabilities”. There is no change in the total Aluminium businesses’ post-tax impairment charge for 2012 as a result of these changes. 
IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”. IFRS 12 includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities. This disclosure is 
included in notes 33 to 36. 
IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. IFRS 13 is prospective in application. It establishes a single source of guidance for all fair value measurements. The standard 
provides guidance on how to measure fair value when fair value is required or permitted under other standards. It does not change when an entity is required to 
use fair value. For the year ended 31 December 2013, this has resulted in some minor changes to the method of valuation of embedded commodity derivatives.

IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. IFRS 13 is prospective in application. It establishes a single source of guidance for all fair value measurements. The standard 
provides guidance on how to measure fair value when fair value is required or permitted under other standards. It does not change when an entity is required to 
use fair value. For the year ended 31 December 2013, this has resulted in some minor changes to the method of valuation of embedded commodity derivatives.

IFRIC 20 “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine”. In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste 
materials in order to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as 
stripping. The Group capitalises pre-production stripping costs incurred during the development of a mine (or pit) as part of the investment in construction of the 
mine (or pit). These costs are subsequently amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis. This accounting treatment is unchanged  
by the implementation of IFRIC 20 which specifies the accounting for production phase stripping costs only. The Group’s accounting policy for production phase 
stripping costs for 2012 and previous years was to defer costs where this was the most appropriate basis for matching the costs against the related economic 
benefits and the effect was material. Implementation of IFRIC 20 has changed the way in which the Group accounts for production phase stripping costs and 
resulted in a write-off to retained earnings on implementation. IFRIC 20 is not fully retrospective; the impact of adoption is calculated as at 1 January 2011 and 
comparatives are restated from that point. On implementation of IFRIC 20, capitalised production phase stripping costs could only be carried forward if they could 
be identified with a remaining component of the orebody for the relevant business unit. A net amount of US$0.7 billion was therefore written off these capitalised 
costs (pre-tax and non-controlling interests) which reduced retained earnings at 1 January 2011 by US$0.4 billion post tax and non-controlling interests. 
Amendments to IAS 36 “Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-financial Assets”. The amendment clarifies the disclosures required in relation to the 
recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The Group has early adopted the amendment and the related 
disclosures are included in note 6.  
The Group has not applied the following pronouncements which are not mandatory for 2013: 
Mandatory for 2014  
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. The amendment has been endorsed  
by the EU. 
IFRIC 21 “Levies” clarifies when to recognise a liability to pay a levy. A levy is an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that is imposed by 
governments on entities in accordance with legislation. IFRIC 21 does not apply to items that are within the scope of other Standards (such as income taxes  
that are within the scope of IAS 12 Income Taxes) or fines and penalties. IFRIC 21 has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
Mandatory for 2015 and beyond and not yet endorsed by the EU 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the parts of  
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. 
The Group is currently evaluating the impact of these pronouncements which are not currently expected to materially impact the Group’s earnings or  
shareholders’ funds.  
Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment in applying accounting policies and in making critical accounting estimates.  
These judgments and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience,  
but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such significant judgments and estimation is contained  
in the accounting policies and/or the Notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are summarised below. 
Areas of judgment that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: 
Merger accounting for the 1995 merger of the economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited into the dual listed companies (DLC) structure  
(see Dual listed companies structure on page 117);  
Acquisitions – note 1(b) and note 37;  
Review of asset carrying values, impairment charges and reversals and the recoverability of goodwill – note 1(e) and (i), note 6, note 12 and note 13; 
Estimation of asset lives – note 1(e) and (i);  
Determination of ore reserve estimates – note 1(j);  
Provision for onerous contracts – note 1(i) 
Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations – note 1(k);  
Deferral of stripping costs – note 1(h);  
Recognition of deferred tax on mining rights recognised in acquisitions – note 1(m) ; 
Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets – note 17 (d) and (f);  
Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs – note 1(f);  
Identification of functional currencies – note 1(d); 
Basis of consolidation – note 1(b); and 
Post-retirement cost assumptions – note 1(n). 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the  
next financial year are: 
Review of asset carrying values, impairment charges and reversals and the recoverability of goodwill – note1(e) and (i), note 6, note 12 and note 13; 
Estimation of close-down, restoration and environmental costs and the timing of expenditure – note 1(k) and note 26;  
Estimation of obligations for post-retirement costs – note 45;  
Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets – note 17(d) and (f);  
Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs – note 1(f); and 
Contingencies – note 31.  
These areas of judgment and estimation are discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates on page 129.   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

1  Principal accounting policies continued 
(a) Accounting convention 
The financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, and for the related comparative periods, has been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative contracts and financial assets, the impact of fair value hedge accounting  
on the hedged item and the accounting for post-retirement assets and obligations. The Group’s policy in respect of these items is set out in the notes below.  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated.  
(b) Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements comprise the consolidation of the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (together “the Companies”) and their respective 
subsidiaries (together “the Group”) together with the Group’s share of joint arrangements and associates accounted for as described below. 
All intragroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.  
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies  
into line with those used by the Group. 
Subsidiaries: Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Companies. Control exists where the Companies have: power over the entities, ie existing rights that give  
them the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the Companies’ returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns 
from their involvement with the entities; and the ability to use their power to affect those returns. 
Joint Arrangements: A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the Companies’ returns) require the unanimous consent  
of the parties sharing control. The Group has two types of joint arrangement: 
Joint Operations (JOs): A JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating  
to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the 
results of trading. In relation to its interest in a JO, the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities, revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its 
share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. These are incorporated into the Group’s financial statements  
under the appropriate headings. 
Joint Ventures (JVs): A JV is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted  
for using the equity accounting method.  
Associates: An associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is 
presumed to exist where there is neither control nor joint control and the Group has over 20 per cent of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that 
this is not the case. Significant influence can arise where the Group holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights if it has the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity accounting method.  
The Group uses the term “Equity accounted units” (EAUs) to refer to associates and JVs collectively. For all EAUs, the carrying value will include any long-term  
debt interests that in substance form part of the Group’s net investment. 
Under the equity accounting method the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods the 
carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group’s share of the EAUs’ retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
When the Group’s share of losses in an EAU equals or exceeds its interest in the EAU, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the EAU. 
Acquisitions 
Under the “acquisition” method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  
and contingent liabilities assumed (the identifiable net assets) on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition which is the date on which control is obtained. 
Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any shortfall is immediately recognised in the income statement.  
Costs related to the acquisition of a subsidiary are expensed as incurred.  
On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets or at fair value. In some cases, non-controlling interests may be treated as equity options and valued on that basis. Goodwill 
(see note (e)) and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests will differ depending on the basis used.  
Where the Group has a previously held non-controlling interest in the acquiree, this is remeasured to fair value at the date control is gained with any gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement. The cash cost of the share purchase that gives rise to control is included within “Investing activities” in the cash flow statement. 
Where the Group increases its ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net assets acquired 
is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is included within “Financing activities” in the cash flow statement. 
The results of businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control, joint control or significant 
influence commences.

Acquisitions 
Under the “acquisition” method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  
and contingent liabilities assumed (the identifiable net assets) on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition which is the date on which control is obtained. 
Provisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net

(see note (e)) and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests will differ depending on the basis used.  
Where the Group has a previously held non-controlling interest in the acquiree, this is remeasured to fair value at the date control is gained with any gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement. The cash cost of the share purchase that gives rise to control is included within “Investing activities” in the cash flow statement.

Disposals 
Individual non-current assets or “disposal groups” (ie groups of assets and liabilities) to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise in a single transaction, are classified  
as “held for sale” if the following criteria are met at the period end: 
the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use; and  
the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for such sales; and  
the sale is highly probable.  
Disposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The comparative statement of financial position is not 
restated. Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held at the fair value determined at the acquisition date. For these assets acquired for resale no profits  
or losses are recognised between the acquisition date and the disposal date, unless there is a subsequent impairment. 
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated.  
The results of businesses disposed of are included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on which control, joint control or significant influence 
ceases. The cash proceeds of disposals are included within “Investing activities” in the cash flow statement. If control is lost, any interest in the entity retained by  
the Group is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement. The retained interest may be subsequently 
accounted for as a joint venture, associate or financial asset depending on the facts. Any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect  
of the entity disposed of, or for which control, joint control or significant influence has ceased may be recycled to the income statement in proportion to the interest 
disposed of.  
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests where control is retained are recorded in equity. The cash proceeds of such disposals are included within 
“Financing activities” in the cash flow statement. 
(c) Sales revenue 
Sales revenue comprises sales to third parties at invoiced amounts. Most sales are priced ex works, free on board (fob) or cost, insurance and freight (cif). Amounts 
billed to customers in respect of shipping and handling are classified as sales revenue where the Group is responsible for carriage, insurance and freight. All shipping 
and handling costs incurred by the Group are recognised as operating costs. If the Group is acting solely as an agent, amounts billed to customers are offset against 
the relevant costs. Revenue from services is recognised as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. 
Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Mining royalties are presented as an operating cost or, where they are in substance a profit-based tax,  
within taxation. 
Revenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are included in sales revenue. Sundry revenue, incidental to the main revenue-generating activities 
of the operations, and which is a consequence of producing and selling the main products, is treated as a credit to operating costs.  
Third-party commodity swap arrangements for delivery and receipt of smelter grade alumina are offset within operating costs. 
Sales revenue is only recognised on individual sales when all of the following criteria are met: 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer;  
neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold, has been retained;  
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;  
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and  
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably.  
These conditions are generally satisfied when title passes to the customer. In most instances, sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered  
to the destination specified by the customer, which is typically the vessel on which it will be shipped, the destination port or the customer’s premises. 
The majority of the Group’s products are sold to customers under contracts, which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, with some volumes sold in the  
spot market. 
Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore  
volumes being sold on the spot market. Substantially all iron ore sales are reflected at final prices in the results for the period, based on the best available 
information at the period end.  
Sales revenue is commonly subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer. In such cases, sales revenue is initially recognised  
on a provisional basis using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal, and adjusted subsequently. 
Certain products are “provisionally priced”, ie the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period normally ranging from 30 to 180 days after  
delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. 
As is customary in the industry, revenue on provisionally-priced sales is recognised based on estimates of the fair value of the consideration receivable based on 
relevant forward market prices. At each reporting date, provisionally priced metal is marked to market based on the forward selling price for the quotational period 
stipulated in the contract. For this purpose, the selling price can be measured reliably for those products, such as copper, for which there exists an active and  
freely-traded commodity market such as the London Metals Exchange and the value of product sold by the Group is directly linked to the form in which it is traded 
on that market. 
The marking to market of provisionally-priced sales contracts is recorded as an adjustment to sales revenue. Information on provisionally-priced sales contracts  
is included in note 30.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

(d) Currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for joint arrangements and associates, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that 
entity operates. For many entities, this is the currency of the country in which they are located. Transactions denominated in other currencies are converted to the 
functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
year end exchange rates. The Group’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting are explained in more detail in note 1(p) (iii).  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group  
as a whole. On consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at average rates of exchange  
where the average is a reasonable approximation of rates prevailing on the transaction date. Statement of financial position items are translated into US dollars  
at period-end exchange rates.  
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly in the foreign 
currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income with the exception of translation adjustments 
relating to Rio Tinto Limited’s share capital which are shown in the statement of changes in equity. 
Where an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to the foreign 
currency translation reserve. Except as noted above, or in note (p) below relating to derivative contracts, all other exchange differences are charged or credited to  
the income statement in the year in which they arise. 
(e) Goodwill and intangible assets (excluding exploration and evaluation expenditure) 
Goodwill is not amortised; it is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Investments 
in EAUs including any goodwill are tested for impairment as a single asset when a trigger for impairment has been identified. The Group’s impairment policy is 
explained in note 1(i). 
Purchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of 
production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised;  
they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in accordance with accounting 
policy note 1(i). 
The Group considers that intangible assets have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. The factors considered in making this determination include the existence of contractual rights 
for unlimited terms; or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental cost can be expected for indefinite future periods in view of the 
Group’s investment intentions. The life cycles of the products and processes that depend on the asset are also considered.  
(f) Exploration and evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to: 
researching and analysing existing exploration data;  
conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;  
examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or  
compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies.  
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits  
or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity is not capitalised. 
Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable, 
and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. 
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure are reviewed for impairment twice a year by management. In the case of undeveloped mining projects 
(projects for which the decision to mine has not yet been approved at the appropriate authorisation level within the Group) which have arisen through acquisition, 
there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for that review. The review is based on a status report summarising the Group’s intentions for development.  
In some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended  
that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or to replace the output when existing smelters and/or refineries  
are closed. It is often the case that technological and other improvements will allow successor smelters and/or refineries to more than replace the capacity of  
their predecessors. 
(g) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property,  
plant and equipment includes the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset. Once an undeveloped mining project has been established 
as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under “Mining 
properties and leases” together with any amount transferred from “Exploration and evaluation”. Commercial viability is deemed to be achieved when the Group 
determines that the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks. Ore reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before  
its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period between declaration of reserves and approval  
to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project’s returns. 
Costs of evaluation of an undeveloped smelter or refinery project are capitalised under “Capital works in progress”, provided that there is a high degree of confidence 
that the project will be deemed to be commercially viable.

compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies.  
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed assessment of deposits  
or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity is not capitalised. 
Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable, 
and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. 
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure are reviewed for impairment twice a year by management. In the case of undeveloped mining projects 
(projects for which the decision to mine has not yet been approved at the appropriate authorisation level within the Group) which have arisen through acquisition, 
there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for that review. The review is based on a status report summarising the Group’s intentions for development.  
In some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended  
that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or to replace the output when existing smelters and/or refineries  
are closed. It is often the case that technological and other improvements will allow successor smelters and/or refineries to more than replace the capacity of  
their predecessors. 
(g) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property,  
plant and equipment includes the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset. Once an undeveloped mining project has been established 
as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under “Mining 
properties and leases” together with any amount transferred from “Exploration and evaluation”. Commercial viability is deemed to be achieved when the Group 
determines that the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks. Ore reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before  
its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period between declaration of reserves and approval  
to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project’s returns. 
Costs of evaluation of an undeveloped smelter or refinery project are capitalised under “Capital works in progress”, provided that there is a high degree of confidence 
that the project will be deemed to be commercially viable.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Costs which are necessarily incurred whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, 
are capitalised. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic 
benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable, or at the 
Group’s cost of borrowing if not, until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. 
(h) Deferred stripping 
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically.  
The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or pit), before production commences, 
stripping costs are capitalised as part of the investment in construction of the mine (or pit) and are subsequently amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on  
a units of production basis. 
Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are accounted for 
separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent  
pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping (ie overburden and other waste removal) of the 
second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping and accounted for by reference to the specific volume of the orebody that is made  
more accessible by the stripping activity. 
The Group’s determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine’s specific circumstances.  
The following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately: 
If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively with that of the first pit, rather than concurrently.  
If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset.  
If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit.  
If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large.  
If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.  
If the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from the several pits combined, including the  
co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation in accounting for stripping costs.  
The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.  
In order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met: 
it must be probable that economic benefit will be realised in a future accounting period as a result of improved access to the orebody created by the stripping 
activity; and 
it must be possible to identify the “component” of the orebody for which access has been improved; and 
it must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity. 
A “component” is a specific volume of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the larger orebody that  
is distinguished by a separate useful economic life. 
When the cost of stripping related to development which has a future benefit is not distinguishable from the cost of producing current inventories, ie there is a 
mixture of waste being removed to extract ore in the current period as well as waste being removed to allow extraction of ore in future periods, the stripping costs  
are allocated to each activity based on a relevant production measure. Generally, the measure would be calculated based on a ratio (Ratio) obtained by dividing  
the tonnage of waste mined for the component for the period either by the quantity of ore mined for the component or by the quantity of minerals contained in the 
ore mined for the component. In some operations, the quantity of ore is a more appropriate basis for allocating costs, particularly, where there are significant by-
products. Stripping costs incurred in the period related to the component are deferred to the extent that the current period Ratio exceeds the life of component  
Ratio. The stripping activity asset is depreciated on a “units of production” basis based on expected production of either ore or contained minerals over the life of  
the component unless another method is more appropriate. 
The life of component Ratios are based on proved and probable reserves of the mine (and for some mines, other mineral resources) and the annual mine plan;  
they are a function of the mine design and therefore changes to that design will generally result in changes to the Ratios. Changes in other technical or economic 
parameters that impact on reserves may also have an impact on the life of component Ratios even if they do not affect the mine design. Changes to the life of 
component Ratios are accounted for prospectively. It may be the case that subsequent phases of stripping will access additional ore and that these subsequent 
phases are only possible after the first phase has taken place. Where applicable, the Group considers this on a mine-by-mine basis. Generally, the only ore attributed 
to the stripping activity asset for the purposes of calculating a life of component Ratio, and for the purposes of amortisation, is the ore to be extracted from the 
originally identified component. 
Deferred stripping costs are included in “Mining properties and leases” within “Property, plant and equipment” or within “Investments in equity accounted units”,  
as appropriate. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units”, as appropriate.

(i) Depreciation and impairment 
Depreciation of non-current assets 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if that is shorter and there is no alternative use for the asset.  
The useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case, the lives  
of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment generally relate to the expected life of the orebody. 
The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life  
of a related orebody, management applies judgment in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. In the case of smelters, factors affecting  
the remaining service potential include smelter technology and electricity purchase contracts when the power is not sourced from the company’s, or certain local 
government’s, electricity generating capacity. 
The useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and charges reflected prospectively. 
Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production  
and/or straight-line basis as follows: 
Units of production basis 
For mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to the production level.  
Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on a units of production basis. 
In applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total expected production in 
current and future periods based on proved and probable reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources. These other mineral resources may be included  
in depreciation calculations in limited circumstances and where there is a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction. This would be the case when  
the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the 
responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources is appropriate based on historic reserve conversion rates. 
Such inclusion would usually only occur in situations where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive  
to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial minerals deposits. The required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for 
minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore, (compared with the above) such as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be 
evaluated in considerable detail before their economic status can be predicted with confidence. Where measured and indicated resources are used in the calculation 
of depreciation for infrastructure, primarily rail and port, which will benefit current and future mines then the measured and indicated resources may relate to mines 
which are currently in production or to mines which will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of resources is determined taking into account future 
capital costs as required by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code. The depreciation calculation, however, does not take into account future development 
costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are currently only incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group’s 
Australian iron ore business.  
Straight-line basis 
Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than  
the related mine are depreciated on a straight-line basis.  
Impairment of non-current assets 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying amount may  
not be recoverable. All goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use or have an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment as at  
30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a  
potential impairment.  
Impairment is assessed at the level of cash-generating units which, in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”, are identified as the smallest identifiable  
group of assets that generate cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. The existence of an active market for intermediate 
products is also monitored and separate cash-generating units are identified even if the majority of those products are further processed internally and therefore  
the cash flows are not independent.  
In some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams, which constitute separate cash-generating units. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units if that is the lowest level within the 
Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, that are expected to benefit from the related business combination.  
When an impairment review is undertaken, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected 
future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD).  
When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has been measured by reference to FVLCD, this amount has been further classified in accordance with the 
fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The best evidence of FVLCD is the 
value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement and the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based 
on quoted prices for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the 
fair value hierarchy. No cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 2. 
Where unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available to reflect the amount  
the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is often estimated using 
discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Where the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed “life-of-mine” 
and/or production plans.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than  
the related mine are depreciated on a straight-line basis.  
Impairment of non-current assets 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying amount may

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
The cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management’s best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs  
of production, capital expenditure, closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining FVLCD from a market participant’s perspective,  
the cash flows incorporate management’s price and cost assumptions in the short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain 
constant where appropriate; as it is considered unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may 
include net cash flows expected to be realised from extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in proved or probable  
ore reserves. Such non-reserve material is only included where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based  
on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation to achieve reserve  
status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation 
of the mine. 
As noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or long term production plan  
for the cash-generating unit. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current condition and therefore does 
not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset’s performance. Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD 
calculations and therefore generally result in a higher value. 
Where the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect long-term mine plans, 
which are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine 
plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody, including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of 
the ore impacting on process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan is therefore the basis for forecasting 
production output and production costs in each future year. 
Forecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto’s commodity price forecasts, which assume short-term market 
prices will revert to the Group’s assessment of the long-term price, generally over a period of three to five years. For most commodities, these forecast commodity 
prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and of the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often 
differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does not believe that published medium and long-term forward prices provide a good 
indication of future levels because they tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. These price forecasts are also used for impairment testing unless management 
deems that in certain economic environments, a market participant would not assign Rio Tinto’s view on prices, in which case management estimates the 
assumptions that a market participant would be expected to use.  
In some cases, prices applying to some part of the future sales volumes of a cash-generating unit are predetermined by existing sales contracts. The effects of such 
contracts are taken into account in forecasting future cash flows. 
The discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting 
point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cash-generating units operate.  
For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the weighted average cost of capital, are used. 
For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. The great majority  
of the Group’s sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities 
strengthen against the US dollar without commodity price offset, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced. 
In estimating FVLCD, a forecast of the long-term exchange rates for the Australian and Canadian dollars is made having regard to spot exchange rates, historical  
data and external forecasts, and is linked to price assumptions. Management considers that over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity 
prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar (and vice versa). However, such compensating changes are not synchronised  
and do not fully offset each other. 
IAS 36 requires that value in use be based on exchange rates current at the time of the assessment. 
Non-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment  
loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate an impairment reversal will be recognised. 
An onerous contract is defined under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” as a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. However, no provision is required provided that the assets 
dedicated to the contract, which may be the wider cash-generating unit of which the business unit forms part, are not fully impaired.  
(j) Determination of ore reserve estimates 
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian 
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2012 (the JORC code). Reserves and, for certain mines, other mineral 
resources determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges and for forecasting the timing of the payment  
of close-down and restoration costs and environmental costs. 
The depreciation and impairment policy above notes instances in which mineral resources are taken into account for accounting purposes. In addition, value may  
be attributed to mineral resources in purchase price allocations undertaken for the purposes of business combination accounting. 
(k) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations 
The Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure and the removal of residual materials 
and remediation of disturbed areas for the mines and certain refineries and smelters.  
Close-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the 
end of the life of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their costs based on feasibility 
and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

1  Principal accounting policies continued 
Close-down and restoration costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs, based on the net  
present value of estimated future costs with, where appropriate, probability weighting of the different remediation, closure or other activities required to achieve 
relinquishment. This may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility. 
Provisions for close-down and restoration costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from future disturbance. The costs are 
estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are updated annually during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, eg revisions to cost estimates  
and to the estimated lives of operations. The estimates are subject to formal review at regular intervals. 
The initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment”. Subsequent movements in the close-down and restoration 
provisions, including those resulting from new disturbance, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations and revisions to discount rates are 
also capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment”. These costs are then depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate. 
The amortisation or “unwinding” of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the income statement in each accounting 
period. The amortisation of the discount is shown within “Finance items” in the income statement.  
Where rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding 
continuous rehabilitation work at each statement of financial position date and the cost is charged to the income statement. 
Environmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and 
penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the statement of financial position date. These costs are charged to “Net operating 
costs”, except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within “Finance items”.  
Remediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can 
continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used. 
(l) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost 
levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory. The cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost 
of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including:  
labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore and the production of alumina  
and aluminium;  
the depreciation of mining properties and leases and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore and the production  
of alumina and aluminium; and  
production overheads.  
Work in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. 
If there is significant uncertainty as to when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the ore is expensed as mined. Where the future processing of this ore can be 
predicted with confidence, eg because it exceeds the mine’s cut-off grade, it is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. If the ore will not be processed 
within the 12 months after the statement of financial position date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted  
cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. 
(m) Taxation 
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. 
Deferred tax is provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. These adjustments may relate to assets such as mining rights that, in general, are not 
eligible for income tax allowances. Provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its income tax base (which may  
be nil). Even where there is no income tax base, the existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not taken into account in determining the deferred tax 
provision for the mining rights because it is expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use of the rights and not from disposal.  
(n) Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees. For post-retirement 
defined benefit plans, the difference between the fair value of any plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations is recognised as an asset or liability  
in the statement of financial position. 
Where appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan  
or reductions in future contributions.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are credited/charged to the statement of comprehensive income and comprise the effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience adjustments due to differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. In particular, the  
difference between the interest income and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit, which include the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements, are 
recognised in the income statement. The interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged 
to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units” as appropriate. 
The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are the discount rate, the inflation assumption and the mortality assumptions. The discount 
rate is used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. The discount rate used 
is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-retirement obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no 
developed corporate bond market in a country, the rate on government bonds is used. Each period, the resulting interest cost, net of the interest income on assets   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Close-down and restoration costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs, based on the net  
present value of estimated future costs with, where appropriate, probability weighting of the different remediation, closure or other activities required to achieve 
relinquishment. This may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility. 
Provisions for close-down and restoration costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from future disturbance. The costs are 
estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are updated annually during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, eg revisions to cost estimates  
and to the estimated lives of operations. The estimates are subject to formal review at regular intervals. 
The initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment”. Subsequent movements in the close-down and restoration 
provisions, including those resulting from new disturbance, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations and revisions to discount rates are 
also capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment”. These costs are then depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate. 
The amortisation or “unwinding” of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of provisions is charged to the income statement in each accounting 
period. The amortisation of the discount is shown within “Finance items” in the income statement.  
Where rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding 
continuous rehabilitation work at each statement of financial position date and the cost is charged to the income statement. 
Environmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and 
penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the statement of financial position date. These costs are charged to “Net operating 
costs”, except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within “Finance items”.  
Remediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can 
continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used. 
(l) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost 
levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory. The cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost 
of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including:  
labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore and the production of alumina  
and aluminium;  
the depreciation of mining properties and leases and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore and the production  
of alumina and aluminium; and  
production overheads.  
Work in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. 
If there is significant uncertainty as to when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the ore is expensed as mined. Where the future processing of this ore can be 
predicted with confidence, eg because it exceeds the mine’s cut-off grade, it is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. If the ore will not be processed 
within the 12 months after the statement of financial position date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted  
cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. 
(m) Taxation 
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. 
Deferred tax is provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. These adjustments may relate to assets such as mining rights that, in general, are not 
eligible for income tax allowances. Provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its income tax base (which may  
be nil). Even where there is no income tax base, the existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not taken into account in determining the deferred tax 
provision for the mining rights because it is expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use of the rights and not from disposal.  
(n) Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees. For post-retirement 
defined benefit plans, the difference between the fair value of any plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations is recognised as an asset or liability  
in the statement of financial position. 
Where appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan  
or reductions in future contributions.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are credited/charged to the statement of comprehensive income and comprise the effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience adjustments due to differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. In particular, the  
difference between the interest income and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit, which include the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements, are 
recognised in the income statement. The interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged 
to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units” as appropriate. 
The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are the discount rate, the inflation assumption and the mortality assumptions. The discount 
rate is used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. The discount rate used 
is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-retirement obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no 
developed corporate bond market in a country, the rate on government bonds is used. Each period, the resulting interest cost, net of the interest income on assets  
 
127 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
is charged to the Group’s income statement as the interest cost in each accounting period. The inflation assumption is used to project increases in future benefit 
payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The mortality assumption is used to project the future stream of benefit payments, which is then 
discounted to arrive at the net present value of the obligations. 
Valuations of the obligations are carried out using the projected unit method which values benefits accrued at the valuation date with allowance where appropriate 
for future increases to pay and pensions. 
The values of the obligations are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries. 
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. 
(o) Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise: cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks, and short-term, highly-
liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the 
cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities in the 
statement of financial position. 
(p) Financial instruments 
(i) Financial assets 
Classification 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, available-for-sale and held to maturity 
investments. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The Group’s policy with regard to financial risk management is 
set out in note 30. Generally, the Group does not acquire financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term. When the Group enters into derivative contracts 
these transactions are designed to reduce exposures related to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions. 
Management determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition. 
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from the host contracts are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 
classified as non-current. 
(b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables comprise non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables are 
included within this category; however, trade receivables subject to provisional pricing are valued as explained in note 1(c) Sales revenue. 
(c) Held to maturity 
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intention and ability 
to hold to maturity. Assets in this category are classified as Other investments and are classified as current assets or non-current assets based on their maturity. 
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as available-for-sale or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of the assets within 12 months of the statement of financial position date or the asset 
matures within 12 months.  
Recognition and measurement 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.  
All financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets carried at fair value 
through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are de-recognised when the 
rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the statement of financial position date. Derivatives embedded in host contracts are 
treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to their host contracts. In some cases, the embedded derivatives may be 
designated as hedges and accounted for as described above. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. Where relevant market prices are available, these have been used to determine fair values, adjusted where necessary for market liquidity, bid/offer spreads  
and credit considerations. In other cases, fair values have been calculated using quotations from independent financial institutions, or by using valuation techniques 
consistent with general market practice applicable to the instrument. 
The fair values of cash, short-term borrowings and loans to joint ventures and associates approximate to their carrying values, as a result of their short maturity or 
because they carry floating rates of interest. The fair values of the various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 30. Movements  
on the hedging reserve are disclosed within note 29. 
Offsetting financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right  
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.  
If impairment is identified for a financial asset carried at amortised cost the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and  
the loss is recognised in the income statement. 
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, an evaluation is made as to whether a decline in fair value is “significant” or “prolonged” based on an 
analysis of indicators such as significant adverse changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the company invested in operates.  
If such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss, measured as the difference between acquisition cost and the current fair value,  
less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. 
(ii) Financial liabilities 
Borrowings and other financial liabilities (including trade payables but excluding derivative liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.  
Any difference between the amounts originally received for borrowings and other financial liabilities (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the income statement over the period to maturity using the effective interest method. 
The fair values of medium and long-term borrowings are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using quoted prices in active markets  
or an appropriate market based yield curve. The carrying value of the borrowings is amortised cost. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
(iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. 
They are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each statement of financial position date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as 
either; hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or of firm commitments (fair value hedges) or, hedges of a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or of a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges). 
Fair value hedges: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together  
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or firm commitment that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
When a fair value interest rate hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a fair value interest rate hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  
the fair value adjustments which have been made to the hedged item are amortised through the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item  
or written off immediately where the hedged item is de-recognised.  
Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity  
are recycled in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss, for example when the forecast sale that is being hedged takes  
place. When the forecast transaction that is being hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are 
transferred from equity and adjust the cost of the asset. The gains and losses are recognised subsequently in the income statement when the non-financial asset  
is amortised or sold. 
When a cash flow hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a cash flow hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, although the forecast 
transaction is still expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss relating to the instrument which is held in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain  
or loss that is held in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
(q) Share-based payments 
The Group’s equity-settled share plans are settled either by: the issue of shares by the relevant parent company, the purchase of shares on market, or the use  
of shares previously acquired as part of a share buy-back. The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a 
corresponding entry to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans. 
If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans exceeds the expense charged, the excess is taken to retained earnings or other reserves as appropriate.  
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based vesting conditions attached to the award. 
The Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
Non-market-based vesting conditions (eg earnings per share targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the 
number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each statement of financial position date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the 
actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. 
The terms of each plan are considered at the statement of financial position date. The Group no longer operates any plans as cash-settled. However the Performance 
Share Plan can, at the discretion of the directors, offer employees an equivalent amount in cash. This is not standard practice. In some jurisdictions, employees are 
granted cash-settled awards where equity-settled awards are prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of these awards is immaterial. Further information 
about the treatment of individual share-based payment plans is provided in note 44.

(r) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,  
from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Group’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental  
costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received,  
net of any directly-attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. 
(s) Segment reporting  
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM,  
who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as Rio Tinto’s chief executive.  
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
(i) Dual listed companies reporting  
As described in the “Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements”, the consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group  
deal with the results, assets and liabilities of both of the dual listed companies, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, and their subsidiaries. Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto 
Limited are viewed as a single parent company with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company. 
The 2013 Annual report satisfies the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order  
issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012). The 2013 financial statements disclose 
the effect of the adjustments to the Group’s consolidated profit/(loss), consolidated total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders’ funds as 
prepared under EU IFRS that would be required under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). 
The US dollar is the presentation currency used in these financial statements, as it most reliably reflects the Group’s global business performance. 
(ii) Acquisitions 
The determination of the fair values of net identifiable assets acquired, and of any goodwill, involves significant judgment. This is particularly the case when the 
acquisition involves little or no cash, for example when the Group gains control of a company in stages or for shares. The allocation of fair value between intangible 
assets, and the tangible assets with which they are used, is also judgmental. The Group engages third-party valuers to advise on the purchase price allocation for 
significant acquisitions.  
(iii) Impairment review of asset carrying values 
Events or changes in circumstances can give rise to significant impairment charges or reversals of impairment.  
Estimates in respect of the timing of project expansions and the cost to complete asset construction are critical to determining the recoverable amounts for  
cash-generating units.  
Where the recoverable amounts of the Group’s cash-generating units are assessed by analyses of discounted cash flows, the resulting valuations are also sensitive  
to changes in estimates of long-term commodity prices, exchange rates, operating costs and discount rates. 
Note 6 outlines the significant judgments and assumptions made in measuring the impairments recorded and notes 12 and 13 outline judgments in relation to the 
testing of cash-generating units containing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets respectively.  
(iv) Estimation of asset lives and determination of ore reserve and mineral resource estimates 
Intangible assets are considered to have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over  
which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. The factors considered in making this determination include the existence of contractual rights  
for unlimited terms; or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental cost can be expected for indefinite periods into the future in 
view of the Group’s investment intentions. 
Rio Tinto estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Australasian 
code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2012 (the ‘JORC code’). The amounts presented under EU IFRS and  
AAS are based on the ore reserves, and in some cases mineral resources, determined under the JORC code. 
The estimation of ore reserves and mineral resources requires judgment to interpret available geological data and then to select an appropriate mining method and 
establish an extraction schedule. It also requires assumptions about future commodity prices, exchange rates, production costs, recovery rates and discount rates 
and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licenses.  
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and mineral resources; consequently assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation  
may change significantly when new information becomes available.  
New geological data, as well as changes in the above assumptions, may change the economic status of ore reserves and mineral resources, and may ultimately 
result in their restatement. Such changes in ore reserves and, in some cases mineral resources, could have an impact on: depreciation and amortisation rates; the 
carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; deferred stripping calculations; and provisions for close-down and restoration costs.  
(v) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations 
Provision is made for close-down, restoration and environmental costs when the obligation occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs with, 
where appropriate, probability weighting of the different remediation, closure or other activities required to achieve relinquishment. The ultimate cost of close-down  
and restoration is uncertain and management uses its judgment and experience to provide for these costs over the life of the operations. Cost estimates can vary in 
response to many factors including: changes to the relevant legal or local/national government ownership requirements or the Group’s closure and environmental 
policies; review of remediation and relinquishment options; the emergence of new restoration techniques; the timing of the expenditures and the effects of inflation. 
Experience gained at other mine or production sites is also a significant consideration.

130
Notes to the 2013 financial statements continued 
130 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
1  Principal accounting policies continued 
Cost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation. The accuracy range for operations with a remaining life of ten to 40 years is +/-30 per cent.  
For operations with a remaining life of five to ten years, the accuracy range is +/-20 per cent. Five years prior to the estimated date of closure, operations must 
produce a full decommissioning plan with an accuracy range of +/-15 per cent. 
The expected timing of expenditure included in cost estimates can also change, for example in response to changes to expectations relating to ore reserves and 
resources, production rates, operating licence or economic conditions. Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for an extended period  
of time depending on the specific site requirements. Some expenditure can continue into perpetuity.  
Cash flows must be discounted if this has a material effect. The selection of appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the risk-free discount rate used 
for such obligations also requires judgment. 
As a result of all of the above factors, there could be significant adjustments to the provision for close-down, restoration and environmental costs which would affect 
future financial results. Increases and decreases in environmental obligations are charged directly to the income statement. Increases and decreases in close-down 
obligations are capitalised for operating businesses. An increase in close-down and restoration provisions would increase the unwind of the discount and depreciation 
charges in the income statement in future years and increase the carrying value of property, plant and equipment potentially impacting any future impairment 
charges or reversals. 
(vi) Deferral of stripping costs 
Stripping of waste materials takes place throughout the production phase of a surface mine or pit. The identification of components within a mine and of life of 
component strip ratios is a function of an individual mine’s design. Changes to that design may introduce new components and/or change the life of component  
strip ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact on ore reserves may also have an impact on the life of component ratios even if they  
do not affect the mine’s design. Changes to the life of component ratios are accounted for prospectively. 
The Group’s determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations determines whether initial stripping of a pit is deemed  
to be pre-production or production phase stripping and therefore the accounting treatment of those costs. The determination depends on each mine’s specific 
circumstances and the analysis requires judgment; another mining company could make a different determination even where the fact pattern appears to be similar.  
At 31 December 2013, the net book value of capitalised production phase stripping costs totalled US$1.3 billion, with US$0.9 billion within Property, plant and 
equipment and a further US$0.4 billion within Investments in Equity Accounted Units (2012 total of US$1.5 billion with US$1.2 billion in Property, plant and 
equipment and a further US$0.3 billion within Investment in Equity Accounted Units).  
The main movements in capitalised production phase stripping costs during 2013 were capitalisation of US$0.5 billion primarily related to the push-backs of  
the pit walls at Kennecott Utah Copper (KUC) and Escondida, a transfer of US$0.2 billion to assets held for sale relating to Clermont and a US$0.4 billion write off 
relating to KUC as a result of the pit wall slide in April.  
(vii) Recognition of deferred tax liabilities on mining rights recognised in acquisitions 
Deferred tax is provided in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions. These adjustments may relate to assets such as mining rights that, in general, are  
not eligible for income tax allowances. Provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its income tax base (which 
may be nil). Even where there is no income tax base, the existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not taken into account in determining the deferred 
tax liability for the mining rights because it is expected that the carrying amount will be recovered primarily through use of the rights and not from disposal. For 
acquisitions after 1 January 2004, such a deferred tax liability on acquisition results in a consequential increase in the amounts attributed to goodwill. For acquisitions 
prior to 1 January 2004, such deferred tax was recognised in equity on transition to EU IFRS. Amounts attributed to goodwill for business combinations in 2012 and 
2013 are shown in note 37. 
(viii) Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs and other costs prior to the decision to mine/construct 
Under the Group’s accounting policy, exploration expenditure is not capitalised. Evaluation expenditure is capitalised when there is a high degree of confidence  
that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. 
A project’s commercial viability is determined based on whether it will provide a satisfactory return relative to the perceived risks of the project. Once a project’s 
commercial viability has been established, the Group will decide, at the appropriate authorisation level, whether to approve the decision to mine. The appropriate 
authorisation level within the Group is the Rio Tinto Investment Committee and the board where appropriate. In determining whether to approve a project, the 
Investment Committee reviews the ore reserves estimate together with analyses regarding the net present value of the project and sensitivity analyses around  
key assumptions.  
There are occasions when the Group concludes that the asset recognition criteria are met at an earlier stage than approval to mine. In these cases, evaluation 
expenditure is capitalised if there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine the project is commercially viable. The Group’s view is that a high 
degree of confidence is greater than “more likely than not” (that is greater than 50 per cent certainty) and less than “virtually certain” (that is less than 90 per cent 
certainty). Determining whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable requires a 
significant degree of judgment and assessment of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project’s current stage; project timeline; 
current estimates of the project’s net present value including sensitivity analyses around key assumptions; and the main risks of the project. Development 
expenditure incurred prior to the decision to mine is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine 
that a project is commercially viable. 
In accordance with IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”, the criteria for the capitalisation of exploration and evaluation costs is applied 
consistently from period to period.  
Subsequent recovery of the resulting carrying value depends on successful development or sale of the undeveloped project. If a project does not prove viable,  
all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any related impairment provisions are charged to the income statement. At 31 December 2013, a total  
of US$2.3 billion had been capitalised comprising: evaluation costs (US$1.9 billion) and US$0.4 billion of early works expenditure within property, plant and 
equipment (31 December 2012: a total of US$2.1 billion).   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Cost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation. The accuracy range for operations with a remaining life of ten to 40 years is +/-30 per cent.  
For operations with a remaining life of five to ten years, the accuracy range is +/-20 per cent. Five years prior to the estimated date of closure, operations must 
produce a full decommissioning plan with an accuracy range of +/-15 per cent. 
The expected timing of expenditure included in cost estimates can also change, for example in response to changes to expectations relating to ore reserves and 
resources, production rates, operating licence or economic conditions. Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for an extended period  
of time depending on the specific site requirements. Some expenditure can continue into perpetuity.  
Cash flows must be discounted if this has a material effect. The selection of appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the risk-free discount rate used 
for such obligations also requires judgment. 
As a result of all of the above factors, there could be significant adjustments to the provision for close-down, restoration and environmental costs which would affect 
future financial results. Increases and decreases in environmental obligations are charged directly to the income statement. Increases and decreases in close-down 
obligations are capitalised for operating businesses. An increase in close-down and restoration provisions would increase the unwind of the discount and depreciation 
charges in the income statement in future years and increase the carrying value of property, plant and equipment potentially impacting any future impairment 
charges or reversals. 
(vi) Deferral of stripping costs 
Stripping of waste materials takes place throughout the production phase of a surface mine or pit. The identification of components within a mine and of life of 
component strip ratios is a function of an individual mine’s design. Changes to that design may introduce new components and/or change the life of component  
strip ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact on ore reserves may also have an impact on the life of component ratios even if they  
do not affect the mine’s design. Changes to the life of component ratios are accounted for prospectively. 
The Group’s determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations determines whether initial stripping of a pit is deemed  
to be pre-production or production phase stripping and therefore the accounting treatment of those costs. The determination depends on each mine’s specific 
circumstances and the analysis requires judgment; another mining company could make a different determination even where the fact pattern appears to be similar.  
At 31 December 2013, the net book value of capitalised production phase stripping costs totalled US$1.3 billion, with US$0.9 billion within Property, plant and 
equipment and a further US$0.4 billion within Investments in Equity Accounted Units (2012 total of US$1.5 billion with US$1.2 billion in Property, plant and

(ix) Identification of functional currencies 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for equity accounted units, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
Determination of functional currency involves significant judgment and other mining companies may make different judgments based on similar facts. For many  
of Rio Tinto’s entities, their functional currency is the currency of the country in which they operate. The Group reconsiders the functional currency of its entities  
if there is a change in the underlying transactions, events and conditions which determine their primary economic environment. 
The determination of functional currency affects the carrying value of non-current assets included in the statement of financial position and, as a consequence,  
the amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity.  
(x) Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs 
The value of the Group’s obligations for post-retirement benefits is dependent on the amount of benefits to be paid out and is discounted to the balance sheet date. 
This amount will vary depending on the assumptions made about the future pay increases received by members of final pay plans, the level of inflation (for those 
benefits that are subject to some form of inflation protection), the number of individuals and how long individuals live in retirement. Plan assets are measured at  
fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
Most of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants and the majority of the obligations relate to former employees. As a consequence,  
the carrying value of the Group’s post-retirement obligations is less sensitive to assumptions about future salary increases than it is to assumptions regarding future 
inflation. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation-linked instruments where possible, combined with consensus views on 
future inflation, and is derived using the same process at each reporting date. Changes to the assumption therefore reflect changes to the market and consensus 
views of future inflation. 
The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set its current mortality assumptions.  
It also allows for future improvements in mortality having regard to standard improvement scales in each country. 
The discount rate used to value post-retirement obligations is based upon the yields on high quality corporate bonds in the relevant currency and which have 
durations consistent with the nature of the obligations. The discount rate will vary from one period to another in line with movements in corporate bond yields,  
but at any given measurement date there is relatively little estimation uncertainty. This rate is also used to calculate the interest cost on obligations and interest 
income on plan assets.  
Details of the key assumptions, how they have moved since the previous statement of financial position date and the sensitivity of the carrying value to changes  
in the assumptions, are set out in note 45. 
For 2013, the charge against income for post-retirement benefits net of tax and non-controlling interests was US$558 million. This charge included both pension  
and post-retirement healthcare benefits. The charge is net of interest income of US$410 million after tax and non-controlling interests. 
The average future increase in compensation levels was assumed to be 3.4 per cent in 2013 and will be 3.6 per cent for 2014. The average discount rate used  
was 3.9 per cent in 2013 and will be 4.4 per cent in 2014 reflecting the net impact of changes in corporate bond yields in the regions where the Group has  
pension obligations. 
Based on the known changes in assumptions noted above and other expected circumstances, the expected impact of post-retirement costs on the Group’s  
EU IFRS net earnings in 2014 would be US$93 million less than in 2013. The actual charge may be impacted by other factors that cannot be predicted, such  
as the effect of changes in benefits, number of employees and exchange rates. 
The table below sets out the potential change in the Group’s 2013 net earnings (after tax and non-controlling interests) that would result from hypothetical changes 
to post-retirement assumptions and estimates. The sensitivities are viewed for each assumption in isolation although a change in one assumption is likely to result  
in some offset elsewhere. The figures in the table only show the impact on underlying and net earnings. Changing the assumptions would also have an impact on  
the statement of financial position.

(xi) Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets  
The Group has tax losses, and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in UK, French, Canadian, US and Australian taxable entities that have the potential  
to reduce tax payments in future years. Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the projected future 
taxable income of these taxable entities and after taking account of specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these assets.   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

(xii) Contingencies 
Disclosure is made of material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote. Contingencies are disclosed in note 31. 
(xiii) Basis of consolidation 
Judgment is sometimes required to determine whether the Group has control, joint control or significant influence over an entity. These judgments are set out  
in notes 33 to 36.  
In some cases, the Group makes acquisitions over a period of days, weeks or months. It is a matter of judgment as to whether the payments made during this  
period form part of one transaction or a number of separate transactions. In the latter case, the transactions will be treated as an acquisition in stages. The effect  
on the financial statements of treatment as an acquisition in stages is that any excess of consideration over identifiable net assets for transactions after control  
has been gained will be recorded as a reduction in equity. If the transactions were treated as one acquisition then all such excess consideration would be treated  
as goodwill. In addition, acquisitions of shares after the date on which control is gained and which are accounted for as an acquisition in stages are shown within 
“Financing activities” in the cash flow statement rather than in “Investing activities”. 
Factors which are considered in this judgment are the length of time between the acquisition date and completion of the transaction and whether, at the time  
of the initial share purchase, it was clear what percentage ownership would ultimately be obtained.

Rio Tinto’s management structure is based on the principal product groups shown above together with the global functions that support the business. The chief 
executive of each product group reports to the chief executive of Rio Tinto. The chief executive of Rio Tinto monitors the performance of each product group based 
on a number of measures including capital expenditure and operating cash flows, with Underlying earnings being the key financial performance indicator. Finance 
costs and net debt are managed on a Group basis.  
Generally, business units are allocated to product groups based on their primary product. The Energy product group includes both coal and uranium businesses.  
The Diamonds & Minerals product group includes businesses with products such as borates, salt and titanium dioxide feedstock together with diamond operations 
and the Simandou iron ore project, which is the responsibility of the Diamonds & Minerals product group chief executive. The Copper group includes certain gold 
operations in addition to copper. 
The financial information by business unit provided on page 197 of these financial statements provide additional voluntary disclosure which the Group considers 
useful to the users of the financial statements. 
(a) Gross sales revenue 
Gross sales revenue includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$3,757 million (2012: US$5,067 million,   
2011: US$5,239 million) in addition to consolidated sales revenue. Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$353 million (2012: US$412 million, 
2011: US$470 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in gross sales revenue. 
Intersegment transactions relate to sales between the Aluminium Product Group and Constellium (formerly Alcan Engineered Products) and Other Aluminium 
operations whose results are reported within Other operations. 
(b) Depreciation and amortisation 
Product group depreciation and amortisation totals include 100 per cent of subsidiaries’ depreciation and amortisation and include Rio Tinto’s share of the 
depreciation and amortisation of equity accounted units. Rio Tinto’s share of the depreciation and amortisation charge of equity accounted units is deducted to  
arrive at depreciation and amortisation excluding equity accounted units as shown in note 4. These figures exclude impairment charges, which are excluded from 
Underlying earnings. 
(c) Underlying earnings 
Underlying earnings is reported by Rio Tinto to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations and to enhance comparability 
of reporting periods. 
The measure of Underlying earnings is used by the chief executive of Rio Tinto to assess the performance of the product groups. Underlying earnings and net 
earnings both represent amounts net of tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. The following items are excluded from Net earnings in arriving at Underlying earnings 
each period irrespective of materiality: 
Profits less losses on acquisitions/disposal of interests in businesses. 
Impairment charges/reversals.  
Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations. 
Exchange and derivative gains and losses. This exclusion includes Exchange gains/(losses) on US dollar net debt and intragroup balances, gains and losses  
on currency and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and gains/(losses) on commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. 
In addition, there is a final judgemental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a similar type,  
are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.  
Product group earnings include earnings of subsidiaries and equity accounted units stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount.

Rio Tinto’s management structure is based on the principal product groups shown above together with the global functions that support the business. The chief 
executive of each product group reports to the chief executive of Rio Tinto. The chief executive of Rio Tinto monitors the performance of each product group based 
on a number of measures including capital expenditure and operating cash flows, with Underlying earnings being the key financial performance indicator. Finance 
costs and net debt are managed on a Group basis.  
Generally, business units are allocated to product groups based on their primary product. The Energy product group includes both coal and uranium businesses.  
The Diamonds & Minerals product group includes businesses with products such as borates, salt and titanium dioxide feedstock together with diamond operations 
and the Simandou iron ore project, which is the responsibility of the Diamonds & Minerals product group chief executive. The Copper group includes certain gold 
operations in addition to copper. 
The financial information by business unit provided on page 197 of these financial statements provide additional voluntary disclosure which the Group considers 
useful to the users of the financial statements. 
(a) Gross sales revenue 
Gross sales revenue includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$3,757 million (2012: US$5,067 million,   
2011: US$5,239 million) in addition to consolidated sales revenue. Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$353 million (2012: US$412 million, 
2011: US$470 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in gross sales revenue. 
Intersegment transactions relate to sales between the Aluminium Product Group and Constellium (formerly Alcan Engineered Products) and Other Aluminium 
operations whose results are reported within Other operations. 
(b) Depreciation and amortisation 
Product group depreciation and amortisation totals include 100 per cent of subsidiaries’ depreciation and amortisation and include Rio Tinto’s share of the 
depreciation and amortisation of equity accounted units. Rio Tinto’s share of the depreciation and amortisation charge of equity accounted units is deducted to  
arrive at depreciation and amortisation excluding equity accounted units as shown in note 4. These figures exclude impairment charges, which are excluded from 
Underlying earnings. 
(c) Underlying earnings 
Underlying earnings is reported by Rio Tinto to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations and to enhance comparability 
of reporting periods. 
The measure of Underlying earnings is used by the chief executive of Rio Tinto to assess the performance of the product groups. Underlying earnings and net 
earnings both represent amounts net of tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. The following items are excluded from Net earnings in arriving at Underlying earnings 
each period irrespective of materiality: 
Profits less losses on acquisitions/disposal of interests in businesses. 
Impairment charges/reversals.  
Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations. 
Exchange and derivative gains and losses. This exclusion includes Exchange gains/(losses) on US dollar net debt and intragroup balances, gains and losses  
on currency and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and gains/(losses) on commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. 
In addition, there is a final judgemental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a similar type,  
are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.  
Product group earnings include earnings of subsidiaries and equity accounted units stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount. 
  
 
 
Rio Tinto’s share of the Underlying earnings of equity accounted units amount to US$747 million in 2013 (2012: US$1,061 million; 2011: US$945 million).  
This amount is attributable as follows: US$777 million profit to the Copper group and US$30 million loss to other product groups (2012: US$799 million profit 
attributable to the Copper product group and US$262 million profit to other product groups; 2011: US$699 million profit attributable to the Copper product group  
and US$246 million profit to other product groups). These amounts are included in Underlying earnings of the relevant product groups and include the Underlying 
earnings of the Group’s tolling entities which process alumina. Tolling entities recharge the majority of their costs and generally have minimal earnings.  
The copper product group’s underlying earnings in 2013 included US$131 million impairment after tax in relation to the group’s investment in Northern Dynasty 
Minerals Ltd following a strategic review of this shareholding by the group.  
The Energy product group’s Underlying earnings in 2012 included US$258 million profit after tax in relation to the divestments of equity interest in Extract Resources 
and Kalahari Minerals.

(e) Net gains on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses during 2013 mainly relate to the Group’s divestment of its remaining interest in Constellium (formerly Alcan 
Engineering Products), and the Northparkes mine.  
Net gains arising on the consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses for the year ended 31 December 2012 relate principally to consolidation of Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) 
and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (formerly Ivanhoe Mines Limited), and in 2011 principally to the divestment of the Group’s talc business. Refer to note 37 for additional information.  
(f) Kennecott Utah Copper, Bingham Canyon mine experienced a slide along a geological fault line of its north-eastern wall on 10 April 2013. Charges relating to the slide, which have been 
excluded from underlying earnings, primarily comprise the write off of certain deferred stripping assets and damaged equipment. Adjustments for settlement of insurance claims have 
been made to the amount excluded from underlying earnings, and will continue as insurance claims are settled. 
(g) Adjustments in relation to Clermont and Blair Athol arose following reclassification to disposal groups held for sale, and reflect contractual obligations for product sales and funding of 
closure activities, which will remain with the Group following completion of the divestments. Further adjustments in respect of these obligations will be combined with the net gain/loss 
on disposal expected to be recognised in 2014. 
(h) A deferred tax asset was recognised following the introduction of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) on 1 July 2012. 
(i) Deferred tax assets were written off as a result of restrictions on the utilisation of French losses introduced in 2011, to eliminate the increase in deferred tax assets following the 
impairment of French aluminium assets in 2012 and 2013.  
(j) Other credits and charges that, individually, or in aggregate, if of similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business 
performance. In 2013, other exclusions include adjustments relating to inventory sold by RBM during the period, which had been recognised at fair value on initial consolidation in 2012. 
(k) Exclusions from underlying earnings relating to equity accounted units, after tax, are included in the column ‘Pre-tax’.

were identified during 2013. 
(b) Other impairments include adjustments to reduce the carrying amount of the Eagle nickel-copper project to fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) prior to divestment on  
17 July 2013, and is considered to be a level 1 classification under the fair value hierarchy. Other impairment include an adjustment to the carrying value of Inova Resources Limited 
which was sold on 1 November 2013. 
Copper – Oyu Tolgoi 
The annual impairment review of the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit resulted in a pre-tax impairment of US$1,149 million to goodwill and US$3,567 million  
to property, plant and equipment, primarily as a result of the delay in developing the underground. The recoverable amount for Oyu Tolgoi was determined to be 
US$8.4 billion assessed by reference to a FVLCD model, in line with the accounting policy set out in note 1(i). The impairment loss was allocated to goodwill and  
the accounting uplift to property, plant and equipment that were previously recognised as accounting uplifts from when Rio Tinto obtained control of Oyu Tolgoi  
such that individual items of property, plant and equipment were not written down below fair value. 
The recoverable amount of the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows 
expressed in real terms have been estimated until the end of the life of mine plan and discounted using a country specific post-tax discount rate of 8.7 per cent 
(2012: 8.3 percent) for Mongolia. 
The most critical assumption for the FVLCD calculation is the timing of the underground project. If this is further delayed, it would have an adverse impact upon  
the recoverable amount due to the delay in commencing full production. A further twelve month delay in the timing of cash flows related to the underground  
would decrease FVLCD by US$0.8 billion. 
Other key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Oyu Tolgoi is most sensitive are: long-term copper prices, discount rates and operating costs.  
Other assumptions include the long-term gold price, and Mongolian Tugrik and Chinese Yuan exchange rates against the US dollar. Future selling prices and 
operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 1(i). 
Aluminium 
The annual impairment review of the Group’s Aluminium cash-generating units with indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge  
of US$908 million to intangible assets and US$42 million to property, plant and equipment within the Kitimat cash-generating unit, primarily as a result of a 
significant project cost overrun. The recoverable amount of US$2,258 million for the Kitimat cash-generating unit was determined by reference to a FVLCD model,  
in line with the accounting policy set out in note 1(i) and the impairment loss recorded such that individual items of property, plant and equipment were not written 
down below fair value.

(a) On 24 June 2013, the Group announced that the strategic review had concluded with a decision to retain the Diamonds businesses. No impairment triggers relating to Diamonds  
were identified during 2013. 
(b) Other impairments include adjustments to reduce the carrying amount of the Eagle nickel-copper project to fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) prior to divestment on  
17 July 2013, and is considered to be a level 1 classification under the fair value hierarchy. Other impairment include an adjustment to the carrying value of Inova Resources Limited 
which was sold on 1 November 2013. 
Copper – Oyu Tolgoi 
The annual impairment review of the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit resulted in a pre-tax impairment of US$1,149 million to goodwill and US$3,567 million  
to property, plant and equipment, primarily as a result of the delay in developing the underground. The recoverable amount for Oyu Tolgoi was determined to be 
US$8.4 billion assessed by reference to a FVLCD model, in line with the accounting policy set out in note 1(i). The impairment loss was allocated to goodwill and  
the accounting uplift to property, plant and equipment that were previously recognised as accounting uplifts from when Rio Tinto obtained control of Oyu Tolgoi  
such that individual items of property, plant and equipment were not written down below fair value. 
The recoverable amount of the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows 
expressed in real terms have been estimated until the end of the life of mine plan and discounted using a country specific post-tax discount rate of 8.7 per cent 
(2012: 8.3 percent) for Mongolia. 
The most critical assumption for the FVLCD calculation is the timing of the underground project. If this is further delayed, it would have an adverse impact upon  
the recoverable amount due to the delay in commencing full production. A further twelve month delay in the timing of cash flows related to the underground  
would decrease FVLCD by US$0.8 billion. 
Other key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Oyu Tolgoi is most sensitive are: long-term copper prices, discount rates and operating costs.  
Other assumptions include the long-term gold price, and Mongolian Tugrik and Chinese Yuan exchange rates against the US dollar. Future selling prices and 
operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 1(i). 
Aluminium 
The annual impairment review of the Group’s Aluminium cash-generating units with indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge  
of US$908 million to intangible assets and US$42 million to property, plant and equipment within the Kitimat cash-generating unit, primarily as a result of a 
significant project cost overrun. The recoverable amount of US$2,258 million for the Kitimat cash-generating unit was determined by reference to a FVLCD model,  
in line with the accounting policy set out in note 1(i) and the impairment loss recorded such that individual items of property, plant and equipment were not written 
down below fair value. 
  
 
The recoverable amount of the Kitimat cash-generating unit is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed 
in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic life of the new smelter, being the principal asset of the cash-generating unit and discounted 
using a post-tax discount rate of 7.3 per cent (2012: 6.9 per cent). 
Modernisation of the Kitimat aluminium smelter in British Columbia is due to be completed in the first half of 2015 (subject to any additional capital required to 
complete the project receiving Board approval). The most critical assumption for the FVLCD calculation is the cost to complete the project, where a cost overrun  
has recently been identified. A process to validate the extent of the overrun is currently underway; should the cost to complete the project be greater than currently 
forecast, it could result in further impairment. 
Other key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Kitimat is sensitive are: the aluminium price, discount rates, the Canadian dollar exchange rate and 
operating cost assumptions. The price of alumina is not considered a key assumption as it is typically priced as a percentage of the aluminium price. The long-term 
aluminium price for impairment testing purposes decreased by 6.5 per cent (2012: three per cent) in real terms compared to the prior year, marginally above the 
mid-point of the range published for 2017 by market commentators of US$2,001 and US$2,570 per tonne, with an average of US$2,250 per tonne. 
The remaining US$847 million pre-tax impairment loss in the Group’s Aluminium business relates to the full write-off of property, plant and equipment at the  
Gove alumina refinery following the decision to curtail operations and at the Shawinigan aluminium smelter following the decision to close the plant.  
In previous years, the Group’s Aluminium cash-generating units were tested for impairment in aggregate as the goodwill was allocated and monitored at the 
segment level, this goodwill was fully written off in 2012. During 2012 impairment testing of the Group’s Aluminium business resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge  
of US$7,468 million to goodwill (2011: US$7,405 million), a pre-tax impairment charge of US$229 million to intangible assets (2011: US$nil), a pre-tax impairment 
charge of US$3,944 million to property, plant and equipment (2011: US$1,186 million), a post-tax impairment charge of $379 million to investments in equity 
accounted units (2011: US$579 million), and a pre-tax adjustment of US$194 million to other assets and liabilities (2011: US$nil). 
Energy – Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique 
An impairment trigger was identified at Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique following reassessment of the development plan, discount rate and associated country risk 
premium. Subsequent testing resulted in a post-tax impairment of the Benga cash-generating unit, which is classified as an investment in equity accounted unit, of 
US$216 million (2012: US$1,147 million) and a pre-tax impairment of the Zambeze cash-generating unit intangible assets of US$259 million (2012: US$1,581 million) 
and property, plant and equipment of US$22 million (2012: no impairment charge). The impairment recorded in 2012 also included the full write off of goodwill of 
US$541 million which was monitored and tested at the business unit level. 
The recoverable amount for Benga has been determined to be US$86 million assessed by reference to a FVLCD model and the recoverable amount for Zambeze  
has been determined by reference to a value-in-use of nil as the property is undeveloped. 
The recoverable amount for the Benga cash-generating unit is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed 
in real terms have been estimated over the assets’ life based on long term production plans, including restoration and environmental clean-up costs. The cash flows 
are discounted using a country specific post-tax discount rate of 10.3 per cent (2012: 7.9 per cent) for Mozambique. 
The key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Benga is most sensitive are the thermal coal and hard coking coal price; operating costs; discount rates; 
and infrastructure assumptions. Coal prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 1(i).  
Copper – SouthGobi; expansion and undeveloped properties 
The expansion and undeveloped properties in SouthGobi were recognised in accordance with the requirement in IFRS to fair value assets on first consolidation  and 
were therefore recorded as an accounting uplift when Rio Tinto obtained control of Turquoise Hill Resources on 24 January 2012. These assets were not amortised 
and therefore have been tested for impairment. The recoverable amount has been determined as nil by reference to a recoverable amount based on value-in-use.  
As a result, a pre-tax impairment charge of US$113 million has been recorded against intangible assets and a further US$156 million has been recorded against 
property, plant and equipment.

The dividends paid in 2013 are based on the following US cents per share amounts: 2012 final – 94.5 cents, 2013 interim – 83.5 cents (2012 dividends paid:  
2011 final – 91.0 cents, 2012 interim – 72.5 cents; 2011 dividends paid: 2010 final – 63.0 cents, 2011 interim – 54.0 cents). 
The number of shares on which Rio Tinto plc dividends are based excludes those held as treasury shares. 2013, 2012 and 2011, no Rio Tinto Limited shares were 
held by Rio Tinto plc. 
In addition, the directors of Rio Tinto announced a final dividend of 108.5 cents per share on 13 February 2014. This is expected to result in payments of  
US$2,005 million (Rio Tinto plc: US$1,532 million, Rio Tinto Limited US$473 million). The dividends will be paid on 10 April 2014 to Rio Tinto plc shareholders  
on the register at the close of business on 7 March 2014 and to Rio Tinto Limited shareholders on the register at the close of business on 12 March 2014. 
The proposed Rio Tinto Limited dividends will be franked out of existing franking credits or out of franking credits arising from the payment of income tax  
during 2014. 
The approximate amount of the Rio Tinto Limited consolidated tax group’s retained profits and reserves that could be distributed as dividends and franked out  
of credits, that arose from net payments of income tax in respect of periods up to 31 December 2013 (after deducting franking credits expected to be utilised on  
the 2013 final dividend declared), is US$14,298 million.

(a) During 2013, the goodwill impairment charge of US$1,149 million represents the full impairment of goodwill allocated to Oyu Tolgoi. During 2012, the goodwill impairment charge 
related mainly to Rio Tinto Alcan and Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique. Refer to note 6 for further details. 
Impairment tests for goodwill 
Richards Bay Minerals 
The Group consolidated Richards Bay Minerals on 3 September 2012. Goodwill of US$806 million arose in accordance with the requirement in IFRS to recognise  
a deferred tax asset or liability on the difference between the fair value of newly consolidated assets and liabilities and their tax base. The recognition of Richards  
Bay Minerals’ identifiable assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position was based on fair values at the acquisition date determined with the assistance  
of an independent third party valuer.  
Richard Bay Minerals’ annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charge for 2013 (2012: no impairment charge). The recoverable amount has been 
assessed by reference to FVLCD, in line with the policy set out in note 1(i) and classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. FVLCD was determined by 
estimating cash flows until the end of the life of mine plan. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 7.3 per cent (2012: 6.9 per cent) has been applied  
to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.  
The key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Richards Bay Minerals is most sensitive are the long-term titanium slag prices and discount rates.  
Other assumptions include the long-term pig iron and zircon prices, the South African Rand exchange rate against the US dollar and operating costs. Future selling 
prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 1(i).  
A five per cent decrease in the long-term titanium slag price, in isolation, would lead to a US$482 million decrease in the FVLCD. A one per cent increase in the 
discount rate, in isolation, would lead to a US$388 million decrease in the FVLCD. A ten per cent strengthening of the South African Rand against the US dollar, in 
isolation, would lead to a US$920 million decrease in FVLCD. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the carrying value as a result of each of 
these sensitivities applied in isolation. 
Iron Ore – Australia 
The recoverability of goodwill arising from the acquisition of Robe River has been assessed by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows, which is in line with 
the policy set out in note 1(i) and is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 7.3 per cent (2012: 6.9 per 
cent) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms. The recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, 
and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining goodwill to be impaired. 
Other 
The recoverability of the Other goodwill has been assessed by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows, which is in line with the policy set out in note 1(i).  
The recoverable amounts were determined to be in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause  
the remaining goodwill to be impaired by a significant amount.

(a) Exploration and evaluation assets’ useful life is not determined until transferred to property, plant & equipment. The impairment charge in 2013 of US$379 million (2012: US$1,581) 
mainly related to exploration and evaluation assets within Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM) and SouthGobi Resources Limited (see note 6). 
(b) The Group benefits from certain intangible assets acquired with Alcan including power supply contracts, customer contracts and water rights. The water rights are expected to 
contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of operations for the foreseeable future: accordingly, these rights are considered to have indefinite lives and are not subject to 
amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. These water rights constitute the majority of the amounts in ‘Contract based intangible assets’. 
(c) Finite life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Where amortisation is calculated on a straight 
line basis, the following useful lives have been determined:  
 Trademark, patented and non-patented technology 
Trademarks: 14 to 20 years 
Patented and non-patented technology: 10 to 20 years 
 Contract based intangible assets  
Power contracts: 2 to 39 years 
Other purchase and customer contracts: 5 to 15 years 
 Other intangible assets 
Internally generated intangible assets and computer software: 2 to 5 years 
Other intangible assets: 2 to 20 years 
(d) There are no intangible assets either pledged as security or held under restriction of title. 
(e) Impairment test for indefinite lived assets: 
 All indefinite lived intangible assets relate to water rights, having been allocated to the Kitimat and the Quebec smelters cash-generating units within the Aluminium business on 
consolidation of Rio Tinto Alcan in 2007. The annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets resulted in an impairment loss being recognised in the Kitimat cash-generating 
unit as described in note 6. The remaining carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets wholly relate to the water rights in the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit. The carrying 
value of those water rights is US$2,131 million. The Quebec smelters cash-generating unit was tested for impairment and it was determined that its recoverable amount determined  
on a FVLCD basis is US$7,736 million and exceeds the carrying amount by US$385 million. 
 The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been 
estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 7.3 per cent (2012: 6.9 per cent). riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Other intangible assets: 2 to 20 years 
(d) There are no intangible assets either pledged as security or held under restriction of title. 
(e) Impairment test for indefinite lived assets: 
 All indefinite lived intangible assets relate to water rights, having been allocated to the Kitimat and the Quebec smelters cash-generating units within the Aluminium business on 
consolidation of Rio Tinto Alcan in 2007. The annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets resulted in an impairment loss being recognised in the Kitimat cash-generating 
unit as described in note 6. The remaining carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets wholly relate to the water rights in the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit. The carrying 
value of those water rights is US$2,131 million. The Quebec smelters cash-generating unit was tested for impairment and it was determined that its recoverable amount determined  
on a FVLCD basis is US$7,736 million and exceeds the carrying amount by US$385 million. 
 The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been 
estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 7.3 per cent (2012: 6.9 per cent).

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
The key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for the Quebec smelters is most sensitive and the corresponding decrease in FVLCD are set out below:  
 
US$ million
0.5% increase in discount rate applied to post-tax cash flows  492 
5% decrease in aluminium and alumina prices 1,282 
5% strengthening of the Canadian dollar 556 
5% increase in operating costs 810 
Each of the sensitivities has been determined by assuming that the relevant key assumption moves in isolation, except where modifying the aluminium price directly 
affects the price assumption for certain input costs and further assumes that there is no mitigating action by management.   
In previous years, the Group’s Aluminium cash-generating units were tested for impairment in aggregate as the goodwill was allocated and monitored at the 
segment level. The remaining goodwill was fully impaired in 2012. Refer to note 6 for further details.

for reporting as part of the net investment in subsidiaries, on cash flow hedges and on actuarial gains and losses on pension schemes, and on post retirement healthcare plans. 
(b) Deferred tax relating to newly consolidated operations in 2012 is principally the result of deferred tax liabilities arising on the difference between the fair value and the tax base  
of the assets of Richards Bay Minerals and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. Refer to note 37.  
(c) ‘Other movements’ include deferred tax relating to tax payable recognised by subsidiary holding companies on the profits of the equity accounted units to which it relates.  
(d) The deferred tax liability of US$4,140 million (2012: US$5,145 million) includes US$4,139 million (2012: US$5,143 million) due in more than one year. The deferred tax asset of  
US$3,555 million (2012: US$3,476 million) includes US$3,426 million (2012: US$3,331 million) receivable in more than one year. 
(e) Deferred tax is not recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the timing of the remittance and it is probable that there 
will be no remittance in the foreseeable future. If these earnings were remitted, tax of US$183 million (2012: US$198 million) would be payable. 
(f) US$14,200 million (2012: US$15,154 million) of potential deferred tax assets have not been recognised as assets in the financial statements. US$10,664 million (2012: $12,631 million)  
of the potential assets relate to temporary differences that are deductible for the purposes of Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT). US$1,274 million (2012: US$1,034 million) of the 
potential assets relate to trading losses in France, which were acquired as part of the Alcan acquisition. US$652 million (2012: US$447 million) of the potential assets relate to realised 
or unrealised capital losses, recovery of which depends on the existence of capital gains in future years. There is a time limit, the shortest of which is one year, for the recovery 
of US$343 million of these potential assets (2012: US$116 million).  
(g) There is a limited time period, the shortest of which is four years, for the recovery of US$1,384 million (2012: US$1,017 million) of tax losses and other tax assets which have been 
recognised as deferred tax assets in the financial statements. 
(h) Deferred tax assets arising from capital allowances include amounts arising following the introduction of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) on 1 July 2012. Refer to note 9.

(a) At 31 December 2013, trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts of US$12 million (2012: US$23 million). Amounts of US$10 million  
(2012: US$21 million) were impaired; the majority of these receivable more than 90 days overdue.   
(b) Non-current receivables at 31 December 2013 included a US$700 million (2012: US$700 million) prepayment for an intangible asset, as a result of signing the agreement  
for the Simandou iron ore project in 2012. 
(c) Rio Tinto Aluminium has made certain prepayments to equity accounted units for toll processing of alumina. These prepayments will be charged to Group operating  
costs as processing takes place. 
There is no material element of trade and other receivables that is interest bearing. 
The fair value of current trade and other receivables, including the majority of amounts classified as non-current assets, approximates their carrying value.  
As of 31 December 2013, trade and other receivables of US$178 million (2012: US$190 million) were past due but not impaired. The ageing of these receivables  
is as follows: 
 
2013

between 30 and 60 days overdue 71 22
between 60 and 90 days overdue 47 19
more than 90 days overdue 3 32
 178 190 
These relate to a number of customers for whom there is no recent history of default or other indicators of impairment.  
With respect to trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet 
their payment obligations.  
19 Assets and liabilities held for sale

(a) The main assumptions used to determine the provision for pensions and post retirement healthcare, and other information, including the expected level of future funding payments  
in respect of those arrangements, are given in note 45. 
(b) The provision for other employee entitlements includes a provision for long service leave of US$314 million (2012: US$347 million), based on the relevant entitlements in certain  
Group operations and includes US$193 million (2012: US$77 million) of provision for redundancy and severance payments.  
(c) The Group’s policy on close down and restoration costs is described in note 1(k) and in paragraph (v) under ‘critical accounting policies and estimates’ on pages 125 and 129. Close 
down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the relevant operation. Remaining 
lives of mines and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average, weighted by closure provision, of around 21 years (2012: 21 years). Although the ultimate cost to be 
incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their respective costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques. Provisions 
of US$8,582 million (2012: US$9,223 million) for close down and restoration costs and environmental clean up obligations include estimates of the effect of future inflation and have 
been adjusted to reflect risk. These estimates have been discounted to their present value at an average nominal rate of approximately four per cent per annum, based on an estimate 
of the long term, risk free, pre-tax cost of borrowing. Before discounting, this provision is equivalent to some US$12.9 billion (2012: US$13.7 billion). 
(d) Non-current provisions for close down and restoration/environmental expenditure include amounts relating to environmental clean-up of US$327 million (2012: US$507 million) 
expected to take place between one and five years from the statement of financial position date, and US$909 million (2012: US$793 million) expected to take place later than five  
years after the statement of financial position date. 
(e) Close down and restoration/environmental liabilities at 31 December 2013 have not been adjusted for amounts of US$142 million (2012: US$198 million) relating to insurance 
recoveries and other financial assets held for the purposes of meeting these obligations. 
(f) Close down and restoration/environmental remediation provisions decreased during 2012 following a Group wide review of estimated liabilities. The review included a re-evaluation  
of the estimates of risk free discount rates in light of the impact of fiscal interventions and, where appropriate, of the probability weighting for the different remediation, closure or other 
activities required to achieve relinquishment.

(a) The main assumptions used to determine the provision for pensions and post retirement healthcare, and other information, including the expected level of future funding payments  
in respect of those arrangements, are given in note 45. 
(b) The provision for other employee entitlements includes a provision for long service leave of US$314 million (2012: US$347 million), based on the relevant entitlements in certain  
Group operations and includes US$193 million (2012: US$77 million) of provision for redundancy and severance payments.  
(c) The Group’s policy on close down and restoration costs is described in note 1(k) and in paragraph (v) under ‘critical accounting policies and estimates’ on pages 125 and 129. Close 
down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the relevant operation. Remaining 
lives of mines and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average, weighted by closure provision, of around 21 years (2012: 21 years). Although the ultimate cost to be 
incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their respective costs based on feasibility and engineering studies using current restoration standards and techniques. Provisions 
of US$8,582 million (2012: US$9,223 million) for close down and restoration costs and environmental clean up obligations include estimates of the effect of future inflation and have 
been adjusted to reflect risk. These estimates have been discounted to their present value at an average nominal rate of approximately four per cent per annum, based on an estimate 
of the long term, risk free, pre-tax cost of borrowing. Before discounting, this provision is equivalent to some US$12.9 billion (2012: US$13.7 billion). 
(d) Non-current provisions for close down and restoration/environmental expenditure include amounts relating to environmental clean-up of US$327 million (2012: US$507 million) 
expected to take place between one and five years from the statement of financial position date, and US$909 million (2012: US$793 million) expected to take place later than five  
years after the statement of financial position date. 
(e) Close down and restoration/environmental liabilities at 31 December 2013 have not been adjusted for amounts of US$142 million (2012: US$198 million) relating to insurance 
recoveries and other financial assets held for the purposes of meeting these obligations. 
(f) Close down and restoration/environmental remediation provisions decreased during 2012 following a Group wide review of estimated liabilities. The review included a re-evaluation  
of the estimates of risk free discount rates in light of the impact of fiscal interventions and, where appropriate, of the probability weighting for the different remediation, closure or other 
activities required to achieve relinquishment.

(a) The capital redemption reserve was set up to comply with section 733 of the Companies Act 2006 (previously 170 of the Companies Act 1985) when shares of a company are  
redeemed or purchased wholly out of the company’s profits. Balances reflect the amount by which the Company’s issued share capital is diminished in accordance with this section. 
(b) The hedging reserve records gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are recognised initially in equity, as described in note 1 (p) (iii).  
(c) The available for sale revaluation reserves record fair value gains or losses relating to available for sale securities, as described in note 1 (p) (i) (d).  
(d) Other reserves include the cumulative amount recognised under IFRS 2 in respect of options granted but not exercised to acquire shares in Rio Tinto Limited, less, where applicable,  
the cost of shares purchased to satisfy share options exercised. The cumulative amount recognised under IFRS 2 in respect of options granted but not exercised to acquire shares in  
Rio Tinto plc is recorded in retained earnings. 
Other reserves also include US$11,936 million which represents the difference between the nominal value and issue price of the shares issued arising from Rio Tinto plc’s rights issue 
completed in July 2009. No share premium was recorded in the Rio Tinto plc financial statements through the operation of the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985. 
(e) Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Group’s net investment in foreign controlled companies are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, as described in  
note 1(d). The cumulative differences relating to an investment are transferred to the income statement when the investment is disposed of. 
(f) Retained earnings and movements in reserves of subsidiaries include those arising from the Group’s share of joint operations. 
(g) In 2013, there were no actuarial losses relating to equity accounted units (2012: US$nil; 2011: US$5 million).  
(h) In 2011, this is stated net of a US$95 million reclassification between share premium and retained earnings, relating to the weighted average cost of shares held that was applied  
to the sale of shares in Rio Tinto plc to Rio Tinto Limited, and for the satisfaction of share options, in prior periods.

A (b) Financial risk management 
Funding and exposure management 
The Group’s policies on financial risk management are clearly defined and consistently applied. They are a fundamental part of the Group’s long term strategy 
covering areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital management. 
The Group mainly sells commodities it has produced and also enters into third party transactions and physical swaps on alumina to balance the regional positions 
and to balance the loading on production facilities.  
The Group has a diverse portfolio of commodities and operates in a number of markets, which have varying responses to the economic cycle. The relationship 
between commodity prices and the currencies of most of the countries in which the Group operates provides a further natural hedge in the long term. Production  
of minerals, aluminium and alumina is an important contributor to the Gross Domestic Products of Australia and Canada, countries in which the Group has a large 
presence. As a consequence, the Australian and Canadian currencies have historically tended to strengthen when commodity prices are high. In addition, US dollar 
floating interest rates have historically also tended to be high when commodity prices are high, and vice versa, and hence the Group’s interest rate policy is to 
generally borrow and invest, after the impact of hedging, at floating interest rates. However, in some circumstances, the Group elects to maintain a higher proportion 
of fixed rate funding. These natural hedges significantly reduce the necessity for using derivatives or other forms of synthetic hedging. Such hedging is therefore 
undertaken to a strictly limited degree, as described below.  
Treasury operations 
Treasury operates as a service to the businesses of the Group and not as a profit centre. Strict limits on the size and type of transactions permitted are laid down by 
the Board and are subject to rigorous internal controls. Senior management is advised of corporate cash and debt positions, as well as commodity, currency interest 
rate and interest rate derivatives through a monthly reporting framework.

Treasury policy 
Rio Tinto does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes; nor does it believe that it has material exposure to such 
trading or speculative holdings through its investments in joint arrangements and associates. Derivatives are used to separate funding and cash management 
decisions from currency exposure and interest rate management. Bank counterparty exposures are managed within allocated credit limits. Investment, funding  
and cash management activities are managed and co-ordinated by Treasury. 
(i) Foreign exchange risk 
Management policy 
The Group’s shareholders’ equity, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a wide variety of currencies due to the geographic diversity of the Group’s sales and the 
countries in which it operates. The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the majority of the Group’s sales are denominated. Operating costs are influenced by 
the currencies of those countries where the Group’s mines and processing plants are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment 
and services are determined. The Australian and Canadian dollars are the most important currencies (apart from the US dollar) influencing costs. In any particular 
year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on Rio Tinto’s financial results. A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies in which the Group’s 
costs are partly determined has a positive effect on Rio Tinto’s Underlying earnings. 
Given the dominant role of the US currency in the Group’s affairs, the US dollar is the currency in which financial results are presented both internally and externally. 
It is also the most appropriate currency for financing the Group’s operations. Borrowings and cash are predominantly denominated in US dollars, either directly or 
through the use of derivatives. 
Certain US dollar debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, are not held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. 
This results in an accounting exposure to exchange gains and losses as the financial assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiary 
that holds those assets and liabilities. These exchange gains and losses are recorded in the Group’s income statement except to the extent that they can be taken  
to equity under the Group’s accounting policy which is explained in note 1(d). Gains and losses on US dollar net debt and on intragroup balances are excluded from 
Underlying earnings. Other exchange gains and losses are included in Underlying earnings. 
See section B for the details of cross currency interest rate and interest rate swaps relating to borrowings. 
After taking into account relevant swap instruments, almost all of the Group’s net debt is denominated in US dollars. The table below summarises, by currency,

Hedging strategy 
Under normal market conditions, the Group does not generally believe that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long term benefits to shareholders. 
The Group reviews its exposure on a regular basis and reserves the right to enter into hedges to maintain financial stability. Currency protection measures may  
be deemed appropriate in specific commercial circumstances, typically hedging of significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividends,  
and are subject to strict limits laid down by the Board. A monthly treasury report is provided to senior management which summarises corporate debt exposed  
to currency risks after the impact of derivatives. Refer to section B for the details of currency forward, cross currency interest rate and option contracts used to 
manage the currency risk exposures of the Group at 31 December 2013. 
Sensitivities 
The table below gives the estimated retranslation effect on financial assets and financial liabilities of a ten per cent strengthening in the closing exchange rate of the 
US dollar against significant currencies. The sensitivity associated with a ten per cent weakening of a particular currency would be equal and opposite to the figures 
presented. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings, Underlying earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation.  
The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2013, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of 
the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2014, 
and therefore the following information should be used with care.

Ten per cent is the maximum annual exchange rate movement that management deems to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for one of 
the Group’s significant currencies and as such provides an appropriate representation. 
(ii) Interest rate risk  
Management policy  
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. This approach is based on historical 
correlation between interest rates and commodity prices. In some circumstances, the Group may consider a higher proportion of fixed rate funding to be appropriate.  
Hedging strategy 
As noted above, the Group may hedge its interest rate risk by entering into interest rate derivatives to achieve its policies. The market value of such instruments 
moves in alignment with the market and at times can act as an alternative source of funding. The Group reviews the positions on a regular basis and may act to 
monetise in-the-money instruments either to take advantage of favourable market conditions or manage counterparty credit risk. During 2013, no interest rate  
swaps were closed out. During 2012, the Group closed out interest rate swaps with a notional principal of US$200 million giving rise to a net cash inflow of US$3 
million including accrued interest of US$3 million. The interest rate swaps closed out in 2012 were in fair value hedge relationships prior to close out. See section  
B for the details of currency and interest rate swaps relating to borrowings. 
At the end of 2013, US$20.4 billion (2012: US$17.7 billion) of the Group’s adjusted total borrowings was at fixed rates after taking into account interest and currency 
interest rate swaps, resulting in a fixed to floating debt ratio of 72 per cent fixed to 28 per cent floating (2012: 67 per cent fixed to 33 per cent floating). On a net  
debt basis, the fixed to floating debt ratio was 111 per cent fixed liability to (11) per cent floating asset (2012: 91 per cent fixed liability to 9 per cent floating liability).  
The weighted average interest rate on total adjusted borrowings as at 31 December 2013 was 3.8 per cent (2012: 4 per cent) and the weighted average maturity was 
8 years (2012: 9 years). Weighted average effective interest rate is based on interest rates and carrying value of gross borrowings at the year end. Current interest 
rates are applied for debt at floating rates. 
The net debt ratio at the end of 2013 and 2012 reflects the high level of cash, cash equivalents and other liquid resources held by the Group and the impact  
of borrowings held at fixed rates. 
See note 22 (Borrowings and other financial liabilities) for the details of debt outstanding at 31 December 2013.   
Sensitivities 
Based on the Group’s net debt (refer to note 24) and other floating rate financial instruments outstanding as at 31 December 2013, the effect on net earnings  
of a half percentage point increase in US dollar LIBOR interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an increase of US$9 million (2012: decrease  
of US$9 million) reflecting the high level of cash at the period end. The Group has an exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders’ equity arising from  
fair value movements on derivatives in the cash flow reserve. The derivatives have an underlying exposure to Pound sterling and US dollar rates. With all factors 
remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives impacting the cash flow reserve at 31 December 2013, the sensitivity of a 100 basis point increase  
in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by US$106 million charge (2012: US$126 million charge) for Pound sterling  
and US$101 million credit (2012: US$125 million credit) for US dollar. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction. 
These balances will not remain constant throughout 2014, and therefore this information should be used with care.

(iii) Commodity price risk 
Management policy 
The Group’s normal policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices. Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the board and to rigid 
internal controls.  
Metals such as copper and aluminium are generally sold under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, with some volumes sold in the spot market. 
The prices are determined by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and COMEX in New York.  
Prices fluctuate widely in response to changing levels of supply and demand but, in the long run, prices are related to the marginal cost of supply. Gold is also  
priced in an active market in which prices respond to daily changes in quantities offered and sought. Newly mined gold is only one source of supply; investment  
and disinvestment can be important elements of supply and demand. Contract prices for many other natural resource products including coal are generally agreed 
quarterly or for longer periods with customers, although volume commitments vary by product. 
Certain products, predominantly copper concentrate, are ‘provisionally priced’, that is the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to  
the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Revenue is recognised on provisionally priced sales based on 
estimates of fair value of the consideration receivable which is based on forward market prices. At each reporting date provisionally priced metal sales are marked  
to market based on the forward selling price for the period stipulated in the contract. For this purpose the selling price can be measured reliably for those products 
such as copper concentrate for which the price is directly related to the price of copper for which an active and freely traded commodity market exists, such as the 
LME, and the value of product sold by the Group is directly linked to the form in which it is traded on that market. 
The marking to market of provisionally priced sales contracts is recorded as an adjustment to sales revenue. 
At the end of 2013, the Group had 254 million pounds of copper sales (2012: 249 million pounds) that were provisionally priced at US 333 cents per pound  
(2012: US 360 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2014. A ten per cent change in the price of copper realised  
on the provisionally priced sales would increase or reduce net earnings by US$49 million (2012: US$56 million). 
Hedging strategy 
Rio Tinto’s exposure to commodity prices is diversified by virtue of its broad commodity base and the Group does not generally believe commodity price  
hedging would provide a long term benefit to shareholders. The Group may hedge certain commitments with some of its customers or suppliers. Details  
of commodity derivatives held at 31 December 2013 are set out in section B. 
Sensitivities 
The Group’s commodity derivatives are impacted by changes in market prices and include those aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in electricity 
purchase contracts outstanding at 31 December 2013. A ten per cent increase in market prices would reduce net earnings by US$164 million (2012: US$144 million) 
and a ten per cent decrease in prices would increase net earnings by US$93 million (2012: US$125 million). A ten per cent change in prices would impact equity, 
before tax, by US$8 million (2012: US$13 million). 
The Group’s “own use contracts” are excluded from the sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IAS 39. Such contracts to buy or sell non financial items 
can be net settled but were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non financial item in accordance with the business 
unit’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. The sensitivity does not include the impact arising from derivatives held by equity accounted units. Including 
equity accounted units primarily impacts the sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase in aluminium prices and would result in a US$59 million reduction in net earnings 
(2012: US$59 million). 
(iv) Credit risk 
Treasury management policy 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.  
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its financing activities, including investments  
in government securities, deposits with banks and financial institutions, other short term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and  
other financial instruments. 
Credit risks related to receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk 
management. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal or external rating criteria. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating 
agency, these ratings are used to set credit limits. In circumstances where no independent credit rating exists, the credit quality of the customer is assessed based  
on an extensive credit rating scorecard. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any credit concerns highlighted to senior management.  
High risk shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group had approximately 120 customers (2012: 80 customers) that owed the Group more than US$5 million each and these balances 
accounted for approximately 93 per cent (2012: 68 per cent) of all receivables owing. There were 46 customers (2012: 25 customers) with balances greater than 
US$20 million accounting for just over 65 per cent (2012: just over 48 per cent) of total amounts receivable. Details of trade and other receivables past due but  
not impaired are provided in Note 18. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets (refer to table of financial assets and liabilities 
reported above). The Group does not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables.

(2012: US 360 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2014. A ten per cent change in the price of copper realised  
on the provisionally priced sales would increase or reduce net earnings by US$49 million (2012: US$56 million). 
Hedging strategy 
Rio Tinto’s exposure to commodity prices is diversified by virtue of its broad commodity base and the Group does not generally believe commodity price  
hedging would provide a long term benefit to shareholders. The Group may hedge certain commitments with some of its customers or suppliers. Details  
of commodity derivatives held at 31 December 2013 are set out in section B. 
Sensitivities 
The Group’s commodity derivatives are impacted by changes in market prices and include those aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in electricity 
purchase contracts outstanding at 31 December 2013. A ten per cent increase in market prices would reduce net earnings by US$164 million (2012: US$144 million) 
and a ten per cent decrease in prices would increase net earnings by US$93 million (2012: US$125 million). A ten per cent change in prices would impact equity, 
before tax, by US$8 million (2012: US$13 million). 
The Group’s “own use contracts” are excluded from the sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IAS 39. Such contracts to buy or sell non financial items 
can be net settled but were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non financial item in accordance with the business 
unit’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. The sensitivity does not include the impact arising from derivatives held by equity accounted units. Including 
equity accounted units primarily impacts the sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase in aluminium prices and would result in a US$59 million reduction in net earnings 
(2012: US$59 million). 
(iv) Credit risk 
Treasury management policy 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.  
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its financing activities, including investments  
in government securities, deposits with banks and financial institutions, other short term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and  
other financial instruments. 
Credit risks related to receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk 
management. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal or external rating criteria. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating 
agency, these ratings are used to set credit limits. In circumstances where no independent credit rating exists, the credit quality of the customer is assessed based  
on an extensive credit rating scorecard. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any credit concerns highlighted to senior management.  
High risk shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group had approximately 120 customers (2012: 80 customers) that owed the Group more than US$5 million each and these balances 
accounted for approximately 93 per cent (2012: 68 per cent) of all receivables owing. There were 46 customers (2012: 25 customers) with balances greater than 
US$20 million accounting for just over 65 per cent (2012: just over 48 per cent) of total amounts receivable. Details of trade and other receivables past due but  
not impaired are provided in Note 18. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets (refer to table of financial assets and liabilities 
reported above). The Group does not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables.

Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits 
Credit risk from investments in government securities (primarily US Government treasuries and funds) or AAA rated money market funds and balances with banks 
and financial institutions is managed by Group Treasury in accordance with a board approved policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved 
counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty mainly based upon specific assessment criteria. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by  
the Rio Tinto board at least annually. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through 
counterparty failure.  
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group’s financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows:

(v) Liquidity and Capital risk management  
Management policy 
The Group’s overriding objective when managing capital is to safeguard the business as a going concern whilst maximising returns for shareholders. In practice, this 
involves regular reviews by the board and senior management. These reviews take into account the Group’s strategic priorities, economic and business conditions 
and opportunities that are identified to invest across all points of the commodities cycle, and the focus on the progressive dividend policy, whilst also striving to 
maintain the Group’s “A-” credit rating. The resulting capital structure provides the Group with a high degree of financial flexibility at a low cost of capital. 
To maintain an “A-” credit rating, the Group considers various financial metrics including the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, 
total capital, cash flow, EBITDA and interest cover ratios either on a statutory reported basis or as expected to be adjusted by the credit rating agencies. 
The Group’s total capital, which is defined as equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto plus equity attributable to non-controlling interests plus net debt, amounted 
to US$71.6 billion at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$76.9 billion).

Net debt (note 24)  18,055 19,192 
Total capital 71,557 76,932
Net debt is a measure used by management and the board of directors to manage the Group’s capital structure and therefore is linked to the Group’s financial  
and operational excellence strategic driver. Net debt is disclosed and defined in note 24. Net debt decreased from US$19.2 billion at 31 December 2012 to  
US$18.1 billion at 31 December 2013 as operating cash inflows and divestment proceeds were partly offset by outflows relating to capital expenditure and the 
increase in the dividend. Net debt to total capital was 25 per cent at 31 December 2013 (2012: 25 per cent) and interest cover was 13 times (2012: 13 times). 
The unified credit status of the Group is maintained through cross guarantees whereby contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are 
automatically guaranteed by the other. The table below summarises the credit ratings attributed to the Group as at 31 December.

The Group has access to various forms of financing including but not limited to, Capital markets as well as the bank market. In June 2013, under its US Shelf 
Programme, the Group issued four Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds: US$1,000 million 1.375% bond due 2016, US$1,250 million 2.250% bond due 2018,  
US$250 million LIBOR plus 0.55% bond due 2015 and US$500 million LIBOR plus 0.840% bond due 2016. In March 2012, under its US Shelf Programme, the  
Group issued four Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds: US$500 million 1.125% bond due 2015, US$500 million 2.000% bond due 2017, US$1,000 million 3.500%  
bond due 2022 and US$500 million 4.750% bond due 2042. In August 2012, the Group issued three Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds: US$1,250 million 1.625% 
bond due 2017, US$1,000 million 2.875% bond due 2022 and US$750 million 4.125% bond due 2042. In December 2012, under its European Debt Issuance 
Programme, the Group issued three Rio Tinto Finance plc bonds: EUR750 million 2.00% bond due 2020, EUR500 million 2.875% bond due 2024 and GBP500  
million 4.00% bond due 2029. The Euro denominated bonds were swapped using cross currency interest rate swaps to US dollar floating rate bonds and  
the GBP bond was swapped to a US dollar fixed rate bond. 
Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited entered into new facility agreements for the aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion on 15 November 2013 as 
borrowers with a syndicate of banks. The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. The facilities comprise a US$1,875 million three-year multi-
currency revolving credit facility and a US$5,625 million five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility (including a US$ denominated same day access swingline 
facility). Both facilities could be extended for one year on the first anniversary and for a further year on the second anniversary of the date of the facility agreements 
by mutual agreement of the parties to the agreement. The funds made available under the facility agreements may be used for general corporate purposes of the 
Group. The new facilities replace the US$6 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility dated 12 November 2010 and the US$2 billion bilateral bank facility 
agreements entered in the last quarter of 2012 which were closed out on 15 November 2013. 
Advances under the revolving facilities bear an interest rate per annum equal to the margin (which is dependent on the Group’s long-term credit rating as 
determined by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s and the level of drawdown) plus LIBOR or EURIBOR, CDOR or BBSW (in relation to any Euro, Canadian dollar  
or Australian dollar loans) plus a margin. The facility agreements contain no financial covenants. At 31 December 2013, the facilities were undrawn. 
During the last quarter of 2012, the Group entered into bilateral bank facility agreements amounting to US$2 billion in aggregate. The facilities were denominated  
in US dollars and had a term of one year that was extendable, at the Group’s option, by a further 364 days. Any borrowings under each facility were at prevailing 
LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin dependent on the amount of drawdown and the credit rating of the Group. The facilities were not subject to financial covenants. 
At 31 December 2012, the facilities were undrawn and subsequently closed out on 15 November 2013. 
In November 2010, the Group entered into a US$6 billion multi-currency committed revolving credit facility maturing in November 2015 with its relationship banks. 
Any borrowings under this facility were at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin dependent on the amount of drawdown and the credit rating of the Group. 
The facility was not subject to any financial covenants. The overall agreement also enabled same day access to a US$ swing-line facility. The funds available under 
the facility agreement could have been used for general corporate purposes of the Group. At 31 December 2012, the facility was undrawn and subsequently closed 
out on 15 November 2013. 
Further details of the Group’s credit facilities are set out in note 22 of the 2013 financial statements.  
In February 2011, the Group commenced a US$5 billion share buy-back programme. During 2012, 26 million Rio Tinto plc shares were bought back at a total cost  
of US$1.5 billion which completed the programme in March 2012.

(a) Aluminium embedded derivatives (forward contracts and options) are contained within certain aluminium smelter electricity purchase contracts. These contracts reduce the Group’s 
exposure to movements in the aluminium price.  
(b) The interest rate swaps are used to convert certain fixed rate borrowings to a floating rate. For further details, see note 22 ‘Borrowings and other financial liabilities’. 
(c) The cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert non US dollar denominated borrowings to either fixed or floating US dollar borrowings. For further details see note 22 
‘Borrowings and other financial liabilities’. 
(d) The aluminium forward contracts are entered into to convert aluminium sales made at a fixed price to LME cash and to hedge the sales from high cost smelters. No ineffective portion 
arising from cash flow hedges was recognised in the income statement in 2013 (2012: gain of US$6 million pre tax). 
The aluminium forward contracts which were taken out to convert aluminium sales made as a fixed price to LME cash are not designated as hedges as they  
largely offset. 
C Fair values 
The carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Group’s financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates their fair value at  
31 December are shown in the following table. The fair values of the Group’s cash, short term borrowings and loans to equity accounted units approximate  
their carrying values as a result of their short maturity or because they carry floating rates of interest (see note 1(p)).

(a) Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. This category includes listed equity shares and other quoted funds. 
(b) Valuation is based on inputs that are observable for the financial instruments which includes quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which  
are not considered to be active or either directly or indirectly based on observable market data.  
(c) Valuation is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
(d) Other Investments, including loans comprise cash deposits in rehabilitation funds, government bonds, contingent consideration receivable from divested businesses and royalty 
amounts receivable. The royalty receivables are valued based on an estimate of future production subject to the royalty agreement. 
(e) The net asset or liability derivative balance for the three different categories reconcile to the net asset and liability balances presented in section B. 
(f) Interest rate and currency interest rate swaps are valued using applicable market quoted swap yield curves adjusted for relevant basis and credit default spreads. Currency interest  
rate swap valuations also use market quoted foreign exchange rates. A discounted cash flow approach is applied to the cash flows derived from the inputs to determine fair value. 
(g) Level 3 derivatives consist of embedded derivatives in electricity purchase contracts linked to the LME with terms expiring between 2014 and 2040. The embedded derivatives are 
measured using discounted cash flows and option model valuation techniques. Long-term embedded derivatives with a fair value of US$196 million at 31 December 2013 is valued 
using significant unobservable inputs as the term of the derivatives extends beyond the forward curve for aluminium. 
Aluminium prices are flatlined beyond the market forward curve and increased by projected inflation up to the date of expiry of the contract. The range of market prices are  
US$2,413 per metric tonne in 2024 to US$3,157 in 2040. The other contracts with a fair value of US$35 million at 31 December 2013 are categorised as level 3 as the market premium 
assumptions used represent material unobservable inputs.  
(h) There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and between Level 2 and Level 3 in 2013. 
C (b) Level 3 Financial assets and Financial liabilities 
The table below shows the summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2013

Sensitivity analysis in respect of level 3 derivatives 
The carrying value of forward contracts valued using unobservable inputs is calculated using appropriate discounted cash flow and option model valuation 
techniques. The most significant assumptions relate to internal long term aluminium prices beyond 10 years. A 10 per cent increase in long term aluminium  
prices would result in a US$165 million (2012: US$205 million) decrease in carrying value. A 10 per cent decrease in long term aluminium prices would result  
in a US$94 million (2012: US$181 million) increase in carrying value.

(a) Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities  
to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. The definition of purchase obligations has been further clarified for  
2013 and comparatives restated accordingly. In particular, purchase obligations between subsidiaries and joint arrangements are now included to the extent that they relate to  
other venturers.

(a) Indemnities and other performance guarantees represent the potential outflow of funds from the Group for the satisfaction of obligations including those under contractual 
arrangements (for example undertakings related to rehabilitation activities and supplier agreements) not provided for in the statement of financial position, where the likelihood  
of the guarantees or indemnities being called is assessed as possible rather than probable or remote. The comparative for indemnities and other performance guarantees for 2012  
has been restated for consistency. 
(b) There were no contingent liabilities arising in relation to the Group’s joint ventures and associates.  
There are a number of legal claims currently outstanding against the Group. No material loss to the Group is expected to result from these claims.  
Contingent assets 
The Group has various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers including claims relating to the Manefay slide at Kennecott Utah Copper in April 2013.  
An interim progress payment was received on this claim in 2013. Further receipts are considered probable but the amount cannot currently be reliably estimated.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
The Group comprises a large number of companies and it is not practical to include all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those companies that  
have a more significant impact on the profit or assets of the Group.  
The Group’s principal subsidiaries are mostly held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited. 
(a) Of the Group’s 80 per cent interest in Coal & Allied Industries Limited, an indirect share of 4.29 per cent is held through its investment in an equity accounted unit. Coal & Allied forms 
part of the Rio Tinto Coal Australia business unit.  
Through a series of intermediate companies Coal & Allied holds interests in Bengalla (40 per cent), Mount Thorley (80 per cent) and Warkworth (55.6 per cent). The Group’s beneficial 
interests are therefore: Bengalla: 32 per cent; Mount Thorley: 64 per cent; Warkworth: 44.5 per cent. These are unincorporated arrangements that are not entities; the Group recognises 
its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to these arrangements. Coal & Allied also owns 100 per cent of Hunter Valley Operations. 
(b) Queensland Coal Pty Limited is the main legal entity that holds the Group’s interests in Hail Creek (82 per cent), Blair Athol (71.2 per cent), Clermont (50.1 per cent) and Kestrel  
(80 per cent). These are unincorporated arrangements that are not entities; the Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to these arrangements. 
Queensland Coal forms part of the Rio Tinto Coal Australia business unit. 
(c) Robe River Mining Company Pty Limited (which is 60 per cent owned by the Group) holds a 30 per cent interest in Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River). North Mining Ltd (which  
is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 35 per cent interest in Robe River. Through these companies the Group recognises a 65 per cent share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses of Robe River, with a 12 per cent non-controlling interest. The Group therefore has a 53 per cent beneficial interest in Robe River. 
(d) Alcan Alumina Ltda holds the Group’s 10 per cent interest in Consórcio De Alumínio Do Maranhão, a joint operation in which Group participates but is not a joint operator.  
The Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to this arrangement. 
(e) This entity is incorporated in the United States of America but operates in Canada. 
(f) Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. is the legal entity that owns the Group’s 60 per cent interest in the Diavik diamond mine (Diavik), an unincorporated arrangement that is not an entity.  
The Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses relating to this arrangement. 
(g) Simfer Jersey, a company incorporated in Jersey in which the Group has a 53 per cent interest, has a 95 per cent interest in Simfer S.A. the company that operates the Simandou  
mining project in Guinea. The Group therefore has a 50.4 per cent indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the 
Simandou iron ore project. 
(h) The Group’s shareholding in QIT Madagascar Minerals SA carries an 80 per cent economic interest and 80 per cent of the total voting rights, a further 5 per cent economic interest is 
held through non-voting investment certificates to give an economic interest of 85 per cent. The non-controlling interests have a 15 per cent economic interest and 20 per cent of the 
total voting rights. 
(i) The Group obtained a controlling interest in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (formerly Ivanhoe Mines Limited) on 24 January 2012. Ivanhoe was renamed Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. 
(Turquoise Hill) on 2 August 2012. Refer to note 37 for further details relating to the consolidation of Turquoise Hill. The Group has a 50.79 per cent interest in Turquoise Hill which 
holds a 66 per cent interest in Oyu Tolgoi (OT) and a 55.95 per cent interest in SouthGobi Resources Ltd (SouthGobi); these companies are subsidiaries of Turquoise Hill. The Group 
therefore has a 33.5 per cent indirect interest in OT and a 28.4 per cent indirect interest in SouthGobi.  
This entity is incorporated in Canada but operates in Mongolia. 
(j) This entity is incorporated in Australia but operates in Mozambique. 
(k) The Group’s shareholding in Rössing Uranium Limited carries 35.54 per cent of the total voting rights; the non-controlling interests hold 64.46 per cent of the total voting rights.  
Rössing is consolidated by virtue of board control. The Government of Namibia has the ability to veto matters that are considered not to be in the interest of Namibia, this is considered 
to be a protective right. Rio Tinto therefore has control of Rössing and consolidates it as a subsidiary. 
(l) Additional classes of shares issued by Richards Bay Titanium Proprietary Limited and Richards Bay Mining (Proprietary) Limited representing non-controlling interests are not shown. 
The Group’s total legal and beneficial interest in Richards Bay Titanium (Proprietary) Limited and Richards Bay Mining (Proprietary) Limited is 74 per cent.

The Group’s principal joint ventures are held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited. 
(a) Although the Group has a 30 per cent interest in this entity, participant and management agreements allow for an Owners’ Council whereby significant  commercial and operational 
decisions about the relevant activities that significantly affect the returns that are generated require the joint approval of both Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (holders of a 57.5 per cent 
interest). It is therefore determined that Rio Tinto participates in joint control. 
 The year end of Minera Escondida Limitada is 30 June. The amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of Rio Tinto are however based on accounts of Minera Escondida 
Limitada that are coterminous with those of the Group. 
(b) Although the Group holds a 65 per cent interest in this entity, decisions about the relevant activities that significantly affect the returns that are generated require agreement  
of both parties to the arrangement. It is therefore determined that Rio Tinto participates in joint control.

Tete, Mozambique. 
(c) Although the Group holds a 20 per cent interest in this entity, decisions about relevant activities that significantly affect the returns that are generated require agreement of all parties

The Group’s principal associates are held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited. 
The Group comprises a large number of operations and it is not practical to include all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those associates that  
have a more significant impact on the profit or operating assets of the Group. 
(a) The parties that collectively control this entity do so through decisions that are determined on an aggregate voting interest that can be achieved by several combinations of the  
parties; although each combination requires Rio Tinto’s approval, this is not joint control as defined under IFRS 11. Rio Tinto is therefore determined to have significant influence  
over this company. 
(b) Although the Group holds only 12 per cent of this entity, it has representation on its board of directors and a consequent ability to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions. It is therefore determined that Rio Tinto has significant influence.  
(c) Halco has a 51 per cent indirect interest in Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée, a bauxite mine, the core assets of which are located in Guinea.

The Group’s principal associates are held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited. 
The Group comprises a large number of operations and it is not practical to include all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those associates that  
have a more significant impact on the profit or operating assets of the Group. 
(a) The parties that collectively control this entity do so through decisions that are determined on an aggregate voting interest that can be achieved by several combinations of the  
parties; although each combination requires Rio Tinto’s approval, this is not joint control as defined under IFRS 11. Rio Tinto is therefore determined to have significant influence  
over this company. 
(b) Although the Group holds only 12 per cent of this entity, it has representation on its board of directors and a consequent ability to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions. It is therefore determined that Rio Tinto has significant influence.  
(c) Halco has a 51 per cent indirect interest in Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée, a bauxite mine, the core assets of which are located in Guinea. 
Summary information for associates that are material to the Group 
This summarised financial information is shown on a 100 per cent basis. It represents the amounts shown in the associate’s financial statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRS under Group accounting policies, including amounts due to and from Rio Tinto.

2013 Acquisitions 
There were no material acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2013.  
2012 Acquisitions 
Consolidation of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. 
On 24 January 2012, Rio Tinto increased its ownership of shares in Turquoise Hill to a controlling 51.01 per cent interest. The acquisition gave Rio Tinto control  
of the assets in Turquoise Hill other than those relating to Oyu Tolgoi (OT), control of which the Group had previously gained in 2010. 
Total consideration to acquire the controlling interest in Turquoise Hill amounted to US$839 million, comprising US$678 million relating to the fair value of the 
Group’s interest in Turquoise Hill prior to the acquisition date, and US$161 million of cash price paid to acquire the controlling interest after adjusting for amounts 
attributable to OT and net intragroup balances between Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill. Fair values on acquisition of Turquoise Hill were determined and finalised  
during 2012. 
Consolidation of Richards Bay Minerals  
On 7 September 2012, Rio Tinto increased its holding in Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) to 74 per cent with consolidation effective from 3 September 2012, following 
the completion of its acquisition of BHP Billiton’s entire interests including BHP Billiton’s 37 per cent indirect equity voting interests in the RBM operating companies. 
The acquisition price was US$1.9 billion before contractual adjustments for cash payments made by RBM to BHP Billiton since the acquisition trigger date of  
1 February 2012. This price included US$0.6 billion for BHP Billiton’s 37 per cent equity interest in RBM, US$1.0 billion for a 50 per cent interest in outstanding  
RBM shareholder financing arrangements and US$0.3 billion for a royalty stream.  
Provisional fair values recognised on acquisition were finalised by 3 September 2013, 12 months after the consolidation date. No adjustments were made to 
provisional fair values as a result of finalisation. 
2011 Acquisitions 
Rio Tinto Mozambique (formerly Riversdale Mining Limited) 
During 2011, between January and July, Rio Tinto acquired a 100 per cent interest in Riversdale Mining Limited. The purchase was accounted for as an acquisition 
taking place in two stages; first the acquisition of a 52.6 per cent controlling interest on 8 April 2011 (the acquisition date) for US$1,713 million net of cash acquired, 
and record the purchase of additional interest for US$1,977 million after the acquisition date.  
Rio Tinto Canada Uranium Corporation (formerly Hathor Exploration Limited)  
During 2011, between April and December, Rio Tinto acquired an 88 per cent controlling interest in Hathor Exploration Limited (Hathor). By 12 January 2012 the 
remaining 12 per cent was acquired and Hathor was subsequently delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and renamed Rio Tinto Canada Uranium Corporation.  
Goodwill arising on acquisition comprised US$150 million, being Rio Tinto’s 88 per cent share of the amount calculated in accordance with IFRS to recognise a 
deferred tax liability on the difference between the provisional fair value of newly consolidated assets and liabilities with their tax base. 
Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (formerly Ivanhoe Mines Limited) 
During the year ended 31 December 2011, Rio Tinto increased its ownership of shares in Ivanhoe Mines Limited by 132.7 million, for aggregate consideration of 
US$1,860 million, increasing its ownership from 40.3 per cent to 49.0 per cent.

2012 Disposals 
Chalco Joint Venture and Settlement Agreement with Government of Guinea (GoG) for the Simandou Iron Ore Project 
On 24 April 2012, Rio Tinto and Chalco, a listed subsidiary of The Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco), completed the formation of their joint venture to 
develop and operate the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, following the completion of all Chinese regulatory approvals. To complete earn in to a 44.65 per cent 
net economic interest in the Simandou project, a consortium led by Chalco made a payment to Rio Tinto of US$1.35 billion, in line with an agreement reached with 
Rio Tinto on 29 July 2010. In late 2013 Chalco completed the transfer of 65 per cent of their interest in Simandou to their holding company, Chinalco, who now holds 
the Simandou interest directly. 
Under the Settlement Agreement signed by Rio Tinto and the Government of Guinea on 22 April 2011, GoG has an option to take an interest of up to 35 per cent  
in Simfer S.A. (Simfer), the Rio Tinto subsidiary that will undertake the mining portion of the Simandou project. 
The Settlement Agreement provides for the transfer of ownership of railway and port infrastructure from Simfer to a newly formed Infrastructure entity (InfraCo) 
in which GoG had indicated its intention to fund a 51 per cent interest.  
Amendment to Simfer’s mining convention and the terms of a new infrastructure convention, required to give effect to the Settlement Agreement (including the  
GoG participation in the Project), need to be finalised and will require legislative ratification.  
The eventual basis of accounting for InfraCo remains to be determined pending finalisation of the detailed infrastructure agreements. 
Other disposals 
During 2012, Rio Tinto completed the sale of Alcan Cable, the Specialty Alumina businesses, and the Lynemouth Power Station. Finalisation of working capital 
adjustments took place where applicable and did not result in a material impact on the Group. 
2011 Disposals 
Constellium (formerly Alcan Engineered Products)  
On 4 January 2011, Rio Tinto completed the divestment of 61 per cent of Alcan Engineered Products (AEP) to certain investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global 
Management, LLC (Apollo) and the Fonds Stratégique d´investissement (FSI). The terms of the transaction are confidential. AEP was rebranded as Constellium on  
3 May 2011. 
Divestment of the talc business

42 Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) 
The Group owns 53.8 per cent of the issued share capital of BCL. Mining has been suspended at the Panguna mine since 1989. Safe access by company employees 
has not been possible since that time and an accurate assessment of the condition of the assets cannot therefore be made. Considerable funding would be required 
to recommence operations to the level which applied at the time of the mines closure in 1989. An Order of Magnitude Study completed by BCL in 2013 indicated  
an estimated capital requirement of US$5.2 billion to reopen the mine assuming all site infrastructure is replaced. Rio Tinto does not have control over BCL under 
IFRS as it does not have the current ability to direct the activities that affect its returns, being the mining and sale of ore from the Panguna mine; it is therefore not  
a subsidiary.  
43 Events after the statement of financial position date 
On 13 January 2014, Rio Tinto’s 50.8 per cent subsidiary Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd closed its rights offering. Rio Tinto exercised all of its rights under the basic 
subscription, with holders of the non-controlling interest subscribing for 495,133,382 shares at a price of C$2.53 per share. Rio Tinto’s share in Turquoise Hill 
remained unchanged at 50.8 per cent of common shares as a result of the offering.  
On 12 February 2014, the Group announced that it had entered into an option agreement for LNG Canada to acquire or lease a wharf and associated land at  
Rio Tinto’s port facility at Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada. 
Other than the items above, no events were identified after the statement of financial position date which could be expected to have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements. 
44 Share based payments 
Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (the Companies) have a number of share based payment plans, which are described in detail in the Remuneration Report.  
These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of ‘IFRS 2 Share-based Payment’. 
The charge/(credit) that has been recognised in the income statement for Rio Tinto’s share-based compensation plans, and the related liability (for cash-settled 
plans), is set out in the table below.

The 2012 share based payment charge included one off costs associated with management changes at Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) of US$76 million.  
These costs were incurred on TRQ’s own share based payment plans. These charges did not recur in 2013 and are not expected to recur in future years.  
The main Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans are as follows: 
Share Savings Plans  
Awards under these plans are settled in equity and accounted for accordingly. The fair value of each award on the day of grant was estimated using a lattice-based 
option valuation model, including allowance for the exercise price being at a discount to market price. 
Awards are no longer granted under the Share Savings Plans as these plans were replaced by the Global Employee Share Plan in 2012. Charges will continue  
to be incurred until prior period awards have vested.

Share Option Plan 
The Group has a policy of settling awards made under the Share Option Plan in equity, although the directors at their discretion can offer a cash alternative.  
The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions. The performance conditions  
in relation to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) have been incorporated in the measurement of fair value for these awards by modelling the correlation between  
Rio Tinto’s TSR and that of the HSBC Global Mining Index. The relationship between Rio Tinto’s TSR and the index was simulated many thousands of times to  
derive a distribution which, in conjunction with the lattice-based option valuation model, was used to determine the fair value of the options.  
No awards were granted under the Share Option Plans in 2013 as the LTIP arrangements have been simplified and awards are now only made under the 
Performance Share Plan. Charges will continue to be incurred until prior period awards have vested. 
UK Share Plan (formerly the Share Ownership Plan) 
The fair values of awards of Matching and Free Shares made by Rio Tinto are taken to be the market value of the shares on the date of purchase. These awards  
are settled in equity. The total fair value of shares awarded during the year was US$2 million (2012: US$3 million). 
Performance Share Plan 
Participants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their awards and therefore the Plan is accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying  
to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
For the awards or parts of awards with TSR performance conditions, the fair value (FV) of the awards was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking  
into account the TSR performance conditions. In each case fair values were adjusted for non receipt of dividends between grant date and date of vesting (excluding 
awards for executive directors and product group CEOs). One-third of the 2013 awards must satisfy an earnings target relative to ten global mining  comparators  
for vesting. As this is a non-market related performance condition, under IFRS 2, the fair value recognised is reviewed at each accounting date based on the  
directors’ expectations for the proportion vesting. As at 31 December 2013 it was assumed 100 per cent of awards subject to the condition would vest. Forfeitures  
are assumed prior to vesting at three per cent per annum of outstanding awards (except for the 2009 awards which applied to senior executives only with no 
allowance for forfeitures). 
Management Share Plan 
The Management Share Plan was introduced during 2007 to provide conditional share-based awards to management. The vesting of these awards is dependent  
on service and/or performance based conditions being met. In general, the awards will be settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award  
to vesting. The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to share price on the day of grant less a small adjustment for the timing of dividends. Forfeitures are 
assumed prior to vesting at five per cent per annum of outstanding awards. 
Bonus Deferral Plan 
The Bonus Deferral Plan was originally introduced during 2009 for the mandatory deferral of the 2008 bonuses for executive directors, product group executives and 
for other executives. Additional Bonus Deferral Awards were made in 2010, 2011 and 2012 for the mandatory deferral of 50 per cent of the bonuses for executive 
directors and product group executives and 10 per cent of the bonuses for other executives. 
The vesting of these awards is dependent only on service conditions being met. In general, the awards will be settled in equity including the dividends accumulated 
from date of award to vesting. The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.  
The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to share price on the day of grant less a small adjustment for the timing of dividends vesting. Forfeitures  
are assumed prior to vesting at three per cent per annum of outstanding awards. 
Global Employee Share Plan  
The Global Employee Share Plan was introduced during 2012. The company provides matching shares for each share purchased. The vesting of these matching 
awards is dependent on service conditions being met. These awards are settled in equity. The fair value of each matching share on the day of grant is equal to share 
price on the date of purchase. Forfeitures are assumed prior to vesting at five per cent per annum of outstanding awards.

45  Post retirement benefits 
Description of plans 
The Group operates a number of pension and post retirement healthcare plans around the world. Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are  
defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.  
Defined benefit pension and post retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks:  
Uncertainty in benefit payments  The value of the Group’s liabilities for post retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out.  
This in turn will depend on the future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form  
of inflation protection) and how long individuals live.  
Volatility in asset values The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.  
Uncertainty in cash funding Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of  
cash funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries 
control over the rate of cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee 
body or other body that is not under the Group’s direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in 
pension regulation.  
For these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provision and towards defined contribution arrangements instead.  
The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees some plans remain open  
but others are closed.  
The Group does not usually participate in multiemployer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group’s participation  
in such plans is immaterial and consequently no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.

Description of plans 
The Group operates a number of pension and post retirement healthcare plans around the world. Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are  
defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.  
Defined benefit pension and post retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks:  
Uncertainty in benefit payments  The value of the Group’s liabilities for post retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out.  
This in turn will depend on the future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form  
of inflation protection) and how long individuals live.  
Volatility in asset values The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.  
Uncertainty in cash funding Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of  
cash funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries 
control over the rate of cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee 
body or other body that is not under the Group’s direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in 
pension regulation.  
For these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provision and towards defined contribution arrangements instead.  
The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees some plans remain open  
but others are closed.  
The Group does not usually participate in multiemployer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group’s participation  
in such plans is immaterial and consequently no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.

Pension plans  
The majority of the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US, Switzerland and the Eurozone.  
In Canada the benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and are closed to new entrants. Benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed  
in negotiation with unions and are typically either linked to final average pay or to a flat monetary amount per year of service. Some of these plans have been  
closed to new entrants but some remain open at present. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to Canadian pension plans in the relevant 
provinces and territories (predominantly Quebec). Pension Committees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with the 
relevant regulations. The Pension Committees generally have a number of members appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the plan participants.  
In some cases there is also an independent Committee member.  
The defined benefit sections of the UK arrangements are linked to final pay and are closed to new members. New employees are admitted to defined contribution 
sections. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to UK pension plans. Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a 
manner that is compliant with UK regulations. Trustee boards have a number of directors appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the plan participants. 
In some cases there is also an independent trustee director.  
A number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities. Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and closed to new 
entrants, while benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically a flat monetary amount per year of service. A Benefits 
Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the plans are compliant with US regulations. Members of that Committee are appointed by the sponsor.  
In Europe, there are defined benefit plans in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and France. The largest single plan is in Switzerland and provides benefits  
linked to final average pay. The Swiss plan is overseen by a Foundation Board which is responsible for ensuring that the plan complies with Swiss regulations. 
Foundation Board members are appointed by the plan sponsor, by employees and by retirees.  
In Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay, typically  
paid in lump sum form. The defined benefit sections are closed to new entrants.  
The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.  
Post retirement healthcare plans  
Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their 
beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements are generally unfunded,  
and are included in the figures below.  
Plan assets  
The assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. Consequently the funding level of the pension 
plans is affected by movements in the level of equity markets and also by movements in interest rates. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates 
and equity markets and also measures its statement of financial position pension risk using a Value at Risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding 
whether significant changes in investment strategy are required. Asset-liability studies are conducted on a periodic basis for the main pension plans to determine the 
optimal investment mix bearing in mind the Group’s tolerance for risk, the risk tolerance of the local sponsor companies and the views of the Pension Committees 
and Trustee boards who are legally responsible for the investments of the plans. In Canada, the UK and Switzerland the Group works with the trustees to ensure that 
the investment policy adopted is consistent with the Group’s tolerance for risk. In the US the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to the local 
investment regulations.  
The proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at the statement of financial position date were:

The assets of the plans are managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers. These managers may invest in the Group’s securities subject  
to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$40 million 
(2012: US$47 million). 
The holdings of quoted equities are invested either in pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These equity portfolios 
are well diversified in terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

The holdings of government bonds are generally invested in the debt of the country in which a pension plan is situated. Corporate and other quoted bonds  
are usually of investment grade. Private debt is mainly in North America. 
The quoted property funds are invested in a diversified range of properties. The directly held property is owned by the Swiss pension fund and is predominantly 
invested in properties in and around Zurich. 
The holdings of Cash and Other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments. 
Investments in private equity, private debt, unquoted property funds and directly held property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and 
therefore the Group’s investment in those asset classes is restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans. 
The Group does not currently utilise derivatives to manage risk in its pension plans. However, fund managers may use derivatives to hedge currency movements 
within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently.

relating to the sale of businesses have been excluded from Underlying earnings (2012: US$34 million, 2011: US$20 million). 
The curtailments shown in the table above relate primarily to headcount reductions at various operations during 2013 and divestments. The settlements in 2013 
relate mainly to an exercise in the US in which deferred vested participants were offered a one-time lump sum payment in place of their future pension payments. 
The settlements also include amounts paid to insurance companies to take on the obligations for two relatively small pension plans which were then wound-up.

Funding policy and contributions to plans 
The Group reviews the funding position of its major pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum level required in 
each country. In Canada and the US the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland the minimum is negotiated with the local Trustee or 
Foundation in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding above the minimum level the Group takes 
into account other possible uses of cash within the Group, the tax situation of the local sponsoring entity and any strategic advantage that the Group might obtain by 
accelerating contributions. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.

be determined in line with the Group’s wider financing strategy. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit 
payments, which are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2013.

Change in the effect of the asset ceiling:

Movement in the effect of the asset ceiling (44) –  (44) – 
Effect of the asset ceiling at the end of the year (44) –  (44) – 
In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension 
plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus the asset ceiling may have no effect, although it may be the case  
that a refund will only be available many years in the future. In situations where no refund would be available the effect of the asset ceiling is calculated taking into 
account the availability of a reduction in the employer’s future contributions.

(a) The discount rate shown for Australia is before tax for 2013 and after tax for 2012. 
(b) The assumptions vary by location for the ‘Other’ plans. Assumptions shown are for Southern Africa. 
(c) The inflation assumption shown for the UK is for the Retail Price Index. The assumption for the Consumer Price Index at 31 December 2013 was 2.4 per cent (2012: 2.2 per cent). 
The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 4.6 per cent (2012: 4.0 per cent), 
medical trend rate: 6.8 per cent reducing to 5.1 per cent by the year 2022 broadly on a straight line basis (2012: 6.7 per cent, reducing to 5.1 per cent by the year 
2018), claims costs based on individual company experience.  
For both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The mortality tables used 
imply that a man aged 60 at the statement of financial position date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 25 years (2012: 25 years) and that a man 
aged 60 in 2033 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2012: 27 years).

The values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit payments and discounting those 
payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions we calculate what the obligations would be if we were to make small 
changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of  
the sensitivity to changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small 
changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions.

Interim information 
In the interim Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2013, a balance of US$1,080 million was included in Trade and other receivables which should

The Rio Tinto plc entity financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP using the historical cost convention, except for financial guarantees which have 
been measured at fair value as set out in note (e), below and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006. The directors 
have reviewed the Company’s existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS)  
18 ‘Accounting Policies’ and with last year. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and are set out below.  
b Deferred tax 
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply  
in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis. There are no unprovided amounts relating to deferred tax. 
c Currency translation 
The Company’s local or ‘functional’ currency is the US dollar. Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate 
of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
end of the financial year. Exchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements (see note 41). 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise. 
d Investments 
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value 
of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher. The discount rate applied is based upon the Company’s weighted 
average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.  
e Financial guarantees 
Obligations for financial guarantees issued by the Company to other Group companies are reflected as liabilities at fair value, in accordance with FRS 26 ‘Financial 
Instruments – Measurement’. Such obligations result in corresponding increases in the carrying value of amounts owed by subsidiaries. Payments received are set  
off against the asset recognised which is initially recorded at fair value.  
f Share based payments 
The fair value of the grant is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work. The fair value is 
recognised over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the profit and loss account reserve. Payments received from the Company’s 
subsidiaries in respect of these share based payments result in a credit to reduce the cost of the investment. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the 
date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award (e.g. Total Shareholder Return). When market prices are not available, 
the Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries using a lattice based option valuation model. 
Non market vesting conditions (e.g. earnings per share targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number 
of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.  
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.  
g Revenue recognition 
Interest is accounted for on the accruals basis. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 
h Dividends 
Dividends payable are recognised when they meet the criteria for a present obligation (i.e. when they have been approved).  
i Treasury shares 
The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders’ funds through the profit 
and loss account reserve. 
j Related party disclosures 
The company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ from presenting related-party transactions that are part of the Rio Tinto Group or 
investees of the Rio Tinto plc Group.

Australian Corporations Act – summary of ASIC relief 
201 
riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013 
Pursuant to section 340 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued an order dated  
22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) that granted relief to Rio Tinto Limited from certain requirements of the Corporations Act in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements and associated reports. The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the 
Group’s Dual Listed Companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited’s financial reporting obligations for financial years and half-years 
ending between 31 December 2010 and 30 June 2014 (inclusive). 
In essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering only itself and its controlled entities, the  
order allows Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single 
economic entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared: 
in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS) rather than  
the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report), and in accordance with United Kingdom financial 
reporting obligations generally; 
on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 
should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for 
using ‘merger’, rather than ‘acquisition’, accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other, and 
meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC merger were used to measure those assets and 
liabilities at formation);  
on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company); and 
with a reconciliation, from EU IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated profit for the financial year, total consolidated income for the financial year and 
total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 117). 
Those consolidated financial statements must also be audited in accordance with relevant Australian and United Kingdom requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must  
also prepare a Directors’ report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes the consolidated entity 
is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a Remuneration Report (see pages 68 to 108) prepared in accordance with 
requirements of the Corporations Act. 
Rio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing requirements)  
in relation to those consolidated financial statements (including any concise financial statements), the Auditor’s report and the Directors’ report. The Corporations 
Act also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting. 
Rio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto Limited is also not required  
to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year.  
However, Rio Tinto Limited must in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent 
entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent 
liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 193).  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Directors’ declaration 
Directors’ statement of responsibilities in relation to the Group financial statements, Rio Tinto plc financial statements and  
Rio Tinto Limited financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report, the Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
UK and Australian company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under UK law the directors have elected to prepare  
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and the Rio Tinto plc 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  
Under Australian law, the directors are required to prepare certain Rio Tinto Limited parent company financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting 
Standards (AAS). In preparing the Group financial statements, the directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). 
Under UK and Australian company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the  
state of affairs of the Group and the companies as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the companies and Group for the year (as applicable). 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, applicable UK Accounting Standards and AAS have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company financial statements respectively; 
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the companies will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of the companies and the Group  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the companies and the Group and enable them to ensure that: 
– the Group financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation,  
– the Rio Tinto plc financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006,  
– the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures comply with the Corporations Act as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  
Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) and  
– the Remuneration Report complies with the Companies Act 2006 and the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012). 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the companies and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ between jurisdictions in which the Group reports.  
Each of the current directors, whose names and function are listed on pages 53 to 54 in the Governance section confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Rio Tinto Group financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the Corporations Act 2001  
as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012), the Companies  
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; 
– the Rio Tinto plc financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice  
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company.  
– the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and Corporations  
Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) give a  
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company.  
– the Overview and Performance sections of the Annual report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position  
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and 
– there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited will be able to pay its debts as and when they  
become due and payable. 
The directors have been given the declarations by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001  
as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012).

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, applicable UK Accounting Standards and AAS have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company financial statements respectively; 
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the companies will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of the companies and the Group  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the companies and the Group and enable them to ensure that: 
– the Group financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation,  
– the Rio Tinto plc financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006,  
– the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures comply with the Corporations Act as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  
Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) and  
– the Remuneration Report complies with the Companies Act 2006 and the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012). 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the companies and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ between jurisdictions in which the Group reports.  
Each of the current directors, whose names and function are listed on pages 53 to 54 in the Governance section confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Rio Tinto Group financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the Corporations Act 2001  
as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012), the Companies  
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; 
– the Rio Tinto plc financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice  
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company.  
– the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and Corporations  
Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012) give a  
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company.  
– the Overview and Performance sections of the Annual report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position  
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and 
– there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited will be able to pay its debts as and when they  
become due and payable. 
The directors have been given the declarations by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001  
as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on 17 February 2012).

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in relation to UK legal, professional and regulatory 
responsibilities and reporting obligations to the members of Rio Tinto plc  
and PricewaterhouseCoopers in relation to Australian legal, professional

Companies Act 2006 for Rio Tinto plc and the Corporations Act 2001 as 
amended by the ASIC order dated 22 December 2010 (as amended on  
17 February 2012) (the “ASIC Order”) for Rio Tinto Limited.  
Report on the financial statements 
Opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the financial statements to 
the members of Rio Tinto plc  
In our opinion: 
the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of Rio Tinto plc’s affairs as at 31 December 2013  
and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;  
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been properly  
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group  
financial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder  
of this report.  
Separate opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in relation  
to IFRSs as issued by the IASB   
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition  
to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs  
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB. 
Opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers on the financial report  
to the members of Rio Tinto Limited  
In our opinion: 
the financial report of Rio Tinto Limited is in accordance with the 
Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order, including: 
i. giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at  
31 December 2013 and of its performance for the year ended on that date; 
ii. complying with the Australian Accounting Standards (including the 
Australian Accounting Interpretations) and the Corporations Regulations 
2001; and 
the Group’s financial report also complies with IFRSs as disclosed in note 1. 
What we have audited 
The Group financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are 
prepared by Rio Tinto Group, comprise: 
the Group statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013; 
the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income  
for the year then ended; 
the Group statement of cash flows for the year then ended;  
the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;  
notes 1 – 47 to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information;  
the outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial 
statements; and 
the Rio Tinto financial information by business unit.  
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Rio Tinto plc company financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the Rio Tinto 
plc company balance sheet and the related notes. PricewaterhouseCoopers  
has audited the Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Rio Tinto Limited financial report, which comprises the financial statements  
and the Directors’ declaration on page 202. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Group financial statements is applicable law in the United Kingdom  
and applicable law in Australia as amended by the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010, as amended on  
17 February 2012 (the “ASIC Order” described in the Australian Corporations 
Act – Summary of ASIC relief), International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs).  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements is applicable law and  
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
What an audit of financial statements involves  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)) and Australian Auditing Standards.  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and  
Parent Companies’ circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition  
to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs  
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB. 
Opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers on the financial report  
to the members of Rio Tinto Limited  
In our opinion: 
the financial report of Rio Tinto Limited is in accordance with the 
Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order, including: 
i. giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at

ii. complying with the Australian Accounting Standards (including the 
Australian Accounting Interpretations) and the Corporations Regulations 
2001; and 
the Group’s financial report also complies with IFRSs as disclosed in note 1. 
What we have audited 
The Group financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are 
prepared by Rio Tinto Group, comprise: 
the Group statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013; 
the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income  
for the year then ended; 
the Group statement of cash flows for the year then ended;  
the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;  
notes 1 – 47 to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information;  
the outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial 
statements; and 
the Rio Tinto financial information by business unit.  
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Rio Tinto plc company financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the Rio Tinto 
plc company balance sheet and the related notes. PricewaterhouseCoopers  
has audited the Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Rio Tinto Limited financial report, which comprises the financial statements  
and the Directors’ declaration on page 202. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Group financial statements is applicable law in the United Kingdom  
and applicable law in Australia as amended by the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission Order dated 22 December 2010, as amended on  
17 February 2012 (the “ASIC Order” described in the Australian Corporations 
Act – Summary of ASIC relief), International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs).  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements is applicable law and  
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
What an audit of financial statements involves  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)) and Australian Auditing Standards.  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and  
Parent Companies’ circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Overview of our audit approach 
Materiality 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect  
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the  
Group financial statements as a whole to be $600 million. In arriving at this 
judgement we have had regard to profit before tax, adjusted for items excluded 
from underlying earnings (as defined in note 2 to the financial statements).  
We consider an adjusted measure reflects what is typically used by members  
of the Companies to assess financial performance.  
Overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group is organised into five product groups being Aluminium, Copper, 
Diamonds & Minerals, Energy, and Iron Ore, which are all supported by 
centralised functions. Each product group is made up of a number of operating 
businesses which represent separate business units. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of business units, comprising the group’s 
operating businesses and centralised functions.  
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the  
type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units by us, as the  
Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms 
operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work at those business units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on  
the Group financial statements as a whole.  
We identified 3 business units which, in our view, required an audit of  
their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk 
characteristics. Those business units are Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, Robe River 
Mining Co. and Minera Escondida Limitada. Specific audit procedures on  
certain balances and transactions were performed at a further 19 business 
units. This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, 
gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Areas of particular audit focus 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events  
that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by 
assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both.  
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular  
focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of  
focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the  
Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be  
significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 61. 
 
Areas of focus  How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
Impairment assessment   
We focused on the directors’ assessment of the carrying  
value and annual impairment reviews of goodwill  
(Oyu Tolgoi), long lived intangible assets (Rio Tinto Alcan) 
and property, plant & equipment (both Rio Tinto Alcan 
and Oyu Tolgoi) because they involve complex and 
subjective judgements by the directors about the future 
performance of the business. (Refer to note 6 to the 
financial statements.) 
 
We evaluated the Group’s future cash flow forecasts, including comparing them to the latest  
Board approved budgets and considering the historical accuracy of forecasts. We challenged the key 
assumptions for discount rates, long term growth rates and prices by performing independent market 
analysis of these assumptions.  
We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, which included 
price assumptions and discount rates. Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions 
that either individually or collectively would be required for the asset to be impaired, we considered the 
likelihood of such movements in those key assumptions arising. 
Impact of cost savings initiatives on the overall control environment 
We focused on the potential impact on the overall control 
environment of reductions in headcount as part of the 
cost savings initiatives at some reporting units. 
 
We considered through enquiry with management and other operating personnel the potential areas of 
impact and directed our audit work, particularly in relation to our testing of control design and operating 
effectiveness, to those areas of greatest risk. We evaluated the impact of our findings on our fraud risk 
assessment and overall audit approach. 
Provisions for uncertain tax positions   
We focused on the extent and quantum of provisions 
made for uncertain tax positions as they involve complex 
and subjective judgements by the directors about 
potential exposure.  
We obtained an understanding of the status of the Group’s tax compliance in significant countries  
and business units including the status of discussions with tax authorities and tax investigations.  
We assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the tax provisions recognised for uncertain  
tax positions and related disclosures, utilising our experience of similar challenges elsewhere. 
Revenue recognition    
Auditing standards presume there is a risk of fraud in 
revenue recognition. We focused on checking that 
revenue has been recognised and appropriately recorded 
in the relevant period.  
 
We assessed the design of the Group’s key controls over revenue recognition and tested the operating 
effectiveness of these controls at relevant reporting units. We tested the timing of revenue recognition, 
taking into account contractual obligations, and in particular considered whether the Group appropriately 
recorded revenue based on the terms of those contracts.  
We also performed testing on revenue journal entries. 
Risk of management override of internal controls    
Auditing standards require that we consider this.  
 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the ‘tone at the top’ arrangements 
for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management and the Group’s 
internal audit function. We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to 
the financial statements for evidence of bias by management or the directors that may represent a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud.  
We also tested key reconciliations and manual journal entries, including checking whether journals were 
approved, and whether reconciling items and journals were supported by appropriate documentation.   riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement,  
set out on page 109, in relation to go ing concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it  
is appropriate to prepare the Group’s and Parent Companies’ (in respect of  
both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited) financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the  
Group and Parent Companies have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date 
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Companies’  
ability to continue as a going concern. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s opinions on matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report  
for the financial year for which the fi nancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
the information given in the Corpor ate Governance Statement set out on 
pages 57 to 67 in the Annual Report with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with 
the financial statements. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s report on other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations 
received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are requ ired to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require  
for our audit; or 
adequate accounting records have not b een kept by Rio Tinto plc, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited  
by us; or 
the Rio Tinto plc financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are requ ired to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law have  
not been made, and under the Listing Ru les we are required to review certain 
elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by  
Rio Tinto plc. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to Rio Tinto plc’s compliance with nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Govern ance Code (‘the Code’). We have  
nothing to report having performed our review. 
On page 67 of the Annual Report, as re quired by Code Provision C.1.1, the 
directors state that they consider the An nual Report taken as a whole to be  
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.  
On page 61, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out 
the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial statements, 
and how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in th e course of performing our audit; or 
the section of the Annual Report desc ribing the work of the Audit Committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the  
Audit Committee. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other information in the Annual Report 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is: 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,  
our knowledge of the Group and Rio Ti nto plc acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
is otherwise misleading. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers’ report on other matters prescribed 
by the Corporations Act 2001 
Independence 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence  
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. 
Report on the Remuneration Report 
Under the Corporations Act 2001 (in re spect of Rio Tinto Limited) we are 
required to express an opinion on the Di rector’s Remuneration Report, based  
on our audit conducted in accordance wi th Australian Auditing Standards.  
The directors of Rio Tinto Limited ar e responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A  
of the Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order.  
In our opinion: 
the Remuneration Report included in the accompanying Annual Report 
complies with the requirements of section 300A of the Corporations  
Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order; and 
the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for  
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the  
financial statements.

Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement,

As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it

concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the  
Group and Parent Companies have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date 
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Companies’  
ability to continue as a going concern.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are requ ired to report to you if, in our

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
(a) Comparative information has been restated to reflect a number of new accounting standards. See note 46 on page 191. 
(b) Information for the years 2004 to 2013 is stated under EU IFRS. The Group implemented IAS 39 on 1 January 2005 without restatement of comparatives. 
(c) Gross sales revenue includes 100 per cent of subsidiaries’ sales revenue and the Group’s share of the sales revenue of equity accounts units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries). 
(d) Underlying earnings is an additional measure of earnings, which is reported by Rio Tinto with its EU IFRS results to provide greater understanding of the underlying business 
performance of its operations. It is defined in note 2 to the Financial Statements. Underlying profit before interest and tax (PBIT) is similar to Underlying earnings except that it is stated 
before tax and interest. 
(e) Finance costs include net interest and amortisation of discount. 
(f) Under EU IFRS, certain gains and losses on exchange and on revaluation of derivatives are included in the Group’s Net earnings. These items are excluded from Underlying earnings. 
(g) Dividends per share are the amounts declared in respect of each financial year. These usually include an Interim dividend paid in the year, and a Final dividend paid after the end  
of the year. The Special dividend of 90 US cents per share paid in 2006 is not included in the table. 2004 to 2008 ordinary dividends per share have been restated using a number  
of shares which reflects the discounted price of the July 2009 rights issues (the bonus factor).   
(h) Fixed assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and investments in and long term loans to equity accounted units. 
(i) Capital expenditure comprises purchases less disposals of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less disposals of other intangible assets plus  
direct funding provided to equity accounted units for Rio Tinto’s share of their capital expenditure. The figures include 100 per cent of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure, but exclude  
that of equity accounted units except where directly funded by Rio Tinto. 
(j) Total cash flow from operations comprises cash flow from consolidated operations together with dividends from equity accounted units. Exploration and evaluation costs charged 
against income were previously included in cash used in investing activities but are now included within cash flow from operating activities. As a result, exploration and evaluation  
costs expensed have been reclassified in the comparative periods within the statement of cash flows.  
(k) Cash flow before financing activities is stated before deducting dividends payable to owners of Rio Tinto. 
(l) Operating margin is the percentage of Underlying PBIT, after excluding tax on equity accounted units, to Gross sales revenue. 
(m) Total capital comprises equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto plus net debt and non-controlling interests. 
(n) Underlying earnings: owners’ equity represents Underlying earnings expressed as a percentage of the mean of opening and closing equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. 
(o) Interest cover represents the number of times interest payable less receivable (excluding the amortisation of discount but including capitalised interest) is covered by Underlying 
operating profit, less amortisation of discount, plus dividends from equity accounted units. Underlying operating profit is similar to Underlying earnings but is stated before tax,  
interest and share of profit after tax of equity accounted units. 
(p) 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations and Underlying earnings per share have been calculated using a number of shares which reflects the discounted price of the  
July rights issues (the bonus factor). 2004 to 2008 comparatives have been restated accordingly.  riotinto.com/reportingcentre2013

Production data notes:        
Mine production figures for metals refer to the total quantity of metal produced in concentrates, leach liquor or doré bullion irrespective of whether these products are then refined onsite, 
except for the data for bauxite and iron ore which represent production of marketable quantities of ore plus concentrates and pellets.  
(a) Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at the end of 2013. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years. The Rio Tinto share varies at individual  
mines and refineries in the “others” category and thus no value is shown. 
(b) Jonquière’s (Vaudreuil’s) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina.  
(c) On 29 November 2013, Rio Tinto announced plans to suspend production at the Gove refinery in 2014; the Gove refinery has been transferred from “Pacific Aluminium”  
to “Other Aluminium”.  
(d) Rio Tinto sold its interest in these specialty alumina assets with an effective date of 1 August 2012. Production is shown up to that date.  
(e) Rio Tinto started production at the Arvida AP60 Technology Centre in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
(f) On 8 August 2013, Rio Tinto announced that Pacific Aluminium, including the Gove mine, Bell Bay, Boyne Island, Tomago and Tiwai Point smelters, would be reintegrated in  
Rio Tinto Alcan. 
(g) Rio Tinto sold its 100 per cent interest in the Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne smelter with an effective date of 16 December 2013. Production is shown up to that date. 
(h)The Shawinigan smelter ceased production on 29 November 2013.

Production data notes:        
Mine production figures for metals refer to the total quantity of metal produced in concentrates, leach liquor or doré bullion irrespective of whether these products are then refined onsite, 
except for the data for bauxite and iron ore which represent production of marketable quantities of ore plus concentrates and pellets.  
(a) Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at the end of 2013. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years. The Rio Tinto share varies at individual  
mines and refineries in the “others” category and thus no value is shown.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (the JORC Code) as required by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Codes or guidelines similar to JORC 
with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, the US, Chile, Peru, the Philippines, the UK, Ireland and Europe. Together these Codes 
represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. 
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long-term commodity prices, in calculating Reserve 
estimates. However, for US reporting, the US Securities and Exchange Commission requires historical price data to be used. For this reason, some Reserves reported 
to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those reported below. 
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information in the tables below is based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as defined by JORC), most of whom  
are full time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies. Each has had a minimum of five years’ relevant estimation experience and is a member of a recognised 
professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics. Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of information they 
have provided in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on pages 224 and 225, by operation, along  
with their professional affiliation, employer and accountability for Ore Reserves and/or Mineral Resources. Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the  
Ore Reserves are published as received from the managing company. The Ore Reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2013. Summary data  
for year end 2012 are shown for comparison. Metric units are used throughout. The figures used to calculate Rio Tinto’s share of Ore Reserves are often more precise 
than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.

Notes              
(a) Type of mine: O/P = open pit, O/C = open cut, U/G = underground, D/O = dredging 
operation.  
(b) Reserves of iron ore, bauxite and diamonds are shown as recoverable reserves  
of marketable product after accounting for all mining and processing losses.  
Mill recoveries are therefore not shown.  
(c) On 8 August 2013, Rio Tinto announced that Pacific Aluminium, including the  
Gove mine, Bell Bay, Boyne Island, Tomago and Tiwai Point smelters, would be  
reintegrated into Rio Tinto Alcan. Gove Reserves are not dependent on continued 
refinery operations.  
(d) Reserves at Porto Trombetas (MRN) increased after conversion of Resources  
to Reserves.  
(e) Reserves of borates are expressed in terms of marketable product (B
2
O
3
) after  
all mining and processing losses.  
(f) Coal type: SC: steam/thermal coal, MC: metallurgical/coking coal.  
(g) Coals have been analysed on an “air dried” moisture basis in accordance with 
Australian Standards and gross calorific value and sulphur content are reported here 
on that basis. Marketable Reserve tonnages are reported on a product moisture basis.  
(h) For coal, the yield factors shown reflect the impact of further processing, where 
necessary, to provide marketable coal.  
(i) Reserves at Hunter Valley Operations increased following technical and  
economic studies.  
(j) Hunter Valley Operations, Argyle and Silvergrass have had material Reserve  
changes since previous publication. A JORC table 1 in support of these changes  
can be found at www.riotinto.com/JORC.  
(k) Mount Thorley Operations Reserves decreased as a result of production.  
(l) An appeal of the Project Approval for reserves west of Wallaby Scrub Road was  
upheld (disapproved) by the NSW Land and Environment Court in April 2013.  
RTCA management are working through a process that should result in further 
approval in 2014. Should this not occur, a reduction in Reserves of approximately  
126 million tonnes run of mine (ROM), consisting of 41 million tonnes ROM (Proved) 
and 85 million tonnes ROM (Probable), could occur.  
(m) The term “other undeveloped reserves” is used here to describe material that is 
economically viable on the basis of technical and economic studies but for which 
mining and processing permits may have yet to be requested or obtained. There is a 
reasonable, but not absolute, certainty that the necessary permits will be issued and 
that mining can proceed when required.  
(n) Bingham Canyon open pit Reserves decreased after production. Current stockpiles are 
17 million tonnes or 2.2 per cent of the listed reserve. Pending further geotechnical 
review some 2012 Proved material has been reclassified as Probable.  
(o) The Escondida oxide mine Reserves tonnes increased and grade decreased following  
a mine design update incorporating a new geological model based on additional 
drilling data.  
(p) Under the terms of a joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto and FCX, Rio Tinto  
is entitled to a direct 40 per cent share in Reserves discovered after 31 December  
1994 and it is this entitlement that is shown.  
(q) Rio Tinto sold its 80 per cent interest in Northparkes with an effective date  
of 1 December 2013.  
(r) The South Oyu stockpile Reserve tonnes increase and grade decrease is a result  
of economic re-evaluation.  
(s) The sale of Rio Tinto’s 57.7 per cent interest in Palabora Mining Company was 
completed on 31 July 2013. 
(t) Rio Tinto sold its 100 per cent interest in the Eagle project with an effective date  
of 17 July 2013.  
(u) Reserve tonnes decreased and grade increased at Argyle as a result of an economic 
reassessment.  
(v) Diavik Reserves decreased consistent with production.  
(w) Murowa Reserves declined with production and an updated mine plan.  
(x) Australian and Guinean iron ore Reserve tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.  
(y) Changes in Mt Tom Price (Brockman ore) Reserve tonnage are due to production  
and updated technical and economic studies.  
(z) Changes in Mt Tom Price (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve tonnage are due to production 
and updated technical and economic studies.  
(aa) Hope Downs 1 (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve depletions are consistent with production.  
(bb) The decrease in West Angelas (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve tonnage is due to 
production and updated technical and economic studies.  
(cc) Reserves at Iron Ore Company of Canada are reported as marketable product  
(43 per cent pellets and 57 per cent concentrate for sale), at a natural moisture 
content of three per cent using process upgrade factors derived from current IOC 
concentrating and pellet operations. The marketable product is obtained from mined 
material comprising 851 million dry tonnes at 38.1 per cent iron (Proved) and 560 
million dry tonnes at 37.6 per cent iron (Probable).  
(dd) Koodaideri (Brockman ore) is being reported for the first time in the Rio Tinto Annual 
report following completion of a pre-feasibility study. A JORC table 1 in support of this 
initial release can be found at www.riotinto.com/JORC.  
(ee) Reserve additions at Silvergrass East (Marra Mamba ore) are due to changes in pit 
designs following technical and economic studies.  
(ff) Molybdenum grades interpolated from exploration drilling assays have been factored 
based on a long reconciliation history to blast hole and mill samples.  
(gg) Reserves of titanium dioxide products are expressed in terms of marketable product 
(TiO
2
 slag), after all mining and processing losses.  
(hh) QMM Reserves are derived from 519 million tonnes of ore at an ilmenite grade of  
3.7 per cent and co-product grade of 0.2 per cent zircon.  
(ii) RBM Reserves are derived from 1,854 million tonnes of material at a grade of 2.3  
per cent ilmenite and co-product grades of 0.2 per cent rutile and 0.3 per cent zircon.  
(jj) RTFT Reserves are derived from 143 million tonnes of ore at an ilmenite grade of  
83.1 per cent.  
(kk) Ranger #3 stockpile Reserves were depleted concurrent with production.  
(ll) Reserve additions at Rössing are due to an updated pit design and economic  
re-evaluation.

(w) Murowa Reserves declined with production and an updated mine plan.  
(x) Australian and Guinean iron ore Reserve tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.  
(y) Changes in Mt Tom Price (Brockman ore) Reserve tonnage are due to production  
and updated technical and economic studies.  
(z) Changes in Mt Tom Price (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve tonnage are due to production 
and updated technical and economic studies.  
(aa) Hope Downs 1 (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve depletions are consistent with production.  
(bb) The decrease in West Angelas (Marra Mamba ore) Reserve tonnage is due to 
production and updated technical and economic studies.  
(cc) Reserves at Iron Ore Company of Canada are reported as marketable product  
(43 per cent pellets and 57 per cent concentrate for sale), at a natural moisture 
content of three per cent using process upgrade factors derived from current IOC 
concentrating and pellet operations. The marketable product is obtained from mined 
material comprising 851 million dry tonnes at 38.1 per cent iron (Proved) and 560 
million dry tonnes at 37.6 per cent iron (Probable).  
(dd) Koodaideri (Brockman ore) is being reported for the first time in the Rio Tinto Annual 
report following completion of a pre-feasibility study. A JORC table 1 in support of this 
initial release can be found at www.riotinto.com/JORC.  
(ee) Reserve additions at Silvergrass East (Marra Mamba ore) are due to changes in pit 
designs following technical and economic studies.  
(ff) Molybdenum grades interpolated from exploration drilling assays have been factored 
based on a long reconciliation history to blast hole and mill samples.  
(gg) Reserves of titanium dioxide products are expressed in terms of marketable product 
(TiO
2
 slag), after all mining and processing losses.  
(hh) QMM Reserves are derived from 519 million tonnes of ore at an ilmenite grade of  
3.7 per cent and co-product grade of 0.2 per cent zircon.  
(ii) RBM Reserves are derived from 1,854 million tonnes of material at a grade of 2.3  
per cent ilmenite and co-product grades of 0.2 per cent rutile and 0.3 per cent zircon.  
(jj) RTFT Reserves are derived from 143 million tonnes of ore at an ilmenite grade of  
83.1 per cent.  
(kk) Ranger #3 stockpile Reserves were depleted concurrent with production.  
(ll) Reserve additions at Rössing are due to an updated pit design and economic  
re-evaluation.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
As required by the Australian Securities Exchange, the following tables contain details of other mineralisation that has a reasonable prospect of being economically 
extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as Proved or Probable Ore Reserves. This material is defined as Mineral Resources under the JORC Code. 
Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors. While in the 
judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Reserves, 
there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.  
As in the case of Ore Reserves, managed operations’ estimates are completed using or testing against Rio Tinto long-term pricing and market forecasts/scenarios. 
Mineral Resources are stated as additional to the Ore Reserves reported earlier. Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the Mineral Resources are published 
as received from the managing company. Where new project Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves are footnoted as being reported for the first time, additional 
information about them can be viewed on the Rio Tinto website.

, rather than marketable product  
as in reserves.  
(f) Coal type: SC=steam/thermal coal, MC=metallurgical/coking coal.  
(g) Rio Tinto reports coal Resources on an in situ moisture basis.  
(h) Blair Athol closed in the last quarter of 2012. Rio Tinto agreed the sale of its  
71.2 per cent interest in Blair Athol in October 2013.  
(i) Steam coal is included in the Lake Elphinstone Resource following updated  
technical studies.  
(j) Benga Resources have increased following reclassification of material as part  
of a geological model and mine design update. 
(k) The reduction in Bingham Canyon open pit Resources is due to production  
and economic studies.  
(l) Rio Tinto sold its 100 per cent interest in the Eagle project with an effective date  
of 17 July 2013.  
(m) The changes in Escondida Resources result from geological model updates including 
additional drilling data and in some cases updated economic assessments.  
(n) Resource additions at Grasberg result from new drilling data leading to updated 
geological models with concurrent economic assessments.  
(o) Under the terms of a joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto and FCX, Rio Tinto is 
entitled to a direct 40 per cent share in Resources discovered after 31 December 1994.  
(p) Resource additions at La Granja are a consequence of additional drilling plus updated 
technical and economic studies.  
(q) La Granja, Robe JV  Channel Iron Deposit and Rössing Z20 have had material  
Mineral Resource changes since previous publication. A JORC table 1 in support  
of these changes can be found at www.riotinto.com/JORC.  
(r) Rio Tinto sold its 80 per cent interest in Northparkes with an effective date  
of 1 December 2013.  
(s) The changes in the Hugo Dummett North Resource figures result from updated 
technical and economic studies.  
(t) The sale of Rio Tinto’s 57.7 per cent interest in Palabora Mining Company  
was completed on 31 July 2013.  
(u) Murowa Resources increased after an economic review. 
(v) Australian and Guinean iron ore Resource tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.  
(w) Channar Brockman Resources have decreased due to updated technical studies.  
(x) Eastern Range Brockman Resources have increased as a result of drilling, modelling 
and pit design changes.  
(y) Hope Downs Brockman Resources have increased as a result of drilling and modelling 
at Hope Downs 4. 
(z) Hope Downs Marra Mamba Resources have increased as a result of drilling and 
modelling at Hope Downs 1.  
(aa) Hope Downs Detrital Resources have increased as a result of drilling and modelling  
at Hope Downs 1.  
(bb) Rhodes Ridge Brockman Process Ore Resources have increased as a result of  
drilling and modelling.  
(cc) Robe Channel Iron Deposit Resources have increased as a result of drilling  
and modelling.  
(dd) Iron Ore Company of Canada Resources are quoted on an in situ dry tonnes and 
grades basis. This Resource would produce marketable product (43 per cent pellets 
and 57 per cent concentrate for sale at three per cent moisture content) of  
316 million tonnes at 65 per cent iron (Measured), 724 million tonnes at 65 per cent 
iron (Indicated) and 290 million tonnes at 65 per cent iron (Inferred).  
(ee) The Jadar Resources lithium grade has increased as an outcome of updated  
technical studies.  
(ff) Molybdenum grades interpolated from exploration drilling assays have been factored 
based on a long reconciliation history to blast hole and mill samples. 
(gg) Under an earn-in agreement with a third party, Rio Tinto’s effective interest in Sulawesi 
reduced from 80 per cent to 38 per cent in November 2013. Since then, the third party 
has exercised its right to withdraw from the project, returning Rio Tinto’s interest to  
80 per cent effective February 2014. 
(hh) QMM Resources are derived from 1,323 million tonnes of material at an ilmenite  
grade of 4.0 per cent and co-product grade of 0.3 per cent zircon. 
(ii) RBM Resources are based on 36Mt of material at a 19.3 per cent ilmenite grade  
and co-product grades of 11.3 per cent zircon and 7.1 per cent rutile. 
(jj) RTFT Resources are derived from 11.1 million tonnes of material at an ilmenite  
grade of 84.9 per cent. 
(kk) Ranger #3 stockpiles Resources decreased following an economic reassessment. 
(ll) While the total Resource tonnage change is modest, the reporting structure for 
Rössing has been updated to reflect the potential for future production at two sites. 
(mm) Resource reductions at Rössing SJ are due to an updated pit design and economic 
re-evaluation. 
(nn) The Rössing Z20 Resource increase results from a modified mine design incorporating 
a new geological model based on additional drilling data.  
Mineral resources and ore reserves corporate governance 
Rio Tinto has an established governance process supporting the generation  
and publication of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, which includes a series 
of structures and processes independent of the operational reporting through 
business units and product groups. 
The Audit Committee has in its remit the governance of resources and reserves. 
This includes an annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at a 
Group level, as well as review of findings and progress from the Group Resources 
and Reserves internal audit programme within the regular meeting schedule. 
Rio Tinto also has an Ore Reserve Steering Committee (ORSC), which meets at 
least quarterly, chaired by the Group executive, Technology & Innovation, and 
comprises senior representatives from technical, financial and business groups 
within the company. The ORSC role includes oversight of the appointment of 
Competent Persons nominated by the business units, review of Exploration 
results, Mineral Resources or Ore Reserve data prior to public reporting and 
development of Group Resources and Reserves standards and guidance. 
The Resources and Reserves internal audit programme is conducted by 
independent external consulting personnel in a programme managed by  
Group Audit & Assurance with the assistance of the ORSC. In 2013, seven 
internal audits were completed. Material findings are reported outside of the 
product group reporting line to the Audit Committee, and all reports and  
action plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to internal and external 
reporting standards. 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves from externally managed operations, where 
Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are reported as received from the managing 
entity. Figures from Rio Tinto managed operations are the responsibility of the 
managing directors of the business units and estimates are carried out by 
Competent Persons as defined by JORC. 
Rio Tinto has continued the development of internal systems and controls  
in order to meet JORC (2012) compliance in all external reporting including  
the preparation of all reported data by Competent Persons as members of  
The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (The AusIMM), Australian 
Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional organisations (RPOs). 
As well as the establishment of an enhanced governance process, there have 
been a number of process improvements and training initiatives introduced by 
the ORSC over recent years, including a web-based Group reporting and sign-off 
database, annual internal Competent Person reports and Competent Person 
development and training.

of Halco since 2004. Current annual capacity is 14 million tonnes. Rio Tinto Alcan has a 45 per cent interest in the mine’s production. 
Open cut 
 
On-site generation (fuel oil)
  Bauxite mining commenced in 1970 feeding both the Gove refinery and export market capped at two million tonnes per annum.  
Bauxite export ceased in 2006 with feed intended for the expanded Gove refinery. Bauxite exports recommenced in 2008 and will 
continue in the coming years as the refinery production is suspended in 2014. 
 
Open cut Central power station 
located at the Gove refinery
  Mineral extraction commenced in April 1979. Initial production capacity 3.4 million tonnes annually. From October 2003, production  
capacity up to 16.3 million tonnes per year on a day basis. Capital structure currently: Vale (40%), BHP Billiton (14.8%), Rio Tinto Alcan

Exchange Agreement signed in 1998 with Comalco to allow for extraction of ore at Ely. The Western Cape Communities Co-Existence 
Agreement, an Indigenous Land Use Agreement, was signed in 2001. In 2004 a mine expansion was completed at Weipa that lifted 
annual capacity to 21.5 million tonnes. Mining commenced on the adjacent Ely mining lease in 2006, in accordance with the 1998 
agreement with Alcan (first ore extracted at Ely in 2007). A second shiploader that increases the shipping capability was commissioned 
in 2006 at Weipa. Annual production capacity has now reached 26 million tonnes.

History 
Rio Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March 1962 (then called The Rio Tinto-
Zinc Corporation Limited (RTZ)) and was formed by the merger of The Rio Tinto 
Company and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation. The Rio Tinto Company  
was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. 
The Consolidated Zinc Corporation’s origins trace back to the Australian  
mining industry in the early twentieth century. Operating out of Broken Hill  
in New South Wales, it came to prominence with the mining of silver, lead  
and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.  
Rio Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959 (then called  
The Rio Tinto Mining Company of Australia Limited) and in 1962 the Australian 
interests of Consolidated Zinc Corporation and the Rio Tinto Company Limited 
of the United Kingdom were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia 
Limited as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, 
Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to 
CRA Limited. 
Between 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral 
deposits, developed major mining projects and also grew through acquisition.  
RTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual listed companies 
structure. In 1997, the RTZ Corporation became Rio Tinto plc and CRA Limited 
became Rio Tinto Limited, together known as the Rio Tinto Group.  
In 2007, Rio Tinto completed an agreed takeover of the Canadian aluminium 
producer Alcan Inc. 
Dual listed companies structure 
In 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual listed 
companies merger (the DLC structure) which was designed to place the 
shareholders of both Companies in substantially the same position as if they 
held shares in a single entity owning all of the assets of both Companies. 
Following the approval of the DLC structure, both Companies entered into a 
DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement) through which each 
Company agreed to ensure that the businesses of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto 
Limited are managed together, to ensure that the boards of directors of each 
Company are the same, and to give effect to certain arrangements designed  
to provide shareholders of each Company with a common economic interest  
in the DLC structure. 
In order to achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement provided  
for the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to  
each Rio Tinto plc share and to each Rio Tinto Limited share to be fixed in  
an Equalisation Ratio which has remained unchanged at 1:1. The Sharing 
Agreement has provided for this ratio to be revised in special circumstances 
where, for example, certain modifications are made to the share capital of  
one Company, such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share 
consolidations, but not to the share capital of the other. Outside these specified 
circumstances, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval  
of shareholders under the Class Rights Action approval procedure described 
under Voting rights. In addition, any adjustments are required to be confirmed 
by the Group’s external auditors. 
Consistent with the creation of the DLC structure, directors of each Company 
seek to act in the best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The Class Rights  
Action approval procedure is intended to deal with instances where there  
may be a conflict of interest between the shareholders of each Company. 
To ensure that the boards of both Companies are identical, resolutions to 
appoint or remove directors must be put to shareholders of both Companies  
as a joint electorate (as Joint Decisions as described under Voting rights).  
It is a requirement that a person can only be a director of one Company if that 
person is also a director of the other Company. So, for example, if a person  
was removed as a director of Rio Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be  
a director of Rio Tinto Limited. 
One consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio Tinto is subject to a wide  
range of laws, rules and regulatory review across multiple jurisdictions.  
Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto, as a Group, aims to comply with the  
strictest applicable level. 
Dividend rights 
The Sharing Agreement provides for dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and 
Rio Tinto Limited shares to be equalised on a net cash basis, that is without 
taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US 
dollars and are then, except for ADR holders, translated and paid in sterling and 
Australian dollars. The Companies are also required to announce and pay their 
dividends and other distributions as close in time to each other as possible. 
In the unlikely event that one Company did not have sufficient distributable 
reserves to pay the equalised dividend or the equalised capital distribution,  
it would be entitled to receive a top-up payment from the other Company.  
The top-up payment could be made as a dividend on the DLC Dividend Share, 
or by way of a contractual payment. 
If the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable  
to one of the Companies, then they may depart from the Equalisation Ratio. 
However, should such a departure occur, then the relevant Company will put 
aside reserves to be held for payment on the relevant shares at a later date. 
Rio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation 
provisions of the Sharing Agreement. 
The DLC Dividend Shares can also be utilised to provide the Group with 
flexibility for internal funds management by allowing dividends to be paid 
between the two parts of the Group. Such dividend payments are of no 
economic significance to the shareholders of either Company, as they will  
have no effect on the Group’s overall resources. 
Voting rights 
In principle, the Sharing Agreement provides for the shareholders of Rio Tinto 
plc and Rio Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on all matters which affect 
shareholders of both Companies in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint 
Decisions. Such Joint Decisions include the creation of new classes of share 
capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors and the receiving 
of the annual financial statements. All shareholder resolutions including Joint 
Decisions are voted on a poll.

was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. 
The Consolidated Zinc Corporation’s origins trace back to the Australian  
mining industry in the early twentieth century. Operating out of Broken Hill  
in New South Wales, it came to prominence with the mining of silver, lead  
and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.  
Rio Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959 (then called  
The Rio Tinto Mining Company of Australia Limited) and in 1962 the Australian 
interests of Consolidated Zinc Corporation and the Rio Tinto Company Limited 
of the United Kingdom were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia 
Limited as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, 
Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to 
CRA Limited. 
Between 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral 
deposits, developed major mining projects and also grew through acquisition.  
RTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual listed companies 
structure. In 1997, the RTZ Corporation became Rio Tinto plc and CRA Limited 
became Rio Tinto Limited, together known as the Rio Tinto Group.  
In 2007, Rio Tinto completed an agreed takeover of the Canadian aluminium 
producer Alcan Inc. 
Dual listed companies structure 
In 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual listed 
companies merger (the DLC structure) which was designed to place the 
shareholders of both Companies in substantially the same position as if they 
held shares in a single entity owning all of the assets of both Companies. 
Following the approval of the DLC structure, both Companies entered into a 
DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement) through which each 
Company agreed to ensure that the businesses of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto 
Limited are managed together, to ensure that the boards of directors of each 
Company are the same, and to give effect to certain arrangements designed  
to provide shareholders of each Company with a common economic interest  
in the DLC structure. 
In order to achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement provided  
for the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to  
each Rio Tinto plc share and to each Rio Tinto Limited share to be fixed in  
an Equalisation Ratio which has remained unchanged at 1:1. The Sharing 
Agreement has provided for this ratio to be revised in special circumstances 
where, for example, certain modifications are made to the share capital of  
one Company, such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share 
consolidations, but not to the share capital of the other. Outside these specified 
circumstances, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval  
of shareholders under the Class Rights Action approval procedure described 
under Voting rights. In addition, any adjustments are required to be confirmed 
by the Group’s external auditors. 
Consistent with the creation of the DLC structure, directors of each Company 
seek to act in the best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The Class Rights  
Action approval procedure is intended to deal with instances where there  
may be a conflict of interest between the shareholders of each Company. 
To ensure that the boards of both Companies are identical, resolutions to 
appoint or remove directors must be put to shareholders of both Companies  
as a joint electorate (as Joint Decisions as described under Voting rights).  
It is a requirement that a person can only be a director of one Company if that 
person is also a director of the other Company. So, for example, if a person  
was removed as a director of Rio Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be  
a director of Rio Tinto Limited. 
One consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio Tinto is subject to a wide  
range of laws, rules and regulatory review across multiple jurisdictions.  
Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto, as a Group, aims to comply with the  
strictest applicable level. 
Dividend rights 
The Sharing Agreement provides for dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and 
Rio Tinto Limited shares to be equalised on a net cash basis, that is without 
taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US 
dollars and are then, except for ADR holders, translated and paid in sterling and 
Australian dollars. The Companies are also required to announce and pay their 
dividends and other distributions as close in time to each other as possible. 
In the unlikely event that one Company did not have sufficient distributable 
reserves to pay the equalised dividend or the equalised capital distribution,  
it would be entitled to receive a top-up payment from the other Company.  
The top-up payment could be made as a dividend on the DLC Dividend Share, 
or by way of a contractual payment. 
If the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable  
to one of the Companies, then they may depart from the Equalisation Ratio. 
However, should such a departure occur, then the relevant Company will put 
aside reserves to be held for payment on the relevant shares at a later date. 
Rio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation 
provisions of the Sharing Agreement. 
The DLC Dividend Shares can also be utilised to provide the Group with 
flexibility for internal funds management by allowing dividends to be paid 
between the two parts of the Group. Such dividend payments are of no 
economic significance to the shareholders of either Company, as they will  
have no effect on the Group’s overall resources. 
Voting rights 
In principle, the Sharing Agreement provides for the shareholders of Rio Tinto 
plc and Rio Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on all matters which affect 
shareholders of both Companies in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint 
Decisions. Such Joint Decisions include the creation of new classes of share 
capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors and the receiving 
of the annual financial statements. All shareholder resolutions including Joint 
Decisions are voted on a poll.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
The Sharing Agreement also provides for the protection of shareholders of each 
Company by requiring their separate approval for decisions that do not affect 
the shareholders of both Companies equally. Matters requiring this approval 
procedure are referred to as Class Rights Actions and are voted on a poll.  
For example, fundamental elements of the DLC merger cannot be changed 
unless approved separately by shareholders of both Companies under the  
Class Rights Action approval procedure.  
Exceptions to these principles can arise in situations such as where legislation 
requires the separate approval of a decision by the appropriate majority of 
shareholders in one Company, and approval of the matter by shareholders  
of the other Company is not required. 
Where a matter has been expressly categorised as either a Joint Decision  
or a Class Rights Action, the directors do not have the power to change that 
categorisation. If a matter falls within both categories, it is treated as a Class 
Rights Action. In addition, the directors can determine that matters not 
expressly listed in either category should be put to shareholders for their 
approval under either procedure. 
To facilitate the joint voting arrangements, each Company has entered into 
shareholder voting agreements. Each Company has issued a Special Voting 
Share to a special purpose company held in trust by a common Trustee. 
Rio Tinto plc has issued its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting Share)  
to RTL Shareholder SVC and Rio Tinto Limited has issued its Special Voting 
Share (RTL Special Voting Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The total number  
of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the shareholders of one Company are voted 
at the parallel meeting of the other Company. The role of these special purpose 
companies in achieving this is described below. 
In exceptional circumstances, certain shareholders of the Companies can be 
excluded from voting at the respective Company’s general meetings because 
they have acquired shares in one Company in excess of a given threshold 
without making an offer for all the shares in the other Company. If this should 
occur, the votes cast by these excluded shareholders will be disregarded. 
Following the Companies’ general meetings the overall results of the voting  
are announced to the stock exchanges, to the media in the UK and Australia, 
and published on the Rio Tinto website. 
At a Rio Tinto plc shareholders’ meeting at which a Joint Decision is considered, 
each Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote and the holder of its Special Voting 
Share has one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto 
Limited. The holder of the Special Voting Share is required to vote strictly,  
and only, in accordance with the votes cast by public shareholders for  
and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited 
shareholders’ meeting. 
The holders of Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares do not actually hold any  
voting shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto Limited and 
cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share. 
At a Rio Tinto Limited shareholders’ meeting at which a Joint Decision is 
considered, each Rio Tinto Limited share carries one vote and the holder  
of its Special Voting Share will have one vote for each vote cast by the public 
shareholders of Rio Tinto plc in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special 
Voting Share is required to vote strictly, and only, in accordance with the votes 
cast for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto plc 
shareholders’ meeting. 
The holders of Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares do not actually hold any voting 
shares in Rio Tinto Limited by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto plc and  
cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share. 
Capital distribution rights 
If either of the Companies goes into liquidation, the Sharing Agreement 
provides for a valuation to be made of the surplus assets of both Companies.  
If the surplus assets available for distribution by one Company on each of  
the shares held by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets available for 
distribution by the other Company on each of the shares held by its 
shareholders, then an equalising payment between the two Companies shall  
be made, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such that the amount 
available for distribution on each share held by shareholders of each Company 
conforms to the Equalisation Ratio. The objective is to ensure that the 
shareholders of both Companies have equivalent rights to the assets of the 
combined Group on a per share basis, taking account of the Equalisation Ratio. 
The Sharing Agreement does not grant any enforceable rights to the 
shareholders of either Company upon liquidation of a Company. 
Limitations on ownership of shares and merger obligations 
The laws and regulations of the UK and Australia impose restrictions and 
obligations on persons who control interests in publicly listed companies  
in excess of defined thresholds that, under certain circumstances, include 
obligations to make a public offer for all of the outstanding issued shares  
of the relevant company. The threshold applicable to Rio Tinto plc under  
UK law and regulations is 30 per cent and to Rio Tinto Limited under Australian 
law and regulations is 20 per cent (on a standalone basis or, taking into account 
only Rio Tinto plc interests, on a Joint Decision basis). 
As part of the DLC merger, the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the 
Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited were amended with the intention of extending 
these laws and regulations to the combined enterprise and, in particular, to 
ensure that a person cannot exercise control over one Company without having 
made offers to the public shareholders of both Companies. It is consistent with 
the creation of the single economic enterprise, and the equal treatment of the 
two sets of shareholders, that these laws and regulations should operate in  
this way. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of 
Rio Tinto Limited impose restrictions on any person who controls, directly or 
indirectly, 20 per cent or more of the votes on a Joint Decision. If, however, such 
a person only has an interest in either Rio Tinto Limited or Rio Tinto plc, then 
the restrictions will only apply if they control, directly or indirectly, 30 per cent 
or more of the votes at that Company’s general meetings. 
If one of the thresholds specified above is breached then, subject to certain 
limited exceptions and notification by the relevant Company, such persons  
may not attend or vote at general meetings of the relevant Company, may not 
receive dividends or other distributions from the relevant Company, and may  
be divested of their interest by the directors of the relevant Company. These 
restrictions continue to apply until such persons have either made a public  
offer for all of the publicly held shares of the other Company, or have reduced 
their controlling interest below the thresholds specified, or have acquired 
through a permitted means at least 50 per cent of the publicly held shares  
of each Company. 
These provisions are designed to ensure that offers for the publicly held shares 
of both Companies would be required to avoid the restrictions set out above, 
even if the interests which breach the thresholds are only held in one of the 
Companies. The directors do not have the discretion to exempt a person from 
the operation of these rules. 
Under the Sharing Agreement, the Companies agree to co-operate to enforce 
the restrictions contained in their Articles of Association and Constitution. 
Guarantees 
In 1995, each Company entered into a Deed Poll Guarantee in favour of 
creditors of the other Company. Pursuant to the Deed Poll Guarantees, each 
Company guaranteed the contractual obligations of the other Company and 
the obligations of other persons which are guaranteed by the other Company, 
subject to certain limited exceptions. Beneficiaries under the Deed Poll 
Guarantees may make demands upon the guarantor thereunder without first 
having recourse to the Company or persons whose obligations are being 
guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor under each Deed Poll Guarantee 
expire upon termination of the Sharing Agreement and under other limited 
circumstances, but only in respect of obligations arising after such termination 
and, in the case of other limited circumstances, the publication and expiry of

Dividends 
Both Companies have paid dividends on their ordinary shares every year since 
incorporation in 1962. The rights of Rio Tinto shareholders to receive dividends 
are explained under the description of the Dual listed companies structure on 
page 234. 
Dividend policy 
The aim of Rio Tinto’s progressive dividend policy is to increase the US dollar 
value of ordinary dividends over time. The rate of the total annual dividend, in 
US dollars, is determined taking into account the results for the past year and 
the outlook. Under Rio Tinto’s dividend policy, the interim dividend is set at one 
half of the total ordinary dividend for the previous year and the final ordinary 
dividend is expected to be at least equal to the previous interim dividend.  
Dividend determination 
The majority of the Group’s sales are transacted in US dollars, making this  
the most reliable measure of the Group’s global business performance. It is 
Rio Tinto’s main reporting currency and consequently the natural currency  
for dividend determination. Dividends determined in US dollars are translated  
at exchange rates prevailing two days prior to the announcement and are  
then declared payable in sterling by Rio Tinto plc and in Australian dollars  
by Rio Tinto Limited. On request, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc can elect to 
receive dividends in Australian dollars and shareholders of Rio Tinto Limited  
can elect to receive dividends in sterling. These dividend amounts are 
calculated by converting the declared dividend using currency exchange  
rates applicable five business days prior to the dividend payment date.  
Shareholders who wish to receive their dividends in any other currencies  
should contact the Companies’ share registrars, who also offer payment 
services in other currencies, subject to a fee.  
2013 dividends 
The 2013 interim and final dividends were determined at 83.50 US cents and  
at 108.50 US cents per share respectively and the applicable conversion rates 
for the interim and final dividend were US$1.5384 and US$1.6484 to the pound 
sterling and US$0.89785 and US$0.90315 to the Australian dollar respectively. 
For those Rio Tinto plc shareholders who elected to receive their interim 
dividend in Australian dollars the applicable conversion rate was A$1.70816  
and for Rio Tinto Limited shareholders who elected to receive their dividend  
in sterling the applicable conversion rate was £0.58543.  
Final dividends of 65.82 pence or 120.14 Australian cents per share will be  
paid on 10 April 2014. For those Rio Tinto plc shareholders requesting the  
2013 final dividend be paid in Australian dollars, those holders of Rio Tinto plc 
ADRs (each representing one share) and those Rio Tinto Limited shareholders 
requesting the 2013 final dividend be paid in pounds sterling, the applicable 
conversion rates will be announced on 3 April 2014. 
The following chart sets out the amounts of interim and final dividends paid  
or payable on each share or ADR in respect of each financial year, but before 
deduction of any withholding tax. 
These have been restated for the impact of the 2009 rights issues and the  
ADR ratio change.

Dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) 
Rio Tinto offers a DRP to registered shareholders, which provides the 
opportunity to use cash dividends to purchase Rio Tinto shares in the market. 
Due to local legislation the DRP cannot be extended to shareholders in the US, 
Canada and certain other countries.

Material contracts  
Articles of Association and Constitution, and DLC Merger Sharing 
Agreement 
As explained on pages 234 to 235, under the terms of the DLC structure the 
shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and of Rio Tinto Limited entered into certain 
contractual arrangements which are designed to place the shareholders of both 
Companies in substantially the same position as if they held shares in a single 
entity which owned all of the assets of both Companies. Please refer to the 
section on Guarantees on page 235 for further information. Generally, and as far 
as is permitted by the UK Companies Act and the Australian Corporations Act 
and ASX Listing Rules, this principle is reflected in the Articles of Association of 
Rio Tinto plc and in the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited. The summaries below 
include descriptions of material rights of the shareholders of both Rio Tinto plc 
and Rio Tinto Limited.  
Objects 
At the 2009 annual general meetings, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and 
Rio Tinto Limited approved amendments to the constitutional documents 
whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the Companies to have  
the widest possible scope of activities.  
Directors 
Under Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association, a director may not vote in respect 
of any proposal in which he, or any other person connected with him, has  
any material interest, other than by virtue of his interests in shares or 
debentures or other securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company, 
except where resolutions: 
– indemnify him or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the 
director on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the Company, or in respect  
of obligations of the Company, for which the director has assumed 
responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee; 
– relate to an offer of securities in which he may be interested as a holder  
of securities or as an underwriter; 
– concern another body corporate in which the director is beneficially 
interested in less than one per cent of the issued shares of any class of 
shares of such a body corporate; 
– relate to an employee benefit in which the director will share equally with 
other employees; and 
– relate to liability insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for 
the benefit of directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as 
directors (or officers) of the Company. 
Under Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution, except where a director is constrained 
by Australian law, a director may be present at a meeting of the board while a 
matter in which the director has a material personal interest is being considered 
and may vote in respect of that matter. 
The directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Companies to 
borrow money, to charge any property or business of the Companies or all, or 
any, of their uncalled capital and to issue debentures or give any other security 
for a debt, liability or obligation of the Companies or of any other person. The 
directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the 
aggregate amount of all moneys borrowed by the Company and its subsidiaries 
shall not exceed an amount equal to one and one half times the Company’s 
share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company. 
Directors are not required to hold any shares of either Company by way of 
qualification. The Remuneration Report on pages 80 and 89 provides 
information on shareholding policies relating to executive and non-executive 
directors. Please refer to the Corporate governance section (page 58) for 
information on appointment of directors.  
Rights attaching to shares 
Under English law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits  
available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to 
receive such dividends as may be declared by the directors. The directors may 
also pay shareholders such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified 
by the financial position of the Group.  
Any Rio Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend 
was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the 
Company. Any Rio Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or 
otherwise used by the board for the benefit of the Company until claimed or 
otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. 
Voting rights 
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the 
holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, 
and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has 
been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present  
in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative and is entitled to 
vote has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the 
Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote on a show of hands. On a poll, every 
shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or other duly authorised 
representative and is entitled to vote has one vote for every ordinary share for 
which he or she is the holder and, in the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of 
the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the shareholders  
at the parallel meeting of the other Company’s shareholders.  
A poll may be demanded by any of the following: 
– the chairman of the meeting; 
– at least five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution; 
– any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than 
one tenth (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total voting 
rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution;  
– any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote  
at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate 
equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares 
conferring that right (Rio Tinto plc); or 
– the holder of the Special Voting Share. 
A proxy form will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, 
or to join others in demanding one. 
The necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc general meeting is three members 
present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and 
entitled to vote, and for a Rio Tinto Limited general meeting is two members 
present in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative.

whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the Companies to have  
the widest possible scope of activities.  
Directors 
Under Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association, a director may not vote in respect 
of any proposal in which he, or any other person connected with him, has  
any material interest, other than by virtue of his interests in shares or 
debentures or other securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company, 
except where resolutions: 
– indemnify him or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the 
director on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the Company, or in respect  
of obligations of the Company, for which the director has assumed 
responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee; 
– relate to an offer of securities in which he may be interested as a holder  
of securities or as an underwriter; 
– concern another body corporate in which the director is beneficially 
interested in less than one per cent of the issued shares of any class of 
shares of such a body corporate; 
– relate to an employee benefit in which the director will share equally with 
other employees; and 
– relate to liability insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for 
the benefit of directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as 
directors (or officers) of the Company. 
Under Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution, except where a director is constrained 
by Australian law, a director may be present at a meeting of the board while a 
matter in which the director has a material personal interest is being considered 
and may vote in respect of that matter. 
The directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Companies to 
borrow money, to charge any property or business of the Companies or all, or 
any, of their uncalled capital and to issue debentures or give any other security 
for a debt, liability or obligation of the Companies or of any other person. The 
directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the 
aggregate amount of all moneys borrowed by the Company and its subsidiaries 
shall not exceed an amount equal to one and one half times the Company’s 
share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company. 
Directors are not required to hold any shares of either Company by way of 
qualification. The Remuneration Report on pages 80 and 89 provides 
information on shareholding policies relating to executive and non-executive 
directors. Please refer to the Corporate governance section (page 58) for 
information on appointment of directors.  
Rights attaching to shares 
Under English law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits  
available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to 
receive such dividends as may be declared by the directors. The directors may 
also pay shareholders such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified 
by the financial position of the Group.  
Any Rio Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend 
was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the 
Company. Any Rio Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or 
otherwise used by the board for the benefit of the Company until claimed or 
otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. 
Voting rights 
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the 
holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, 
and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has 
been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present  
in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative and is entitled to 
vote has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the 
Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote on a show of hands. On a poll, every 
shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or other duly authorised 
representative and is entitled to vote has one vote for every ordinary share for 
which he or she is the holder and, in the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of 
the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the shareholders  
at the parallel meeting of the other Company’s shareholders.  
A poll may be demanded by any of the following: 
– the chairman of the meeting; 
– at least five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution; 
– any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than 
one tenth (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total voting 
rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution;  
– any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote  
at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate 
equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares 
conferring that right (Rio Tinto plc); or 
– the holder of the Special Voting Share. 
A proxy form will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, 
or to join others in demanding one. 
The necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc general meeting is three members 
present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and 
entitled to vote, and for a Rio Tinto Limited general meeting is two members 
present in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES AND OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 
Matters are transacted at general meetings by the proposing and passing  
of resolutions: 
ordinary resolutions, which require the affirmative vote of a majority of  
the votes of those persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum, 
for example the election of directors; and  
special resolutions, which require the affirmative vote of not less than  
three-fourths of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum, 
for example amending the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc or the 
Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited. 
The DLC Merger Sharing Agreement further classifies resolutions as  
“Joint Decisions” and “Class Rights Actions” as explained under Voting rights  
on pages 234 and 235. 
Annual general meetings must be convened with 21 days’ written notice  
for Rio Tinto plc and with 28 days’ notice for Rio Tinto Limited. Other meetings 
of Rio Tinto plc must be convened with 21 days’ written notice for the passing  
of a special resolution and with 14 days’ notice for any other resolution, 
depending on the nature of the business to be transacted. All meetings of  
Rio Tinto Limited require 28 days’ notice. In calculating the period of notice  
the days of delivery or receipt of the notice and the date of the meeting are  
not included. Among other things, the notice must specify the nature of the 
business to be transacted.  
Variation of rights 
If, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the 
rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the 
relevant legislation, with the consent in writing of holders of three-fourths in 
value of the shares of that class or upon the adoption of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that 
class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of 
Association and Constitution relating to proceedings at a general meeting 
apply, except that the quorum for Rio Tinto plc should be two or more persons 
who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of  
the issued shares of the class. 
Rights in a winding-up 
Except as the shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon  
a winding-up, the balance of assets available for distribution: 
after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, 
whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and 
subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares 
is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the 
amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is generally  
to be made in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of a special 
resolution of the shareholders, divide among the shareholders the whole or  
any part of the assets in kind.  
The DLC Merger Sharing Agreement further sets out the rights of ordinary 
shareholders in a liquidation as explained on page 235. 
Facility agreement 
Details of the Group’s US$7.5 billion multi-currency committed revolving  
credit facilities are set out in note 30 to the 2013 financial statements. 
Exchange controls and foreign investment 
Rio Tinto plc 
There are no UK foreign exchange controls or other UK restrictions on the 
import or export of capital or on the payment of dividends to non-resident 
holders of Rio Tinto plc shares or that materially affect the conduct of Rio Tinto 
plc’s operations. It should be noted, however, that various sanctions, laws, 
regulations or conventions may restrict the import or export of capital by, or the 
payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares. There are 
no restrictions under Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association or under UK law that 
limit the right of non-resident owners to hold or vote Rio Tinto plc shares. 
Rio Tinto Limited 
Under current Australian legislation, no permission is required for the 
movement of funds into or out of Australia, except that there is a prohibition  
on, or in some cases the specific prior approval of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for, certain 
payments or other dealings connected with parties identified with terrorism,  
or to whom United Nations or autonomous Australian sanctions apply.  
Rio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct withholding tax from foreign 
remittances of dividends, to the extent that they are unfranked, and from 
payments of interest.  
Acquisitions of interests in shares, voting power or certain other equity 
instruments in Australian companies by foreign interests are subject to  
review and approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia  
under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act). 
The Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions of 15 per cent or more, by several 
foreign persons (and any associates) of 40 per cent or more of the actual or 
potential shares of, or voting power in, an Australian company, and to other 
transaction that results in such persons controlling such interests. The 
Takeovers Act also applies to direct investments by foreign government 
investors, including acquisition of interests of ten per cent or more. Persons 
who are proposing such acquisitions or transactions are required to notify  
the Treasurer of their intention. The Treasurer has the power to order 
divestment in cases where such acquisitions or transactions have already 
occurred. The Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of owners whose 
interests are held in compliance with the legislation. 
Limitations on voting and shareholding 
Except for the provisions of the Takeovers Act 1975 there are no limitations 
imposed by law, Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association or Rio Tinto Limited’s 
Constitution, on the rights of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or  
vote the Group’s ordinary shares or ADSs that would not apply generally  
to all shareholders. 
Taxation 
The following information is provided to meet the reporting obligations of the 
Annual report on Form 20-F. This is not tax advice and you should not rely on  
it as such. Rio Tinto accepts no liability for any such reliance. 
UK resident individuals’ shareholdings in Rio Tinto plc 
Taxation of dividends 
Dividends carry a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the dividend. Individuals  
who are liable to income tax at the basic rate will have no further tax to pay. 
Higher rate tax payers are liable to tax on UK dividends at 32.5 per cent,  
which after taking account of the tax credit produces an effective tax liability  
of 25 per cent of the dividend received. Additional rate tax payers are liable  
to tax on UK dividends at 42.5 per cent until 5 April 2013 and 37.5 per cent 
thereafter, which after taking account of the tax credit produces an effective  
tax liability of 36.1 per cent of any dividend received up to 5 April 2013 and  
30.5 per cent thereafter. 
Dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) 
The taxation effect of participation in the DRP will depend on individual 
circumstances. Shareholders will generally be liable to tax on dividends 
reinvested in the DRP on the same basis as if they had received the cash  
and arranged the investment. The dividend should, therefore, be included  
in the annual tax return. 
The shares acquired should be added to shareholdings at the date and at the 
net cost shown on the share purchase advice. The actual cost of the shares for 
Rio Tinto plc shareholders, including the stamp duty/stamp duty reserve tax 
and broker’s commission, will form the base cost for capital gains tax purposes. 
Capital gains tax 
Shareholders who have any queries on capital gains tax issues are advised  
to consult their financial adviser.

Australian resident individuals’ shareholdings in Rio Tinto Limited 
Taxation of dividends 
The basis of the Australian dividend imputation system is that when Australian 
resident shareholders receive dividends from Rio Tinto Limited they may be 
entitled to a credit for the Australian tax paid by the Group in respect of that 
income, depending on the tax status of the shareholder.  
The application of the system results in the Australian tax paid by the Group 
being allocated to shareholders by way of franking credits attaching to the 
dividends they receive. Such dividends are known as franked dividends.  
A dividend may be partly or fully franked. The current Rio Tinto Limited 
dividend is fully franked and the franking credits attached to the dividend  
are shown in the distribution statement provided to shareholders. 
The extent to which a company can frank a dividend depends on the credit 
balance in its franking account. Credits to this account can arise in a number  
of ways, including when a company pays company tax or receives a franked 
dividend from another company. The dividend is required to be included in a 
resident individual shareholder’s assessable income. In addition, an amount 
equal to the franking credit attached to the franked dividend is also included  
in the assessable income of the resident individual, who may then be entitled  
to a rebate of tax equal to the franking credit amount included in their income. 
Should the franking credits exceed the tax due, the excess is refunded to the 
resident individual. 
The effect of the dividend imputation system on non-resident shareholders  
is that, to the extent that the dividend is franked, no Australian tax will be 
payable and there is an exemption from dividend withholding tax.  
A withholding tax is normally levied at the rate of 15 per cent when unfranked 
dividends are paid to non-resident shareholders residing in a country with 
which Australia has a taxation treaty. Most Western countries have a taxation 
treaty with Australia. A rate of 30 per cent applies to countries where there  
is no taxation treaty. 
Since 1988, all dividends paid by Rio Tinto Limited have been fully franked.  
It is the Group’s policy to pay fully franked dividends whenever possible.  
The boards expect Rio Tinto Limited to be able to pay fully franked dividends  
for the foreseeable future. 
Dividend reinvestment plan 
Shareholders will generally be liable for tax on dividends reinvested in the  
DRP on the same basis as if they had received the cash and arranged the 
investment. The dividend should therefore be included in the annual tax return 
as assessable income. 
The shares acquired should be added to the shareholding at the date of 
acquisition at the actual cost of the shares, which is the amount of the  
dividend applied by the shareholder to acquire shares and any incidental  
costs associated with the acquisition will form part of the cost base or  
reduced cost base of the shares for capital gains tax purposes. 
Capital gains tax 
The Australian capital gains tax legislation is complex. If shareholders have 
acquired shares after 19 September 1985 they may be subject to capital gains 
tax on the disposal of those shares. 
Generally, disposal of shares held on capital account would give rise to a capital 
gain or loss. A capital gain arises when the proceeds on disposal are greater 
than the cost base of shares. A capital loss arises when the proceeds on sale 
are less than the cost base or reduced cost base. Where a capital gain arises  
on shares held for at least 12 months, individual, trust and superannuation  
fund shareholders may be eligible for a capital gains tax discount.  
Shareholders are advised to seek the advice of an independent taxation 
consultant on any possible capital gains tax exposure. 
US residents 
The following is a summary of the principal UK tax, Australian tax and  
US Federal income tax consequences of the ownership of Rio Tinto plc  
ADSs, Rio Tinto plc shares and Rio Tinto Limited shares, “the Group’s ADSs  
and shares”, by a US holder as defined below. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that are relevant  
to all classes of taxpayer. Future changes in legislation may affect the tax 
consequences of the ownership of the Group’s ADSs and shares.  
It is based in part on representations by the Group’s depositary bank as 
depositary for the ADRs evidencing the ADSs and assumes that each obligation 
in the deposit agreements will be performed in accordance with its terms. 
You are a US holder if you are a beneficial owner of the Group’s ADSs and 
shares and you are: a citizen or resident of the US; a domestic corporation;  
an estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its 
source; or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s 
administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all 
substantial decisions of the trust. 
This section applies to US holders only if shares or ADSs are held as capital 
assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to shareholders who are 
members of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including a 
dealer in securities, a trader in securities who elects to use a mark-to-market 
method of accounting for securities holdings, a tax exempt organisation,  
a life insurance company, a person liable for alternative minimum tax, a person 
that actually or constructively owns ten per cent or more of Rio Tinto’s voting 
stock, a person that holds shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging  
or conversion transaction, or a person whose functional currency is not the  
US dollar. 
This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the Code), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published 
rulings and court decisions, and on the convention between the US and UK,  
and the convention between the US and Australia which may affect the tax 
consequences of the ownership of the Group’s ADSs and shares. These laws 
and conventions are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. 
For the purposes of the Conventions and of the Code, US holders of ADSs  
are treated as the owners of the underlying shares. 
The summary describes the treatment applicable under the conventions in 
force at the date of this report. 
UK taxation of shareholdings in Rio Tinto plc 
Taxation of dividends 
US holders are not liable to UK withholding tax on dividends paid by Rio Tinto 
plc. Dividends carry a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the net dividend, or ten 
per cent of the net dividend plus the tax credit. The tax credit is not repayable  
to US holders. 
Capital gains 
A US holder will not normally be liable to UK tax on capital gains realised on  
the disposition of Rio Tinto plc ADSs or shares unless the holder carries on a 
trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a permanent establishment in 
the UK and the ADSs or shares have been used for the purposes of the trade, 
profession or vocation or are acquired, held or used for the purposes of such  
a permanent establishment. 
Inheritance tax 
Under the UK/US Estate Tax Treaty, a US holder, who is domiciled in the US  
and is not a national of the UK, will not be subject to UK inheritance tax upon 
the holder’s death or on a transfer during the holder’s lifetime, unless the ADSs 
and shares form part of the business property of a permanent establishment in 
the UK or pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK used in the performance of 
independent personal services. In the exceptional case where ADSs or shares 
are subject both to UK inheritance tax and to US Federal gift or estate tax, the 
UK Estate Tax Treaty generally provides for tax payments to be relieved in 
accordance with the priority rules set out in the Treaty.

UK taxation of shareholdings in Rio Tinto plc 
Taxation of dividends 
US holders are not liable to UK withholding tax on dividends paid by Rio Tinto 
plc. Dividends carry a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the net dividend, or ten 
per cent of the net dividend plus the tax credit. The tax credit is not repayable  
to US holders.

Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax 
Transfers of Rio Tinto plc ADSs will not be subject to UK stamp duty provided 
that the transfer instrument is not executed in, and at all times remains outside, 
the UK. Electronic “paperless” purchases of Rio Tinto plc shares are subject to 
stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) at a rate of 0.5 per cent (rounded to the nearest 
penny). Purchases of Rio Tinto plc shares using a stock transfer form are 
subject to Stamp Duty at a rate of 0.5 per cent on transactions over £1,000 
(rounded up to the nearest £5). Conversions of Rio Tinto plc shares into 
Rio Tinto plc ADSs will be subject to additional Stamp Duty or SDRT at a rate  
of 1.5 per cent (rounded to the nearest penny) on all transfers to the depositary 
or its nominee. 
Australian taxation of shareholdings in Rio Tinto Limited 
Taxation of dividends 
US holders are not normally liable to Australian withholding tax on dividends 
paid by Rio Tinto Limited because such dividends are normally fully franked 
under the Australian dividend imputation system, meaning that they are paid 
out of income that has borne Australian income tax. Any unfranked dividends 
would suffer Australian withholding tax which under the Australian income  
tax convention is limited to 15 per cent of the gross dividend. 
Capital gains 
US holders are not normally subject to any Australian tax on the disposal of 
Rio Tinto Limited ADSs or shares unless they have been used in carrying on  
a trade or business wholly or partly through a permanent establishment in 
Australia, or the gain is in the nature of income sourced in Australia. 
Gift, estate and inheritance tax 
Australia does not impose any gift, estate or inheritance taxes in relation  
to gifts of shares or upon the death of a shareholder. 
Stamp duty 
An issue or transfer of Rio Tinto Limited shares does not require the payment  
of Australian stamp duty. 
US federal income tax 
In general, taking into account the earlier assumptions that each obligation of 
the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed according 
to its terms, for US federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing 
ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those 
ADRs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be 
subject to US federal income tax. 
Taxation of dividends 
Under the US federal income tax laws, and subject to the Passive Foreign 
Investment Company (PFIC) Rules discussed below, if you are a US holder, the 
gross amount of any dividend the Group pays out of its current or accumulated 
earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes) is 
subject to US federal income taxation.  
If you are a non-corporate US holder, dividends paid to you in taxable years 
beginning after 31 December 2012 will be taxed at ordinary income rates on 
dividends.  
You must include any Australian tax withheld from the dividend payment in  
this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The dividend is 
taxable to you when you, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case  
of ADSs, receive the dividend, actually or constructively. The dividend will  
not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US 
corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.  
The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income 
as a US holder will be the US dollar value of the non-US dollar payments made, 
determined at the spot UK pound/US dollar rate (in the case of Rio Tinto plc)  
or the spot Australian dollar/US dollar rate (in the case of Rio Tinto Limited)  
on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of 
whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or 
loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the 
date you include the dividend payment in income to the date you convert the 
payment into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not 
be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income.  
The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US  
for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Distributions in excess of current and 
accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax 
purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of  
your basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.  
Subject to certain limitations, any Australian tax withheld in accordance  
with the Australia/United States Tax Treaty and paid over to Australia will be 
creditable or deductible against your US federal income tax liability. Special 
rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to 
dividends that are subject to the maximum 20 per cent tax rate beginning  
after 31 December 2012. 
For foreign tax credit purposes, dividends will generally be income from sources 
outside the US and will, depending on your circumstances, generally be either 
“passive” or “general” income which, in either case, is treated separately from 
other types of income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit 
allowable to you. 
Taxation of capital gains 
Subject to the PFIC Rules discussed below, if you are a US holder and you  
sell or otherwise dispose of the Group’s ADSs or shares, you will recognise 
capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference 
between the US dollar value of the amount that you realise and your tax basis, 
determined in US dollars, in your shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-
corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the holder  
has a holding period greater than one year. The gain or loss will generally  
be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit  
limitation purposes. 
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules  
We believe that the Group’s shares or ADSs should not be treated as stock  
of PFIC for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual 
determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change.  
If we were to be treated as a PFIC, unless the shares or ADSs are “marketable 
stock” and a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis 
with respect to the shares or ADSs, gain realised on the sale or other disposition 
of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead,  
if you are a US holder, you would be treated as if you had realised such gain  
and certain “excess distributions” rateably over your holding period for the 
shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each 
such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge  
in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. In addition, dividends that 
you receive from us will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to 
qualified dividend income if we are a PFIC either in the taxable year of the 
distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates 
applicable to ordinary income.

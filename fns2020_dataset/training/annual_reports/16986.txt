Market overview  
The global economic downturn and 
associated decline in commodity prices 
resulted in difficult market conditions  
in 2009. While commodity production 
volumes were lower early in the year 
there was notable improvement in the 
second half supported by investment in  
Asian infrastructure. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications used in mining 
as well as in the niche oil sands and flue

Market overview  
The North American upstream market 
experienced reduced activity with lower 
demand for natural gas. At the mid-year, 
rig count had reduced by around 50% 
before starting to recover in the second 
half. Significant downstream project 
opportunities were driven principally by 
Middle East refining expansion.

This map is illustrative, but not fully definitive of our locations. 02 The Weir Group PLC
I am delighted to report, that in a difficult global 
economic environment, the Weir Group has 
performed strongly in 2009 with the resilience 
of our business model evident in these results. 
We delivered a record underlying profit and 
an exceptional cash performance and enter 
2010 in robust financial health.
With revenues up 3%, we were able to report an increase in 
Group pre-tax profit from continuing operations, before intangibles 
amortisation, of 6%, to a record £187.0m and generated free cash 
flow after dividend payments of £141.1m, despite seeing order 
input in constant currency fall by some 18% on 2008.
We are proposing a final dividend payment to shareholders of 
16.2p per share, making 21.0p for the full year, an increase of 14%, 
reflecting the Board’s continuing confidence in the Group’s business. 
These results reflect the successful transformation of the Group 
under Mark Selway’s leadership, encompassing operating 
improvements and a strategic re-alignment into the three higher 
growth, higher margin, long cycle sectors of mining, oil and gas, 
and power. Over the last eight years, earnings have increased 
more than four times, the share price has trebled and dividends 
to shareholders increased by 81%. On behalf of the Board, 
our employees and all shareholders, I would like to thank Mark 
personally for his outstanding contribution to the success of the 
Group and wish him well in his new role back home in Australia.
As we move forward, the Group has a strong operating platform to 
drive growth both through organic development and value enhancing 
acquisitions. It also has a number of significant advantages. We 
have a clear and focused strategy targeted at three end markets 
with positive fundamentals, driven principally by emerging market 
growth. The Group’s extensive installed base of original equipment 
products continues to grow and provides an increasing platform 
for more profitable and resilient aftermarket sales. It also provides 
exposure to both end market capital investment trends and 
underlying market activity levels. 
Structured for growth
Chairman’s statement by
Lord Smith of Kelvin
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report  03
We have a strong balance sheet, are highly cash generative 
and took early action to manage our way through the economic 
downturn. Over the past few years, we have also put our pension 
plans on a sustainable footing. 
The Board is determined to achieve and maintain best practice  
in all areas of corporate responsibility and sustainability, including  
all aspects of health and safety. It was pleasing therefore to see  
the progress made in these areas during the year and they remain  
a key focus for the management team with further initiatives  
already underway.
There have been a number of changes to the Board during 
the year. I was pleased to announce the appointment of Keith 
Cochrane as chief executive and the subsequent seamless 
transition following Mark Selway’s decision to leave in September 
2009. The appointment of Jon Stanton to replace Keith as finance 
director was announced in January 2010 and Jon is expected to 
join us in April. We welcomed as a new non-executive director 
Richard Menell who brings valuable experience to the Board 
particularly from a mining perspective. Ian Percy will retire from  
the Board in April 2010 after more than 13 years of service and I 
would like to thank him for his valuable contribution to the Group 
over that period. The Board has benefited from his wisdom, 
guidance and perspective. 
I would also like to thank all our employees for their dedication,  
hard work and commitment to the success of the Group over  
what has been a very demanding year. Skilled and dedicated 
people are the cornerstone of the Group’s success and we are 
continuing to develop ways to create an environment in which  
we excel at all that we do.
The pace of global economic recovery during 2010 remains 
uncertain, but I strongly believe that our business is particularly  
well placed to respond to the challenges and to take advantage  
of the opportunities that will undoubtedly arise.

Driving growth The Weir Way
Overview by Chief Executive 
Keith Cochrane
As I take on the role of chief executive, I am 
excited at the range of growth opportunities 
open to the Group. Each of our divisions has 
a clearly defined strategy to build our market 
presence and deliver outstanding customer 
service, while sustaining the fundamentals 
that have delivered success thus far.
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report  05
The Group’s 2009 performance demonstrates the resilience of  
our business model and the benefits of a strong opening order 
book, diversified portfolio and strong cash generating capability.  
We benefit from exposure to positive end markets, geographic 
strength in emerging markets and a presence at the heart of the 
processing cycle. All these characteristics give us confidence for  
the future. The success of any business is down to its people and  
as I visit our operations, I continue to be most impressed at the  
very evident commitment, pride and passion of our employees.
Our installed base of original equipment delivers an aftermarket 
channel that enables us to stay close to customers and this 
business model provides access to both capital and operating 
expenditure. Our service, spares and support activities ensure  
that we build ongoing relationships with customers and can be 
responsive to their needs.
2009 performance 
Overall order input, in constant currency, was down 18% while 
aftermarket input was down 2%, reflecting production activity  
levels in our main markets offset by our growing installed base  
and the greater importance of maintenance and refurbishment  
of existing equipment.
The proportion of revenues from aftermarket sales increased to 
54%, which, together with the early actions taken to reduce the 
cost base during the year, largely mitigated the impact of lower 
volumes of original equipment on operating profits.
Revenue also benefited from a positive foreign currency effect  
with over 90% of the Group’s revenues generated internationally. 
Our South American Minerals operations delivered a record 
operating performance and we won a number of notable contracts  
in the Chinese nuclear new build and Middle East downstream oil 
and gas refining markets. We also retained the Canadian Naval

Early and effective action was taken across the Group to manage 
the downturn. Detailed planning resulted in a global headcount 
reduction of around 600 in response to local input reductions.  
Such decisions in relation to employees are not taken lightly and have 
been restricted to those companies most affected by the downturn.
We delivered an excellent cash performance and substantially 
increased free cashflow to £141.1m. Our balance sheet has been 
strengthened by the issue of US$250m of long term debt and we 
took further positive steps to reduce our pension liabilities through 
an enhanced transfer offer to certain members of the main UK 
defined benefit plan. The Group has substantial financial headroom 
to support organic development and expand its presence across 
target markets.
Group strategy 
The Weir Group, with its strong positions in very attractive end 
markets, extensive global presence and dedication to operational 
disciplines, has an excellent platform for growth. We will continue 
to extend the Group’s position in the Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power 
sectors, all of which are high growth, long cycle markets with 
positive fundamentals. 
Our strategy will be delivered through sustainable self-made growth 
supplemented by skilfully integrated, targeted acquisitions. We will 
invest in the technology, infrastructure and people to grow market 
share and our installed base of original equipment. This will include 
broadening our competitive portfolio of products and added-value 
services, with the emphasis on those products that will provide a 
strong stream of aftermarket opportunities.
Driving growth 
The immediate priority for 2010 is to extend operational 
excellence beyond the factory floor into functional areas that 
have a direct impact on our ability to grow and that support our 
continued drive for greater customer focus. 
The Weir Commercial System will be extended during 2010 and 
complements the Weir Production System that has delivered such 
good results in manufacturing. Both these tools contribute by 
sharpening customer focus and ensuring operational efficiency. 
With operational excellence prioritised throughout the business,  
we will generate growth through three key drivers. 
First, we will drive product sales through innovation and 
creativity. We will continue to take an innovative approach to the 
research, testing and development of new materials and products. 
Besides taking new products to existing markets and customers, 
we will proactively take our existing and developing portfolio to new 
markets and customers as we seek to build market presence.

Second, we will support collaboration in the form of co-operative 
alliances and cross-divisional initiatives to promote our total 
capability for customers in all markets and to leverage off best 
practice across the Group. We will continue to build customer 
partnerships and add value by delivering innovative engineering 
solutions with an integrated service offering and enhanced 
organisational capability.
Third, we will exploit and strengthen our emerging markets 
footprint. Over 40% of Group revenue already comes from 
developing markets in Asia, South America, Middle East and  
Africa. There are significant opportunities for us to internationalise 
more products through both our existing and expanding 
geographical network.
Outlook 
The Weir Group today has a superb manufacturing platform, 
resilient business model and enviable market position. This is  
based on our reputation for excellent engineering capability and  
the quality of our people, whose performance under pressure  
has been outstanding in the past year. 
Despite the impact of the current downturn, we continue to be 
positive as to the medium term growth prospects of each of our 
principal end markets and anticipate growing demand from:
•  Global demographic trends causing increased demand for 
resources and energy.
•  Continuing infrastructure investment in developing economies 
with fast-growing populations, such as India, China and Brasil.
•  Necessary replacement or life extension of ageing power 
generation and hydrocarbon processing plant in the  
developed world.
•  Increasing trend towards the unconventional supply of minerals 
and hydrocarbons which requires greater engineering input in 
both their extraction and processing.
As we enter 2010, the Group is in robust financial health and well 
placed to capitalise on market opportunities. Although the pace 
and timing of global economic recovery remains uncertain and 
forward visibility limited, we are now targeting a broadly similar  
level of profitability to that achieved in 2009.

Waterspider 
The Weir Multiflo ‘waterspider’ is a 
floating pump platform for use in mine 
de-watering, enabling the ongoing 
cleaning of settling ponds which 
previously had to be drained and 
mechanically de-silted – a costly  
and time-consuming process. 
Flow Line Safety Restraint System  
Developed by Weir SPM, this best-
in-class safety product is mandated 
on Shell offshore and onshore sites 
worldwide. The Safety Restraint System 
is designed to help provide damage 
control for line failures during high-
pressure pumping – and to prevent the 
costly and potentially life-threatening 
effects of this.
Subsea innovation  
In ultra-deep subsea gas projects, 
water vapour in the hydrocarbon gas 
can freeze and requires Mono Ethylene 
Glycol (MEG) injection – a type of 
antifreeze – to prevent costly hydrate 
formation. Weir Power & Industrial’s 
rotary gate valve controls the level  
of MEG injection without blockage  
or erosion.

The Weir Group’s reputation is built on the superiority of our materials 
and products, which deliver longer plant life, extend maintenance 
cycles, reduce downtime and lower whole-life operating costs. We 
are committed to protecting this superiority, by investing in materials 
research and design, securing our intellectual property portfolio and 
focusing on bringing breakthrough developments to market ahead of 
the competition. 
Innovation is not restricted to the development of our product 
portfolio through technological R&D. It is about taking the initiative 
in introducing new products to existing customers and existing 
products to new markets; about being proactive and creative in 
delivering operational improvement and increasing customer focus.
Our strategy for growth includes an invitation to all our people to 
challenge received wisdom and established processes and to utilise 
the talent across Weir to provide innovative solutions for the real 
world challenges our customers are tackling. 
Our people are encouraged to pursue more innovative service solutions 
for our installed equipment base to develop complementary products 
to maximise the offering to customers.
An innovative solution from Weir’s Australian field service experts 
created significant savings for a New Zealand paper company  
after a blade failure on the plant’s geothermal steam turbine.  
A six-month wait for replacement initially seemed the only option.  
But design and manufacture of new blades using the latest 
computerised technologies and materials combined with Weir’s 
project management skills and on-site installation expertise meant 
the turbine was back in action within a number of weeks.

Weir Minerals Division is the global leader in the provision of slurry 
handling equipment and associated spare parts for abrasive high 
wear applications. Mining and minerals is the division’s largest sector 
but it also has aligned product sales into the niche markets of oil 
sands and flue gas desulphurisation (FGD). Products include pumps, 
hydro cyclones, valves, de-watering equipment and wear resistant 
linings. Specialised engineering resource and ongoing investment 
in wear resistant materials technology and engineered hydraulics 
ensure delivery of world-class performance in customer critical 
mining and minerals applications. The division is fully operational in 
the key mining markets, including South America, Australia, Africa 
and North America.
Market review 
The global economic downturn and associated decline in 
commodity prices resulted in difficult market conditions in 2009. 
A number of existing mine sites were mothballed, principally in 
North America and Australia and many major new projects were 
deferred as customers sought to conserve cash and strengthen 
their balance sheets although enquiry levels and preliminary 
scoping work did increase towards the end of the year. While 
commodity production volumes were lower in the early part of 
the year, there was a notable improvement in the second half 
supported by investment in Asian infrastructure. This, together with 
increased enquiry levels for new capital projects in the latter part 
of 2009, indicates that we have seen a bottoming of the market. 
The FGD and oil sands markets were also adversely impacted by 
a more cautious approach to new projects, although we did see a 
number of follow-on orders in respect of existing oil sands projects. 
Achievements & contract wins
•  Completed design work on a number of pump enhancements which will be launched 
in 2010.
•  Commenced development of new larger facilities for Weir Multiflo in Australia reflecting 
the doubling in size of that business since it was acquired in 2007.
•  Weir Minerals Netherlands won a substantial order in excess of m10m to supply a 
number of Geho

Operational performance 
Despite difficult market conditions, the division has continued to 
perform strongly benefiting from improved operating efficiencies, a 
higher proportion of aftermarket revenues, pro-active management 
of the cost base and the continued development of the product 
portfolio. This performance demonstrates the resilience of the 
division’s business model.
Order input decreased 20% to £718m (2008: £897m) reflecting 
a 36% decline in original equipment and a 3% reduction in 
aftermarket orders, resulting in a higher proportion of aftermarket 
orders (58%) compared to the prior year (2008:48%). Order 
input trends reflect the division’s broad geographic spread and 
commodity exposure. Input in our Netherlands business, which is 
largely driven by major greenfield mining development, was down 
44% while our Andean business with a focus on copper mining 
achieved input growth of 10%. The success of integrating the 
2007 acquisition Multiflo was evident with input for that business 
increasing by 51%. We experienced a significant reduction in 
orders for FGD equipment, particularly in North America, pending 
clarification of proposed environmental legislation. Demand for 
products for the Canadian oil sands market remained strong with 
follow-on orders booked in the year. The relative resilience of 
aftermarket orders reflected the decline in commodity production 
volumes offset to some extent by an absolute increase in the 
installed base. 
Revenue decreased 1% to £813m (2008: £825m) reflecting  
the strong opening order book, a full year contribution from the  
CH Warman acquisition and more robust shorter cycle aftermarket 
input trends. Our global footprint continues to drive increasing 
exposure to emerging markets which represented 52% of 
revenues in 2009 compared to 46% in 2008, with further  
good progress in both South America and Africa.
Operating profit increased by 2% to £133.6m (2008: £130.4m) 
reflecting a full year benefit from CH Warman, now successfully 
integrated, and the impact of stronger operating margins offset  
by restructuring and one-off costs of £5.5m. 
Operating margins improved to 16.4% (2008: 15.8%) primarily 
reflecting a higher proportion of aftermarket sales and the success 
of our pro-active approach to downturn planning which resulted in 
tangible cost savings in operations, procurement and manufacturing. 
The division also benefited from further development of Lean best 
practices in all of our facilities worldwide.
“ We continue to invest in 
product technology, including a 
redesign of all our major pump 
lines by 2011. The focus on 
customer relations and global 
service underpins our goal to 
remain at the forefront of our 
target industries and benefit 
from the ongoing growth in 
emerging markets.”

Investment  
The division’s success is underpinned by ongoing investment in materials and product 
technology as well as in operating facilities to ensure that we maintain our market  
leading position in terms of quality and delivery. Recognising the need to respond  
to the changing geographic profile of the global mining market, we continue to  
invest in growing our presence in the emerging markets of South America and Asia.  
Capital expenditure in 2009 totalled £29.7m (2008: £32.2m) and included a new  
state-of-the-art foundry in Brasil which features the latest concepts in manufacturing, 
quality and safety procedures. 
Investment in technology included the implementation of our Wear Fundamentals 
Programme which has enabled us to derive significant performance improvements  
from the core Warman Slurry Pump product. Design work was completed on several 
new products in 2009 and 2010 will see these launched to the market. In addition,  
the culmination of two years of product development work by the Netherlands business 
has resulted in the launch of the Apexs pump, which expands the GEHO
®
 positive 
displacement product range. The initial application of this technology is in mine 
dewatering applications. 
People  
Our employees remain at the heart of the business and it is their engineering and 
operational skills which provide the competitive advantage. We continued to invest  
in our people through the economic downturn with a number of representatives from  
the division attending the Weir Group Leadership Development programme.
Outlook 
While project enquiry levels are up and major miners have announced planned increases 
in their 2010 capital expenditure levels, we remain cautious as to the timing of conversion 
into original equipment orders. Furthermore product lead times dictate that any resultant 
flow through to revenues will not be evident until later in 2010. These factors together 
with our lower opening order book mean that original equipment revenues are likely to be 
lower through the first part of 2010. Aftermarket sales have now stabilised and we would 
expect these to grow in line with underlying commodity production trends determined by 
commodity prices and global economic growth. They will also benefit from our growing 
installed base of original equipment. The medium term outlook for the division remains 
positive, reflecting growing emerging market demand for resources.
Weir in action 
Customer 
Newmont Mining owns and operates two gold 
mines at Waihi on New Zealand’s North Island 
and gold has been mined in the area for over  
100 years. These mines share a processing  
mill, which consists of primary crushing with SAG 
and ball mill circuits employing multiple Warman
®
 
AH
®
 pumps and Cavex
®
 hydrocyclones.
Brief 
The two mines produce ore with differing 
degrees of abrasiveness. Waihi’s “Favona’ 
underground mine’s ore is almost four times 
more abrasive than the ore from the ‘Martha’ 
open pit. These differences create irregular 
wear rates and cause other maintenance 
requirements at the mill. Pump rebuilds were 
costly in terms of repair time, replacement 
parts and labour and Newmont Mining needed 
a longer-lasting solution to meet the varying 
demands of the different ores. 
Solution 
Weir Minerals provided its newly designed 
WRT
TM
 ‘wear reduction technology’ streamlined 
impellers and throatbush for the customer’s 
existing Warman
®
 pumps, enabling the use of 
longer-lasting rubber pump liners. The results 
were remarkable – a 180% increase in wear life 
on ‘Favona’s’ more abrasive ore and an 80% 
increase on ‘Martha’s’. 
Result 
The efforts of Weir Minerals have allowed the 
Newmont operation at Waihi to significantly 
reduce their costs for labour and parts and 
maintain a more consistent and profitable mill 
circuit operation. The innovative enhancements 
to the Warman
®
 impellers at Waihi are 
being expanded for use in Warman
®
 pumps 
worldwide aimed at helping customers enjoy 
similar performance and fiscal results.

Weir Oil & Gas Division designs and manufactures pumps and 
ancillary equipment for the global upstream and downstream oil 
and gas markets and provides substantial aftermarket service 
and support activities. The upstream operation which is focused 
in North America specialises in the manufacture of high-pressure 
well service pumps and related flow control equipment along with 
repairs, parts and service of pressure control and upstream rotating 
equipment. The downstream business is focused on the design 
and manufacture to order of centrifugal pumps, mainly used in the 
refining industry. The division’s principal operations are located in 
North America, Europe and the Middle East.
Market review 
During 2009, the North American upstream market experienced 
a substantial reduction in activity with lower demand for natural 
gas resulting in higher gas storage levels and reduced prices. At 
the mid-year point, rig count had reduced by around 50% before 
starting to slowly recover in the second half, with a notable increase 
in the drilling of harsher shale formations.
There was a significant number of project opportunities in the 
downstream market, principally driven by an expansion of 
refining capacity in the Middle East, although Middle East service 
operations were impacted by reduced production volumes.

“ The results in 2009 highlight 
the resilience of our business 
model. With improving upstream 
market conditions in the last 
quarter, we are well placed to 
make further progress in 2010.”
Operational performance 
The division has performed well, taking swift and decisive action  
to manage costs in response to market conditions while also 
driving greater operating efficiencies.
Order input reduced by 8% to £305m (2008: £332m). Weir SPM 
was impacted by the difficult market through much of the year. 
This was mitigated by market share gains and improving demand 
in the final quarter such that input was only 9% lower at £145m 
(US$226m) compared to £160m (US$250m) in 2008. Our Middle 
East service operation input was lower principally due to the 
reduced activity levels in that region. These reductions were  
partly offset by our downstream business, Weir Gabbioneta,  
which performed well achieving good organic growth, with input 
increasing from £89m in 2008 to £101m in 2009. 
Revenue decreased 7% to £299m (2008: £323m) broadly following 
the input trend. Weir SPM finished the year with revenues of 
£131m (US$206m) against the previous year’s £176m (US$275m), 
a reduction of 26% which compared favourably with market trends 
and exceeded our prior expectations of around US$175m. Revenue 
performance benefited from Lean improvements giving rise to 
competitive lead times and the introduction of new products 
quickly gaining traction. Weir Gabbioneta played a significant  
part in mitigating the effect of reduced volumes at Weir SPM  
with revenues increasing by 56% to £98m (2008: £63m).
Operating profit including joint ventures decreased by 29% to 
£52.0m (2008: £72.8m) due to the combination of Weir SPM’s 
backlog clearance in the first half of 2008 and lower volumes at 
that business through much of 2009. 
Operating margins were 17.4% in 2009 compared to 22.6% in 
2008, reflecting the operating leverage effect of lower volumes 
at Weir SPM, partly offset by our actions to reduce costs at the 
beginning of 2009 in response to the severity of the downturn.

Customer 
A “voice of customer” exercise by Weir SPM 
uncovered market demand for a more durable 
and reliable frac manifold trailer to replace 
existing competitor equipment which was failing 
prematurely in the harsh pumping environment 
of unconventional gas shale formations during 
multistage hydraulic fracturing processes. 
Brief 
A leading oil field service company reported a 
competitor’s piping and integrals components 
failing within 20 - 200 hours of installation due 
to vibration. Other customers had concerns 
over high wear rates during high pressure 
pumping and sought an alternative to reduce 
replacement costs.
Solution 
Weir SPM analysed existing designs and 
created a solution utilising its patented Safety 
Iron
®
, high-pressure flow line product. The 
offering included both retrofit kits for existing 
trailers and complete new manifold trailers. 
Result 
To date, Safety Iron
®
 manifold trailers and 
retrofit kits have been utilised by many of the  
oil field service pressure pumping companies. 
Weir SPM engineered special “hybrid” Safety 
Iron
®
 components that can be installed into 
key stress areas in the existing flow lines of the 
customer’s trailer. The new integrals achieved 
over 1,000 hour life with no issues saving the 
customer thousands of dollars in replacement 
cost and increasing the utilisation rate of the 
manifold trailer.
Investment  
Weir Oil & Gas continued to invest in support of future growth ambitions. Major investment 
in Weir SPM included the start up of six new service centres and high pressure pump 
test facilities at Fort Worth. Weir Oil & Gas Edmonton invested in a new vertical boring 
mill to expand its machining capabilities and service offering. On 5 March 2010, we 
further extended our geographic reach and service offering with the AUS$7m acquisition  
of Petroleum Certification Services, an Australian based specialist certification and  
testing business.
People 
We have continued to develop and promote our strong talent base within the division. 
During 2009, management training and development activities were carried out in each 
area of the business and representatives from the division attended the Weir Group 
Leadership Development Programme. 
Outlook 
Although forward visibility is still limited, the immediate outlook for our upstream business 
is more positive than at the start of 2009. This is based on increases in rig counts since 
they bottomed in mid-2009 and higher demand for aftermarket products and services as 
the industry moves to harsher shale formations. We expect any recovery in our Middle East 
service operations to be slow. Our downstream order book provides a solid underpinning 
for 2010, although we anticipate a more challenging environment for new orders.
 
The medium term outlook for upstream remains strong, with rig counts forecast to continue 
to rise, an increasing bias towards unconventional drilling and emerging interest in shale 
fracturing beyond North America.

Weir Power & Industrial Division designs, manufactures and provides 
aftermarket support for specialist and critical-service rotating and 
flow control equipment to the global power generation, industrial 
and oil & gas sectors. The division includes the Group’s valve 
operations, a specialist pump business and substantial service and 
aftermarket operations with locations in Europe, Middle East, North 
America, China, India and South Africa. Three of our facilities have 
nuclear certification and we are one of only a few companies globally 
with the capability to provide specialist safety critical valves into the 
nuclear islands of the third generation of nuclear power stations.
Market review 
The original equipment power market continued to be generally 
buoyant in Asia but was depressed in Europe and North America, 
due to new coal power station development being delayed or 
cancelled as a result of funding issues, environmental concerns 
and planning constraints. The strong Asian market has been 
driven by an acceleration in the placement of nuclear new build 
contracts in China, now the largest nuclear new build market in the 
world, as a consequence of the economic stimulus programme 
introduced by the Chinese Government.
New coal and nuclear plant delays in Europe and North America 
have resulted in increased potential for service and life extension 
projects and demand for hydro refurbishment in Canada has  
been robust. 
The global downturn impacted the North American industrial markets 
which had a direct impact on our Canadian service centres. 
Achievements & contract wins
•  Type approval certification for a new nuclear butterfly valve.
•  Awarded £33m of orders from the nuclear new build programme in China with supply 
of critical valves from all three of our nuclear facilities in the UK, France and USA.
•  Additional contract wins in Libya to supply submersible pump sets for the Sarir Wellfield 
extension project, which will supply and transport water to towns and industries.
•  Early completion of a multi-million dollar mechanical overhaul contract at BC Hydro 
Peace Canyon, British Columbia’s fourth largest hydro power station. 
•  CAD$600m15-year contract awarded for the maintenance and operation of the 
Canadian Naval Engineering Test Establishment.

“ Strong power sector growth 
has offset industrial sector 
decline giving our resilient 
business a record order book 
into 2010.”
Operational performance 
The division has continued to make good progress in developing its 
presence in global power markets with a key focus on the nuclear 
and hydro markets. Sales to emerging markets, especially China 
are making a growing contribution. Improving operating margins 
reflect increased plant utilisation and further operational efficiencies.
Order input declined by 8% to £266m (2008: £289m), with 
original equipment 18% lower and aftermarket in line with the 
prior year. This reflects the timing of large contract awards in the 
power markets with the weaker industrial markets being partly 
offset by increased power station life extension and service work. 
Overall, the proportion of orders from the power sector continued 
to grow with some £33m of specialist valve input achieved from 
the Chinese nuclear new build programme scheduled for delivery 
in 2011 onwards. The strong power performance was offset by 
a decline in industrial and oil and gas orders from Canada and 
Europe reflecting weaker market conditions. 
Our Canadian service business secured a CAD$600m 15 year 
contract to operate the Naval Engineering Test Establishment  
in Montreal providing a solid base load for that business  
going forward. 
Revenue increased by 1% to £242m (2008: £240m). Revenue 
from the power sector increased 19% and now accounts for 56% 
of divisional revenues (2008: 48%). This reflects a strong opening 
order book and increased refurbishment and life extension support 
to power stations in Europe and North America. Oil and gas 
revenues declined 22% as a consequence of a general market 
downturn in new project activity. The proportion of the division’s 
revenue generated from emerging markets increased to 21% 
compared to 20% in 2008.
Operating profit increased 16% to £23.0m (2008: £19.9m) 
reflecting the flow through of the underlying margin improvement 
and early returns on the investment in people, technology and 
plant made in recent years. 
Operating margins rose to 9.5% from 8.3% in 2008. This 
increase has been driven by increased operational efficiencies, 
lower product costs and developing supply chain in China.

Investment  
Investment in our products and facilities continues to be critical to the future success 
of the division. Total capital expenditure in the year was £3.7m (2008: £10.2m). 
Further investment has been made in Suzhou, China to expand the range of products 
manufactured there and to establish a customer training centre to consolidate our 
presence in this growing market. In the UK, we extended the capability and portfolio of 
services of the Alloa Service Centre in Scotland with investment in the valve workshop;  
a new training centre to improve our service offering on pumping equipment and a 
unique profiling machine for on-site valve maintenance. 
People 
Investment in people is central to our divisional strategy. During 2009, we created a 
dedicated nuclear technology forum and sales team to focus on global opportunities 
and ensure that we continue to have the capabilities to deliver the design, development, 
testing and qualification of nuclear valves that will meet customer and regulatory 
qualification standards.
Outlook 
We enter 2010 with a record order book and the division’s financial performance in 2010 
will benefit from a strong nuclear workload. 
Whilst we are cautious at the speed of recovery in industrial markets, the outlook for  
the global nuclear power market is increasingly positive driven by environmental concerns 
combined with a growing demand for power particularly in Asia. A significant large-scale 
and sustained nuclear new build market is projected worldwide. At the same time, the 
need for life extension and refurbishment of existing power plants in the UK, Europe and 
North America will continue to grow given lead times for new build in these markets. 
Our global footprint, track record and nuclear expertise means we are well placed to 
benefit from these opportunities over the medium term.
Weir in action 
Customer 
Qinshan Nuclear Power Station Phase II 
extension project is a joint venture between 
China Nuclear Energy Industries Company and 
China Nuclear Power Engineering and has two 
650 MW reactors under construction.
Brief 
Before a nuclear station can operate a safety 
case has to be accepted and the correct 
functioning of the Main Steam Isolation valve is 
critical. The purpose of this quick closing valve 
is to protect the steam generator in the unlikely 
event of a pipe break, down stream of the valve.
Solution 
Hopkinsons 750mm diameter MSIv parallel slide 
gate valves, at five metres tall, are the largest 
valves designed and built at Power & Industrial’s 
UK valve facility. The valve is required to close 
within five seconds of a pipe break being 
detected. Weir undertook a combination of 
analysis and testing, based on the 700mm MSIv 
supplied to Sizewell ‘B’ nuclear power station in 
the UK, which had been subjected to simulated 
pipe break testing.
Result 
Weir carried out a detailed ‘Design for 
Manufacture’ exercise with key castings and 
machinist suppliers. A purpose-built specialist 
test rig was developed and testing and 
analytical results all proved the valve’s quick-
closure performance in the highly critical safety 
related function before the valves were shipped 
to China during 2009 for the commissioning of 
the unit in May 2010.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report
We have delivered a strong set of results that clearly demonstrate 
the quality and resilience of our business model. A higher proportion 
of aftermarket revenues, a growing contribution from emerging 
markets and effective cost-base management largely mitigated  
the impact of reduced demand for original equipment products.  
An outstanding level of cash generation in the year coupled  
with our committed bank facilities and long dated fixed rate notes 
issued in January 2010 means that we start the year in a strong  
financial position.
Order input in constant currency at £1,302m was 18% lower than 
the prior year both in total and, on a like for like basis, after adjusting 
for prior year acquisitions and disposals. Original equipment orders 
were down 34%, reflecting lower capital spending across most of 
our end markets while aftermarket orders held up well ending the 
year only 2% lower than 2008, representing 58% (2008: 48%)  
of total input. Each of the divisions reported lower input levels in 
2009. Minerals order input fell 20% to £718m (2008: £897m) and 
23% on a like for like basis, while Oil & Gas input fell 8% to £305m 
(2008: £332m) with the like for like decline also at 8%. Power & 
Industrial input fell 8% to £266m (2008: £289m).
Revenue grew by 3% from £1,354m in 2008 to £1,390m, with a 
net currency benefit of £145m principally due to the weakening 
of sterling relative to the average US dollar, euro and Australian 
dollar rates in the prior year. In constant currency terms, this 
represents a 7% decline in revenue, reflecting a strong opening 
order book, offset by lower input levels over the year. Like for like 
revenues, in constant currency, were similarly down 7% reflecting 
the impact of prior year acquisitions and disposals. Aftermarket 
sales represented 54% (2008: 50%) of revenue and our exposure 
to emerging markets grew to 43% (2008: 40%) of revenues with 
stronger contributions from both South America and Africa. On 
a constant currency basis, Minerals revenues were down 1% to 
£813m (2008: £825m) with a like for like revenue decline of 5% 
and a full year’s contribution from CH Warman. Oil & Gas revenue 
fell 7% to £299m (2008: £323m) with a like for like revenue decline 
of 8% and a full year contribution from prior year acquisitions. 
Power & Industrial revenues grew 1% to £242m (2008: £240m). 
Revenues from other Group companies fell from £110m to £36m  
in part due to disposals in the prior year.
1
 Adjusted to exclude intangibles amortisation  25
Interest 
Net finance costs increased to £17.7m 
(2008: £8.8m) due to an increase in 
pension scheme finance costs of £3.3m, 
one-off costs of £3.7m on cancellation  
of floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps 
in advance of the issue of a series of 
fixed rate notes in January 2010 and 
reduced interest rate differential benefits 
from our US dollar balance sheet hedging 
programme. Net finance costs (excluding 
other finance costs / income) were 
covered 12.6 times by operating profits 
(2008: 17.5 times).
Profit before tax 
Profit before tax from continuing operations 
before intangibles amortisation increased 
by 6% to £187.0m (2008: £176.2m). 
Reported profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by 7% to £170.4m 
(2008: £159.5m) reflecting intangibles 
amortisation of £16.6m (2008: £16.7m).
Taxation 
The tax charge for the year of £52.2m 
(2008: £51.8m) on profits before tax from 
continuing operations before intangibles 
amortisation of £187.0m (2008: £176.2m) 
represents an underlying effective tax rate 
of 27.9% (2008: 29.4%) reflecting a lower 
proportion of US profits which are taxed  
at a higher rate. This differs from an 
expected rate of 29.3% (2008: 31.2%) 
principally as a consequence of an  
efficient capital structure. The reported  
tax charge in respect of continuing 
operations was £46.8m (2008: £46.5m), 
reflecting the additional tax credit on 
intangibles amortisation.
Discontinued operations 
Profit from discontinued operations of 
£5.2m (2008: £57.8m) relates to the 
release of certain warranty provisions  
in relation to prior year disposals.
Earnings & dividends 
Earnings per share from continuing 
operations before intangibles amortisation 
increased by 8% to 64.1p (2008: 59.3p). 
Reported earnings per share including 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional items 
and discontinued operations was 61.2p 
(2008: 81.4p) reflecting the gain of £55.1m 
realised on the sale of Strachan & Henshaw 
in the prior year. The weighted average 
number of shares in issue increased to 
210.3 million (2008: 209.9 million).
Subject to shareholder approval, the full 
year dividend will be 21.0p, an increase  
of 14% over last year’s total of 18.5p. 
This results in dividend cover (being the 
ratio of earnings per share from continuing 
operations before intangibles amortisation 
and exceptional items to dividend per 
share) of 3.1 times compared to 3.2  
times in 2008.
Operating profit from continuing operations before intangibles 
amortisation increased by 11% to £204.7m (2008: £185.0m) 
including a net foreign currency benefit of £29.4m. On a constant 
currency basis, operating profits reduced by 5% to £204.7m 
(2008: £214.4m), in part due to lower volumes at Weir SPM  
and one-off restructuring costs of £6.2m partly offset by a net 
contribution from prior year acquisitions and disposals of £10.7m. 
Operating margins in constant currency increased from 14.3%  
to 14.7%, reflecting the favourable impact of a higher proportion  
of aftermarket revenues and proactive management of the cost 
base. On a constant currency basis, Minerals operating profits 
grew 2% to £133.6m (2008: £130.4m) with a £5.6m incremental 
contribution from CH Warman giving a divisional operating margin 
of 16.4% (2008: 15.8%). Oil & Gas operating profits, including joint 
ventures, declined to £52.0m (2008: £72.8m). Operating margins 
were 17.4% compared to 22.6% for the prior year. Power & 
Industrial operating profits increased by 16% to £23.0m (2008: 
£19.9m) with operating margins of 9.5% (2008: 8.3%). The profit 
contribution from other Group companies was £6.8m (2008: 
£2.0m). Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and 
equipment and investment property in the year was £29.2m 
(2008: £25.6m) giving rise to operating profits from continuing 
operations before depreciation and intangibles amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) of £233.9m (2008: £210.6m). 26 The Weir Group PLC
Cashflows 
The Group delivered an outstanding cash 
result. Cash generated from operations 
increased 41% to £302.3m (2008: 
£214.4m) representing an EBITDA to 
cash conversion ratio of 129% (2008: 
102%), principally driven by a net working 
capital inflow of £66.2m (2008: £9.0m 
outflow). Overall working capital on a 
constant currency basis is now 10% 
of revenues (2008: 13%) with strong 
management attention in the year yielding 
an improvement in debtor days from 52 to 
47 and an improvement in inventory turns 
from 3.2 times to 3.6 times. Our working 
capital performance did benefit from an 
unusually high level of advance payments 
on major contracts and we expect to see 
an associated unwind of around £30m 
during 2010.
Additional pension contributions of £11.1m 
(2008: £6.5m) were paid in the period, 
principally in respect of the enhanced 
transfer offer to certain deferred members 
of the main UK plan and agreed special 
contributions to the UK plans. We expect 
such payments to reduce to around £9m 
in 2010. 
Capital expenditure reduced from £53.3m 
in 2008 to £40.6m, representing 1.4 
times depreciation (2008: 2.3 times), 
reflecting continued attractive investment 
opportunities available across the Group.
Settlement of derivative financial instruments 
resulted in cash outflows of £16.5m (2008: 
£4.2m). This principally represented the 
scheduled settlement of cross currency 
swaps which formed part of the hedge of 
our US dollar investment in Weir SPM with 
the remainder of these derivatives rolling-off 
over the next four years.
Net free cashflow (being net cashflow 
generated from continuing operations, 
excluding the cash impact in relation to 
acquisitions, disposals and net repayment 
of borrowings) after all financing costs, 
tax and dividends was £141.1m (2008: 
£60.7m). Taken together with the adverse 
impact of the translation of foreign 
currency borrowings of £18.9m (2008: 
£63.5m), net debt reduced by £120.7m  
to £119.2m (2008: £239.9m) reflecting 
a net debt/EBITDA ratio of just 0.5 times 
(2008: 1.1 times).
Treasury management 
The Group is financed through a 
combination of bank debt, fixed rate 
notes and equity. The capital structure 
is managed centrally with the objective 
of optimising capital efficiency while 
maintaining a good degree of  
financial headroom. 
The principal financial risks faced by the 
Group are those relating to liquidity, foreign 
currency and credit risk. The Group’s 
treasury policies and procedures, which 
are reviewed and updated on a regular 
basis, seek to reduce these financial risks. 
Within this framework, the Group uses 
financial assets and liabilities including 
derivatives to hedge certain foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Funding & liquidity 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding 
and flexibility through the use of bank 
overdrafts, bank loans and long term  
fixed rate notes.
The Group has committed bank borrowing 
facilities of £625m which mature in the 
third quarter of 2011. At 1 January 2010, 
£173.1m (2008: £241.8m) was drawn 
under these facilities and all covenants 
were met at 1 January 2010. During the 
year Canadian dollar facilities of CAD$90m 
matured and were repaid using drawings 
under the committed bank borrowing 
facilities. The Group also held net cash 
balances of £55.7m at 1 January 2010 
(2008: £53.6m) representing operating 
balances held by the Group’s subsidiaries 
of which £1.9m was held in the UK. 
The Group has additional committed and 
uncommitted bank facilities under which 
guarantees are issued in order to support 
commercial activities.
On 11 January 2010, the Group issued 
through a Private Placement to UK and 
US investors, the equivalent of US$250m 
of five year (2015) and eight year (2018) 
fixed rate notes in a combination of US 
dollar and sterling. Including the effect of 
swapping the sterling notes into US dollars 
the all-in average US dollar equivalent 
interest rate across these notes is 4.8%. 
This bond issue further improves the 
Group’s financial flexibility by diversifying 
our sources of finance and lengthening 
the maturity profile of borrowings. The 
proceeds from this placement have been 
used to repay borrowings under our 
bilateral facilities.
Credit management 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables with risk 
spread over a large number of countries 
and customers, with no significant 
concentration of risk. Credit worthiness 
checks are undertaken before entering 
into contracts with new customers and 
credit limits are set as appropriate. Where 
appropriate, we will use trade finance 
instruments such as letters of credit and 
insurance to mitigate any identified risk. 
The Group’s exposure to the credit risk 
of financial institutions is limited by the 
adherence to counterparty limits and by 
only trading with counterparties that have 
a strong credit standing based upon 
ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk management 
The Group’s bilateral facilities are charged 
at variable rates of interest. It is our policy 
to maintain a proportion of debt at fixed 
rates of interest subject to the future 
outlook for the level of interest rates. At 
1 January 2010, 18% (2008: 47%) of the 
Group’s debt was at fixed rates of interest 
through the use of floating to fixed interest 
rate swaps. Following the issuance of the 
equivalent of US$250m fixed rate notes on 
11 January 2010, almost all of the Group’s 
borrowings will be at fixed interest rates.
Foreign exchange 
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates for transactions undertaken 
in non-functional currencies of the operating 
companies concerned and the translation 
of foreign currency denominated net assets 
and profit and loss items.
All material transactional currency exposures 
are hedged, usually by means of forward 
contracts thereby ensuring certainty 
over revenue and costs. Subject to local 
exchange controls, foreign exchange 
transactions are executed by the 
central treasury function. No speculative 
transactions are undertaken. Although 
hedging is undertaken for all material 
exposures, only two companies apply  
cash flow hedge accounting under IFRS.
Financial review
(continued)
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report  27
The Group manages a proportion of the 
potential currency translation exposures 
from US dollar denominated net 
investments through a combination of US 
dollar borrowing, forward foreign currency 
contracts and cross currency swaps. 
The strengthening of sterling relative to 
a number of major currencies in the year 
resulted in a negative net asset translation 
effect of £12.9m, including the benefit of 
the balance sheet hedging programme. 
The fair value of derivatives designated as 
net investment hedges at 1 January 2010 
was a liability of £40.7m (2008: £77.4m) 
reflecting the weakening of the US dollar 
relative to sterling during the year. These 
derivatives are due to cash settle on a 
broadly even annual basis through to 2013.
The Group does not hedge foreign 
currency translation exposures related  
to profit and loss items.
Further information on financial risk 
management objectives and policies  
can be found in note 30 to the Group 
financial statements.
Retirement benefits 
The Group has five defined benefit plans 
in the UK and North America, the most 
significant being in the UK. All defined 
benefit plans were closed to new  
members in 2002.
The Group has continued to manage  
pro-actively manage its exposure to 
its pension plans. The wind-up of the 
Canadian defined benefit plan was 
completed and an enhanced transfer 
offer made to certain deferred members 
of the main UK plan which has further 
reduced our defined benefit pension 
obligations by around 5%. The net Group 
deficit for retirement benefit obligations 
at the period end was £71.0m (2008: 
£29.9m), reflecting a reduction in bond 
yields and the impact of updating mortality 
assumptions, partly offset by better than 
expected equity returns.
Net assets 
Net assets increased by £45.5m 
in the year to £742.4m (2008: 
£696.9m), principally reflecting total net 
comprehensive income for the year of 
£83.3m less dividends paid of £39.2m.
Litigation 
The Company and certain subsidiaries  
are from time to time, parties to legal 
proceedings and claims which arise in  
the normal course of business.
There were 308 asbestos related actions 
(2008: 180) outstanding against Group 
companies. All such actions are  
robustly defended.
In 2004, an announcement was made to 
the London Stock Exchange in connection 
with the Group’s involvement in the UN 
sanctioned Oil for Food Programme.  
The Group continues to co-operate fully 
with the on-going investigations by UK 
authorities in this connection. In addition, 
the Company is subject to a claim relating 
to an action for damages arising from the 
UN Oil for Food Programme which has 
been raised in the United States against 
just under 100 companies. This action  
will be robustly defended.
To the extent not already provided for, 
the directors do not anticipate that the 
outcome of these proceedings and claims 
either individually or in aggregate will have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial position.
Critical accounting policies 
The accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and the material 
accounting policies are set out on pages 
63 to 69 of this financial report. There 
have been no significant changes to the 
accounting policies adopted in 2008.
Applying accounting policies requires the 
use of certain judgements, assumptions 
and estimates. The most important 
of these are set out below. Further 
judgements, assumptions and estimates 
are set out in the accounts.
Intangible assets 
On the acquisition of a business it is 
necessary to attribute fair values to any 
intangible assets acquired (provided they 
meet the criteria to be recognised). The 
fair values of these intangible assets are 
dependent on estimates of attributable 
future revenues, margins and cashflows, 
as well as appropriate discount rates. 
In addition, the allocation of useful lives 
to acquired intangible assets requires 
the application of judgement based on 
available information and management’s 
expectations at the time of recognition.
Impairment 
IFRS require companies to carry out 
impairment testing on any assets that 
show indications of impairment and 
annually on goodwill and intangibles  
that are not subject to amortisation.  
This testing involves exercising 
management judgement about future 
cashflows and other events which are,  
by their nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefits 
The assumptions underlying the calculation 
of retirement benefits are important and 
based on independent advice. Changes in 
these assumptions could have a material 
impact on the measurement of the 
Group’s retirement benefit obligations. 28 The Weir Group PLC

Principal risks  
& uncertainties
Risk is inherent in the Group’s business activities and as a consequence of operating a comprehensive 
risk management process, the Group has identified the following principal risks and uncertainties which 
it believes could have a materially adverse effect on its business, revenues, profit, assets, liquidity, 
resources and reputation. The nature of risk is such that no list can be comprehensive and it is possible 
that other risks may arise, or that risks not currently considered material may become so in the future. 
Any forward-looking statements in the annual report or otherwise made by the Group should be 
considered in light of these risk factors. The Group operates controls as described in the Corporate 
governance report to mitigate against these risks.
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Global political and economic conditions
The Group operates in a number of regions 
where it may be exposed to economic, political, 
regulatory or business risks. 
While benefiting from the opportunities and 
growth in these regions, changes such as the 
introduction of new regulations, expropriation  
of assets or the imposition of trade barriers 
could disrupt the Group’s business activities 
or impact on the Group’s customers, suppliers 
or other parties with which it does business. 
In some instances, this could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial position 
and prospects. 
The Group’s diversified geographic footprint 
mitigates against any exposure within any  
one country in which it operates.
Management monitor such risks and amend 
business procedures accordingly, while 
remaining in compliance with local and 
international requirements.
In addition, strategic reviews are carried out 
by the Group prior to entry into a new country.
Human resources 
The future success of the Group depends on 
the skills and efforts of its employees across all 
of its businesses and the ability to retain and 
develop these individuals. 
In addition, the success of Group acquisitions 
will depend on the ability to retain management 
personnel of acquired companies.
If it is unable to attract and retain excellent 
talent, the Group may not be able to effectively 
implement its business strategies. 
The Group constantly reviews its remuneration 
packages to ensure they remain competitive 
and also maintains development and 
succession planning programmes.
The Group’s employee development 
programmes are explained in more detail 
on page 50.
Health and safety 
Certain aspects of the Group’s manufacturing 
and service activities mean that employees are 
exposed to hazardous environments.
If the Group cannot maintain a safe place of 
work for all its employees, a number of negative 
outcomes to the Group could result including: 
• fines and penalties; 
• loss of key customers; 
•  exclusion from market sectors deemed 
important for future growth; and 
• damage to reputation. 
The Group is committed to maintaining a safe 
working environment and a culture of zero 
tolerance to accidents. To support this, all 
operations are encouraged to achieve OHSAS 
18001. More details of this are contained on 
page 49.
The Group has in place quality and safety 
processes within each of its businesses which 
are regularly audited by professional bodies 
and customers.  31
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Environmental and regulatory 
The Group has contracts and operations in 
many parts of the world and is subject to local 
laws and regulations. Non-compliance with any 
of these laws or regulations could expose the 
Group to financial or reputational damage. 
In addition, manufacturing facilities are, at times, 
subject to permits that control the discharge 
of hazardous substances into the air or water; 
and the storage and disposal of such materials 
which could result in contamination of the site. 
It is expected that controls over environmental 
issues will increase in the future. 
Failure by the Group, or agents acting on 
its behalf, to comply with these laws and 
regulations could result in administrative, civil 
or criminal liabilities resulting in significant fines 
and penalties and/or debarment of the Group 
from government contracts for a period of 
time or affect the Group’s future operational 
performance or financial condition.
The Group has formal systems and policies  
in place which are mandated under the Group 
compliance scorecard to ensure adherence 
to regulatory requirements and to identify any 
restrictions that could adversely impact on the 
Group’s activities. More detail on this can be 
found on pages 38 and 39.
Each of the Group’s operational sites have 
managers who monitor regulatory developments.
All sites have to be ISO 14001 compliant in 
order that they not only meet with current 
requirements but also have the appropriate 
management systems in place to ensure 
continuous improvement in environmental 
performance. More detail on this is  
contained on page 51.
Legal
Manufacturing companies are, from time to 
time, exposed to personal injury claims and 
class actions or other litigation resulting from 
injuries sustained at work, including asbestosis 
or other health problems associated from 
working in industries that used asbestos in  
the twentieth century.
The Group has insurance cover for certain 
claims but not for all the claims. The number 
and size of the claims is dependent on the 
number of third parties that are still in existence 
and can be included in such actions. Both of 
these can change over time and as a result the 
Group’s exposure can increase.
The Group has internal policies and 
procedures for monitoring these risks, 
managing and mitigating against these 
liabilities and to ensure that there is regular 
reporting to the Board on any changes  
or developments. 
Competition and innovation
The Group competes against large and well 
established global companies, as well as local 
companies and low cost replicators of spare 
parts, on the basis of price, technical expertise, 
timeliness of delivery, previous installation 
history and reputation for quality and reliability. 
The Group’s continued success depends 
not only on the continuous improvement of 
its existing product portfolio but its ability to 
continue to develop and produce new and 
enhanced products in a cost effective and timely 
manner in accordance with customer demands. 
Failure to maintain a competitive advantage  
or manufacture at the lowest cost could  
have a significant adverse impact on the  
Group’s business.
All new or improved technologies and products 
involve risk, including the potential for abortive 
expenditure, reputational risk and potential 
customer claims. 
In addition, the Group’s processes to bring a 
new product to market may not be fast enough 
to gain market share or the new product 
may not achieve market acceptance, thereby 
harming the Group’s reputation.
To remain competitive, the Group invests 
continuously in its manufacturing, marketing, 
customer service support and distribution 
networks. The Group also maintains 
the highest manufacturing and quality 
standards which include regular dialogue 
with customers to ensure that individual 
customer requirements are met. It also takes 
appropriate action to ensure that its cost base 
remains competitive and margins protected. 
The diversity of operations reduces the 
possible effect of action by a single competitor 
and combined with the application of the 
Weir Production System ensures the Group’s 
competitive advantage is sustained. 32 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Financial
The Group is exposed to foreign currency, 
liquidity and credit risk. 
Foreign currency transactional risk arises when 
operating subsidiaries enter into transactions 
denominated in currencies other than their 
functional currencies. 
Translational exposure arises on the translation 
of overseas earnings and investments into 
sterling for consolidated reporting purposes. 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or 
counterparty fails to meet an obligation under 
a contract and liquidity risk is the risk that the 
Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as  
they fall due. 
Foreign currency transactional and translational 
risk could result in volatility in reported 
consolidated earnings and net assets. 
Credit risk could have a negative impact on 
reported earnings and cash and consequently 
the liquidity of the Group. 
Liquidity risk could impact negatively on  
the Group’s reputation, borrowing costs  
or ultimately its ability to continue as a  
going concern. 
Foreign currency transactional risk is managed 
by hedging significant exposures, usually by 
means of forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Net assets translational risk is partly hedged 
using foreign currency borrowings and 
derivative financial instruments. The Group 
does not hedge translational exposure arising 
from profit and loss items. 
Credit risk is managed by undertaking credit 
reviews of key customers with reference 
to external credit rating agencies and then 
adhering to the resultant credit limits. Credit 
risk to financial institutions is limited by 
restricting the range of counterparties to  
those with high credit ratings.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring 
forecast and actual cashflows and ensuring 
that sufficient committed facilities are in place 
to meet possible downside scenarios. 
Acquisitions 
The anticipated benefits of acquisitions may  
not be realised. 
While the Group identifies expected synergies, 
cost savings and growth opportunities prior 
to completing any acquisition, these benefits 
may not always be achieved or within the 
anticipated timescale.
The Group implements a rigorous due 
diligence process and ensures clear financial 
targets are in place as well as putting any 
acquisition through a formal approval process. 
The Group implements an internal 100 day 
plan to ensure that the integration process  
is actioned with the minimum of disruption. 
Delivery performance and production
The Group’s ability to meet customer delivery 
schedules is dependent on a number of factors 
including sufficient manufacturing capacity, 
access to raw materials, inventory control, 
sufficient trained and equipped employees, 
engineering expertise and the appropriate 
planning and scheduling of the manufacturing 
process. Many of the contracts it enters into 
require long lead times and therefore contain 
clauses in relation to on-time delivery.
Failure to deliver in accordance with customer 
expectation could subject the Group to financial 
penalties, damage customer relationships and, 
as a result, impact on the Group’s financial 
performance.
Manufacturing scheduling and planning 
is subject to stringent internal assurance 
processes to optimise each business unit’s 
order book. The effect of this is to maximise 
capacity and minimise reworking costs and 
delays in delivery times. This is complemented 
by the use of the Group’s Manufacturing 
Resource Planning systems, together with the 
slotting and scheduling achieved through the 
Weir Production System.

Corporate governance 
report
Introduction 
The Board remains committed to the principles of good 
governance. Good corporate governance, using the Combined 
Code as a guide to the components of good practice, is 
an integral part of the Board’s stewardship obligations. The 
interpretation of good governance changes over time but the 
Group constantly aims for best practice in all matters and, by 
doing so, promotes the success of the business to the benefit  
of the shareholders. 
As part of the Board’s review into its effectiveness conducted 
during the year, the Board considered its composition and skills 
and concluded that it has the right experience to address and 
respond to the challenges it faces.
The Combined Code 
This report explains how the Company applies the principles of 
the Financial Reporting Council Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the Combined Code) published in June 2008 and 
appended to the Listing Rules. The Combined Code is available 
on the Financial Reporting Council website. During the 53 weeks 
ended 1 January 2010, the Company complied with all provisions 
set out in the Combined Code. 
Board of directors 
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for its 
decision. This schedule is reviewed regularly and includes 
approval of:
• environmental, health and safety policies;
•  annual and half-year financial results, interim management 
statements and trading updates;
• dividend policy;
• Board appointments;
• Group strategy and the annual operating budget;
• changes to the Group’s management and control structure;
• major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals;
• treasury policies; and
• risk management strategy and the system of internal controls.
Board meetings 
In the 53 weeks to 1 January 2010, the Board met eight times, 
with one meeting at Weir SPM in Texas, USA. The majority of 
meetings were held at the Company’s head office in Glasgow 
with two meetings held in London at the time of the Company’s 
annual and interim announcements. There is regular contact 
outside formal meetings between the chairman, chief executive 
and the other directors. 
The following table identifies the attendance record of individual 
directors at the eight board meetings held during 2009. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Re-election of directors 
The Company’s articles of association require that all directors 
appointed to the Board other than at an annual general meeting 
of the Company are required to retire at the following annual 
general meeting when they may offer themselves for election.  
In addition, one third of the remaining members of the Board 
(or, where that number is not a whole number, the nearest lower 
whole number) are required to retire by rotation, subject to all 
directors submitting themselves for re-election at least once every 
three years. Any non-executive director who has served on the 
Board for more than six years is subject to a particularly rigorous 
review and any director who has held office for more than nine 
years is required to submit himself for re-election annually. 
Board information and development 
On joining the Board, directors are provided with documentation 
on the Group and its activities. New directors are provided with 
an appropriate induction programme and, where appropriate,  
site visits are arranged to major business units. Ongoing training 
is provided as necessary. 
All directors are provided with updates on corporate governance 
developments, legislative and regulatory changes and relevant 
industry and technical information.

The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate 
information to enable it to discharge its duties, and any further 
back-up papers and information are readily available to all 
directors on request to the company secretary. The chairman 
ensures that non-executive directors are properly briefed on  
any issues arising at board meetings and non-executive directors 
have access to the chairman at any time.
Board evaluation 
A formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board  
is undertaken annually. This process is conducted internally, 
based on a detailed questionnaire completed by each director  
as well as individual and collective discussions. 
The evaluation examines the balance of skills of the directors, 
the operation of the Board in practice including its corporate 
governance and the operation and content of board meetings. 
The findings are used to assist the Board in its consideration 
of the opportunities for improvement in the performance of the 
Board and its directors. 
The Board also conducts an internal review of the effectiveness 
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees 
incorporating a questionnaire covering such matters as the role 
and organisation of each committee, meeting arrangements, 
information provision and effectiveness. Following completion  
of these questionnaires by the members of each committee,  
the chairman meets with each of them to discuss the feedback. 
The results of the evaluation for 2009 were reported to the  
Board and, where areas for improvement had been identified, 
actions were agreed. 
Additionally, a one-to-one appraisal of all board members 
is undertaken annually by the chairman. An appraisal of the 
chairman is carried out by the senior independent director,  
with input from other board members. 
Board balance and independence 
The Board currently comprises the chairman, chief executive, 
legal and commercial director and six non-executive directors,  
all of whom are independent. Michael Dearden was appointed  
senior independent director in November 2009. Jon Stanton  
is expected to join the Group as finance director in April 2010.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent 
professional advice, where appropriate, on any matter at the 
Company’s expense. The company secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that board procedures are followed and all directors 
have direct access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary. The company secretary is also responsible for 
facilitating the induction and professional development of the 
board members and information flows within the Board, its 
committees and between the non-executive directors and  
senior management. 
All directors bring their own independent judgement to major 
matters affecting the Group. Each of the non-executive directors 
is considered by the Company to be independent, with the 
exception of Professor Percy, who, as set out in the Chairman’s 
statement, will be retiring from the Board prior to the forthcoming 
annual general meeting after over thirteen years with the Group. 
The non-executive directors are independent of management. 
None of the non-executive directors has any material business  
or other relationship with the Company. Each member of the 
Board has considerable experience at senior level in other 
companies, which allows for well informed and broadly based 
debate. The board structure ensures that no individual or group 
dominates the decision-making process. 
There is a division of responsibilities between the chairman,  
who is responsible for leading and running the Board and related 
matters and the chief executive, who has executive responsibility 
for running the Group’s business and developing the appropriate 
organisational structure for a global organisation. The chief 
executive chairs the Group Executive Committee. 
The executive directors have contracts of service with one 
year’s notice, whilst non-executive directors are appointed on 
a rotational basis for periods of up to three years. The letters of 
appointment of the chairman and the non-executive directors, 
which are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office, set out the required commitment to the Company. 
Directors conflicts of interests 
The statutory duties for directors relating to conflicts of interest, 
set out in the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’), came into 
force on 1 October 2008. Under the 2006 Act, a director must 
avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company’s 
interests. The Company has adopted a formal procedure for the 
disclosure, review, authorisation and management of directors 
conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in accordance 
with these provisions. The procedure requires directors formally  
to notify the Board, via the company secretary, as soon as they 
become aware of any actual or potential conflict of interest with 
their duties to the Company or of any material change in existing 
or potential conflicts that may have been authorised by the Board. 
The Board continues to monitor and review potential conflicts of 
interest on a regular basis. A register is maintained of all such 
disclosures and the terms of any such authorisation.

Shareholders 
The Company is committed to a process of continual dialogue 
with its shareholders, including making appropriate contact 
with institutional investors and their representative bodies when 
there are specific matters to discuss. This dialogue with its 
institutional shareholders is in the form of the Group’s investor 
relations programme. This includes regular update meetings and 
presentations with major shareholders and industry analysts. 
Feedback from these presentations, which is reported to the 
Board, gives investors an opportunity to comment on the quality 
of the communications they receive in their contact with the 
chief executive and finance director. Attendees at the results 
presentations include the chairman, the executive directors, the 
senior independent director and a number of the non-executive 
directors. The Company also encourages communication 
with private shareholders throughout the year and welcomes 
their participation at shareholder meetings. In addition to the 
chairman’s statement at the annual general meeting, a trading 
update to shareholders is given and details of the Company’s 
trading activities are on display. The directors attend the annual 
general meeting and the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees are available to answer questions. 
The date of the key publications in 2010 can be found on the 
Company’s website. 
Notice of the annual general meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the meeting. The Company 
conducts the vote at the annual general meeting by electronic  
poll and the result of the votes (including proxies) is published 
on the Company’s website after the annual general meeting. 
Electronic proxy voting, details of which are included in the 
notice of the 2010 annual general meeting, is available. Voting 
participation at the annual general meetings in 2007, 2008 and 
2009 was 61%, 56% and 64% respectively.
Communications 
The Board considers that the annual report and financial 
statements and interim statements present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s performance and 
prospects. In addition to information which any company is under 
a legal or regulatory requirement to publish, the Group frequently 
publicises other business developments through the specialised 
trade press and its own internal bulletins, which have wide 
circulation and through the news section on both the divisional 
and Company websites. 
The Company’s website at www.weir.co.uk provides additional 
company information, is regularly updated and includes the 
presentations to shareholders given at the announcements of the 
full year and interim results. The website also contains an online 
version of the notice of the annual general meeting, the annual 
report and financial statements and the interim report.

Where appropriate, matters are delegated to board committees, 
all of which have written terms of reference which are available 
on the Company’s website. The company secretary acts as 
secretary to all these committees.

General Administration Committee 
The principal duties of the General Administration Committee are 
to allot shares under the Group Long Term Incentive Plan and 
other matters of a routine nature. This Committee comprises the 
executive members of the Board and meets as required.

members of the Committee are Lord Robertson and Professor  
Ian Percy. John Mogford joined the Committee in 2010.  
The secretary to the Committee is Alan Mitchelson.

who are independent of management and free from any business 
or other relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. No member of the 
Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as  
a shareholder, in the matters decided by the Committee. 
The minutes of each meeting are circulated to the Board. 
The responsibilities of the Committee are as follows: 
•  to determine the policy on the remuneration and performance  
of executive directors of the Company; 
•  to determine the conditions of employment, including levels of 
salary, pension arrangements, bonuses and share awards of 
the members of the Group Executive Committee;

 Mark Selway ceased to be a member of the Committee on 16 September 2009. 
The Committee uses external search consultants to assist it in 
its work.
The Committee primarily monitors the composition and balance 
of the Board and its committees and identifies and recommends 
to the Board the appointment of new directors. The Committee’s 
terms of reference establish a framework through which it can 
operate to ensure the selection process of Board candidates is 
conducted in a formal, disciplined and objective manner. When 
considering candidates, the Committee evaluates the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board and prepares  
a description of the role and capabilities required for the particular 
appointment. The Committee also reviews the succession 
planning and leadership needs of the organisation and ensures 
that, on appointment, all directors receive a formal contract or 
letter of appointment as appropriate. The Committee’s terms  
of reference are available on the Company’s website. 
During the year, the Committee undertook the search for a new 
chief executive to succeed Mark Selway. Having considered the 
Group’s succession plans and reviewed the external candidates 
identified by search consultants, the Committee recommended  
to the Board the appointment of Keith Cochrane as chief 
executive. The Committee then undertook the search for a  
new finance director, with both internal and external candidates 
being considered, and identified Jon Stanton as Keith Cochrane’s 
replacement. Both recommendations were approved by the Board.

the other members of the Committee were Professor Ian Percy, 
Richard Menell (who was appointed to the Committee on 1 April 
2009) and John Mogford. The secretary to the Committee is

Committee meetings. 
The Board is satisfied that Stephen King has recent and relevant 
financial experience. 
The Committee has the ability to call on Group’s employees to 
assist in its work and also has access to independent advice. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the financial reporting and internal risk management 
control functions and for making recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment of the Group’s external auditors.
The Committee is charged with responsibility to the Board for 
satisfying itself, on behalf of the Board as a whole, that the 
financial affairs of the Group are conducted with openness, 
integrity and accountability and in accordance with such existing 
statutory and regulatory provisions and codes as are applicable  
to the Group and to report on these matters to the Board. 
Its duties are to:

The minutes of each meeting are circulated to the Board.  
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The Committee maintains a policy on the appointment and role of 
the auditors. This includes guidelines on their appointment which 
is subject to review at least every five years and on their ongoing 
work to ensure that the independence of the Group’s auditors is 
not threatened, particularly by the provision of non-audit services. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the auditors’ process for 
ensuring their independence and effectiveness and commented 
on their internal quality control procedures. The Committee are 
satisfied as to their continued independence. 
Prior approval of the Committee is required where the expected 
cost of non-audit services provided by the appointed external 
auditors is in excess of £75,000. 
The day-to-day implementation of the Committee’s policies are 
delegated to the finance director who in turn monitors each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries to ensure that all engagements fall within the 
Committee’s guidelines. Fees payable to Ernst & Young LLP in 
respect of audit and assurance services of £1.2m (2008: £1.3m) 
and transaction support services of £nil (2008: £0.2m) in respect 
of 2009 were approved by the Committee. 
The Group maintains a ‘whistleblowing’ policy in line with the 
Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 to enable employees, on a 
confidential basis, to raise concerns internally in cases where 
they believe they have discovered malpractice or impropriety. 
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Complaints can be made 
either to line managers or directly to the company secretary who 
will appoint an investigating officer. Action will be taken in cases 
where the complaint is shown to be justified and at all times the 
complainant is informed of progress and outcomes. In addition, 
the auditors can be brought in to review procedures if appropriate. 
The ‘whistleblowing’ policy is available to all staff within the Group 
through the Group intranet. 
Principles of business conduct 
As an international company, the Group’s approach to 
maintaining high ethical standards is critical to its business 
success. The Group’s operating policies, which provide guidance 
in this area, have been communicated throughout the Group 
through its intranet. A copy is available from the company 
secretary. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis. 
Internal control  
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance on internal control,  
the Board ensures that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by Group 
companies. This process has been in place throughout 2009 and 
up until the date of this report, except that it did not apply to the 
Group’s joint ventures. The directors have overall responsibility 
for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board delegates to executive management the 
responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring both the 
system and the maintenance of effective internal control in each 
of the businesses which comprise the Group. In addition, each 
operating company is responsible for the operation of key internal 
controls and to formally assess the effectiveness of the internal 
control environment through the submission, twice yearly, of the 
Group compliance scorecard. 
An internal audit function is in place to review and challenge the 
effectiveness of key internal controls and to suggest relevant 
actions to address potential weaknesses. The internal audit 
review programme is based on a ‘risk based approach’ that helps 
to prioritise resource upon the areas of perceived greatest risk to 
the Group. This process is supplemented by a number of peer 
reviews that seek to further monitor and evaluate the process of 
internal control and share best practice around the Group. 
Internal audit and peer review reports are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee which considers and determines relevant action in 
respect of any control issues raised. 
As part of the control framework, each Group operating company 
and business prepares a Risk and Control Framework for their 
respective business. As part of this process, the operating 
companies prepare a report identifying the relative probability 
and severity of the risks identified, the process for managing 
and mitigating these risks and the means by which management 
might be assured that the processes are effective. 
These frameworks are considered and approved by the Group 
Executive Committee. 
In addition, a Group Risk and Control Framework is prepared, 
taking account of the significant risks identified by the individual 
units together with other Group-wide risks. The Group Risk and 
Control Framework is considered and adopted by the Board 
which is responsible for the risk management strategy. The 
system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
Corporate governance
report (continued)  39
The principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group Risk 
and Control Framework and how they are managed or mitigated 
are summarised on pages 30 to 32.
The Board has monitored the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control during the year. This is refined as necessary to 
meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks. 
Regular performance reports are provided to the executive 
directors, the Audit Committee and the Board, as appropriate. 
Where weaknesses are identified, plans and timetables for 
addressing them are also reported.
In addition to the Group Risk and Control Framework, other 
procedures which are fundamental to the Group’s system of 
internal control are as follows:
•  A clearly defined organisational structure within which individual 
responsibilities are identified and monitored. 
•  A Group compliance scorecard which records compliance with 
the policies and procedures. 
•  Policies and procedures manuals are in place and communicated 
to all Group operating companies through the Group intranet. 
The managing directors are responsible for ensuring that  
each company observes and implements these policies and 
procedures which are continuously reviewed and updated.
•  A comprehensive annual planning and financial reporting 
system incorporating consolidated management accounts, 
which compares results with forecast and the previous year 
on a monthly and cumulative basis. Management information 
systems provide directors with relevant and timely reports 
that identify significant variations from approved forecasts and 
revised forecasts for the year are produced four times a year. 
The Group’s internal control procedures described in this section 
have not been extended to cover its interests in joint ventures. 
The Group has board representation on each of its joint venture 
companies where separate systems of internal control have  
been adopted.

Remuneration 
report
Introduction 
The Remuneration Committee’s main aim is to support the Group 
in its ability to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals 
to deliver the highest possible performance to our shareholders. 
During 2009, the Committee reviewed the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan, the performance conditions attached to the awards 
and the levels at which they are made to ensure they remain 
competitive and are appropriate in the current environment. 
The Committee believes that the salary levels and the mix 
between fixed and variable compensation continues to be 
appropriate and shall continue to review the remuneration 
package on a regular basis to ensure it remains so. 
Membership of the Remuneration Committee 
The chairman of the Committee is Michael Dearden. The other 
members of the Committee who served during the year are 
Lord Robertson and Professor Ian Percy. The secretary to the 
Committee is Alan Mitchelson. 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (“Hewitt”) continued to provide external 
advice in formulating remuneration policy and its implementation 
during 2009, as well as advice on long-term incentive schemes. 
Hewitt’s appointment was renewed by the Committee for the year 
2010. Hewitt do not undertake any other work for the Group other 
than remuneration work. In carrying out its business, the Committee 
consults with the chairman and the chief executive as appropriate.
No individual plays a part in the determination of their own 
remuneration.
Remuneration strategy and policy for executive directors 
The Committee adopted the following policy for the remuneration 
of executive directors throughout 2009. It is intended that this 
policy will apply in 2010 and future years. 
•  The Group’s remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and 
retain executive directors with the necessary abilities to manage 
and develop the Group’s activities successfully for the benefit  
of shareholders. 
•  For all senior executives, the Group policy is to provide 
a significant part of their total potential reward through 
performance based incentive plans (annual bonus and long-
term incentives) as described in this report. 
•  To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with 
those of shareholders, executive directors are encouraged to 
build up a meaningful shareholding in the Company by both the 
purchase of shares and/or the retention of a proportion of their 
share awards. In addition, executive directors are obliged to 
convert part of their bonus into shares under the Group’s Long 
Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). 
Elements of remuneration
The following table provides a summary of the key elements of the executive directors’ remuneration package:
Element Objective
Performance 
period Policy
Salary To provide a competitive base 
salary to attract and retain 
talented leaders. 
— Reviewed annually by reference to companies of a similar size and 
industry and having regard to salary increases throughout the Group. 
The only component of executive remuneration which is 
pensionable is the basic salary.
Annual bonus Bonus payments are intended to 
reflect the achievement of agreed 
business objectives and positive 
contribution to stretching the 
performance of the Group. 
One year The Committee reviews the bonuses payable on an annual basis 
and sets the targets at the beginning of the financial year. The 
target used is normalised pre-tax profits. The maximum potential 
bonus receivable by the chief executive is 125% of salary and for 
the other executive directors is 100% of salary. 
As part of the LTIP, 25% of the chief executive’s bonus is deferred 
in the form of shares and in respect of the other executive directors 
20% of their bonuses are deferred. In 2011, it is proposed that the 
deferral will increase to 30% for all executive directors.*
Long term share 
incentives
To incentivise executives to 
achieve superior long-term 
performance to align shareholder 
interests with the executives and 
the retention of key individuals.
Three years Vesting is based on an earnings per share growth target and 
the relative Group total shareholder return over the three year 
performance period.   41
Analysis of remuneration package 
The following chart illustrates the proportions of the 2009 
remuneration package for the executive directors comprising  
fixed and variable elements of pay. For 2009, it shows that 
60% of executive directors total remuneration package was 
performance related.
Salary and benefits 
Following his appointment as chief executive, Keith Cochrane’s 
basic salary increased with effect from 2 November 2009 to 
£550,000. There will be no change to his salary in 2010. Reflecting 
the fact that there was no adjustment to his salary in 2009, Alan 
Mitchelson’s salary will increase by 3% in April 2010. Jon Stanton’s 
salary will be £370,000 and the other elements of his remuneration 
package will be in line with the other executive directors. 
Executive directors also receive other benefits which are the 
provision of a car allowance, participation in a Group health care 
scheme, travel allowance and death in service insurance. 
Bonus 
Under the Group annual performance–related bonus, the payout 
for 2009 was based on normalised pre-tax profits and the 
maximum potential bonus receivable by the chief executive was 
125% of salary and for the other executive directors 100% of 
salary. Although pre-tax profits increased in 2009, the stretch 
target for the executive directors was not fully achieved and as 
a result they earned 83.7% of their maximum bonus entitlement 
for the period. The performance criteria and the maximum bonus 
potential will be the same for 2010.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
During 2009, the Company continued with its annual grant 
policy under the LTIP and made awards of performance shares, 
compulsory investment shares and matching shares.
Details of each award are as follows:
•  Performance shares are conditional awards to acquire 
free shares subject to Group performance (see below) and 
continued employment until the third anniversary of the award. 
In 2009, awards were made up to a maximum of 100% of 
salary. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention to make 
awards in 2010 of up to 100% of salary.
•  Executive directors are required to compulsorily defer an element 
of any Group bonus earned (currently 25% for the chief executive 
and 20% for the other executive directors) in exchange for which 
they are awarded investment shares. In addition, executive 
directors are also allowed to voluntarily convert a further 
portion of their Group bonus (subject to any cap imposed by 
the Remuneration Committee, currently 20%) into Weir Group 
shares. In 2011, it is proposed that the compulsory deferral of 
the Group bonus for the 2010 financial year be increased to 
30%.* In addition, it is proposed that the amount that the chief 
executive will be able to invest voluntarily be increased to 25%.* 
The cap in relation to the other executive directors will remain at 
20%. These changes, which do not require formal shareholder 
approval, should permit a greater proportion of bonus to be 
converted into shares, which should further align management 
with shareholders.
•   Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, 
subject to Group performance (see below) and continued 
employment until the third anniversary of the award. In 2009, 
matching shares were awarded worth a maximum of 2.5 times  
the pre-tax value of the bonus “invested” both on a compulsory  
and voluntary basis under the LTIP. In 2011, it is proposed that 
this be reduced to 2 times.* As a result, the overall maximum 
opportunity represented by the deferral and matching arrangement 
will not increase.
The awards are based on the Group’s share price, using the 
average published closing price for the three dealing days 
immediately preceding the date of award. 
The vesting of conditional awards of performance and matching 
shares is subject to the satisfaction of a highly demanding 
performance condition. 
For the performance and matching share awards granted in 
2009, the performance condition was based on the growth in the 
Group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over a single three year 
performance period (three consecutive financial years, beginning 
with the year in which the award is made) relative to the growth  
in the TSR of a comparator group (“the Comparator Group”).  
The Comparator Group currently comprises:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Remuneration Committee may, in its absolute discretion, 
vary, add, remove or alter the companies making up the 
Comparator Group where events happen which cause the 
Remuneration Committee to consider that such change is 
appropriate to ensure that the performance condition continues 
to represent a fair measure of performance.
*  This is subject to the approval of the various changes to the LTIP being put to 
shareholders as outlined in the notice of the 2010 annual general meeting.

Only if the Company’s TSR ranks in the upper quintile of the 
Comparator Group will the full awards be receivable. This reduces 
on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the 
awards will be receivable. For below median performance,  
none of the awards will be receivable. 
In addition to TSR performance, for any of the performance and 
matching share awards to vest, the growth in the Company’s 
earnings per share over the performance period must be equal  
to or greater than the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over 
the same period.
The performance condition for the performance and matching 
share awards to be made in 2010 has been amended to one 
which is 50% based on TSR, using the same Comparator Group, 
and 50% based on earnings per share growth (adjusted to 
exclude intangibles amortisation and exceptional items) as  
set out in the following table: 
 % of the earnings per share portion 
Earnings per share growth  of the award which vests
 
11% per annum 100% 
4% per annum 25% 
Less than 4% per annum 0%
There is straight line vesting between each point.
The earnings per share performance condition used up until 2009 
will no longer apply to awards from 2010 onward. 
The Committee considers that the earnings per share targets 
introduced for 2010 are very demanding. The Committee will set 
appropriate earnings per share targets for future awards, which 
will be at least as challenging in the circumstances as the 2010 
award targets were when they were set.
The Committee believes that a balance between earnings per 
share and TSR is appropriate and aligned to the Company’s  
long-term strategic goals of driving sustained earnings 
performance and shareholder value creation.
The TSR calculation is performed by Hewitt for the Remuneration 
Committee at the time of vesting. 
In 2009, the awards made in 2006 vested and due to the 
performance condition only 69% of the awards were exercisable 
with the remainder lapsing.
Proposed changes to the Long Term Incentive Plan 
During 2009, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the LTIP 
and identified the need to revise several aspects of the incentive 
arrangements to maintain their effectiveness.
At the annual general meeting in 2010, the Company proposes to  
put a number of changes to the LTIP to shareholders in relation  
to the following:
•  The introduction, for awards made from 2011, of dividend 
equivalents in respect of vested compulsory investment share, 
matching share and performance share awards to provide 
better alignment with shareholders, reflecting ABI guidelines.
•  The provisions relating to compulsory investment share awards 
made from 2011 will be changed to make them forfeitable only 
in the case of gross misconduct or a material misstatement  
of the Group’s financial results in respect of which the bonus 
was generated.
•  To increase the annual limit on the grant of performance share 
awards under the LTIP from 100% to 150% of salary and to 
increase the limit on grants in exceptional circumstances from 
150% to 200% of salary. This will allow the flexibility to increase 
award levels in future years should the commercial need arise 
but, as mentioned above, normal awards will not exceed 100% 
of salary in 2010.
Full details of these changes are contained in the notice to the 2010 
annual general meeting. 
The Committee has ensured that, in accordance with its policy, 
there continues to be a suitable degree of stretch within the LTIP.
Conditional share award 
In 2008, a one-off conditional award of 405,953 shares was 
made to Mark Selway, which has now lapsed. 
Pensions 
Alan Mitchelson is an active member of the Company’s 1972 
pension and life assurance plan. The plan is a contributory defined 
benefit plan with the active members contributing 8% of salary. 
The balance of the cost of the plan is met by the Company having 
taken account of the trustee’s opinion arrived at by considering 
the funding recommendations of the plan’s independent actuary. 
The plan targets a pension of two thirds of final salary payable 
at normal retirement date, providing a member then has at least 
24 years pensionable service. Where a member has less than 24 
years pensionable service to normal retirement date their pension 
currently accrues at 1/36th of final salary per annum. 
For members, salary (both for contributions and for plan benefits) is 
subject to a plan specific earnings cap. This is currently £123,600. 
The plan provides for a surviving spouse’s pension of one half  
of the member’s pension (before any exchange for cash) and,  
in certain circumstances, for a dependent child’s pension until  
the child attains the age of 23 years. 
Pension built up prior to April 2006 increases in payment by the 
annual increase in the retail prices index up to a maximum of 5%. 
For pension built up after April 2006, the annual increase is limited 
to a maximum of 2.5%. Deferred pensions are revalued between 
the date of exit and normal retirement date in line with statute.
The plan provides a lump sum death benefit of five times salary 
for Alan Mitchelson.
Keith Cochrane is responsible for his own pension arrangement and 
Jon Stanton will be responsible for his own pension arrangement. 
Remuneration
report (continued)  43
Chairman and non-executive directors 
The chairman and each of the non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment. The letters of appointment do not contain 
any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the 
directors can be removed in accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association. The chairman and all non-executive 
directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at least 
every three years, with the exception of any director whose 
appointment exceeds nine years, in which case there is a 
requirement for annual re-election.
The details of the letters of appointment in relation to the non-
executive directors who served during the year are:
Executive directors service contracts 
All the executive directors who served during the year have 
service contracts with the Company that provide for a minimum 
period of notice of six months by the individual and twelve months 
by the Company. In the event that the Company terminated an 
executive director’s service contract other than in accordance 
with its terms, the Remuneration Committee, when determining 
what compensation, if any, should properly be paid by the 
Company to the departing director, will give full consideration to 
the obligation of that director to mitigate any loss which he may 
suffer as a result of the termination of his contract. 
To recruit the best executives, the Remuneration Committee 
may in the future agree contractual notice periods which initially 
exceed twelve months, particularly as it is often necessary for 
executives to relocate their families.
The details of the service contracts in relation to the executive 
directors who served during the year are:
Executive directors external appointments 
The executive directors are permitted, with board agreement,  
to take up one non-executive appointment provided that there is 
no conflict of interest and that the time spent would not impinge 
on their work for the Group. It is the Company’s policy that 
remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by  
the individual executive director. During 2009, Mark Selway acted 
as a non-executive director of Lend Lease Corporation Limited, 
an Australian and New Zealand listed company. His remuneration 
in respect of this appointment was AUS$140,000.
Remuneration of the chairman and non-executive directors 
The remuneration of the chairman is agreed by the Board on 
the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. Fees 
for the non-executive directors are determined by the Board. 
In determining the fee levels, account is taken of the time 
commitment, scale of roles, market norms and comparison with 
companies of equivalent size based on information provided 
by Hewitt. Neither the chairman nor any of the non-executive 
directors participate in any of the Company’s incentive plans or 
receive pension or other benefits, except that the chairman is 
entitled to participate in the Group health care scheme and an 
additional allowance is made available to non-executive directors, 
where appropriate, to reflect the additional time commitment in 
attending intercontinental board meetings and operational visits. 
The chairman and the non-executive directors are not involved in 
any discussions or decisions about their own remuneration. 
The non-executive directors’ fees and chairman’s remuneration are 
reviewed annually by the Board but have not been increased since 
2007. With effect from 1 April 2010, the chairman’s remuneration 
will be increased from £175,000 to £182,500 and the basic fee for 
each of the non-executive directors will be increased from £40,000 
to £45,000. The additional fees paid to the deputy chairman and 
the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees remain 
unchanged. Michael Dearden, who became the senior non-
executive director on 1 November 2009, is receiving an additional 
fee of £2,500 for that role. 
Total shareholder return 
The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company 
against the FTSE 350 Industrial Engineering Sector Index and 
the Comparator Group used in the LTIP. The Board believes 
that both the FTSE Index and the Comparator Group represent 
an appropriate and fair benchmark upon which to measure the 
Group’s performance for this purpose.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This chart shows the value, as at 31 December 2009, of £100 invested in The Weir

Comparator Group. The other points are the values at the intervening financial year ends.

Directors pension benefits
#
 
Alan Mitchelson was a member of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year 2009. Keith Cochrane and Mark 
Selway were responsible for their own pension provisions. Pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values were as follows 
during the year:
Notes         
1. The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on normal retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the year.
2.  With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees (having taken actuarial advice) to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary 
transfer values to be paid from the plan. Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility. Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the year end has been calculated in 
accordance with this revised requirement.
3.    The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: 
a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension; 
b. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing; 
c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis – as referred to in 2. above; 
d. less the director’s ordinary contributions. 
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket 
movements; which will be reflected within c. above. The inflation measure for leavers during 2009 with at least one year to their normal retirement date was 0%, despite actual inflation being negative. 
Consequently, the rate of inflation assumed in the above figures is 0%.
4. The figures allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap. Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted (formerly known as unapproved) pension from the Group.  
5. Payment of actual transfer values (from the defined benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member) are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.  
6. The figures allow for the impact of inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.

Weir Oil & Gas UK helped 
raise money for charity 
through various activities 
including sponsoring a climb 
of Mount Kilimanjaro.
The Weir Group’s sustainability approach involves applying our core values – integrity, valuing people, 
innovation and collaboration – to the way we run our business. This means continuous progress in 
achieving the highest standards of safety; treating our employees, suppliers and the communities in 
which we work as long-term partners and considering the environmental impact of every aspect of 
what we do.
The areas highlighted in this report namely policy, the community in which we operate, our people, 
the environment and our supply chain reflect the priorities of the Group in 2009. In 2010, the Group 
is undertaking a review of our corporate responsibility and sustainability activities, the results of which 
will be reported through our website and in the 2010 annual report.
Corporate responsibility 
report
Corporate ethics policy 
The aim of this policy is to communicate to our 
customers, suppliers, investors, employees and the 
communities in which we operate, the ethical and 
social values we respect and our commitment to 
uphold human rights. By promoting sound ethical 
values and human rights principles, we aim to be  
an aspiring business for people to join. 
Human rights principles 
The Group is dedicated to the adoption of 
internationally recognised human rights standards 
in its global operations. The international sources 
of law upon which our human rights standards 
are based aim to ensure a consistent world-
wide adoption of the principles throughout the 
Group. Each operating entity may retain its own 
human rights policy or statement, provided such 
a document incorporates the principles of the 
Group’s policy and has received the prior approval 
of the chief executive. 
Anti discriminative attitudes and  
respect for ethical values 
All Weir employees should conduct themselves 
in accordance with the highest ethical standards. 
Our aim is to ensure that no discrimination is 
practiced within the Weir Group. We have adopted 
an “equality for all” policy to prevent discrimination 
in hiring, compensation, promotion, training, 
termination or retirement based on race, caste, 
colour, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, 
veterans status (United States), marital status, 
actual or perceived sexual orientation, employment 
status or political affiliation. In some countries 
this policy may be modified by national legal 
requirements on affirmative action. Our aim is to 
ensure that Weir employees are able to work in an 
environment free of physical, psychological or verbal 
abuse, the threat of abuse and sexual or other 
harassment and, accordingly, these are prohibited.
Group policies
The Group maintains 
a number of corporate 
responsibility policies 
which are reviewed 
regularly by the Board 
and are published on the 
Company’s website.  48 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report
In response to the devastating 
floods that hit North Karnataka 
in October 2009, Weir 
Minerals India, under its 
community support project, 
contributed towards the 
construction of pre-fabricated 
houses in Bagalkote, one of 
the worst hit districts. This 
was facilitated through the 
Government’s partnership 
programme with local 
companies and helped in  
the rehabilitation of around 
975 families.
Weir Minerals Peru, through 
its corporate responsibility 
programme, helped build a 
dining hall for local children 
aged between three and 
five years at Manchay. The 
company also donated office 
furniture and helped organise 
a Christmas party in Granja 
Villa where the children 
received donated toys.
In 2009, Weir Minerals 
Floway sponsored six 
students on a week long 
engineering camp run by the 
Lyles College of Engineering 
at California State University, 
Fresno, USA. The programme 
aims to educate girls aged 
15 to 18 on the benefits and 
varied aspects of a profession 
in engineering. A presentation 
was also given to students at 
the Floway facility.

Community
Community initiatives 
During the year, Group companies were involved 
in numerous community and social initiatives, 
many of which were nominated and driven by 
our employees. We also participate in a range of 
educational and training initiatives. Examples of 
these are shown in this report.
Charitable contributions 
The total charitable contributions of Group 
companies made during the year was £252,000 
(2008: £234,000), as shown below:

Managing safety 
Maintaining a consistently safe and healthy workplace 
for our people requires effective, proactive 
management. We operate a global network of 
Environmental, Health and Safety Forums that share 
knowledge and experience between plants with 
the aim of ensuring consistently high standards of 
safety across the Group and eliminating work-related 
injuries, preventing pollution, conserving resources, 
complying with regulatory requirements and 
improving performance.
All our operations have over the past year 
been working toward achieving OHSAS 18001 
(Occupational Health Safety Assessment Series) 
accreditation. To date, all our major sites have 
achieved this with the exception that our most recent 
acquisitions and some smaller businesses will not 
complete the process until 2010. OHSAS 18001 
was developed by the British Standards Institute as 
a health and safety management framework allowing 
organisations to ensure that they are consistently and 
accurately identifying hazards and risks within their 
organisation. Providing a platform for eliminating and 
managing these identified risks, the system supports 
the organisation to continually improve its products, 
people and processes. OHSAS 18001 offers a 
proactive approach to reducing accidents, near 
misses and other incidents year on year. 
The Group is committed to an accident free health 
and safety environment based on the belief that all 
accidents are preventable. The Group Executive 
Committee drives this commitment through 
operations globally. The businesses record all near 
misses and injuries within their operations and these 
are analysed on a continuous basis to reduce the 
number of lost time accidents through improvement 
of the working environment. 
The Group’s policy on health and safety requires 
that all our companies take a proactive responsible 
attitude to the protection of their employees’ 
health and safety. All companies carefully evaluate 
risks to personnel wherever they are working 
and take appropriate steps to minimise such 
risks. These include ensuring that project design 
engineers consider design factors that minimise 
or eliminate the risk of accidents to personnel 
during site installation and commissioning. All 
Group companies are required to comply with local 
legislation governing health and safety at work and 
to conduct regular formal health and safety reviews 
at plant and site level. These reviews are undertaken 
by nominated managers and employees to ensure 
that risks are properly evaluated, events leading to 
accidents are examined and appropriate remedial 
or avoidance action initiated and subsequently 
monitored. Formal reporting procedures have been 
implemented so that the safety performance of 
individual companies is monitored and peer-to-peer 
audits are conducted in order to provide a critical 
assessment of each company’s performance. 
The increased focus on this important issue 
includes full investigations of all accidents being 
carried out and reported at the Group Executive 
Committee meetings on a monthly basis.
Projects and activities 
The driving force behind our performance continues 
to be our emphasis on behaviour, networking and 
sharing best practice and the active involvement  
of senior management to promote and audit  
safety programmes. 
Our network safety committees 
focused on a number of activities this 
year, including:
—  Group-wide training and behavioural 
auditing
—  continued development of policies 
and procedures 
—  recognising and rewarding 
outstanding safety performance 
through award schemes
The core elements of our approach to safety are:
—  emphasis on the importance of behaviour by encouraging 
a culture of safety at all locations
 —  improving communications and sharing best practice 
throughout the Group
—  the active involvement of senior executives in  
promoting safety
—  the auditing of safety and loss control programmes 
People 50 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report
Employee development 
We recognise that people are vital to the success 
of our business. Training and development play a 
major part in improving businesses and retaining 
employees by developing the skills required 
for career advancement and business process 
improvements. Training and development is 
managed either on a Group or company basis. 
Group programmes include induction, high potential 
leadership and managing director development.
The induction training provides awareness training 
on the Group standard procedures and processes 
and senior managers attend one of these courses 
within a short period of joining the Group. The 
leadership courses are run for the Group’s current 
and future leaders.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The courses are aimed at developing existing and 
future managing directors and senior managers 
from across the Group to help them achieve their 
maximum potential. 
To ensure the development and advancement of 
our employees, the Weir Personal Development 
Profile analyses employee performance and enables 
employees to receive the most relevant and tailored 
training to match their specific skills and needs.
The principal aims of these courses are 
to provide:
— personal development
— exposure to different disciplines
— cultural integration
—  networking across all disciplines 
and operations
Weir Minerals Brasil is 
involved with a project which 
supports 190 children and 
teenagers who live in the

Throughout the year, talks 
were given to the children 
with the focus being on the 
importance of protecting  
the environment and

Overview 
All our locations fully integrate environmental 
management into their operational systems and 
procedures. The Group’s proactive approach 
ensures that these processes reduce our 
environmental impact year on year. Our three most 
significant environmental impacts are, in order of 
magnitude, energy use, water use and hazardous 
and non-hazardous solid waste production. 
Each company in the Group is required to 
continuously improve its environmental performance 
and management practices. During 2009, the 
Group has been making improvements to its 
data collection and has been working towards 
establishing targets for improvements in all areas 
of our environmental impact with a view to having 
these published in 2011. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental policy 
Maintenance of the Group’s environmental 
policy is the responsibility of the Group Executive 
Committee, while its implementation is the 
responsibility of the divisional managing directors. 
The Group policy is that all its operations will be ISO 
14001 accredited. ISO 14001 is an internationally 
recognised specification for an effective structured 
environmental management system which helps 
organisations achieve environmental and economic 
goals as well as assisting in the implementation 
of environmental policy. An ISO 14001 accredited 
environmental management system provides our 
customers, employees and shareholders with the 
assurance that our environmental performance 
meets and will continue to meet legal and 
environmental policy requirements. Through the 
Group Environmental, Health and Safety Forums, 
all new businesses are brought into line with best 
practice in the implementation of ISO 14001. 
In addition, the Forums are a useful arena to allow 
local and international environmental legislative 
developments to be monitored before they become 
law. This proactive approach allows us to conform 
with future environmental legislation before laws  
are passed by voluntarily taking action on  
specific issues. 
As part of our integrated commitment to ISO 14001 
accreditation, we have a rolling programme as part 
of our 100 day integration plan which we put in 
place in relation to any new business unit. During 
2009, Weir SPM, Weir Warman Africa and Weir 
Multiflo achieved ISO 14001 accreditation. It is 
expected that Weir SOS and Weir Mesa will achieve 
full compliance in 2010.
Environmental improvements 
As part of the Group’s commitment to continual 
improvement, during 2009 the Minerals Division 
established an Environmental Improvement 
Team whose objective is to share best practice 
in environmental management. The global team 
aims to implement and maintain three active 
environmental improvement projects at each 
participating site, adding new projects as each 
is completed. The regions represented by the 
team are Europe, North America, South America, 
Australia, Africa and China.
Initiatives to improve the environmental performance 
of our operations include energy and water 
efficiency, raw material efficiency, waste 
minimisation and resource recovery projects. 
In addition, many Weir companies collaborate with 
suppliers to address environmental considerations 
throughout the supply chain to our mutual benefit, 
particularly in areas such as raw materials, 
packaging and recycling.
We focus our improvement efforts on the areas that 
have the most environmental and financial impact.
The Group is committed to the protection of the environment 
in all the countries in which its companies operate. 
Each Weir company will comply with the relevant regulatory 
requirements applicable to its business. 
Each Weir company will ensure that it acts as a good citizen 
in the community in which it operates and adopt practices 
aimed at minimising the environmental impact  
of its operations.

Weir Minerals Australia 
worked together with the 
local Community Environment 
Network in 2009 to gain a 
grant from the National Parks 
and Wildlife Service for the 
regeneration of the creek 
area surrounding its facility in 
Somersby. The grant was to 
preserve the creek's wildlife 
corridor which contains both 
endangered flora and fauna. 
In addition, educational 
programmes were provided 
for employees and the  
local community.
In the area of recycling, examples of improvements that our operations have been working on in 2009 include: 
Peru  Weir Minerals extended its existing wood recycling programme to include used plastics, which are 
donated to a charity (Fundades), who in turn sell it to pay for scholarships for local children.
Chile The foundry at Weir Minerals uses only scrap metal recovered from local manufacturers and  
 metal shops and metal from scrap components bought back from local mines after their usage  
 is complete.
US  Weir Lewis introduced a Single Stream Recycling programme throughout the facility.
 Weir Minerals North America installed a 10,000 gallon reserve tank in the test lab to recycle  
 water instead of having to use fresh water.
UK  Improvements at Power & Industrial UK have focused on: 
 •  The installation of a mechanical reclamation unit introduced to recycle blast grit.
 •  The general improvement on segregation of waste for recycling across the division. 
 • The recycling of aluminium drinks cans, paper and plastic at several sites.
 •  Encouraging all centres to use second hand pallets.
  At Oil & Gas UK, packaging within their facility is monitored on a monthly basis and recorded 
as part of their environmental improvement plan. The business is targeting a 5% reduction in 
waste going to landfill by the end of 2010. They have also introduced initiatives including use of 
a third party recycling company and installing metal scrap collecting hoppers and waste bins 
to maximise metal scrap coming out of the machine shop for onward recycling. In addition, a 
waste oil recycling system was built within the facility, equipment wash-down and hydro test 
water is recycled and colour coded bins and skips are used for recycling.
Australia  In 2009, Weir Minerals has more than doubled the percentage of waste recycled on site. 
Improvements include recycling of timber waste for landscape mulch, capture of swarf from 
the machine shop and recovery of metal waste for re-use in the foundry. A major project is 
underway to improve the recycling of used foundry sand in construction products.

Research and development has a vital role to 
play in meeting our corporate responsibilities. 
The development of new products that are more 
environmentally benign in both manufacture and 
operation and the substitution of harmful materials 
offer competitive advantage to ourselves and to  
our customers.
We recognise that many of our products are 
themselves contributors to environmental protection 
in critical areas such as power generation, nuclear 
handling and subsea oil and gas exploration. We 
continue to invest in research and development  
to improve their performance.
2010 will see ongoing investment in design, 
research and development in which our corporate 
responsibility and business objectives are  
closely aligned.
The Weir Group sources components, materials and 
services on a world-wide basis. Our suppliers are an 
integral part of the Group’s business. Relationships 
with all suppliers are built on total quality practices 
and principles to achieve best performance, 
product, delivery, service and total cost. 
We recognise that our supply chain activities have 
a broad impact and that our responsibilities extend 
beyond our own operations and into those of our 
suppliers. The Group has, therefore, adopted a 
Supply Chain Policy to ensure that suppliers to the 
Group comply with or exceed certain standards in 
connection with their workforce, legal compliance, 
health and safety, business ethics and environmental 
standards. Our key supplier partners are expected to 
either have accreditation to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 
14001 or be able to demonstrate a plan to achieve  
it within a reasonable amount of time.
We recognise that our corporate responsibility also 
reflects the way we behave towards our suppliers. 
The Group does not operate a standard policy in 
respect of payments to suppliers and each operating 
company is responsible for agreeing the terms and 
conditions under which business transactions are 
conducted, including the terms of payment. 
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with the agreed terms. At 
1 January 2010, the Group had an average of 71 
days purchases outstanding in trade creditors.

The sulphur pumps produced by Weir Minerals Lewis 
Pumps in Missouri, USA, are used in various industrial 
and manufacturing processes to reduce pollution. For 
instance, Lewis molten sulphur and sulphuric acid pumps 
are part of two types of acid production. Both of these 
reduce pollution: sulphur burning specifically to make acid, 
which does not involve burning carbon and therefore no 
carbon dioxide is produced and acid made from sulphur 
dioxide produced as a byproduct of smelting sulfide ores. 
Sulphur pumps are also used in removing sulphur from 
petroleum in refineries, which helps reduce atmospheric  
sulphur dioxide.
Weir Minerals Hazleton in Pennsylvania, USA, 
participates in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) 
run by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) of the United States Department of Labor. VPP 
sites are audited on a regular basis on specific safety and 
health criteria above and beyond standard regulation. 
Employees from Weir Minerals Hazleton are certified to 
this standard.
The OSHA also runs a mentoring programme in which 
current VPP sites can mentor potential VPP sites to 
improve their safety and health management systems. 
Weir Minerals Hazleton is involved in this process and is 
currently mentoring a local supplier to prepare them for 
their first audit. This has involved site visits and sharing 
best practice.  54 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report

Substantial shareholders 
At 9 March 2010, the Company had been notified in accordance 
with the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules that the following held, or were beneficially interested in, 3% 
or more of the Company’s issued share capital:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the date of disclosure to the Company, the interest of any 
shareholder listed above may have increased or decreased. No 
requirement to notify the Company of any increase or decrease 
would have arisen unless the holding moved up or down through 
a whole number percentage level. The percentage level may 
increase (if the Company cancelled shares pursuant to the power 
to purchase its own shares) or decrease (on the issue of new 
shares under the LTIP).
Material contracts 
There are no persons with whom the Company has contractual 
or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the 
Company. 
Research and development 
During the year, the Group spent £9.7m (2008: £9.8m) on research 
and development. The expenditure reflects the Group’s continued 
commitment to investment in research and development, applied 
to both the development of new leading edge materials 
technologies and existing product innovation. The Group’s 
worldwide pump technology centres focus on developing 
engineering process improvements through the use of a variety  
of analytical tools to design products with optimal wear life and 
improved safety and efficiency. This maintains the Group’s 
competitive advantage in the market and controls costs whilst 
improving quality.
Employment policy and involvement 
The average number of employees in the Group during the year  
is given in note 4 to the Group financial statements on page 73.
Group companies operate within a framework of HR policies, 
practices and regulations appropriate to their market sector and 
country of operation. Policies and procedures for recruitment, 
training and career development promote equality of opportunity 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status,

The aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees have the 
opportunity to develop fully according to their individual abilities 
and the needs of the Group. The Group remains committed to 
the fair treatment of people with disabilities regarding applications, 
training, promotion and career development.
Employee involvement and feedback is actively encouraged. 
A variety of ways are used to consult and inform employees 
including a Group-wide bulletin, e-mail, intranet and local 
briefings. These are designed to facilitate dialogue while enabling 
the development of a common awareness among employees of 
what affects business performance.
Financial instruments 
The information required in respect of financial instruments 
as required by Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 is given in note 2 to the Group financial statements  
on page 67.
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. In forming this view, the directors have 
reviewed the Group’s budgets, plans and cash flow forecasts, 
including market downturn sensitivities. In addition, the directors 
have considered the potential impact of credit risk and liquidity 
risk detailed in the review of the principal risks and uncertainties 
on pages 30 to 32 and in note 30 to the Group financial 
statements on pages 100 to 108. Each of these items has been 
considered in relation to the Group’s banking facilities described  
on page 26 of the Financial review. 
Audit and auditors 
So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined by section 481 of the Companies Act 
2006) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each of the directors has taken all of the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information (as defined) and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. 
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s 
auditors will be put to the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the Company’s shares 
Details of the issued share capital of the Company, which 
comprises a single class of shares, ordinary shares of 12.5p each, 
are set out in note 25 to the Group financial statements on page 
95. The rights attaching to the shares are set out in the articles 
of association. There are no special control rights in relation to 
the Company’s shares and the Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.

ordinary shares to employees to satisfy the LTIP awards using 
ordinary shares purchased by the EBT in the market. A further 
2,047 ordinary shares were transferred out of treasury to satisfy 
an award under the LTIP. In addition, a total of 126,902 ordinary 
shares, with an aggregate value of £18,204 were allotted during 
the period in connection with the Company’s sharesave scheme 
and the LTIP. The sharesave scheme is now closed.
The EBT has agreed to waive any right to all dividend payments 
on shares held by it. Details of the shares held by Kleinwort 
Benson are set out in note 25 to the Group financial statements 
on page 95. The EBT holds, through its designated ESOP 
account nominee K.B (CI) Nominees Limited, 0.07% of the issued 
share capital of the Company, as at 1 January 2010, in trust for 
the benefit of certain executive directors and senior executives 
of the Group. The voting rights in relation to these shares are 
exercised by the trustee. The EBT may vote or abstain from 
voting the shares or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, 
in any way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without 
being required to give reasons for its decision.
Repurchase of shares 
At the 2009 annual general meeting, shareholders renewed the 
Company’s authority to make market purchases of up to 20.9m 
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the issued share capital 
excluding treasury shares). No shares were purchased under  
this authority during the 53 weeks to 1 January 2010 and,  
at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the Board will  
again seek shareholder approval to renew the annual authority  
for the Company to make market purchases. 
Voting rights 
The Company’s articles of association provide that on a show 
of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of 
ordinary shares present in person and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote and on a poll, every member present in person or by 
proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary 
share held. The notice of the annual general meeting specifies 
deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy 
or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the 
annual general meeting. The Company conducts the vote at the 
annual general meeting by electronic poll. All proxy votes are 
counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to 
each resolution are announced at the annual general meeting  
and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
The articles of association may only be amended by a Special 
Resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders. 56 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report
Transfer of shares 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company, other than as contained in the articles of association:
•  The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason for it, refuse to register any transfer of any certificated 
share which is not fully paid up (but not so as to prevent dealings 
in listed shares from taking place) and on which the Company 
has a lien as a result of such share not being fully paid up.
•  The Board may also refuse to register any instrument of transfer 
of a certificated share unless it is lodged at the registered office, 
or such other place as the Board may decide, for registration, 
accompanied by a certificate for the shares to be transferred 
and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require 
to prove title of the intending transferor. 
Certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations, for example, insider trading laws, in relation to 
the transfer of shares.
Appointment and replacement of directors 
The provisions about the appointment and re-election of directors 
of the Company are contained in the articles of association. 
Powers of directors 
The business of the Company is managed by the Board who may 
exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the provisions 
of the Company’s articles of association, any ordinary resolution 
of the Company and any relevant legislation.
Change of control – significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to require prior approval, exercise termination, 
alteration or similar rights in the event of a change of control of 
the Company. 
The Company is party to nine bilateral credit agreements for a 
total of £625m with various financial institutions expiring between 
30 July 2011 and 1 September 2011. Under the terms of these 
agreements, if there is a change of control of the Company 
any lender may request, by not less than 30 days’ notice to the 
Company, that its commitment be cancelled and all outstanding 
amounts be repaid to that lender at the expiry of such notice period.
On 11 January 2010, the Company entered into various note 
purchase agreements to issue an equivalent of US$250m five 
year and eight year fixed rate notes in a combination of US 
dollar and sterling at an average US dollar equivalent interest 
rate of 4.8% due 11 January 2015 and 11 January 2018. Under 
the terms of the agreements, if there is a change of control of 
the Company, the notes must be offered for prepayment by 
the Company within seven days of the change of control. The 
prepayment date would be no later than 60 days after the offer  
of prepayment by the Company.
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Directors statement of responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
•  state that the Group financial statements have complied 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures being disclosed and explained; and 
•  state for the Company financial statements whether the 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures being disclosed  
and explained.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Each of the directors, as at the date of this report, confirms to  
the best of his knowledge that:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group; and 
•  the Directors report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

Independent auditors report to the members of The Weir Group PLC 
We have audited the Group financial statements of The Weir Group PLC for the 53 
weeks ended 1 January 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 32. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors & auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors statement of responsibilities set out 
on page 56, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•   give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 1 January 2010 
and of its profit for the 53 weeks then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors report for the financial year for 
which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•   we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•   the directors statement, set out on page 55, in relation to going concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate governance report relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of The Weir 
Group PLC for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 and on the information in the 
Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the  
Group Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 (“2009”) 
were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 9 March 2010. The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 
26 December 2008 (“2008”). In addition, certain comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 (“2007”) as detailed below. For practical 
reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December. The results on this basis are unlikely to 
be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year. The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in sterling. All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds (£m) except when otherwise indicated. 
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Group’s underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been 
analysed between:
i)  profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation; and 
ii)  the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
  a)   Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation 
to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Group’s financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate 
comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
  b)  Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on  
intangible assets. 
Further analysis of the items included in the column “Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation” is provided in note 5 to the financial statements. 
While updating the valuation of the Group’s retirement benefit plans for the purposes of the Group’s 2009 interim condensed financial statements, the qualified actuary who 
advises the Company identified an error in their model used to calculate the actuarial valuation of the Group’s UK retirement benefit plans for the periods ended 28 December 
2007 and 26 December 2008. 
The impact of this was to understate the retirement benefit plan deficits on a cumulative basis by £8.1m at 28 December 2007 and £15.2m at 26 December 2008. There was 
also a corresponding overstatement of net deferred tax liabilities of £2.3m and £4.3m at those respective period ends.
The impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was to increase actuarial losses on defined benefit plans by £7.1m and to decrease tax on items taken 
directly to equity by £2.0m in the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008. 
There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement. The net impact was to overstate Group net assets by £5.8m and £10.9m at 28 December 2007 
and 26 December 2008 respectively. All affected balances and amounts have been restated in these financial statements. To this effect, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and affected notes present restated comparative information for the 52 
weeks ended 26 December 2008. In addition, as required by IAS1, the Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes also present restated comparative information for the 
52 weeks ended 28 December 2007.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except as described below. 
IFRS7 (Amendment) Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Improving Disclosure about Financial Instruments: The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair 
value measurement in the form of a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value. The amendments also clarify the requirements 
for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management. As permitted by the amended standard, comparative information 
for the disclosures required by the amendments has not been provided in this first year of implementation. The amended disclosures are presented in note 30. 
IFRS8 Operating Segments: In adopting IFRS8 the Group concluded that the operating segments were the same as the business segments determined under IAS14 
“Segment Reporting”. Details of these operating segments are disclosed in note 3, including the new disclosure requirements of IFRS8 and the related revised  
comparative information. 
IAS1 (revised) Presentation of Financial Statements: The adoption of IAS1 (revised) has required the reconciliation of movements in equity, previously disclosed in note 25 to 
the Group’s 2008 annual report, to be presented as a primary statement entitled, “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity”. In addition the Consolidated Statement  
of Recognised Income & Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition to some presentational changes this  
has resulted in a tax charge of £1.0m in relation to the cost of share-based payments for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 being reclassified from the former 
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income & Expense to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
IAS23 (revised) Borrowing Costs: In adopting IAS23 (revised) the Group has amended its accounting policy and, from 1 January 2009, now capitalises borrowing costs  
on qualifying assets. The implementation of this policy has had no material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 64 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
In addition to the above, the following standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements and have not had a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements in the period of initial application. 
IFRS2 (Amendment) Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
IAS32 (Amendment) Financial Instruments: Presentation: Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
IFRIC14 IAS19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction
Improvements to IFRS
In May 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and 
to clarify wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group. Some of the key amendments and their impact are detailed below.
IFRS8 Operating Segments: clarifies that segment assets and liabilities need only be reported when those assets and liabilities are included in measures that are used by the  
chief operating decision maker. On the basis that the chief operating decision maker reviews segment assets and liabilities the Group discloses this information in note 3.
IAS7 Statement of Cash Flows: explicitly states that only expenditure that results in recognising an asset can be classified as a cash flow from investing activities.  
This amendment will impact the presentation in the cash flow statement of the contingent consideration upon cash settlement in relation to the acquisition of Weir SOS  
which was completed in 2008 (note 13).
IAS36 Impairment of Assets: when discounted cash flows are used to estimate “fair value less costs to sell” additional disclosure is required about the discount rate, 
consistent with disclosures required when the discounted cash flows are used to estimate “value in use”. This amendment has no impact on the Group because the 
recoverable amount of its cash generating units is estimated using “value in use”. The amendment also clarified that the largest unit permitted for allocating goodwill  
acquired in a business combination is the operating segment as defined in IFRS8 before aggregation for reporting purposes. This amendment has no impact on the Group  
as the annual impairment test is performed before aggregation.
The Group has also adopted the following standards which have been issued with an effective date after the date of these financial statements. 
IAS27 (Amendment) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: The adoption of this standard has resulted in the separate disclosure of each item of other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In addition, minority interests are now referred to as “non-controlling interests”. 
IFRS3 (revised) Business Combinations: IFRS3 (revised) is applied to business combinations arising from 27 December 2008. This requires recognition of subsequent 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill. In addition, transaction costs are required to be recognised 
immediately in the income statement. As there have been no business combinations in the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 the adoption of this standard has had no  
impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.
Use of estimates & judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised  
and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial review on page 27.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Group’s share of its joint 
ventures results. The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so 
as to obtain benefit from its activities. The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Group’s results from the effective date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Group’s results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of 
the Group. All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Notes to the
Group Financial Statements  
(continued) 65
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Joint ventures
The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures. These all take the form of agreements to share control  
over other entities (“jointly controlled entities”). The Group’s interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the  
equity method. 
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in value. The income 
statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investee’s equity, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share of the net fair value of the joint 
venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value 
of the joint venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of 
the joint venture’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency. The functional currency is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which an entity operates. 
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are 
recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’s net investment 
in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a 
foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the 
cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation. As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation 
differences to be £nil as at 27 December 2003. Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising  
before 27 December 2003. 
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods,  
and can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred. The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the 
proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of  
the contract work. The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work  
is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures. Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable. 
Property, plant & equipment 
The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to £10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of  
the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets 
for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009. Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately. 
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost  
less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the 
following ranges: 
Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years 
Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease 
Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years  66 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Investment property
The Group has one property which is currently being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services 
and as such this property is classified as investment property. Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over 40 years. 
Goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the entity’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any  
recognised impairment losses. 
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately  
as a gain in the income statement. 
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated  
to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit. Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP  
is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible 
asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset  
represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is  
tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation is provided on a  
straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Brand names - indefinite life
Customer relationships -  7 - 25 years
Purchased software - 4 - 8 years
Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years
Other  - up to 6 years
Research & development costs 
All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after 
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and 
the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible 
assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Similarly, the recoverable amount  
of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Notes to the
Group Financial Statements  
(continued) 67
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items. Cost represents the expenditure incurred in 
bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. 
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. 
Financial assets & liabilities
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits.  
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Trade & other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is 
assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three 
months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities  
to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount. 
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable 
transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate 
movements. The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Additionally,  
the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps and 
cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. Changes in their 
fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met. Hedge accounting  
is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging 
relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair 
value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset 
by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial 
statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results  
in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.  68 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related 
to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect 
of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which 
the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or 
performance conditions. 
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 
and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company and the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received 
for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.  
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits 
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees throughout the world and other benefits, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to 
certain employees in the United States. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating 
employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and 
the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability 
or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate  
high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance  
sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which  
the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. 
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Group’s contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. 
Leases 
Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified  
as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases. Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar 
owned assets or the lease term if shorter. At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element 
is applied to reduce the outstanding liability. 
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Taxation 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period. 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions:
i)    Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction,  
 affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised;
ii)    Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future;
iii)   A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Notes to the
Group Financial Statements  
(continued) 69
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods 
in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits. Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the  
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.

3. Segment information        
For management purposes the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial. These three divisions are organised and 
managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment in accordance with IFRS8. The operating  
and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Group Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment for the mining, flue gas desulphurisation and oil  
sands markets. The Oil & Gas segment manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and  
gas markets. The Power & Industrial segment designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and flow control equipment to the global power 
generation and industrial sectors.
All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liquefied petroleum gas marine 
and onshore markets. In 2008, it also included the results of the Canadian distribution business and the Materials and Foundries businesses up to the dates of disposal on 
29 August, 2 and 3 October 2008 respectively. None of the businesses disposed of were of a sufficient size to meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS5.
The Group Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation, including impairment (“segment result”). Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are 
not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. The amounts provided to the Group Executive with respect to assets 
and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements. The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical 
location of the asset. The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment. 
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 70 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

8. Discontinued operations
During the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 there were no disposals of businesses which were of a sufficient size to meet the definition of a discontinued operation  
under IFRS5.   
On 21 April 2008, the Group disposed of Weir Strachan & Henshaw for a net cash consideration of £63.7m resulting in a gain on disposal of £55.1m after a tax charge of 
£2.4m. The net liabilities disposed of amounted to £1.9m and direct disposal costs and provisions amounted to £8.5m. Foreign exchange gains suspended in equity on  
the retranslation of the overseas operations disposed of, amounting to £0.4m, were recycled to the income statement as part of the gain on sale in accordance with IAS21.  
In 2009, following the expiry of certain warranty periods, an unutilised amount of £5.2m has been released to the income statement.
In 2008, profits recognised in respect of prior periods disposals related to the negotiated settlement of claims.

9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company  
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and other share awards).
The following reflects the profit and share data used in the calculation of earnings per share.

13. Business combinations
There were no business combinations during the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010.  
On 18 March 2008, following receipt of regulatory clearance from the South African competition authorities, the Group acquired 100% of the CH Warman Pump Group  
(“Weir Warman”), a specialist pump business primarily focused on serving the mining and minerals processing industry throughout Africa. The total cash consideration was 
£113.8m. On 24 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of Mesa Manufacturing Inc. (“Weir Mesa”), a family owned business based in Texas specialising in the manufacture of 
cementing pumps and other products for the oil and gas drilling and well service industries. The total cash consideration was £23.1m. On 4 July 2008, the Group acquired 
75%  of the share capital of Standard Oilfield Services Limited (“Weir SOS”), a privately owned oil equipment services business registered in the Bahamas, based in Baku, 
Azerbaijan, with an obligation to acquire the remaining 25% within the next three years. The total cash consideration payable was £10.9m, including deferred consideration  
of £2.7m in relation to the remaining 25%. In accordance with IFRS3, the acquisition has been accounted for on the basis that a 100% interest has been acquired with no 
non-controlling interest.         
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the relevant dates of acquisition are as follows.

On 13 February 2008, the Group acquired the remaining 26% of Weir Engineering Services (India) Limited for a cash consideration of £0.6m. 
From the date of acquisition Weir Warman, Weir Mesa and Weir SOS contributed £4.8m, £0.6m and £1.4m respectively to the 2008 profit for the period from continuing 
operations of the Group. The combined continuing operations revenue and profit of the Group, assuming that Weir Warman, Weir Mesa and Weir SOS had been acquired  
at the start of 2008, would have been £1,371.7m and £116.2m respectively.        
Included in the £54.6m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to  
their nature. These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.         84 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements
14. Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives has been allocated as per the table below.  
The amounts allocated as “Other” are not considered significant in comparison to their respective total carrying amounts.

Discount rate        
The discount rates presented above reflect the pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in the most appropriate geographic region. The WACC is the 
weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance. In the main there has been an increase in the WACC relative to 2008 largely due  
to an increase in government bond yields partially offset by a reduction in lending margins that banks place on borrowing costs. The WACC in relation to Weir Gabbioneta 
has decreased relative to 2008 as Italian government bond yields have remained broadly in line with 2008 while bank lending margins have reduced.  
2 
Real growth        
Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2% to 4.0% reflects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion 
of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 
EBIT margins
EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes  
and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.

Weir SPM 
Weir SPM is a supplier of gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry. A large proportion of the   
business’s revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon  
natural gas prices and gas storage levels. Independent forecasts of North American gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast natural gas prices and gas  
storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009. 
5 
Warman companies 
The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets outside Africa. The key drivers for revenues are (i) levels of mining  capital 
expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service. Independent forecasts of 
mining activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009.

Weir Gabbioneta 
Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries. The key drivers for revenues 
are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries. Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth 
assumptions.  These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009.
7 
Weir Warman 
Weir Warman is a supplier of pumps and associated equipment and services to the African mining industry. The key drivers for revenues are (i) levels of mining capital 
expenditure across Africa which drives demand for original equipment and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service. Independent  
forecasts of mining activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2009.
Sensitivity analysis 
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact  
of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions. There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

During 2008, the Group entered into a series of bilateral facilities with nine banks totalling £625.0m. As at 1 January 2010, £173.1m (2008: £241.8m) was drawn under  
these bilateral facilities. In 2008, the Group also had a CAD$90.0m facility and a £20.0m multi-currency facility both of which matured in 2009. In 2009, the Group entered 
into a new Indian rupee 79.0m (£1.0m) term loan. As at 1 January 2010, £0.9m was outstanding on the term loan. 
In 2008, the Group entered into a series of interest rate swaps to fix the rate of interest that it would pay on US$200.0m variable rate borrowings. During 2009, this was 
reduced to US$50.0m. The interest rate swaps fixed the whole term of interest at a weighted average of 3.26% (2008: 3.43%) plus the applicable margin for this element  
of the Group’s debt.         
Events after the balance sheet date
On 11 January 2010, the Group issued the equivalent of US$250.0m of five year (US$110.0m) and eight year (US$140.0m) fixed rate notes. Resulting from this, the Group 
repaid US$145.0m and CAD$110.0m of its variable rate borrowings.

Warranties        
Provision has been made in respect of actual warranty and contract penalty claims on goods sold and services provided and allowance has been made for potential warranty 
claims based on past experience for goods and services sold with a warranty guarantee. It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five 
years of the balance sheet date.  
Employee related        
Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on management’s best estimate of the likely costs. It is expected that the costs 
will be incurred in the period up to 2021.
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share sale agreements. Following the expiry of 
certain  warranty periods, an unutilised amount of £5.2m has been released to the income statement. The provision as at 1 January 2010 is based on management’s current 
best estimate of the remaining liabilities. The actual outcome may differ and, in some cases, this may be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings. It is expected that 
the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance  
sheet date. 
Onerous sales contracts 
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts. Provision is made immediately  when it becomes apparent that 
expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract. It is expected that the costs will be incurred within one  year of the balance sheet date.
Other 
Other provisions relate to an environmental clean up programme in the United States for a company acquired in 1992 and various other legal claims and exposures across 
the Group.  The environmental provision is based on management’s current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme. It is expected that these costs will  
be incurred in the period up to 2019.       90 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

Untaxed reserves primarily relate to temporarily disallowed inventory / debtor provisions and accruals / provisions for liabilities where the tax allowance is deferred until the 
cash expense occurs.         
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of £4.8m (2008: £5.1m; 2007: £8.2m) and deductible temporary differences of £3.6m (2008: £4.7m; 2007: 4.0m) have not 
been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient 
to absorb these tax benefits. Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to £12.0m (2008: £10.9m; 2007: £16.1m) have not been recognised but 
would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.       
Temporary differences associated with Group investments        
A deferred tax liability of £18.9m (2008: £8.6m; 2007: £9.1m) has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian  
subsidiaries. As at 1 January 2010, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution 
of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax. The temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £762.1m (2008: £758.4m; 2007: £465.8m).
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

24. Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has five defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America. All defined benefit plans are closed to new members. The most significant of the defined 
benefit plans are the two UK plans. Contribution salary in respect of the Group’s main UK plan is capped and will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per 
annum. The wind up of the Canadian plan was completed in 2009 and the United States plans are frozen. The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement 
healthcare benefits to senior employees in the United States. These benefits are unfunded. The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.

*The curtailment gain of £1.5m in respect of the North American pensions & post-retirement healthcare relates to the freezing of benefits in the Atwood & Morrill Salaried 
Employee plan. The settlement gain of £0.7m relates to the wind up of the Canadian plan (2008: £2.5m curtailment loss was recognised in relation to the wind up of the 
Canadian plan and £0.1m curtailment gain was recognised in relation to post-retirement healthcare). The £1.5m settlement gain in respect of UK pensions relates to an 
enhanced transfer exercise completed in 2009 for deferred members of the main UK plan.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method. The Group made 
contributions of £11.1m in 2009 (2008: £6.5m; 2007: £6.5m) in addition to the employers regular contributions, of which £1.8m related to the wind up of the Canadian plan. 
The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2010 are expected to be £12.1m. Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates 
and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.

The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity (in years) 
following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to an employee retiring in 2039 (in 30 years time).
The assumed investment return and discount rate have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2010.  
The effect of a one percentage point change in those assumptions is set out in the table below.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income since 28 December 2003 is a loss of £46.6m (2008: a gain of £11.1m; 2007: 
a gain of £73.1m). 
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans. 
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised on an IFRS basis in other comprehensive 
income before 27 December 2003.

Legal claims        
The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. 
In 2004, an announcement was made to the London Stock Exchange in connection with the Group’s involvement in the UN sanctioned Oil for Food Programme. The Group 
continues to co-operate fully with the on-going investigations by UK authorities in this connection. In addition, the Company is subject to a claim relating to an action for 
damages arising from the UN Oil for Food Programme which has been raised in the United States against just under 100 companies. This action will be robustly defended. 
To the extent not already provided for, the directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a 
material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.

LTIP
There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares. Details of each award 
are outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 40 to 46.         
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average share prices (WASP) of shares awarded under the LTIP.

An amount of £2.4m (2008: £2.0m) has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the number of awards which are expected to be made at the  
end of the vesting period. This comprises an amount of £1.4m (2008: £1.4m) in respect of parent company employees and £1.0m (2008: £0.6m) in respect of employees  
of subsidiaries. Subsidiary companies made a cash contribution to the parent company of £1.1m (2008: £0.9m) in the period in respect of their LTIP awards.

Conditional share award        
In 2008, the shareholders approved a one-off conditional award of 405,953 shares at a market price of 900.5p to Mark Selway, the previous chief executive, which would 
have vested on 8 May 2011 subject to specified performance conditions being achieved. In 2009, the conditional share award was forfeited as the vesting conditions of 
the award were not satisfied. As a result, a credit of £0.8m (2008: a charge of £0.8m) has been recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the forfeited 
conditional share award. The number of shares outstanding at 1 January 2010 is nil (2008: 405,953).

Share option scheme        
The Company operated a savings related share option scheme in the UK which was not subject to performance criteria. This scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004 
and the last date for exercising options under the scheme was 1 January 2009.        
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of share options.

The weighted average share price during the period was 543.2p (2008: 708.4p). There were no share options outstanding at 1 January 2010. 
Fair value of equity settled share-based payments        
The fair value of the conditional awards under the LTIP and the conditional share award have been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table 
gives the assumptions made during the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010 and the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the   
assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Market related performance conditions have  
been taken into account in the calculation of fair values.

30. Financial assets & liabilities
Financial risk management objectives & policies 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk. Details of these risks are set out in the Directors 
report. In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings. The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial 
instruments, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy
In respect of transactional foreign exchange risk the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually 
by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Group treasury function. In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant 
concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified also apply hedge accounting. Therefore, some of the Group’s forward foreign currency contracts form part of 
an effective cash flow hedge. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will have an impact 
on shareholders equity. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss. It is Group policy not to 
engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar (“US$”) net assets exposure. This is achieved through designating an element  
of US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Group’s US dollar investments. The Group  
does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes. Further  
details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20.
Credit risk policy
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers with no significant concentration of risk. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken before entering 
into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate. As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance 
for doubtful debts. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the 
recoverability of cash flows. The Group’s exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits and by only trading with 
counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy
The Group’s borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest. Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate 
borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term. Interest rate swaps are utilised that have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to 
fixed rates. At 1 January 2010, 18% (2008: 47%) of the Group’s debt was at fixed rates of interest through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps. On 11 January 
2010, the Group issued the equivalent of US$250.0m of five year (US$110.0m) and eight year (US$140.0m) fixed rate notes. This will increase the proportion of fixed rate 
borrowings from the level as at 1 January 2010.

Net investment in foreign operations
As at 1 January 2010, US dollar variable rate loans included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, amounting to US$175.0m (2008: US$190.0m), cross currency swaps 
of US$324.0m (2008: US$404.0m) and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$90.0m (2008: assets of US$6.0m) have been designated as a hedge of the 
Group’s exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM and Weir Warman. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the 
fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in 
these subsidiaries.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The derivative financial 
instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves. The fair value  
of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign 
exchange rates. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward  
foreign exchange rates. 
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value. This requires disclosure 
of fair value measurements in the form of a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value. The Group uses the following 
hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
   Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. 
At 1 January 2010, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement. During the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2010, there were no transfers between  
level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements.    
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities 
of these instruments. The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt 
on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.           102 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

Liquidity & credit risk 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments. The 
liabilities which could impact liquidity risk are best represented by the carrying value and maturity profile of each financial liability, including derivative financial instruments. The 
following tables include the undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to receive or pay these 
financial assets or liabilities and include both interest and principal cash flows. In respect of derivative financial instruments, the net credit/ liquidity risk is best represented by 
the net inflows (outflows) shown below together with the Group’s headroom under the borrowing facilities as disclosed in note 20. On 11 January 2010, the Group issued 
US$250.0m fixed rate notes with maturities of five and eight years significantly increasing the maturity profile of borrowings.

to interest rate risk.  106 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax and 
equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. There is no impact on the Group’s equity, with the exception of the 
Group’s interest rate swaps.

Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments. 
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments. Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge 
accounting to these transactions. Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the period. In addition, as noted above, the Group 
utilises interest rate swaps to convert borrowings from floating to fixed rates of interest. These interest rate swaps are subject to cash flow hedge accounting. All other 
forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised  
in the income statement.

The £0.9m gain (2008: £5.4m) recognised in profit or loss in respect of cross currency swaps designated as net investment hedges reflects the benefit of US dollar / sterling 
interest rate differential. The Group’s forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash flow hedge accounting which were deemed to be ineffective during the period 
resulted in a net charge to the income statement of £nil (2008: £1.2m). A portion of the Group’s interest rate swaps subject to cash flow hedge accounting were deemed  
to be ineffective during the period as a result of a forecast repayment of variable rate debt. This resulted in a net charge to the income statement of £3.7m (2008: £nil). 108 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

Foreign exchange risk 
The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risks relate to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and United States dollar. The following table demonstrates 
the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on 
profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts 
but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of 
financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings 
and cross currency swaps. The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the year end for a 25% strengthening of sterling 
against the relevant exchange rates.

31. Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.  
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may  
adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio 
Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 26).

Notes to the  
Company Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation 
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Company’s functional currency  
at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on  
the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets 
Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for office equipment and 25% for 
computer equipment.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred  
at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences  
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and  
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benefits 
The Company and other UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts. These plans are 
operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS17, the Company 
accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are defined contribution plans. 
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises. Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualified actuary. Pension plan 
liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the 
liability. Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Company’s unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period 
is charged against operating profit. The increase in the period in the present value of the plan’s liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. 
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Company recognises a compensation cost in 
respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions 
on which the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions 
or performance conditions. 
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 
and were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Financial assets & liabilities
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised 
in profit or loss. 113
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements. Additionally, 
the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps  
and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. Changes  
in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS26 are met.  
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS26 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used,  
the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as a cash flow hedge. 
To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account. 
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account 
or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments  
as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS7.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale  
of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No gain or  
loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
2. Profit attributable to the Company
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £20.7m (2008: £24.4m). In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.

Subsidiaries        
As at 1 January 2010, a provision of £6.2m (2008: £2.0m) has been made against the deficiency of underlying net assets in certain subsidiaries. It is expected that this 
amount will be settled within one year of the balance sheet date.        
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity        
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share agreements. The provision as at 1 January 
2010 is based on management’s current best estimate of the remaining liabilities. The actual outcome may differ, and in some cases, this will be dependent on the outcome 
of legal proceedings. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be 
incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.  116 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Financial statements

following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to an employee retiring in 2039 (in 30 years time).

In addition, the Company also participates in the defined benefit plan arrangements within The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme and The Weir Group  
1972 Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives. These defined benefits plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC  
and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities. In accordance with FRS17,  
the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were defined contribution plans. While assets and liabilities in respect of these plans are not  
reflected on the Company’s balance sheet, details of these are set out below.
While updating the valuation of the Group’s retirement benefit plans for the purposes of the Group’s 2009 interim condensed financial statements, the qualified actuary who 
advises the Company identified an error in their model used to calculate the actuarial valuation of the above plans for the periods ended 28 December 2007 and 26 December 
2008. The impact of this was to understate the retirement benefit plan deficits on a cumulative basis by £8.1m at 28 December 2007 and £15.2m at 26 December 2008.  
The impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income was to increase actuarial losses on defined benefit plans by £7.1m in the 52 weeks ended 26 December 
2008. There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement. All affected balances and amounts have been restated in the disclosures set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method.  
The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2010 are expected to be £11.6m. 
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers 
forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses. The actual return on plan assets in the year was a gain of £93.4m (2008: a loss of £85.3m).
The assets and liabilities of the plans and the long-term expected rates of return are as follows.

In 2008, following the adoption of the amendment to FRS17, the equity investments and bonds which are held in plan assets, previously valued at mid price, were valued 
based on the bid price. The effect of this change at 29 December 2007 was a reduction in the fair value of plan assets of £0.6m. The fair value of plan assets prior to 29 
December 2007 have not been restated as the effect is immaterial.

For the purpose of capital gains tax, the market value of an ordinary share of  
The Weir Group PLC as at 31 March 1982 was 29.75p. This market value has

28 June 1993. Rights issues of ordinary shares took place in April 1987 at 157p 
per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every seven ordinary shares 
held, in July 1990 at 250p per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for

Market overview  
The global economic downturn and 
associated decline in commodity prices 
resulted in difficult market conditions  
in 2009. While commodity production 
volumes were lower early in the year 
there was notable improvement in the 
second half supported by investment in  
Asian infrastructure. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications used in mining 
as well as in the niche oil sands and flue 
gas desulphurisation markets. Products 
include pumps, hydro cyclones, valves, 
de-watering equipment and wear 
resistant linings. Investment in materials, 
technology and engineered hydraulics 
ensure world class performance. The 
division is present in key mining markets, 
including South and North America, 
Australia and Africa.

Market overview  
The North American upstream market 
experienced reduced activity with lower 
demand for natural gas. At the mid-year, 
rig count had reduced by around 50% 
before starting to recover in the second 
half. Significant downstream project 
opportunities were driven principally by 
Middle East refining expansion. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures 
pumps and ancillary equipment for 
global upstream and downstream oil and 
gas markets and provides substantial 
aftermarket service and support activities. 
Upstream operations specialise in high-
pressure well service pumps and related 
flow control equipment along with repairs, 
parts and service of pressure control and 
rotating equipment. Downstream focuses

Market overview  
The original equipment power market 
continued to be buoyant in Asia, but 
depressed elsewhere. The strong Asian 
market has been driven by China’s 
nuclear new build. New coal and nuclear 
plant delays in Europe and North America 
have resulted in increased potential for 
service and life extension projects.

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
My message this year continues to be one of caution and our strategy remains defensive. Macro-economic events have again overshadowed our 
business efforts. The impact of the fall in oil price, corresponding Rouble decline and continuing international sanctions weigh heavily on our 
results for 2015.
The most obvious outcome is a significant reduction in the value of our investment portfolio. The fall in market value for the year is $256 million 
which contributes to a reduction in fully diluted, adjusted net asset value (“NAV”) per share to 70 cents (2014: 106 cents) and an IFRS loss after tax 
of $192 million (2014: loss of $88 million).
Despite this, our year end cash balance was $202 million, the investment portfolio is 82% let (2014: 94%) and net operating income (“NOI”) for the 
year was $174 million (2014: $192 million) producing underlying earnings after tax of $55 million (2014: $67 million).
The rapid depreciation of the Rouble has had a fundamental impact on our operating environment. The majority of new lettings are now Rouble 
denominated rather than US Dollar pegged. There is some compensation in that annual lease indexation is linked to Russian inflation (12.9% 
for 2015) on these leases. The trend of Rouble denominated leases is likely to continue, at least while the Rouble remains volatile and at current 
exchange rate levels. The increase in vacancy rate during the year is a result of those tenants with weaker covenants and those smaller businesses 
exposed primarily to the import market succumbing to the pressures of this new environment. 
Our cautious strategy of focusing on cashflow and quality of income means we are not building speculatively nor planning any acquisitions. 
However, given the underlying profits generated during the year we propose a final distribution of the equivalent of 1p per share (2014: 3.5p) 
by way of a tender offer buy-back of 1 in every 40 ordinary shares at 40p per share. That will give a distribution for the year equivalent to 2p per 
share (2014: 6p). 
Whilst we expect trading conditions will continue to be difficult throughout 2016, our market has proven to be relatively resilient in the face 
of such severe events. New supply into our market is very limited and market research forecasts a tightening in vacancy rates over the next 18 
months. Any improvement in the Rouble:US Dollar exchange rate will provide us with immediate benefit. Meanwhile we remain a market leading 
business with excellent investment property assets.
When the market gods smile on you and things are good, it is easy to congratulate your team and applaud their efforts. However, when the 
markets turn and events are as severe as they have been for the business in the last year, the real qualities of your team come to the fore.  
We have a talented and robust Executive and Senior Management group who have now been together for over ten years and are steering their 
way admirably through the obstacles being placed in their way on almost a daily basis. It is a stressful and challenging time for them. They have 
an experienced and supportive Non Executive Board who understand the business and market environment and they have developed a strong 
and loyal employee base. They also have the benefit of a group of advisers, some of whom have worked with the Group since its inception, who 
share in the team’s enthusiasm for the Raven Russia brand and culture.
I would like to thank all of those involved for their hard work over the year and for the efforts to come.

We remain ready to commence development, pursue acquisitions 
and do further buy-backs of our own shares at these low levels as 
soon as we feel that market conditions will support a return to an 
expansionist strategy. Any reduction in sanctions or strengthening  
of the oil price will benefit us.
Operationally we are doing all we can and I thank our shareholders  
for their continued support. 
Glyn Hirsch

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S  
REPORT
The challenging macro-economic conditions, particularly the oil 
price, have continued to impact negatively on our business. The weak 
Rouble has maintained downward pressure on rents and this has had 
a consequent downward effect on valuations. Particularly frustrating 
is that when we founded the business at the beginning of 2005, 
the Brent Crude price was $45 per barrel and the Rouble:US Dollar 
exchange rate was below 30. Today we have Brent at $40 per barrel 
and the Rouble at 70 to the US Dollar.
These events have contributed to an extremely difficult operating 
environment throughout the year and we have focussed on 
maintaining income at whatever level, and in whatever currency,  
the market allows us, whilst protecting our cash balances.
The Company’s monumental efforts have meant we still have 
an occupancy level of 82% and our year end cash balance was 
$202 million. 
Whether the trend towards Rouble contracts is temporary or 
permanent only time will tell. The attraction to tenants today is 
obvious but whether they will feel the same in the future if the 
Rouble strengthens, or further inflation develops, remains to be 
seen. Virtually all Rouble leases increase annually with Russian CPI, 
which was 12.9% in 2015.
We will remain flexible and alert to market changes and 
opportunities.
At the year end, 10% of our portfolio space was contracted with 
Rouble denominated leases. This increasing level of Rouble income 
means that we have significant upside potential if the Rouble 
weakness against the Dollar reverses, and particularly so if it returns  
to its ten year trend of around 35 to the US Dollar.
Our general strategy is to batten down the hatches, preserve cash  
and make sure we are able to participate in the upside when  
things improve.
That said, underlying profits allow us to continue with a limited 
distribution policy and we intend to match our interim with a final 
tender offer buy-back at the equivalent of 1p. As was the case with 
last year’s final distribution, we will not be offering the option to 
oversubscribe for more than each shareholder’s pro rata entitlement. 25
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
BUSINESS 
MODEL
Our Strategy
Our long term strategy remains unchanged: to build an investment 
portfolio of Grade A logistics warehouses in Russia producing rental 
income that delivers progressive distributions to our shareholders.
Until the end of 2014, to achieve this objective, we planned to grow 
the business through acquisitions and managed development of 
new space. The impact of the rapid depreciation in oil prices on the 
Russian economy and the related Rouble depreciation following the 
Central Bank of Russia’s decision to move to a free float mechanism, 
has meant that our short to medium term objectives have had to 
change. The immediate objective is to secure our existing portfolio in 
an environment where market rents, in US Dollar terms, have fallen.
The severity of the changes in the market dynamics has had a marked 
effect on our business model and risk appetite as explained below 
and in our approach to the risk assessment and viability statements.
Business Model
Our business model aims to generate high, US denominated yield 
from rental income in the under supplied warehouse logistics market 
in Russia and principally in the Moscow region.
Until 2014, this was achieved, primarily, by entering into US Dollar 
pegged lease agreements. In essence, tenants took the foreign 
exchange risk, the majority of the tenant businesses generating 
Rouble income, in exchange for reduced indexation risk, the leases 
using US CPI indexation rather than Russian inflation.
Following the depreciation in the Rouble:US Dollar exchange rate, this 
model is under pressure. The Rouble weakened by 102% in the period 
following the implementation of sanctions in 2014 until the end of 
2015, the majority of that depreciation occurring since November 
2014 and the rapid collapse in oil prices followed by the move to a 
free float mechanism for the Rouble.
On existing leases, Rouble equivalent rents have more than doubled 
over that timespan forcing current market practice to change. 
The majority of new leases are now Rouble denominated with 
Russian inflationary indexation. Therefore, as leases mature, the 
foreign exchange risk is being passed back to the landlord with the 
compensation of potentially high indexation over the term of the 
lease and upside should the Rouble strengthen.
At the year end, 6% of our annualised warehouse income was 
denominated in Roubles. These leases represent 10% of the Gross 
Lettable Area (“GLA”) of our warehouse portfolio.
Our medium term objective is to manage any change in our model 
over the next three years as our current leases mature and income 
potentially drops to new market rental levels driven by a weak currency. 
The current mix of Rouble and US Dollar denominated leases gives 
a natural foreign exchange hedge across the portfolio and high 
indexation gives a buffer against further Rouble depreciation over 
the term of a Rouble denominated lease. The risk is focussed on 
the transition stage between US Dollar pegged rents and Rouble 
leases and a managed de-gearing of our balance sheet to support 
potentially lower US Dollar denominated income. Conversely, any 
appreciation in the Rouble exchange rate, triggered by either the 
easing of sanctions or higher oil prices, will boost our US Dollar 
denominated income.
The market turmoil of the last 15 months has tested how robust our 
model is and will continue to do so, the other key components being:
• Tenant size and covenant;
• Tenant concentration;
• SPV structure; and
• Conservative gearing.
We continue to have relatively high occupancy in our portfolio and 
the majority of tenants continue to meet their contractual obligations 
when due. Our tenants tend to be large domestic or international 
groups with strong covenants which allow them to take large lettings. 
Our average letting size by tenant is 9,500 sqm . We do not have one 
tenant with more than 11% (2014: 11%) of our portfolio’s GLA and the 
top ten tenants account for 45% (2014: 49%) of our portfolio in GLA 
terms and 56% (2014: 50%) in income terms.
Each of our assets sits in a special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) with bank 
debt secured on individual assets with no asset cross collateralisation 
and minimal recourse to the holding company. Our debt is reasonably 
highly amortised which means that our gearing levels remain 
manageable, even at this time of trough valuations. Our asset specific 
bank debt represents 65% (2014: 55%) loan to value at the year end 
and consolidated balance sheet gearing is 58.0% (2014: 51.9%) (note 
34d) after a drop in property values of 16% over the year. We will work 
to reduce gearing on our balance sheet over the next three years on 
the premise that our balance sheet needs to support lower rental 
income levels.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Previously, our KPIs were yield and shareholder distribution focussed, 
results being driven by increasing rental income and NOI performance.
Given the changes in market dynamics in the last year, the emphasis 
of our KPIs has now changed. The overriding KPI being targeted is 
that of occupancy. We cannot influence where market rents will settle 
in US Dollar terms so we will focus on maintaining high occupancy in 
the medium term.
Operating cash flow was our primary KPI, being the effective measure 
for shareholder distributions, but in the current environment, whilst it 
remains a key performance indicator, it is now a measure of our debt 
service cover as top line income potentially drops to a new market level.
Underlying this is the portfolio mix between Rouble and US Dollar 
denominated rents, the continuing ability of tenants to meet their 
obligations under existing US Dollar pegged leases and the impact of 
foreign exchange movements on US Dollar income.
The current incentive scheme, introduced in early 2014, was linked to 
the business model of US Dollar pegged rents. In today’s environment 
the objectives set in 2014 are no longer relevant. We also have 
no directly comparable peers or indices which is a problem when 
designing incentive schemes as we cannot easily demonstrate relative 
performance. We are consulting with key shareholders regarding 
changes to the remuneration policy and any proposals will be 
considered at the forthcoming AGM. 26

The 2015 financial year began with a very low vacancy rate of 6% and ended the year with vacancy of 18%. Early termination of weaker covenants 
in the tenant portfolio, principally importers and smaller third party logistics operators whose business models could not adapt to the weak 
Rouble, account for half of the year end vacancy. Contracted NOI at 1 January 2016 was $162 million.

This reflects 42,000sqm of new leases signed in the year in addition to the 218,000sqm of existing lease renegotiations and the upcoming release 
of space by Dixy under a pre let agreement. There are also potential breaks in the portfolio of 29,000sqm in 2016 and 28,000sqm in 2017.
Since the year end, a further 86,800sqm of renewals and new lettings have been completed and letters of intent on 29,200sqm signed.  
The average term of these deals is 3.3 years at an average of $73 per sqm with Russian inflationary indexation.
The majority of contracted income continues to be supported by US Dollar pegged leases. However, as shown below, an increasing proportion of 
warehouse leases are now Rouble denominated or limit tenants’ foreign exchange risk with a short term cap on the Rouble:US Dollar exchange 
rate. For the majority, (95%), of leases which have exchange rate caps, the caps expire by the end of 2017. Annual indexation on Rouble leases is 
linked to Russian CPI.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW
Investment Portfolio
Moscow
In Moscow there are nine projects totalling 1,075,000sqm, producing an annualised income of $121 million at the year end with 81% of space let. 
Moscow Portfolio
The Moscow portfolio had a net reduction in lettings of 99,700sqm during the year. The increased vacancy is a product of weaker tenants 
terminating early and some of the larger tenants looking to make supply chain efficiencies on the maturity of their leases.
The lowest occupancy at Nova Riga reflects the new build space that came on line at the beginning of 2015 and the two smallest assets at 
Sholokovo and Southern are affected by a small number of maturities because of their size. In the case of Sholokovo, the increase in vacancy is 
down to one tenant consolidating their space at another site on maturity of their lease.
Similarly, at Noginsk, Dixy, one of the leading Russian retailers, took occupation of a new, purpose built building of 42,000sqm at the beginning of 
2015. Subsequently, they commenced litigation and did not execute the long term lease, despite accepting the building and being in occupation. 
After three rounds of court hearings, the Russian State Cassation court has recently ruled that the dispute should be heard in the International 
Commercial Arbitration Court at the Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This is in accordance with the dispute resolution 
process in the preliminary lease agreement. Dixy vacated the premises in early February 2016 and we are now seeking to re-let the space whilst 
pursuing the appropriate dispute resolution process.

Tenant Mix
The letting strategy has always been to lease to the strongest tenants 
on secure long term leases. This has protected the portfolio from 
significant numbers of tenant failures, although the early termination 
of leases on 136,699sqm of space has been completed or is underway, 
where tenants have failed or their ongoing covenant is questionable. 
A number of major international businesses, including DHL, Alliance 
Healthcare and Danone have renewed or extended their leases for the 
medium term.

2015 12.0 13.3 14.5
2014 12.0 – 12.5 13.3 14.5
Weakness in estimated rental values (“ERV”), the change to Rouble rents and the weakness of that currency in US Dollar terms have driven 
property values down during 2015. Prime yields for warehouses have now stabilised at 12% for rack rented, well let buildings in Moscow.  
In St Petersburg, yields stand at 13.25% and in the regions, 14.5%. Even in Moscow the combination of capitalisation rates and low Rouble  
rents generate a capital value which is below replacement cost, effectively constraining supply. 
The investment properties and additional phases of existing projects were valued by Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL”) at the year end, in accordance 
with the RICS Valuation and Appraisal guidelines, and are carried at a market value of $1.4 billion (see note 11 to the financial statements).  
This has resulted in a decrease of $256 million in portfolio value since the end of 2014.
Portfolio yields
The regional markets of St Petersburg, Rostov and Novosibirsk have tracked performance in Moscow with a net reduction of 56,000sqm in 
lettings across the three locations. Lease terms on renewals have shortened, usually to two or three years, as a reaction to market volatility.

No speculative development is planned at the current time although there is 26 ha at Noginsk on which 134,000sqm of space can be built and at 
Nova Riga there is the potential to add a further 130,000sqm on the additional 25 ha of land there. 
The Market
Across all sectors rents are now Rouble denominated for new lettings, although the majority of leases have indexation linked to Russian CPI. 
The warehouse/logistics sector has been the most defensive with vacancy peaking at 11.2% in the middle of 2015, and falling back to 10.5% 
at the year end. JLL estimate take up in 2015 of 1,313,128sqm, the majority of this from large retailers improving their supply chains, followed 
by distributors and logistics companies. E-commerce is expanding with traditional retailers reporting strong growth in online sales. Total sales 
volumes are expected to double between 2014 and 2017 which should create increased demand for the best, well located warehouses around 
major cities.
At current rental levels, minimal new speculative construction is anticipated as capital is scarce, debt expensive and development returns 
thin. New supply coming to the market is mainly in the form of build to suit developments. Currently there is only 400,000sqm of space under 
construction for delivery in 2016 of which approximately half is build to suit. With limited new speculative supply, the vacancy rate is forecast to 
continue to fall during 2016 to 7% or 8% by the year end.
The value of investment transactions fell from $8.2 billion in 2013 to $3.8 billion in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2015 according to JLL. The 2015 figure 
equates to less than one third of the number of deals completed in 2014. Approximately 80% of this investment was from Russian sources.

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
The rapid depreciation of the Rouble at the end of 2014 continues to have a marked effect on the Group’s results. This has eroded both operating 
earnings and balance sheet value. Operating results are best explained by focussing on underlying earnings, and the impact of balance sheet 
movements on results by reviewing IFRS earnings.
At 31 December 2015 our investment portfolio was 82% let (2014: 94%) on a like for like basis and net rental and related income reduced by  
$18.2 million in the year compared to 2014. This is a factor of the increase in vacancies, the transition to Rouble income on leases as they mature 
and the conversion of Roslogistic’s Rouble income during the period (see note 4). Underlying administrative costs rose following a bad debt 
charge for the year of $3.7 million (2014: nil).
Foreign exchange movements through the financial statements were muted this year, the damage being done in the short period between 
November and December 2014 last year. There is an exchange gain in the Income Statement of $1.2 million in 2015 compared to a loss of  
$15.5 million in 2014 and a loss of $1.8 million through the Statement of Comprehensive Income (2014: loss of $41 million). 
Net finance costs increased following additional draws on debt facilities at the beginning of 2015. Together with an increase in underlying tax 
cost of $1.9 million this gave a reduction in underlying profit after tax for the year of $12.1 million to $54.6 million.
Given the drop in market rents during the year, this is a very good operating result but assuming that current market conditions prevail,  
reduced income and profit will continue as a trend in 2016.
IFRS earnings reflect the significant reduction in the mark to market value of the consolidated balance sheet assets at 31 December 2015.  
A reconciliation between IFRS and underlying earnings is given in note 9 to the financial statements.

The significant movement in the IFRS results for the year is the revaluation loss on property assets net of the related deferred tax credit.  
This accounts for the disparity between underlying earnings and positive operating cashflows and the large IFRS loss after tax shown above.
Investment Properties
The completed property investment portfolio had a market value of $1.36 billion at 31 December 2015 (2014: $1.61 billion), a fall of 16% in 
value, driven by the fall in US Dollar equivalent market rents. Combined with the revaluation deficit recognised in 2014, the property investment 
portfolio value has fallen by 22% over the last 24 months.
Investment property under construction, being additional phases of existing projects not yet commenced, has fallen in value by 18% in US Dollar 
terms during the year.

FINANCE REVIEW
Cash and Debt
Operating cash inflows fell by $33 million during the year. This follows the drop in net operating income, a reduction in rents paid in advance 
around the year end as tenants became sensitive to the exchange rate on the date of payment of US Dollar pegged leases, and increased tax 
payments as historic deferred tax assets were fully utilised on some projects.
Cash generated from investing activities increased significantly as construction costs wound down and a retention held of $25 million on a prior 
period acquisition was released.
Net cash used in financing activities increased as the prior year included higher debt draws on refinancings to offset debt amortisation. Interest paid 
during the year totalled $69 million. Preference coupon paid was $17 million and the Company purchased $42 million of its own shares in 2015.
After foreign exchange losses on Rouble and Sterling funds held to service future costs in those currencies, cash generated in the year totalled 
$31 million, giving a cash balance of $202 million at the year end.

FINANCE REVIEW
Subsidiaries
The Group’s trading subsidiaries have performed well in the year. Raven Mount continues to sell legacy land plots it holds in the UK and the joint 
venture, Coln, generated a share of profits of $2.5 million (2014: $1 million) from sales of plots at the second home site in the Cotswolds.
The third party logistics subsidiary, Roslogistics, is a good example of the impact of foreign exchange on results. In 2014 the company had 
turnover of Roubles 937 million, which translated to $24 million at the average exchange rate for the year. In 2015, in a tough market, they 
have maintained turnover at Roubles 930 million. However, converting at the average exchange rate for the year generates only $15 million of 
turnover (see note 4). Following new contract wins at the end of 2015, they are looking to grow their Rouble top line in the current year and have 
taken additional space at the project in St Petersburg to meet the increased demand.
Outlook
Despite increasingly difficult trading conditions in US Dollar terms and a net asset value hit by falling asset values, the Group’s balance sheet 
remains robust with high liquidity. Any improvement in economic conditions will translate directly to an improved bottom line. 35
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
RISK 
REPORT
Risk Appetite
The Board places significant importance on identifying and managing 
the risks facing the business and our processes have been suitably 
tested over the last two years.
Our risk appetite is two tiered. The original decision to focus on the 
Russian market could be argued to demonstrate a high risk appetite 
due to the macro economic and political environment we operate in 
but this is offset by a relatively risk averse approach at the operating 
level where:
• We have a focus on an undersupplied asset class in one of Europe’s 
largest cities;
• Tenants are a mix of large international and domestic Groups;
• We have minimal speculative development exposure; and
• Our balance sheet is managed conservatively with relatively low 
gearing, high debt amortisation and Special Purpose Vehicle 
security structures.
The macro economic environment however has put pressure on 
our business model, especially following the rapid depreciation 
in the Rouble exchange rate against the principal currencies at 
the end of 2014. The effect of this has been discussed elsewhere 
in the Strategic Report but the outcome is a significantly reduced 
risk appetite, with our short to medium term objective being the 
security of and maintenance of cash flow from our existing portfolio 
in a volatile market.
This is reflected in our viability statement with the manifestation of 
the risks to the business in the year being significantly more severe 
than we could have reasonably foreseen or would have sensitised 
prior to November 2014.
The combination of international sanctions and the recent macro 
economic upheavals in Russia, together with the introduction of 
the updated Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council, has focussed the Board’s attention firmly on  
risk management. 
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The business is of a size and culture where risks are discussed 
and reviewed, formally and informally, at all levels. The Board is 
responsible for the management of risk and regularly carries out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties affecting 
the business, discusses how these impact operations, performance 
and solvency and what mitigating actions, if any, can be taken. 
Executive Board members are actively involved in all day to day 
operational and decision making processes of the business.
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that the internal 
control procedures are robust and that risk management processes 
are appropriate. A fuller explanation of the processes is given in the 
Audit Committee Report.
At an operational level, weekly meetings are held with the seven 
heads of department, the two members of Senior Management 
and two Executive Board members to discuss all business matters 
including the risk environment. A sub committee of seven of this 
group, including the two Executive Board members, together with 
the Company Secretary, form a separate Risk Committee which meets 
bi-monthly to formally review the Group and Company’s risk profile 
and reports to the Audit Committee twice a year.
The Audit Committee has not identified any significant failings or 
weaknesses in the internal control and risk assessment procedures 
during the year but as a result of the monitoring process, 
improvements have been put in place and further projects have just 
commenced. These include:
• The introduction of a Company intranet to improve communication 
across the Group, enhance the social culture and give prominence 
to regulatory requirements with easy access to Group procedural 
documents;
• The introduction of a formal property database management 
system, a project which will be completed during the current 
financial year; and
• A change in emphasis in the financial reporting information with 
weekly flash reports, monthly management reports and quarterly 
forecasts reflecting KPIs relevant to the defensive approach the 
business is taking.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
We have set out in the following table the principal risks and 
uncertainties that face our business, our view on how those risks 
have changed during the year and a description of how we mitigate 
or manage those risks. We have also annotated those risks that have 
been considered as part of the viability assessment.
At the beginning of 2015 there was uncertainty as to how the effect of 
low oil prices and the significantly weakened Rouble would permeate 
to the day to day operations. Following a volatile year, we have 
greater clarity on the impact on our business and that is reflected in 
the principal risks that we now focus on. 36

Financial Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation Change
Oil price and foreign 
exchange
Weak oil prices prevail in the 
medium term leading to a 
continued weak Rouble.
 
The trend towards Rouble-
denominated rents will 
intensify, leading to further 
falls in US Dollar equivalent 
income and an increase in the 
credit risk of those tenants 
who remain in US Dollar 
pegged leases.
It also exacerbates the slow 
down in Russian growth and 
consumer spending. Reduced 
consumer demand reduces 
appetite for new lettings, 
renewal of existing leases and 
restricts rental growth.
 
The majority of new leases now being signed are 
Rouble denominated with Russian inflationary 
indexation. The US Dollar equivalent of these rents 
is significantly below those achieved prior to the 
Rouble depreciation at the end of 2014. Higher 
indexation gives some compensation against 
further weakening of exchange rates. We still have 
a high proportion of US Dollar pegged rents but 
income will potentially reduce as these mature 
over the next four to five years if the weak Rouble 
persists.
The logistics market continues to be undersupplied 
at current levels of consumer demand. A lack of 
projected investment in new projects has led to 
market reports forecasting that vacancy levels will 
remain low, especially in the Moscow Region. 
A strengthening of the Rouble will have a 
commensurate increase in US Dollar income.
Interest rates
Increases in US LIBOR Cost of debt increases and 
Group profitability and debt 
service cover reduce.
Our variable cost of debt is hedged with the use of 
swaps and caps on US LIBOR or fixed rate facilities. 
Bank covenants
The significant drop in  
market rents impacts on both 
loan to value (“LTV”) and debt 
service cover ratio (“DSCR”) 
covenants. 
The likelihood of debt facility 
covenant breaches increases.
The majority of debt facilities have a relatively 
high amortisation profile. There is also a focus on 
reducing Group debt in parallel with US Dollar 
pegged leases maturing should weak Rouble 
exchange rates persist.
There is very little recourse to the holding 
company and no cross collateralisation between 
projects on events of default.

Legal framework
The legal framework in Russia 
is in the early stages of its 
development.
This could encourage tenants 
to attack lease terms where 
they now perceive those to be 
unfavourable.
The large volume of new 
legislation from various 
state bodies is open to 
interpretation, puts strain on 
the judicial system and can be 
open to abuse.
Increased litigation on 
existing leases in an attempt 
to renegotiate US Dollar 
denominated leases or seek 
early termination of contracts.
We have an experienced in house legal team 
which now includes a litigation specialist. We use a 
variety of external legal advisors when appropriate.
Our lease agreements have previously been 
challenged and have proven to be robust. They 
also stipulate that the arbitration process requires 
a referral to ICAC rather than the Russian Court 
system.
Russian taxation
Russian tax code is changing 
in line with global taxation 
trends in areas such as transfer 
pricing and capital gains tax. 
Tax treaties may be 
renegotiated and new 
legislation may increase the 
Group’s tax expense.
The key tax treaty for the Group is with Cyprus and 
this was renegotiated between the two countries 
during 2013 with no significant impact on the 
business;
Changes in capital gains tax rules have led to a 
change in our calculation of Adjusted Diluted NAV 
per share; and
Russia remains a relatively low tax jurisdiction with 
20% Corporation tax.

VIABILITY 
STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Company and Group over a longer period than 
the twelve months prescribed for the “Going Concern” review in the 
financial statements.
Due to the market volatility over the last eighteen months and the 
significant swings in the Rouble exchange rate, management is 
currently focussed on a three year time horizon. This reflects market 
reluctance to enter into longer term contracts at this time. This has 
also meant a reduction in our weighted average term to maturity 
on existing leases to 3 years and on bank facilities to 4 years. For 
this reason the Board has agreed that a three year viability period 
is appropriate.
Key considerations for the Board have been cash flows and solvency, 
underlying earnings and the sensitivity of covenants on debt facilities. 
In addition this year, the key sensitivity of exchange rate movements 
on Rouble denominated leases has been added. 
Actual events over the last two financial years have significantly 
stretched the boundaries of what was previously modelled as a 
reasonable “severe and plausible” scenario and this has given the 
Board added confidence in the Group’s processes and balance sheet 
strength. The current model now assumes that the market dynamics 
remain static over the three year forecast period and that all leases 
switch to Rouble denominated contracts on maturity. The model is 
then sensitised for those principal risks and uncertainties highlighted 
earlier in the “Risks and Uncertainties” section, the key sensitivities 
applied to the Group being:
• Increased vacancy assumptions on lease maturities;
• Further depreciation in the average Rouble exchange rate;
• Increases in US LIBOR and bank facility interest cost over the 
forecast period; and
• The combined impact of all sensitivities on banking covenants.
Where bank facilities mature in the forecast period it is assumed that 
the principal will be rolled over for a two year period with no further 
debt draws assumed. 
In the case of the Company’s viability and solvency, the key mitigant 
is the Group’s special purpose vehicle structure and limited recourse 
to the holding company.
The Board is also reviewing the Group’s incentive schemes to ensure 
they are fit for purpose for the retention of key individuals at a 
challenging time for the business.
Based on the results of the procedures outlined above, the Board of 
Directors has a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet their liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of assessment.

CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s foreword
In this section of our Annual Report we explain how the principles 
of corporate governance have been adopted across the Group. The 
Board is collectively responsible for upholding high standards of 
corporate governance and see it as vital to support the delivery of 
the Group’s strategic objectives, and as such, good governance has 
been embedded within the way we do business. Throughout the year, 
the Company complied with the provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) published by the Financial Reporting 
Council save for provision B.1.1. This addresses the independence 
of the Non-Executive Directors which is discussed further on in this 
report. The 2014 Code saw a number of provisions revised to focus 
on longer term viability, risk and remuneration. The Board, together 
with management started a review of how the new provisions would 
impact the operations of the Group, the Board and its Committees 
during the latter part of 2014. I am pleased to report that the 
Company was already undertaking the majority of the activities 
introduced by the 2014 edition of the Code and with a few minor 
changes in its activities, fully complied with the revisions to the Code 
during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Richard Jewson

Statement of Compliance with the Code
Responsibility for good governance lies with the Board. The Board is 
ultimately accountable to shareholders for the activities of the Group 
and remains committed to ensuring the high standards of Code are 
continually applied across the Group. Copies of the Code are available 
to download free of charge from the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website (www.frc.org). As explained in the introduction, the Board 
considers that the Company complies fully with the provisions of 
the Code save for B.1.1 which sets out the requirements for Non-
Executive Directors to be considered independent from the Company. 
Stephen Coe and David Moore have both served on the Board as 
Non-Executive Directors since the Company’s establishment in 2005 
therefore the Board has specifically considered their independence. 
The Board concluded that length of service is not necessarily a 
complete or accurate measure of a Director’s independence, a view 
the Board feels is shared by its shareholders. In the Board’s opinion, 
both Stephen and David continue to fulfil the requirements as 
independent Directors.
Leadership 
The Role of the Board 
The Board is collectively charged with governance of the Group, 
providing leadership and direction for management. The Board is 
responsible to shareholders for the long term success of the Group 
whilst ensuring appropriate management and operation in pursuit 
of the objectives of the Group. The Board sets the Group’s strategy, 
values, standards and culture and ensures the resources and controls 
are in place to deliver this. A formal schedule of matters reserved 
solely for consideration by the Board has been adopted, this forms the 
basis of the Board’s core activities. 
The Board has also delegated certain aspects to its Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees through terms of 
reference. Terms of reference for each Committee can be found 
on the Company’s website (www.ravenrussia.com). Together, the 
Committees and the schedule of reserved matters assist the Board 
in discharging its duties effectively. The Board and its Committees 
have regular scheduled meetings. An overview of the activities of the 
Board and its Committees is contained within this report and that of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Terms of reference delineating a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive are in place and are 
reviewed on a regular basis. The Chairman is primarily responsible 
for the effective working of the Board and the Chief Executive for the 
operational management of the business. This includes development 
of the Group’s strategy and business model, the presentation of this 
to the Board and ultimately its implementation across the Group.  42

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board and its Committees 
Board composition 
During the year, the Board comprised eight directors: Non Executive Chairman, Richard Jewson; four Executive Directors; and three Non Executive 
Directors. The Board considers all of the Non Executive Directors to be independent having given specific consideration to the continued 
appointment of Stephen Coe and David Moore as mentioned above. The balance of skills and expertise of the Board ensures that no individual or 
group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision making, allowing for independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s deliberations. 
Christopher Sherwell is the Senior Independent Director of the Company.
Biographies for each director are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The full Board meets at least six times a year to consider general matters affecting the Company and otherwise as required. Committee meetings 
comprising any two or more Directors meet on an ad hoc basis to consider transactional and related matters concerning the Company’s business. 
During 2015, there were 15 such committee meetings. Meetings are generally held in Guernsey at the Group’s head office, however at least once 
a year, the Board will hold a formal meeting in Russia to review the Group’s operations and meet local management. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information, including briefing papers distributed 
in advance of any board meeting and regular management information. All of the Directors are entitled to have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense where they deem it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. On appointment, 
a Director receives advice from the Company’s financial and other professional advisers as to the affairs of the Company and their 
responsibilities, an estimation of time commitments necessary to undertake the role and a commitment to receive other such training and 
induction as may be appropriate.

Effectiveness
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertakes annual performance evaluations of its 
own and its Committees’ activities. These are led by the Chairman 
and where dealing with his own performance, by the Senior 
Independent Director.
The performance evaluations for the year ended 2015 were 
undertaken internally, which included face to face interviews 
with each of the directors and included group discussions on the 
themes which arose from the interviews. It was concluded that 
the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors was effective and the Board has the necessary balance 
of skills, expertise, independence and knowledge required to 
direct the business. 
The Board and Nominations Committee consider annually the 
composition of the Board and its Committees with reference to the 
Group’s needs and also the requirements of the Code. In accordance 
with the Code, all Directors will be put forward for re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting. Having considered the balance of 
skills, expertise and performance of the Board, its committees 
and individual Directors, the Board recommends each Director for 
re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Anton Bilton, Christopher 
Sherwell and Richard Jewson, who is Chairman. The Committee 
undertakes an annual review of any succession planning and 
ensures that the membership and composition of the Board and its 
Committees are constituted appropriately in light of the requirements 
of the Group, with the necessary balance of skills, expertise, 
independence and diversity to undertake their roles effectively.  
The Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its 
Committees in light of the Code. The Committee agreed that no 
formal policy will be adopted to meet any diversity targets, including 
gender, as this could be unfairly prejudicial and bias the opinions and 
judgements of the Board and its Committees in a selection process 
with any proposed appointment made on merit and giving due 
consideration to the existing Board composition. 
As reported in the 2014 annual report, the Nominations Committee 
had considered the appointment of two new Non Executive 
Directors to refresh the Board, however given the volatile conditions 
which were evident at the time and continue today, it was agreed 
by the Committee and supported by the Board that it was not an 
appropriate time for new members to join the Board. The Committee 
again considered the constitution of the Board and its committees 
and agreed that whilst the volatility in market conditions prevail, the 
experience, historic knowledge and relationships of the current Board 
will be crucial to see the Group through this time.
Diversity
The Nomination Committee consider the experience, background, 
age and tenure of each individual to contribute to the diversity of 
the Board, its Committees and the wider Group. When recruiting 
across the Group, appointments are made on merit, ensuring the 
best candidates are appointed to support the operating activities of 
the Group.

and other benefit packages. The fees of the Non Executive Directors are determined by the Executive Directors. Full details of the activities 
undertaken by the Committee during the year are included within the Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Report will be subject to an 
advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Engagement with Shareholders
The Chief Executive, Executive Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer are the Company’s principal spokesmen with investors, fund 
managers, analysts, the press and other interested parties. The Company’s investor relations programme includes formal presentations of the 
annual and interim results, as well as regular analyst briefings and meetings. The Board receives updates on the Company’s investor relations 
activities including any reports prepared by the Company’s brokers, external analyst papers, and details of any shareholder meetings.
The Board believes that sustainable financial performance and delivering on the objectives of the Company are key measures in building trust 
with the Company’s shareholders. To promote a clear understanding of the Company, its objectives and financial results, the Board ensures that 
information relating to the Company is disclosed in a timely manner and in a format suitable to the shareholders of the Company. The Company’s 
website has been developed to facilitate communication with all shareholders. Communication through these means allows our investors to 
receive information in a timely and cost effective manner.

Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility covers many different aspects of business but our primary focus is on the environmental impact of our activities 
and properties and the social impact in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is the responsibility of the Board to manage the 
environmental, economic and social impact of the Group’s business strategy.
The Board recognises that the way its investment properties are designed, built, managed and occupied can significantly influence their impact 
on the environment and the community in which they are located and it seeks to manage these issues. Although the Group is not required 
by statute to provide detailed reports on its environmental impact, the Board considers this an issue that must be monitored and warrants 
disclosure. In 2013 we started to disclose levels of greenhouse gas emissions, as required by Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.  
Last year we also included electricity consumption in our offices in Moscow, Cyprus and Guernsey, and business travel. 
The Board also recognises the social impact of its operations in each of its key jurisdictions, Russia, Guernsey and Cyprus. In Russia, this is 
particularly evident in the employment opportunities that are created in the communities where the Group’s properties are located. Staff are 
encouraged to participate in community and charitable activities and the Board has established a fund to support local causes or charities, which 
meet the corporate values of the Group. During 2015 the Group invested $80,000 in supporting various causes including national and local 
charities and local community sports groups. No political donations were made during the year.
Greenhouse Gases 
We commissioned Trucost to assist in compiling our report to comply with the Mandatory Greenhouse Gases Reporting Regulations (GHG). 
Energy consumption information was collated from all thirteen warehouses in the portfolio and our three offices in Moscow, Cyprus and 
Guernsey. We also collected office car mileage and business travel of the Group’s employees to report on Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. 
The report covers 100% by warehouse floor area. This year we report Scope 2 on a dual-reporting basis using location-based and market based 
approaches in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance released in January 2015. Since market-based emission factors are not 
available to any of our locations, residual emission factors were adopted for offices in Guernsey and Cyprus. For Russia we used location-based 
emission factors due to unavailability of residual emission factors.
The table below sets out the emissions data collated and the intensity ratio agreed at tonnes per square metre of floor area for the last three years.

Data collection and methodology protocol
The group used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for compiling its GHG data, and includes the following material GHG’s: CO2, N2O and 
CH4. The Group used the following emission conversion factor sources:
• Natural gas: DEFRA 2015 conversion factor for cubic meters natural gas
• Diesel: DEFRA 2015 conversion factor for litres diesel
• LPG: DEFRA 2015 conversion factor for litres LPG
• Office car: DEFRA 2015 conversion factor for kilometres of unknown fuel (average car)
• Purchased electricity: IEA Fuel Combustion (Highlights 2015 Edition) and EIA Foreign Electricity Emission Factors
• District heating: electricity factors were adjusted using the same ratio as between UK electricity, and district heating (from DEFRA 2015 
conversion factors for UK electricity, and district heat and steam)
There was a 7% decrease in Scope 1 emissions and 6% increase in Scope 2 emissions from 2014. Compared to 2013, Scope 1 emissions reduced 
by 6%, whereas Scope 2 emissions increased by 28%. However, a large increase in Scope 2 emission in comparison with 2014 was mainly 
attributable to the change in conversion factor published by IEA, as underlying electricity consumption grew by only 2% over the same period, 
reflective of the increased warehouse space in the period.
Although tenants are the end users of the energy consumed, we consider this an important metric to measure. Not only does this make our 
buildings more attractive to tenants and funders but also the more energy efficient our buildings are the less greenhouse gas production occurs 
at our sites. 
As our relations with key tenants become more established we are working with them to anticipate their requirements, with specifically designed 
buildings. In the case of energy intensive uses, such as cold storage, this allows a more efficient building to be constructed compared to the 
reconfiguration of a standard warehouse unit.
Other examples of increased efficiency include adopting low energy lighting in our new warehouses and more energy efficient lighting and air 
conditioning system in Guernsey office. New developments are being assessed by BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Methodology), the worlds longest established and most widely used method of assessing, rating and certifying the sustainability of 
buildings. Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our developments and use the results of BREEAM assessments to provide practical 
ideas for future and existing development projects.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 48
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I present our report on Directors’ 
remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Performance in context
As has been explained elsewhere in the Annual Report, the 
magnitude of the depreciation of the Rouble exchange rate since 
November 2014 has fundamentally changed the landscape in which 
the business operates. The move to Rouble denominated market 
rents halted all growth plans as the equivalent US Dollar rents 
plummeted. The business objective is now to secure the cashflows 
and occupancy of the existing portfolio. 
To put the Group’s current remuneration plans and incentive scheme 
into context:
• The remuneration structure and incentive scheme was designed in 
late 2013, and discussed with the key shareholders in early 2014. 
The objective was to reward results which fostered a progressive 
distribution policy. At that time the Rouble:US Dollar exchange rate 
was 33, around the running average for the previous ten years;
• The crisis in Ukraine came to the fore in early 2014 and the lower 
limits of the proposed incentive scheme were reduced in an 
attempt to allow for the uncertainties that could arise out of this 
event and the subsequent sanctions;
• When the AGM notice was issued in April 2014 the Rouble traded 
at 36 to the US Dollar;
• At the end of October 2014, the impact of sanctions on the market 
had been largely digested and the Rouble traded at 44 to the US 
Dollar. Even with this level of currency depreciation, the business 
was still focussed on a growth strategy, albeit tempered by events;
• Following the collapse in oil prices in November 2014 however, 
the Rouble went into free fall, touching 79 to the US Dollar in 
December 2014, swinging back to 49 in April 2015 and finishing 
the year at 73. At the time of writing, it is 70 to the US Dollar 
following a low of over 80 in January 2016.
LETTER FROM THE 
REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE
In such a turbulent market, a remuneration scheme which 
incentivises management to make decisions in the best interests of 
the Company requires, at the very least, valid motivational targets. 
Over the past year it has become apparent that exogenous events 
can render such targets unattainable putting the focus and cohesion 
of our executive team at risk. This is because our distinctive shares-
only incentive arrangements, with growth driven targets, do not 
align the management team incentive with the defensive strategy 
needed currently.
The fact that the Remuneration Committee has lacked discretion 
under these arrangements is a further complication. On top of this, 
we remain unable to identify a reliable peer group or appropriate 
indices for comparing executive rewards whether markets are 
going up or down. We have undertaken separate projects with 
Ernst & Young and New Bridge Street in an attempt to find suitable 
comparators. In both cases the conclusion has been that there are 
none. We are the only listed investment property group focussed 
on our niche market. Listed Russian property groups tend to be 
development-driven and even then have limited available public 
information. International groups that may invest in our market 
have diverse portfolios across property type and geographic 
markets. Our UK listed peers are exposed to different macro 
economic and market pressures.
The outcome is that we are left with a remuneration approach which 
will reward growth but has no room for discretion in the face of such 
fundamental changes in market dynamics as we have seen.
Performance Outcomes
In this context, performance for the year is above expectations. 
Underlying profits after tax have reduced by 18% on a drop in NOI 
of 9.5%. Cash balances have increased by $31 million to $202 million 
although operating cash inflow has dropped from $169 million to 
$136 million in the year. Vacancy has increased from 6% to 18% as a 
number of weaker businesses (mainly importers) succumbed to the 
weak currency but the bad debt charge in the year was only  
$4 million. 49

Remuneration Decisions
The performance in 2015 means that 34% of the share incentive 
available for the Executives and Senior Management will be issued. 
In line with policy, increases in base salaries for Executives have been 
limited to inflation and no cash bonuses are available.
There were no changes made to the Remuneration Policy in 2015. 
However, as income is expected to reduce given current market 
realities, the incentive targets set for 2016 and 2017 are unlikely to 
be met, even at their minimum levels. We have begun to engage 
with the key shareholders to discuss this as the Executive and 
Management team are facing challenges far greater than those they 
would have confronted when the current incentives were agreed. 
In the Committee’s view, they are making decisions designed to 
secure the long term value of the business but which are inimical to 
the reward objectives they have been set. The Committee needs an 
element of discretion to attempt to correct this, especially given the 
lack of comparative measurement. Any proposals agreed in outline 
with the largest shareholders will be presented at the forthcoming 
AGM for vote.

Composition 
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Board’s Non Executive Directors, Stephen Coe, Richard Jewson, David Moore and Christopher 
Sherwell, who is Chairman.
Policy 
There were no changes to the Group’s remuneration policy in the year which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 20 May 
2014. The full text of the policy can be found on the investors page of the Company’s website.
Potential Remuneration for Directors  
The bar charts below show the potential remuneration which each Director could receive if performance in 2016 was below target thresholds, if 
performance was in line with expectations and the maximum that could be received if expectations are exceeded. Share based remuneration is 
valued at the share price at the date of grant and does not take account of share price appreciation or accrued distributions.
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
The minimum amount of remuneration is the fixed element comprising basic salary, pension and benefits. On target remuneration assumes nil vesting 
of the variable remuneration. The maximum remuneration assumes full vesting of the incentive schemes, not including the deferred element. 
Recruitment and Exit Policies
Summary details of the Executive Directors’ and Non Executive Directors’ service contracts are given later in this report. Recruitment of new 
Directors would be based on the same terms as the existing service contracts. No additional remuneration would be offered as an incentive to 
join and the composition of remuneration would be based on the same components as existing Directors.
Exit policies for the elements of remuneration are summarised in the table below:
Component Good Leaver* Bad Leaver* Change of Control
Basic Salary and Benefits 12 months notice period. No notice period or payment in 
lieu of notice.
150% of the normal notice 
provisions for basic salary.
Annual Bonus Pro rata payment based on the 
previous year’s award, payable at 
the discretion of the Committee.
No award. Pro rata payment based on the 
previous year’s award.
CBLTIS Awards not vested 
forfeited except in certain 
circumstances.**
Awards not vested forfeited. All subsisting awards vest.
*Bad leaver provisions relate to termination of employment for the reason of gross misconduct including breach of obligation, bankruptcy and disqualification as a director. A good leaver covers 
all other circumstances.
**If a scheme participant ceases employment due to ill health or disability, redundancy as determined by the Committee or retirement, awards not vested shall continue in effect and vest on the 
original vesting dates if performance targets are met. The Committee has discretion to reduce awards with reference to the period of time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date the 
participant ceases employment.

1. Taxable benefits include health cover and insurance, subscriptions and sports memberships. These are not performance related. They have been calculated based on premiums and 
subscriptions payable.
2. Pensions are cash payments made to Executive Directors, either directly or to their pension scheme.
3. LTIP share awards have an exercise price of 25p. 
4. Valuation at vesting for 2015 assumes the price of the shares at the end of the relevant financial period for the CBLTIS plus accumulated dividends or distributions. The CBLTIS awards are 
shown in the year of the related performance targets. The 2014 estimated figure has been restated to reflect the actual share price at the date of vesting.
5. In light of the contractual and economic restrictions on disposals of shares received as part of the Group’s incentive schemes the total remuneration package has been recalculated using the 
Company’s ordinary share price immediately before the announcement of these results, being the closing price on 11 March 2016. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT
Audit Committee Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2015. This report sets out the work of the Committee 
throughout the year.
During the year, the Committee’s role continued to be the:
• monitoring of the integrity of the Group’s financial statements;
• review of significant areas of judgement included in the financial statements;
• review of the role of the external auditors, including independence and remuneration; and
• monitoring of the quality of the Group’s internal controls and risk management functions.
We have also reported to the Board on whether the Committee believes that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
This includes advising the Board on the viability and going concern statements.
During the year the Committee met with the external auditors, with and without management present, to assess the audit approach, audit 
independence and the working relationship between the Group auditor and management. We have also met with Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL”), the 
Group’s appointed independent valuers, to discuss the property portfolio, valuation methodology and more generally, the market conditions in 
the locations in which the Group operates.
In both cases, we believe that the working relationship is good and that the management approach and estimates are appropriately challenged. 
The lead audit partner ends his five year term this year and the Committee has discussed and agreed the transition process to the new lead 
partner for the forthcoming year. 
Stephen Coe
Chairman
Audit Committee
13 March 2016 59
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
The Audit Committee  
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported. The 
Committee reviews the annual and interim financial statements, the 
accounting policies of the Group, key areas of accounting judgement, 
management information statements, financial announcements, 
internal control systems, risk management, the continuing 
appointment of the Group auditor and for the first time this year, 
the model underpinning the viability statement. It also monitors the 
whistle blowing policy and procedures for fraud and bribery.
The Committee comprises David Moore, Christopher Sherwell and 
Stephen Coe, (Chairman). The Chairman is considered to have recent 
and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code. The 
Committee meets at least twice a year. There are a number of regular 
attendees at meetings of the Audit Committee, including other 
members of the Board, senior management and the Group’s external 
auditor. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external 
Group auditor without management present.
The Committee met three times during 2015 and addressed:
• The recommendation to the Board to approve the 2014 annual and 
2015 interim financial statements following consideration of the 
key areas of judgement;
• The appropriateness of the current forecast model as the basis for 
the viability statement;
• The appointment, remuneration and continued independence of 
the external auditor; and
• The monitoring of the Group’s internal control procedures and risk 
management.
The action taken on these areas is expanded on below.
External Audit and Valuations 
External Audit 
During the year, the Committee has considered the appointment, 
compensation, performance and independence of the Group’s 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”).
EY was appointed in 2008 following a tender process and this is their 
eighth year of tenure as Group auditor. The current lead partner has 
been in place for five years and the appropriate members of the 
Board and Audit Committee have met with the proposed, new audit 
partner. It is the view of the Committee that he has the appropriate 
experience for the role.
The Committee met with the key members of the audit team 
throughout the year and EY has formally confirmed its continued 
independence as part of the interim and final financial statements 
process. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the lead 
audit partner outside of the formal meetings to discuss any issues 
arising in the course of the audit and to confirm no restrictions 
on scope are placed on them by management. The Chairman also 
has regular meetings with the CFO and COO to discuss the audit 
approach, relationship with auditors and fee structure.
The external auditor prepares a detailed audit plan for the Committee 
which includes their assessment of the key risks impacting the 
financial statements. The Committee actively monitors these risks 
and obtains updates from the external auditor on the status of their 
procedures covering these risks throughout the year.
Local statutory audits of individual subsidiary companies are also 
required in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, being 
Guernsey, Cyprus, Russia and the UK. EY carry out these audits in 
Guernsey and Cyprus but trading entities in Russia and the UK are 
audited locally by Baker Tilly and Crowe Clark Whitehill respectively. 
The Committee believes that this gives a balance to our overall audit 
provision and added assurance to the audit process.
Non Audit Services 
EY LLP has also provided non audit services to the Group where they 
are determined to be best placed to provide the particular service. 
The Committee has policies in place for the provision of non audit 
services and the external auditor will not be permitted to carry out 
services such as property valuation or accounting services. The non 
audit services provided are typically assignments, such as a review 
of the interim financial statements, tax advisory, remuneration 
benchmarking or transaction advisory services. As shown in note 6(b) 
to the financial statements, total fees payable to EY in the year to 31 
December 2015 amounted to $1.3 million, of which $0.2 million was 
for non audit services.
Committee Conclusions 
The Committee has recommended a resolution for the 
re-appointment of EY to be proposed to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. Proposed EU legislation on audit appointments 
including the approach to non audit services has been considered 
and relationships with other suppliers of non audit services have  
been established.
Valuers 
As with the external audit process, the Committee monitors the 
objectivity of the Group’s external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle (“JLL”). 
We have had open discussion with the valuers during the year on 
the valuation process and the external auditor has direct access to 
them as part of the audit process. We also have the opportunity to 
see comparable valuations of part of the portfolio each year, where 
independent valuations are required for banking purposes and these 
are undertaken by other external independent valuers. Meetings 
were held with the valuers in Moscow during the year and site visits 
undertaken by members of the Committee.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 60
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
Matter Arising Action
Property Valuations
Valuations for investment property and investment property under 
construction are conducted by external valuers. The land bank is 
carried at Directors’ valuation.
Valuation movements can have a significant impact on the Group’s 
net asset value.
The Committee discussed the valuation approach with management, 
the external valuers and the external auditors.
The Committee also assesses the continuing independence and 
objectivity of the valuers. The external auditors have direct access 
to the external valuer and comment on the key assumptions and 
movements on property valuations. The Committee considered and 
compared the views of all of the above together with independent 
market information available and was satisfied that the judgement 
used was appropriate. Given the economic situation in Russia at the 
year end, JLL has included an uncertainty paragraph in their valuation 
report. The Committee considered the implications of this with the 
valuers and the auditors and ensured that there was appropriate 
disclosure in the annual report.
Exchange Rate and Credit Risk
The weak Rouble had a significant effect on the carrying value of the 
Group’s assets.
It also increases the Group’s credit risk as US Dollar pegged rents 
become less affordable for tenants.
The Committee discussed the impact of the Rouble depreciation 
on the Group’s business with management and external auditors. It 
also discussed the audit approach with the external auditors and the 
impact on the viability and going concern statements. It is satisfied 
that the annual report and accounts adequately explains the impact 
of the current economic situation in Russia.
Viability Statement
The period of any viability exercise has to be justified and sensitivities 
agreed.
The Committee reviewed the reasons for completing a viability 
period of three years with management and the auditors and also 
questioned the suitability of the sensitivities applied to the model. It 
is satisfied that the model reflects a severe but credible scenario and 
the period under review is appropriate.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Significant Issues Considered by the Audit Committee 
In recommending the approval of the 2015 financial statements, the Committee considered the following:
Internal Control and Risk Management  
The Board has overall responsibility for the systems of internal 
control and for reviewing their effectiveness throughout the Group. 
This is a continual process, in accordance with the guidance of the 
Turnbull Committee on internal controls, that identifies, evaluates 
and manages the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect 
the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. Such a system 
is designed to manage or reduce the effects of the possible risks 
to which the Group’s activities are subject, rather than providing 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Consideration of risks and risk management form an integral part of 
the Board’s deliberations and are key to its decision making processes. 
There are risks which the Board have no control over. These are mainly 
overriding external risks such as the wider economic environment, 
however the impact of such risks and effect that they have on the 
Group are considered and mitigated to the extent possible. The 
strategic decisions of the Group are adjusted to address these issues 
ensuring that threats are reduced and opportunities are exploited. 
Key features of the risk management process in place during 
the year and up to the date of the annual report and financial 
statements include:
• A comprehensive system of reporting and business planning;
• A defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board;
• An organisational structure chart with clearly defined levels of 
authority and division of responsibilities;
• Formal documented policies and procedures throughout the 
Group;
• The close involvement of the Executive Directors and senior 
management in all aspects of the day-to-day operations, including 
regular meetings to review all operational aspects of the business 
and risk management systems;
• The Board’s review of Group strategy and progress against 
objectives throughout the year;
• A formal whistle blowing policy;
• A comprehensive and robust system of financial reporting which 
includes regular management information, such as budgets, re-
forecasts, cash flows, treasury reporting and management accounts 
with review of financial KPIs; and
• A regular assessment of risks within the business at all operational 
levels. AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
61
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
The Audit Committee has established a Risk Committee to carry out 
the review and assessment of risks associated with the business. This 
Committee comprises Executive Directors and senior management 
involved in each operating jurisdiction and department of the Group. 
This engenders a culture of risk assessment within the Group and 
reinforces the strategic objectives communicated by the Board. 
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Risk Committee met 
four times. 
The Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee on 
its deliberations and findings. The risks and uncertainties to which 
the Group is subject are reviewed and considered by the Audit 
Committee and the Board at regular intervals, particularly with 
reference to the strategic objectives of the business. The principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group are included elsewhere in the 
Annual Report.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of these 
systems of internal control and has reported its findings to the Board 
throughout the year and up to the date of the Annual Report and 
financial statements.
Due to its size, structure and the nature of its activities, the Group 
does not have an internal audit function. The Committee has revisited 
its previous decision and concluded that there is no need for a 
separate internal audit function at this time but will continue to keep 
this matter under review. This view is supported by the Board given 
the size of the business and the relatively small number of individual 
assets in the portfolio. 62

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Relationship Agreement
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4 (14), the Company can confirm it has entered into a relationship agreement with its principal shareholder, 
Invesco Asset Management Limited (“Invesco”).
On 20 November 2015, the Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with Invesco Asset Management Limited. The principal purpose 
of which is to ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying on its business independently of Invesco. If Invesco (together with 
its associates and/or those it acts in concert with) ceases to hold 30% of more of the voting rights over the Company’s shares, the Relationship 
Agreement shall terminate.
The Company has and, in so far as it is aware, Invesco and its associates have, complied with the independence provisions set out in the 
relationship agreement during the period. The ordinary shares controlled by Invesco rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares in all respects.
Purchase of own shares
The Company was granted authority at the 2015 AGM to make market purchases of its own ordinary and preference shares. This authority will 
expire on 12 August 2016. A resolution will be proposed at the 2016 AGM to renew this authority. 
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Going Concern
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings are described in the Financial Review and the notes to the 
accompanying financial statements. In addition, in note 34 to the financial statements there is a description of the Group’s objectives and policies 
for managing its capital, financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
The Board receives monthly updates on future cash flow projections and has regular working capital reports presented, in particular, as part 
of the half year and full year reporting process. After making appropriate enquiries and examining sensitivities that could give rise to financial 
exposure, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operations for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of these financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities 
Guernsey company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and IFRS as adopted by 
the EU. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and each has taken 
all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. 64

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Economic and financial uncertainties in 
Russia and their impact (as described in 
the Strategic Report)
The current geopolitical situation remains 
an important area of focus for the Group 
and our audit. Continuing political and 
economic tension between the US, EU 
and Russia, together with movements in 
the oil price and foreign exchange rate, 
have resulted in continuing economic 
uncertainty, including deterioration of 
liquidity in Russia’s banking sector.
There is a risk that the impact of these 
events on the financial statements has not 
been adequately considered. In particular 
the impact on the valuation of investment 
property and the impact on cash flow 
forecasts used to assess going concern.
Business practice in Russia may differ 
from business practices in more 
developed economies. There is a risk 
that inappropriate inducements may 
be sought by third parties which 
may be undetected by the board 
and management. Areas where 
inappropriate payments may be made 
include: payments to secure favourable 
development land; payments for 
planning permits; construction payments; 
payments to resolve ongoing litigations; 
or payments in connection with the 
acquisition or disposal of assets.
We performed the following audit procedures 
around the impact of uncertainties over the 
current economic environment in Russia:
We built an understanding of the current 
economic environment in Russia through:
• Discussions with management and EY 
professionals in Moscow and London;
• Performance of press searches in Russia 
and the UK and reviewing economic 
forecasts.
We assessed the impact of the uncertainties 
on the assessment of fair value of investment 
property and investment property under 
construction.
We assessed the impact of the uncertainties 
on the future trading and cash flow forecasts 
and compliance with banking terms and 
covenants for the Group as part of our review 
of the assumptions supporting the going 
concern basis of preparation. Our procedures 
are described in more detail under the going 
concern section of this report.
We documented our understanding of 
the areas of the Group’s internal control 
environment that respond to these specific 
risks.
We performed the following audit procedures 
around the third party inducements:
We confirmed our understanding of the 
controls in place to prevent and detect 
transactions involving inappropriate 
inducements. 
We held fraud discussions with Raven staff 
at various levels and the audit committee 
throughout the audit. We enquired with 
management as to whether they had seen 
any evidence of fraud, or were aware of 
whistle blowing or other fraud related matters 
or instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations. 
We performed detailed substantive testing 
on capital expenditure through testing of 
additions to investment property under 
construction.
We reviewed the cash book of the main 
operating accounts, reviewed the detailed 
listing of administration expense, performed 
journal entry testing and review of significant 
and unusual transactions to determine 
whether transactions are made for a valid 
business purpose and on an arm’s length 
basis.
We have completed the additional 
procedures we designed in order to 
respond to the heightened political and 
economic uncertainty in Russia.
We have no significant findings to 
report from the completion of these 
procedures.
We conclude that the balances and 
disclosures in the financial statements 
and notes appropriately reflect the risk 
factors identified.
We have no significant findings to 
report from the completion of these 
procedures. 67

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Misstatement of the fair value of 
investment properties and investment 
properties under construction (as 
described in the Audit Committee 
Report and notes 3 and 13 of the 
financial statements).
The valuation of investment property and 
investment property under construction 
requires significant judgements and 
estimates by management and the 
external valuer. 
The uncertainties over the current 
economic environment in Russia had an 
impact on the valuation of the Group’s 
properties. In the current year, as referred 
to in note 3, JLL have highlighted in 
their assessment of the fair value of the 
property portfolio that there is limited 
transactional evidence and less certainty 
with regard to valuations and that market 
values can change rapidly in the current 
market conditions. Accordingly, they have 
stated that it has been necessary to make 
more judgements than is usually required.
We performed the following audit procedures 
around the valuation of investment 
properties and investment properties under 
construction:
We confirmed our understanding of the 
Group’s valuation process and controls over 
data used in the valuation of its property 
portfolio.
We performed testing over source 
documentation provided by the Group to the 
external valuer, including lease data.
We assessed the competence, capabilities and 
objectivity of the external valuer.
With the support of our Chartered Surveyors 
in Russia and the UK, we:
• Challenged the valuation approach and 
the assumptions made by the external 
valuer and the directors in performing 
thei valuation of each property. The 
key assumptions challenged included 
estimated rental values, yield profile and 
other assumptions that impact the value 
which were benchmarked to market data;
• We conducted analytical procedures on the 
movement in valuation of each property 
compared to the prior year by reference 
to external market data to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the valuations adopted 
by the Group;
• We assessed and challenged the 
judgements made by JLL in light of the 
valuation uncertainties they highlight 
in their report in respect of limited 
transactional evidence and rapidly 
changing market conditions.
We met with the development director and 
assessed the forecast costs to complete 
included in the valuations by obtaining 
evidence to support these costs. We 
corroborated the information provided by 
the development director through valuation 
review, site visits and cost analysis.
We have completed our planned 
audit procedures over the valuation of 
investment property and investment 
property under construction.
We have no significant findings to 
report from the completion of these 
procedures.
We conclude that the balances and 
disclosures in the financial statements 
and notes appropriately reflect the risk 
factors identified.
We have concluded that the assessment 
of fair values performed by JLL and the 
directors are within an acceptable range 
and the carrying values of investment 
property and investment property 
under construction are fairly stated at 31 
December 2015.
We have reviewed the disclosure in 
the financial statements relating to 
the valuation uncertainty paragraph 
included by JLL in their valuation report, 
and confirm that the disclosure is 
appropriate.
We have considered the impact of the 
current economic environment in Russia on 
the valuation of properties, including those 
uncertainties raised by JLL in their valuation 
report. 
We assessed the adequacy of the additional 
disclosures of estimates in note 3 and 
valuation assumptions in note 13 that were 
made in accordance with IFRS 13 – Fair Value 
Measurement. 68

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit Committee
Revenue recognition (as described in 
note 2 of the financial statements).
We have identified the following risks 
related to the recognition of revenue: 
Property investment: risk that the rental 
revenue, and service charge income, is not 
recorded correctly, including the effect 
of tenant incentives and contracted rent 
uplift balances. 
Roslogistics: risk that the logistics revenue 
is not recorded in the correct period.
For each segment we also identified a risk 
in connection to fraud and error. 
We performed the following audit procedures 
around revenue recognition:
We confirmed our understanding of the 
controls in place to prevent and detect fraud 
and errors in revenue recognition. 
We performed a detailed analytical review of 
rental, service charge and logistics income 
based upon quantitative expectations, 
formed using historical data and our 
understanding of the changes in the Group’s 
leasing profile during the year.
We tested the correct recognition of revenue 
to underlying agreements (for example, 
leases) for all revenue streams on a sample 
basis.
For the largest tenants, we performed a press 
search to assess the risk of default.
We obtained and examined the trade 
receivable ageing to assess the recoverability 
of receivables by testing subsequent cash 
receipts and confirming the credit worthiness 
of the tenants with outstanding rent.
We agreed the calculation of the IFRS rent 
straight-lining adjustment to underlying lease 
and tenancy data as well as the arithmetical 
accuracy of the calculation.
We performed cut-off procedures on all 
revenue streams to confirm they had been 
recorded in the correct period.
As a result of the procedures performed 
we concluded that revenue has been 
appropriately recognised in accordance 
to the Group’s accounting policy and 
IFRS. 
Going concern (as described in the 
Directors’ Report and note 2 of the 
financial statements)
We considered this as an area of audit 
focus due to the uncertainties over 
the current economic and financial 
environment in Russia.
We performed the following audit procedures 
around the going concern assumption:
We reviewed the cash flow forecasts prepared 
by management to support their going 
concern conclusion and challenged the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions 
(such as vacancy rates, foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates and the related impact 
of these on the Group’s debt covenants) 
and considered their reasonableness in the 
context of other supporting evidence gained 
from our audit work.
We reviewed the sensitivity analysis prepared 
by management (which flex the key 
assumptions noted above).
We examined loan agreements to confirm 
that maturity dates and covenants are 
consistent with those used by management. 
We performed tests over the forecast 
compliance with covenants prepared 
by management by applying negative 
sensitivities.
As a result of the procedures performed 
we concluded that the Directors’ 
assessment that the Group will continue 
to operate as a going concern, is 
reasonable. 69
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a risk of material 
misstatement in relation to litigation in CJSC Toros (“Toros”), the 
subsidiary company that owns the Pushkino project. As the main 
claim against Toros was resolved in 2014, the risk was not included in 
the current year. 
The scope of our audit  
Tailoring the scope 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us 
to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group 
and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other relevant factors when assessing the level of 
work to be performed at each entity.
The Group has operations in Russia, Cyprus, the United Kingdom 
and Guernsey. Our testing is performed on a consolidated 
basis using thresholds which are determined with reference 
to the Group performance materiality and the risks of material 
misstatement identified. 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or by 
component auditors from another EY global network firm operating 
under our instructions. Audits of the Russia, United Kingdom and 
Guernsey components, which address all of the material risks 
of misstatement noted above, were performed by the Group 
engagement team. The Group audit partner is based in the UK but, 
since the Group has operations in Russia, the Group audit team 
includes members from both the UK and Russia. Members of the 
Group team in both jurisdictions work together as an integrated team 
throughout the audit process. The Group audit procedures relating 
to the valuation of investment property and income taxes were also 
supported by EY Moscow experts. 
For the Group entities incorporated in Cyprus, specific scope 
procedures on cash, intercompany, debt and tax balances were 
performed by EY Cyprus. We determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures 
accounted for 100% of the Group’s Loss before tax, Revenue and Total 
assets for both the current and prior years. For the current year, the 
full scope components contributed 96% (2014: 86%) of the Group’s 
Loss before tax, 100% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 99% 
(2014: 98%) of the Group’s Total assets, with the remainder being 
addressed by specific scope procedures.
Involvement with component teams  
During the current year’s audit cycle a visit was undertaken by the 
Group team, including the Group audit partner, to the component 
team in Cyprus. This visit involved discussing the audit approach  
with the component team and any issues arising from the work.  
The Group audit team interacted regularly with the component team 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and 
was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.  
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group 
level, gave us appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality  
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality 
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
Based on the comparison we performed of UK listed real estate 
groups, a balance sheet approach using net assets or total assets 
is generally used as the basis for setting materiality. There is also 
evidence of a trend for auditor’s to change from profits based to 
assets based materiality. Accordingly, we have reassessed the basis  
of materiality for the audit of the year ended 31 December 2015.  
For 2015 we have used an asset based measure, whereas in 2014 we 
used an income based measure. We discussed and agreed this change 
with the Audit Committee and management in May 2015.
Overall materiality for the year ended 31 December 2015 is based 
on 0.5% of total assets. The basis of materiality reflects the fact 
that the primary measure of performance for shareholders is a 
capital measure. 
We have assessed overall materiality, in planning the scope of our 
audit to be $8.0 million based on 0.5% of total assets (2014: $2.4 
million based on 5% of adjusted profit before tax). 
Performance materiality 
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 75% (2014: 50%) of our planning 
materiality, namely $6.0 million (2014: $1.7 million). We increased 
performance materiality to this percentage due to the fact that 
our understanding of the Group and past experience with the 
engagement do not indicate a higher risk of misstatements. This is 
evidenced by the fact that the sum of corrected and uncorrected 
misstatements noted in prior years’ audits was not significant. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. 
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the 
relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and 
our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the 
current year, the performance materiality allocated to EY Cyprus was 
$3.0 million (2014: $1.7 million). 70
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Reporting threshold 
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.4 million (2014: 
$0.17 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. The increase in threshold is 
explained by the change in basis for materiality calculation. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the 2015 Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 64, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.

GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT 80
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
1. General information
Raven Russia Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together 
the “Group”) is a property investment group specialising in 
commercial real estate in Russia.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey under the 
provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The Company’s 
registered office is at La Vieille Cour, La Plaiderie, St Peter Port, 
Guernsey GY1 6EH.
The audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2015 were authorised by the Board for issue on  
13 March 2016.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by 
the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, section 244, not to prepare 
company financial statements as group financial statements have 
been prepared for both current and prior periods. The group 
financial statements are presented in US Dollars and all values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($’000) except where 
otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
the group financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless 
otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed 
in note 3.
Going concern
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowings are described in the Financial Review and the notes 
to these financial statements. After making appropriate enquiries 
and examining sensitivities that could give rise to financial exposure, 
the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis  
in the preparation of these financial statements.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
adopted for use in the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Companies 
(Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the 
previous financial year. The Group has adopted new and amended 
IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2015, which had no 
impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to 
existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
later accounting periods and which have not been adopted early. 
Of these, the only three thought to have a possible impact on the 
Group are:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018) 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 
2018) 
IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
The Group is currently assessing the impact of these changes on 
its financial statements and the effect of this, if any, has yet to be 
determined.
The standards, amendments or revisions are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after the dates noted above.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and the special 
purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) controlled by the Company, made up to 
31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
or ownership of the investee entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee.
The Group has acquired investment properties through 
the purchase of SPVs. In the opinion of the Directors, these 
transactions did not meet the definition of a business 
combination as set out in IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” . 
Accordingly the transactions have not been accounted for as an 
acquisition of a business and instead the financial statements 
reflect the substance of the transactions, which is considered to 
be the purchase of investment property and investment property 
under construction.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the Income Statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
entities acquired to bring the accounting policies into line with those 
used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are 
eliminated on consolidation.
NOTES TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of 
the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the activities require unanimous consent of the contracting parties for 
strategic financial and operating decisions.
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using 
the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in a 
joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share 
of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date. Any 
premium paid for an interest in a joint venture above the fair value 
of the Group’s share of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is determined as goodwill. Goodwill relating to a joint 
venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is 
neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of joint ventures is 
shown on the face of the Income Statement within Operating Profit 
and represents the profit or loss after tax.
Revenue recognition
(a) Property investment 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised in income on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental increases calculated 
with reference to an underlying index and the resulting rental income 
(“contingent rents”) are recognised in income as they are determined.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread 
evenly over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, 
together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to 
continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the directors 
are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
Premiums received to terminate leases are recognised in the Income 
Statement as they arise.
(b) Roslogistics  
Logistics revenue, excluding value added tax, is recognised as services 
are provided.
(c) Raven Mount 
The sale of completed property and land is recognised on legal 
completion.
Taxation
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel 
Islands, and is exempt from taxation. The Group is liable to Russian, 
UK and Cypriot tax arising on the results of its Russian, UK and Cypriot 
operations.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
(a) Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit (or loss) as reported in the 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income and 
expenditure that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
(b) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited 
in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
(c) Value added tax 
Revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the 
amount of value added tax except: 
Where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case  82
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 
the asset or as part of the expenditure item as applicable; and 
Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value 
added tax included.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, 
the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables, as 
appropriate, in the Balance Sheet.
Investment property and investment property under construction
Investment property comprises completed property and property 
under construction held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or 
both. Investment property comprises both freehold and leasehold 
land and buildings.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related 
transaction costs. After initial recognition, investment property is 
carried at fair value. The Directors assess the fair value of investment 
property based on independent valuations carried out by their 
appointed property valuers or on independent valuations prepared 
for banking purposes. The Group has appointed Jones Lang LaSalle 
as property valuers to prepare valuations on a semi-annual basis. 
Valuations are undertaken in accordance with appropriate sections of 
the current Practice Statements contained in the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 9th Edition 
(the “Red Book”). This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
property are included in the Income Statement in the period in which 
they arise. For the purposes of these financial statements, in order 
to avoid double counting, the assessed fair value is reduced by the 
present value of any tenant incentives and contracted rent uplifts that 
are spread over the lease term and increased by the carrying amount 
of any liability under a head lease that has been recognised in the 
balance sheet.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction 
of investment property are included in the cost of the property 
from the date of commencement of construction until 
construction is completed.
Leasing (as lessors)
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks 
and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. All of the Group’s properties are leased under 
operating leases and are included in investment property in the 
Balance Sheet.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories 
discussed below, depending upon the purpose for which the asset 
was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets  
as held to maturity.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see financial 
liabilities policy for out-of-the-money derivatives), which are carried 
at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income 
Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Loans and receivables 
These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. In the case of the 
Group, loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, 
loans, security deposits, restricted cash and cash and short term 
deposits.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition 
or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in 
administrative expenses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the 
impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment is recognised, the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any such reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and short term deposits include cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
comprises ordinary shares and warrants.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories 
listed below.
(a) Fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives, which are 
carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the 
Income Statement in finance income or finance expense.
(b) Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities include interest bearing loans, trade 
payables (including rent deposits and retentions under construction 
contracts), preference shares and other short-term monetary 
liabilities.Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are 
initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing loans and preference shares are initially recorded 
at fair value net of direct issue costs and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are charged to the Income Statement using the 
effective interest rate method. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
83
RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a 
provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a 
separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Income 
Statement net of any reimbursement.
Own shares held
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income 
Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration is recognised in retained earnings.
Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group rewards its key management and other senior employees 
by a variety of means many of which are settled by ordinary or 
preference shares of the Company, these include the Executive Share 
Option Schemes and the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive 
Scheme 2015 to 2017.
Awards linked to or settled by ordinary shares 
These are accounted for as equity-settled transactions in accordance 
with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The cost of equity-settled 
transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date 
at which they are granted. Fair value is determined by an external 
valuer, using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance 
conditions (vesting conditions), other than performance conditions 
linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
Any other conditions, which are required to be met inorder for an 
employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be 
non-vesting conditions. Like market conditions, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the fair value at grant date.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative 
expense that is recognised at each reporting date until the vesting 
date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The Income Statement expense or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at 
the beginning and end of that period. Where all of the conditions are 
communicated to the recipient of the award at the outset, the Group 
recognises the share-based payment expense on a graded basis.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except 
for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market 
or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of 
whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other performance and service conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested 
on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where 
non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the 
employee are not met.
Awards linked to or settled by preference shares 
These awards are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits whereby the Group estimates the cost of awards using the 
projected unit credit method, which involves estimating the future 
value of the preference shares at the vesting date and the probability 
of the awards vesting. The resulting expense is charged to the 
Income Statement over the performance period and the liability is 
remeasured at each Balance Sheet date.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each Group entity are 
measured in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). For the 
Company the directors consider this to be Sterling. The presentation 
currency of the Group is United States Dollars, which the directors 
consider to be the key currency for the Group’s operations as a whole.
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the date of 
the initial transaction or when their fair values are reassessed.
(c) On consolidation 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet are translated at the 
closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet;
(ii) income and expenditure for each Income Statement are 
translated at the average exchange rate prevailing in the period 
unless this does not approximate the rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions in which case they are translated at the 
transaction date rates; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
On consolidation, the exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income. When a foreign entity is 
sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Income 
Statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s ordinary shareholders are recognised 
when they become legally payable. In the case of interim 
dividends, this is when declared by the directors. In the case of 
final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders 
at an AGM. 84

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and judgements regarding the 
future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market 
conditions and other factors. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year are outlined below.
Judgements other than estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies the 
following are considered to have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
(a) Acquisitions 
Properties can be acquired through the corporate acquisition of a 
subsidiary company. At the time of acquisition, the Group considers 
whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business. The 
Group accounts for the acquisition as a business combination where 
an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property. 
More specifically, consideration is made of the extent to which 
significant processes are acquired and the extent of ancillary services 
provided by the subsidiary.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it 
is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities. 
The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities 
acquired based on their relative fair values, and no goodwill or 
deferred tax is recognised.
(b) Recognition of deferred tax assets 
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is 
probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available 
in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can 
be deducted. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding 
the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax 
group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Estimates
(a) Valuation of investment property and investment property  
under construction 
The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market 
for similar lease and other contracts. In the absence of such 
information, the Group determines the amount within a range 
of reasonable, fair value estimates. In making its estimation the 
Group considers information from a variety of sources and engages 
external, professional advisers to carry out third party valuations of its 
properties. The external valuations are completed in accordance with 
appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements contained in 
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation 
Standards, 9th Edition (the “Red Book”). This is an internationally 
accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with the requirements 
of IFRS 13. In our market, where transactional activity is minimal, 
the valuers are required to use a greater degree of estimation or 
judgement than in a market where comparable transactions are more 
readily available. For the valuations at 31 December 2015 and 31 
December 2014 the valuer has highlighted that as a result of market 
conditions at the valuation date it was necessary to make more 
judgements than is normally required.
The significant methods and assumptions used in estimating 
the fair value of investment property and investment property 
under construction are set out in note 13, along with detail of the 
sensitivities of the valuations to changes in the key inputs.
(b) Income tax 
As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Group 
is required to estimate the provision for income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves an estimation 
of the actual current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary 
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and 
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities, which are included in the Balance Sheet.
Russian tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations and 
changes, which may occur frequently. The interpretation of 
legislation that the Group applies to its transactions and activities 
may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. 
Additionally there may be inconsistent interpretation of tax 
regulations by various authorities, creating uncertainties in the 
taxation environment in Russia. Fiscal periods remain open to review 
by the authorities for the three calendar years preceding the years 
of review and in some circumstances may cover a longer period. 
Additionally, there have been instances where tax regulations have 
taken effect retrospectively.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for 
income tax and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
4. Segmental information
The Group has three operating segments, which are managed and 
report independently to the Board. These comprise:
Property Investment - acquire, develop and lease commercial property 
in Russia  
Roslogistics - provision of warehousing, transport, customs brokerage 
and related services in Russia  
Raven Mount - sale of residential property in the UK
Financial information relating to Property Investment is provided to 
the Board on a property by property basis. The information provided 
is gross rentals, operating costs, net operating income, revaluation 
gains and losses and where relevant the profit or loss on disposal of an 
investment property. The individual properties have similar economic 
characteristics and are considered to be a single reporting segment.
Information about Raven Mount provided to the Board comprises the 
gross sale proceeds, inventory cost of sales and gross profit, including 
the share of profits or losses of its joint venture.
Roslogistics is an independently managed business and the Board is 
presented with turnover, cost of sales and operating profits or losses 
after deduction of administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses and foreign currency gains or losses are 
reported to the Board by segment. Finance income and finance 
expense are not reported to the Board on a segment basis. Sales 
between segments are eliminated prior to provision of financial 
information to the Board.
For the Balance Sheet, segmental information is provided in relation 
to investment property, inventory, cash balances and borrowings. 
Whilst segment liabilities includes loans and borrowings, segment loss 
does not include the related finance costs. If such finance costs were 
included in segment profit or loss, the loss from Property Investment 
would have increased by $71,571k (2014: $67,658k). NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EPRA earnings
The EPRA earnings measure excludes investment property revaluations and gains or losses on disposal of investment property, intangible asset 
movements, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings consists of the EPRA earnings measure, with additional group adjustments. The Directors consider underlying earnings to 
be a key performance measure, as this is the measure used by Management to assess the return on holding investment assets for the long term. 
Adjustments include share-based payments and other long term incentives, the accretion of premiums payable on redemption of preference 
shares, material non-recurring items, depreciation and amortisation of loan origination costs. 90

13. Investment property and investment property under construction - Valuation
It is the Group’s policy to carry investment property and investment property under construction at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair 
Value Measurement” and IAS 40 “Investment Property”:
• investment property consists of the completed, income producing, portfolio; and
• investment property under construction consists of potential development projects and land bank.
The latter is sub-categorised as:
• assets under construction - current development projects and the value of land on additional phases of existing investment property; and
• land bank - land held for potential development.
For the purposes of IFRS 13 disclosure, we have analysed these categories by the geographical market they are located in being Moscow,  
St Petersburg and the Regions (the other Russian regional cities). These form distinct markets for valuation purposes as the fundamentals  
differ in each.
The fair value of the Group’s investment property and assets under construction at 31 December 2015 has been arrived at on the basis of 
market valuations carried out by Jones Lang Lasalle (“JLL”), external valuers to the Group. JLL have consented to the use of their name in these 
financial statements.
The Group’s land bank in St Petersburg and the Regions is valued by the Directors.
Valuation process
The executive management team members responsible for property matters determine the valuation policies and procedures for property 
valuations in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The Group has four qualified RICS members on the management team, one of whom is the Chairman of RICS in Russia and the CIS. All have 
relevant valuation and market experience and are actively involved in the valuation process. They also regularly meet with agents and 
consultants to obtain additional market information.
The effectiveness and independence of the external valuer is reviewed each year. The cirteria considered include market knowledge, reputation, 
independence and professional standards. The Audit Committee also meets the external valuer at least once a year. Executive management and 
the Directors have determined that the external valuer is experienced in the Russian market and acts as an “External Valuer” as defined in the 
“RICS Valuation - Professional Standards” .
The external valuers perform their valuations in accordance with the “RICS Valuation - Professional Standards” , the 2014 Edition (the “Red Book”). 
This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation and is consistent with the principles of IFRS 13.
For investment properties and assets under construction, the executive team members consult with the external valuers and the valuers 
then determine:
• whether a property’s fair value can be reliably determined;
• which valuation method should be applied for each asset; and
• the assumptions made for unobservable inputs that are used in valuation methods.
The land bank is valued by the Directors. The process followed includes regular site inspections, meetings with local real estate experts, 
comparison to any local land sale information and comparison to transactions in other regional cities including those where the Group has 
income producing assets. Updated acquisition appraisals and any indication of value for alternative use are also considered.
Valuations are prepared on a biannual basis. At each valuation date the executive team members review the information prepared by 
the property department for valuation purposes being submitted to the external valuers. Each property valuation is then reviewed and 
discussed with the external valuer in detail, adjustments made as necessary and results discussed with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer.
The executive management also present the valuation results to the Audit Committee and hold discussions with the Group’s auditors.  
Both the Audit Committee and the auditors also have discussions with the external valuers. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of investment property is determined using the income capitalisation method where a property’s fair value is estimated based on 
the normalised net operating income of the asset divided by the capitalisation (discount) rate. Each income stream from every tenant is valued 
based on capitalising the contracted rent for the term of the lease, including any fixed increases in rent but excluding any future indexation. 
Allowance at lease end is made for any potential letting void and an assessment is made of the estimated rental value on re-letting (ERV).  
These elements are determined based on current market conditions and values.
Assets under construction (development projects) are valued on a residual value basis using the future anticipated costs to complete 
construction, a provision for letting costs, a letting void period and an assessment of ERV. Depending on the status of the development,  
and how much of development process has been completed an allowance will also be made for developer’s profit.
Assets under construction (additional phases of existing sites) are valued on a comparable basis. The value of these plots is estimated based on 
comparable transactions in the same market. This approach is based on the principle that a buyer will not pay more for an asset than it will cost 
to buy a comparable substitute property. The unit of comparison applied is the price per square metre.
All of the above valuations are completed by JLL.
The land bank is valued by the Directors using the comparable basis.
Sensitivity analysis of significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the entity’s 
portfolio of investment property are:
• ERV;
• Void period on re-letting;
• Initial yield; and
• Specific to property under development: construction costs, letting void, construction period and development profit.
In preparing their valuations at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, JLL have specifically referred to the uncertainty in the market 
caused by sanctions and by an oil price that is low compared with recent history. The Rouble exchange rate exhibited both volatility and further 
weakness, inflation remained a concern and debt is comparatively expensive. Investment in all sectors of the economy is depressed. There is a 
resulting lack of clarity as to pricing levels and market drivers. JLL comment that prices agreed during negotiation are typically reduced prior 
to exchange of contracts as purchasers bring to bear their greater negotiating position and ability to complete transactions in an uncertain 
market. They further say that in this environment, prices and values are going through a period of heightened volatility and as a result there 
is less certainty with regard to valuations and that market values can change rapidly in the current conditions. Where the numbers of genuine 
third party, arm’s length, transactions are severely limited it is challenging to draw conclusions on current market yields and to accurately assess 
ERVs where landlord and tenants are continuing to negotiate to find the new equilibrium due to the Rouble devaluation. This corresponds to the 
Group’s experience.
Further significant increases (or decreases) in any of the main inputs to the valuation, being yield, ERV (per sqm p.a.) and letting void, would result 
in a significantly lower (or higher) fair value measurement. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The interest rates shown above are the weighted average cost, including US LIBOR, as at the Balance Sheet dates.
During the year there were the following changes to the Group’s financing arrangements:
The remaining $39 million of the facility secured on the Noginsk project was drawn, as was a further $27 million on the facility secured on the 
Nova Riga project.
On 21 August 2015, a two year extension was agreed on the facility secured on the Istra project, extending the maturity to April 2018.
The Group agreed and has drawn down in full a $15 million facility secured on its Pulkovo project. The facility has a one year term.
The facility secured on the office block in St Petersburg was in breach of its debt service obligations during the year. In accordance with 
accounting standards, the amount outstanding of $33 million has been moved to loans due for settlement within 12 months. However, as 
previously disclosed, this facility has been subject to a full cash sweep since December 2012 following a potential loan to value covenant breach 
that was subsequently waived. The cash sweep continues and no further action has been taken.
At 31 December the Group had no undrawn loan facilities available (2014: $89 million).
The Group has entered into hedging arrangements in respect of its exposure to interest rates (note 19). $212 million (2014: $222 million) of Group 
bank borrowings have been swapped into fixed rates with one year remaining (2014: two years) at a weighted average swap rate of 1.44% (2014: 
1.44%), $456 million (2014: $457 million) capped at 1.55% (2014: 1.52%) for two years (2014: three years) and $260 million (2014: $220 million) are 
fixed rate loans with a weighted average rate of 7.21% (2014: 7.14%) for four years (2014: five years). This gave a weighted average cost of debt to 
the Group of 7.3% (2014: 7.0%) at the year end.
The Group has entered into a two-year forward dated cap starting in April 2016 to extend the existing Istra hedging arrangement on expiry. 102

As the preference shares are considered to be capital for capital risk management (see note 34d) unrealised foreign exchange movements 
on these have been adjusted when calculating adjusted NAV per share. Following recent changes in Russian tax legislation the Group now 
accounts for deferred tax provisions on revaluation gains when calculating adjusted NAV per share. This assumes that assets would be sold on an 
individual basis rather than a sale of the Group as a whole.
The number of potential ordinary shares is the total number of ordinary shares assuming the exercise of all potential ordinary shares less those 
not expected to vest.
31. Share-based payments and other long term incentives
The Group utilises a number of different Share Schemes to reward and incentivise the Group’s executives and senior staff. The Share Schemes 
operated in the year are as follows:
Executive Share Option Schemes (“ESOS”) 
The Group operates two ESOS, the Employee Retention Scheme (“ERS”) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Both schemes involved the 
grant of options over the Company’s ordinary shares by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts. The ERS vested in full on the publication of the 
audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the ERS options do not have an exercise price. The LTIP 
options vested in three equal tranches, subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 2013 and 2014. The LTIP options have an exercise price 
of 25p per option and have vested in full. Both the ERS and LTIP schemes are closed and further awards cannot be made under either scheme. 
Awards made under the ERS and LTIP have been accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012 to 2014 (“CBLTIS”) 
During 2012 the Group implemented the CBLTIS and contingent awards were made in respect of 14.3 million ordinary shares and 3.7 million 
preference shares and which cover the calendar years 2012 to 2014. The awards are subject to performance criteria linked to operating cash 
income. Awards in respect of ordinary shares are accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for Share-based payments. 
Awards to be settled by preference shares do not meet the criteria under IFRS for a share-based payment and are instead accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 19 - Employee Benefits.
Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2015 to 2017 (“New CBLTIS”) 
During 2015, the Group implemented the New CBLTIS. Contingent awards were made in respect of 35 million ordinary shares, which cover the 
calendar years 2015 to 2017. The awards are subject to preformance criteria; three quarters of the award have performance conditions linked 
to operating cash flows and the remainder have a share price target. The awards made have been accounted for in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for share-based payments.

34. Financial instruments – risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks in relation to the financial instruments it uses: market risk (including currency risk, 
price risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The financial risks relate to the following financial instruments: trade 
receivables, cash and short term deposits, trade and other payables, borrowings, preference shares and derivative financial instruments.
Risk management parameters are established by the Board on a project by project basis and overseen by management in conjunction with 
professional advisers. Reports are provided to the Board formally on a weekly basis and also when authorised changes are required.
(a) Market risk
Currency risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from a variety of currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to US Dollars, Sterling and Russian Rouble. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions (including lease receivables), 
recognised monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign entities.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated in US Dollars, which is also the reporting currency for the Group. The functional 
currency of the Company is Sterling, however the functional currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries vary. The analysis that follows considers the 
impact of Russian Rouble and Sterling on the Group.
Russian Rouble 
The rapid depreciation of the Rouble since November 2014 has heightened the Group’s currency risk. New leases are now predominantly Rouble 
denominated rather than pegged to US Dollars, which will increase the Group’s foreign currency risk when servicing US Dollar denominated debt.
The Group holds sufficient Rouble currency to cover Rouble denominated overheads and any future construction cost commitments.
The weak Rouble also has an impact on property values as explained in note 13 to the accounts and increased credit risk as explained below.
Sterling 
The Group’s exposure to Sterling is primarily driven by the Sterling denominated preference shares and the related quarterly preference 
dividends, but also head office costs and ordinary share distributions. Whilst there are no Sterling foreign exchange gains and losses arising in the 
parent company itself, in preparing the group financial statements these Sterling amounts are translated to the Group’s US Dollar presentation 
currency and the resulting exchange gains and losses are included in the translation reserve.
32. Capital commitments
The Group has committed to fund the construction of certain additional investment property. At 31 December 2015, $2.6 million of funding was 
required (2014: $3.0 million), excluding VAT.
The fair values at grant of the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2015 to 2017 awards were assessed using valuation models. 
Details of the fair values, models used and key inputs thereto are set out in the table below:

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to 
occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency exchange 
rates. The Group principally manages foreign currency risk on a project by project basis. The sensitivity analysis prepared by management of 
foreign currency risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the impact on consolidation if the US Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% against the Russian Rouble or Sterling, with 
all other variables in each case remaining constant, then:
 2015 2014 
Post tax profit or loss would change by: $’000 $’000

Sterling 10,502 4,358
Net asset value would change by:
Russian Rouble 2,355 635
Sterling 11,184 7,512
The majority of sterling sensitivity relates to the retranslation of the value of irredeemable preference shares.

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings (note 22), which include preference shares issued (note 23). Borrowings issued  
at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whilst borrowings issued at a fixed rate expose the Group to fair value risk.  
The Group’s cash flow and fair value risk is reviewed monthly by the Board. The cash flow and fair value risk is approved monthly by the Board.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. It takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels 
of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows. Interest costs may increase as a result of such changes. They may reduce or 
create losses in the event that unexpected movements arise. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of 
existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Based on these scenarios the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined 
interest rate shift. The simulation is run on an on-going basis to verify that the maximum potential impact is within the parameters expected by 
management. Formal reporting to the Board on cash flows is made on a monthly basis. 
To date the Group has sought to fix its exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings through fixed rate debt facilities, the use of a variety of 
interest rate derivatives and the issue of preference shares at a fixed coupon. This gives certainty over future cash flow but exposure to fair value 
movements, which amounted to an accumulated unrealised loss of $10.6 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: loss of $7.9 million). 112

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Sensitivity analysis on the Group’s interest rate borrowings, net of interest bearing deposits, indicate that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would 
increase the loss for the year and decrease net assets by $2.0 million (2014: $2.2 million). If LIBOR rates were to drop to zero then there would be a 
decrease in the loss for the year and an increase in net assets of $2.8 million (2014: increase of $0.7 million) as the loss on income from cash would 
be greater than gains on interest expense because of the low LIBOR rates prevailing at this time and the interest rate hedges in place.
(b) Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk associated with the Group’s trade and other receivables has increased during the year. The Group historically transacted with tenants 
using US Dollar pegged leases, passing foreign exchange risk on to the tenant in exchange for lower US CPI indexation. The rapid weakening of 
the Rouble has meant that the foreign exchange risk carried by tenants has increased significantly. This may result in some tenants struggling to 
meet rental obligations. The Group has policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are made with tenants meeting appropriate Balance Sheet 
covenants, supplemented by rental deposits or bank guarantees from international banks. No significant doubtful receivables existed at the year 
end and the amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables concerned. Details 
of the movements in provision for impairment of trade receivables is provided in the table below.

At 31 December 4,311 591
At 31 December 2015 there were no significant amounts of unimpaired trade receivables that were past due for collection (2014: $ nil).
The Group has VAT recoverable of $7.5 million (2014: $16 million). The timing of recovery of these balances is subject to future revenue receipts 
and application to the Russian Courts. The Group forecasts the recovery of these balances based upon the timing of future revenue receipts and 
its experience of successful application to the Russian Courts. No balances are considered past due or impaired at 31 December 2015 (2014: $ nil) 
based upon this assessment of the timing of future cash receipts. The Group believes its only exposure is in relation to the timing of recovery. 
The credit risk of the Group’s cash and short term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited to the Group’s policy of monitoring 
counterparty exposures.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Board and its advisers seek to have appropriate credit facilities in place on a 
project by project basis, either from available cash resources or from bank facilities.
Management monitor the Group’s liquidity position on a daily basis and formal liquidity reports are issued from all jurisdictions on a weekly basis 
and are reviewed monthly by the Board, along with cash flow forecasts. A summary table with maturity of financial liabilities is presented below.
All amounts shown are gross undiscounted cash flows.

Details of the interest rates applicable to the Group’s long term borrowings and preference shares are given in notes 22 and 23. The Group is 
subject to interest costs in perpetuity in respect of preference shares, which have no contractual maturity date. The table above does not show 
cash flows beyond 10 years.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by forecasting cash flow requirements for future years. The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of short term borrowing facilities, bank loans and equity fund raisings.

The fair values of loans receivable and borrowings have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using a discount rate based on 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The valuation technique falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see note 35 for definition). 
The fair value of short term deposits, other assets, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables is assumed to approximate to their book 
values. The fair value of preference shares is assumed to be their last quoted price, which is considered to be level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
The fair value of derivatives is determined by a model with market based inputs. 114

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(d) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
For capital risk management, the Directors consider both the ordinary and preference shares to be permanent capital of the Company, with similar 
rights as to cancellation.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, under take tender offers, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis 
of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities but excluding provisions, 
head lease obligations and preference shares, which for capital risk management is considered to be capital rather than debt, less cash and short 
term deposits. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the balance sheet, plus preference shares and net debt. Where the Group has a net 
cash position, the gearing ratio will be zero.

RAVEN RUSSIA LIMITED 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
* Explanation of the fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the balance sheet date.
Level 2 - Use of a model with inputs that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 - Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The Group’s foreign currency derivative financial instruments are call options and are measured based on spot exchange rates, the yield curves 
of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The Group’s interest rate derivative financial 
instruments comprise swap contracts and interest rate caps. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model and where not cash 
collateralised consideration is given to the Group’s own credit risk.
There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year or the prior year.
36. Subsequent events
There have been no subsequent events.
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases, which are discussed in

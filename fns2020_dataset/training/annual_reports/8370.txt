strong financial position we will continue to make targeted bolt-on 
acquisitions and to evaluate strategic acquisitions to increase 
shareholder value.

On 26 April 2010, Lloyd Pitchford joined the Board as Chief

On 31 December 2010, Mark Loughead stepped down from  
his role as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director on the  
Board after a successful 22 year career with Intertek. Mark will 
remain with the Group to ensure a smooth handover of his 
responsibilities before retiring during 2011. On behalf of Intertek,  
I would like to thank Mark for his dedicated service and for the 
significant contribution he has made to the Group as Chief 
Operating Officer, as a Director and as Chief of the Oil, Chemical  
& Agri division previously. He leaves the Board with our gratitude  
and best wishes for his retirement from the Group.
On 14 February 2011, Intertek announced that Michael Wareing  
and Alan Brown will join the Board as Non-Executive Directors  
on 15 April 2011. Michael Wareing is currently a Non-Executive 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman at Wolseley plc, a Non-

Cobham plc and is Chairman of the Iraq Advisory Board for G4S  
plc. Michael has major international and board level knowledge  
gained during an extensive global career up to senior partner  
level at KPMG. His last position at KPMG was as International 
Chief Executive Officer, a position he occupied for four years.
Alan Brown is currently Chief Executive Officer of Rentokil Initial  
plc, a position he has held since April 2008 when he was brought  
in to lead a new executive management team. Alan spent 25 years  
at Unilever PLC where he rose through a variety of finance roles  
in the UK and Europe and then general management in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and China. His last four years were as Executive 
Chairman of Unilever China. Following this, Alan returned to the  
UK as Chief Financial Officer at Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, 
taking a leading role in the divestment of the Company. 
I am very pleased to welcome two such high calibre individuals  
to the Intertek Board.
Environmental impact
Intertek is committed to playing an important and positive role with 
respect to climate change and the environmental impact of products 
and processes. We advise our clients, as an integral part of our 
business, on many issues which have an impact on the environment, 
such as the chemical content of their products and packaging, the 
energy efficiency of their equipment, CO2 emissions and the disposal 
of harmful substances and waste electrical products. We also provide 
advisory and consultancy services to help retailers and manufacturers 
design their products and services to comply with current and future 
environmental regulations around the world. Through our services 
we help our clients to minimise the environmental impact of their 
products and processes for the benefit of society as a whole.  
We are also mindful of our own impact on the environment and 
details of our energy saving initiatives are given in the Corporate 
Social Responsibility Report. 
Quality and integrity
Quality and integrity are central to our proposition to customers,  
and therefore form the heart of Intertek’s culture and processes.  
We have embedded our values across the organisation and are 
continually reviewing and reinforcing our internal processes to 
ensure compliance. The Intertek Compliance Code and Code of 
Ethics provide practical guidance and instruction for employees  
and there are email and telephone hotlines so that staff may  
report anonymously any inaccurate or unethical working practices. 
Our strong focus on compliance provides assurance to our 
customers that our reports and certificates are valid and accurate.
Our people 
Our mission to support and add value for our customers is delivered 
through over 27,000 people across Intertek worldwide. The dedication 
of our employees to customer service and going the extra mile has 
helped us to retain business in the face of increased competition.  
We constantly strive to improve our capacity to attract, develop and 
retain the best people who share in the mission, values and success 
of the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome all new employees 
to Intertek and to thank all our employees around the world for their 
commitment to making 2010 another successful year.
Summary 
Intertek produced strong results for the year with a notable 
acceleration in the second half. As the year progressed and market 
conditions improved, we invested in both people and assets to 
capture this recovering growth. 08 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
Delivering sustainable growth
Our strategy
Our mission is to add value to our customers’ processes, products 
and brands through providing quality and safety services.
We concentrate on industry sectors in which we have the critical size 
to provide our customers with global world-class services which are 
based on a deep understanding of their current and evolving future 
needs and challenges.
Our organisation
Our divisions are organised to focus on specific industry sectors and 
continuously strive to improve their capabilities and procedures in 
delivering customer centric services. In addition, our Intertek as One 
programme is strengthening the operational and sales synergies 
between all Intertek business units on a country by country basis. 
We continued this programme throughout 2010 and also increased 
our cross-selling. We also gave our Executive Vice Presidents new 
regional responsibilities for Intertek business and operational 
development. This will focus our efforts and success in terms of 
transnational networking, sales and operational improvements 
across all countries in that region.
Our customers’ industries do not stand still; therefore we continually 
adapt and develop our organisational structure to best meet their 
evolving needs. Thus from 1 January 2011, we reorganised our 
operational structure to improve the alignment of our business lines 
with those of our customers and renamed certain divisions to better 
describe their core activities. The key changes are:
Oil, Chemical & Agri (OCA) is renamed  • Commodities and 
incorporates Minerals;
Analytical Services (AS) is renamed  • Chemicals & Pharma and 
incorporates Health & Environmental (formerly in IS);
Industrial Services (IS) is renamed  • Industry & Assurance and 
incorporates Food (formerly in Consumer Goods), Agri (formerly  
in OCA) and Upstream (formerly in AS).
Our Half Year Results for 2011 will be reported in the new structure 
and all prior period comparative figures will be restated to show a 
like-for-like comparison. 
Our highly motivated people are chosen for their understanding  
of local culture as well as their industry expertise. We appreciate  
that our people are our core assets and invest continuously in them. 
Our excellent staff, industry leading response times and high value 
solutions differentiate us in the marketplace. 
Global reach
As supply chains and sales patterns continue to change we  
have established a network of laboratories and offices located 
where our customers need them. By providing a central Intertek 
relationship for all our clients’ testing, inspection and certification 
needs globally, we help remove the need to engage multiple 
vendors in different markets. Our close relationship with our 
customers and our reputation for quality enables us to develop 
partnerships with many globally renowned companies where we 
take over and operate our customers’ in-house testing facilities or 
quality processes along their supply chain. Companies can outsource 
their laboratory activities to Intertek and be confident that the 
service they receive will be both high quality and more cost effective.
Wolfhart Hauser
Chief Executive Officer
Valued Quality. Delivered. 
In a world of increasing 
quality, safety and 
sustainability expectations, 
we see higher product 
variety, changing sourcing 
patterns and greater supply 
chain complexity. 
In response to these 
challenges, our brand 
proposition represents  
the value we add to our 
customers’ businesses 
through the quality we 
deliver and our speed  
of delivery.  Intertek Annual Report 2010 09
www.intertek.com
Customer-first strategy
Our strategy is to be the premier high value service provider in our 
industry sectors and we will continue to build a full service portfolio 
to offer our customers one-stop shopping solutions and give us  
the opportunity to leverage excellent customer relationships across  
a broad portfolio. Our reputation as an international support partner 
with integrity and consistent standards of service gives clients peace 
of mind that Intertek can test to the quality, safety or environmental 
levels demanded by the markets they operate in. 
Besides focusing on delivering strong organic growth rates we  
will continue our well defined acquisition strategy to strengthen  
our position in evolving market segments and the important  
regional markets of the future. We will do this with small to  
medium sized bolt-on acquisitions but we are also well prepared  
to be an active consolidator in the industry. 
Market drivers
The drivers of growth in our business remained robust in 2010. 
Global trade volumes improved in 2010 over 2009, meaning that  
the 30% of our business which relies on this also performed better. 
The constant creation of new products and technologies drives 
demand for our services. Increasing concern by consumers and 
governments about the quality, safety and environmental impact  
of products also drives demand for our work. We continue to 
develop complementary new services that will support our clients’ 
present and future needs and increase our market share in certain 
regions and geographies to drive growth in the business. 
Intertek enables companies to concentrate on their core business 
and reduce their fixed costs by outsourcing more of their quality  
and safety needs to us. The majority of the quality and safety 
services performed in the world today are still performed by 
companies in-house. Our ability to provide more outsourced 
laboratory services to our clients also feeds our growth. We continue 
to acquire businesses that complement and enhance our service 
portfolio and these supplement our organic growth. We acquired 
seven excellent companies in 2010 which brought us new skills,  
sales and business development opportunities in growing markets.
Environmental focus
Our commitment to sustainability is reflected not only in our 
operations but also through investing in services that enable  
our customers to become more sustainable. By helping our  
clients develop more ‘green’ and sustainable products through 
socially responsible supply chains we make the greatest impact  
on sustainability. 
In addition, as green and renewable technology development 
continues to expand, higher volumes of testing and new bespoke 
laboratory technologies are needed to evaluate and support 
ongoing innovation and products in this area. Over the last  
18 months, Intertek has opened several new, energy efficient 
laboratories and innovated new testing methodologies and 
certification systems for clients in industries from alternative  
fuels and energy storage to bio-textiles and medical products.  
In November 2010, we strengthened our expertise in renewable 
energy services with the acquisition of Metoc, a global provider  
of engineering and environmental consultancy services.
We also recognise our responsibility for improving our own 
operational sustainability. In May 2010 we moved a number  
of our Mexico operations to a new ‘green’ centralised facility,  
helping unite previously dispersed facilities to a building designed  
to help reduce energy, water usage, carbon emissions and waste  
but also to provide clients with one convenient location offering 
unified services.
Looking forward
In addition to our global presence in over 100 countries, Intertek  
has an established presence in many of the world’s fast growing, 
emerging markets. We test, inspect and certify the flow of goods 
and commodities from the markets into global trade. As these 
emerging markets evolve into more sophisticated consumer markets, 
the opportunity for our business there is also evolving and growing. 
We will provide more services to emerging local brands in the 
domestic market as rising middle class populations demand  
higher quality, safety and environmental standards from their 
local businesses.
As our customers are increasingly looking for a strong and reliable 
partner to help them meet their quality, safety, environmental and 
regulatory challenges, Intertek will continue to expand its services 
and outsourcing options, helping clients to better manage  
the impact of ongoing changing legislations on their products, 
operations and supply chains.
Through these value-adding services we will strengthen our  
client relationships as we become more integral in their business 
and on hand for future support services, actively working together 
to help prevent health, safety, environmental damage and 
operational risks.
Intertek – The marks of quality
For more than 100 years, Intertek has  
guided clients through the challenging  
certification process. Offering the broadest  
range of certification and accreditation  
marks accepted in markets around the world, 
Intertek can help clients to succeed in new  
and existing markets, meet evolving regulatory 
requirements and win new customers.

services to the textiles, toys, footwear, hardlines, food and retail 
industries. Services include testing, inspection, auditing, advisory 
services, quality assurance and hazardous substance testing. 
Customers are often retailers but also include manufacturers 
and suppliers within a global supply chain. 
The market for the services of the Consumer Goods division is 
diverse. Demand is driven by retailers who require the goods they 
sell to be produced to a quality set by either their own internal 
standards or by standards applicable in a particular country or 
region. Increasingly, materials are sourced and goods are 
manufactured in locations that are remote from the consumer, 
causing supply chains to be longer and more complex. The market  
is also being driven by regulations issued to address safety and 
environmental concerns over such issues as carcinogenic dyes in 
textiles and chemicals in children’s products, toys and cosmetics. 
Our performance in 2010
Growth in the Consumer Goods division continued to recover 
through 2010 ending the year with total revenue of £341.5m up 
6.4% (5.2% at constant exchange rates). The growth was wholly 
organic. Adjusted operating profit was £109.2m, up 3.5% (1.8%  
at constant exchange rates). The total adjusted operating margin 
declined 90 basis points to 32.0% from 32.9% in 2009. The margin 
was particularly high in toy testing in 2009 as a result of the CPSIA 
legislation explained below. 
Textiles, Apparel & Footwear which is the largest sector in the 
division grew well, with excellent results in China supported by 
notable growth in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkey and Guatemala. 
Revenue growth from toy testing continued to improve through 
2010 as the impact of the exceptionally high prior year comparables 
dissipated, and the volume of toy testing normalised after the surge 
caused by the enactment of the CPSIA (Consumer Product Safety 
Improvement Act) legislation in the US. We continued to invest in 
new facilities, particularly in the food sector where strong revenue 
growth was reported in Europe and Asia. Revenue from Inspection 
services in Asia also grew steadily.
On 31 December 2010, we acquired American Analytical Chemistry 
Laboratories Corp (AAC Labs), a business that provides laboratory 
based food testing in the United States. This acquisition expands our 
network of food services and adds North American chemical testing 
to our existing chemical testing, microbiological, inspection, auditing 
and certification services. No revenue or operating profit for this 
acquisition was included in the Group results for 2010.

The key growth drivers in Consumer Goods remain strong, 
principally the sourcing of products from lower cost manufacturers 
in countries such as China, the increasingly wide range of products 
being sold by retailers and shorter product lifecycles. Concern over 
the safety of consumer products has increased demand from 
consumers and regulatory bodies for independent assurance of 
quality and safety. 
Although two-thirds of revenue is derived from toys and textiles 
testing, the remainder is from our developing service lines such as 
food, consultancy, inspection, supply chain services and corporate 
social responsibility, where margins are not always as high as those 
earned by the established services. As many economies are currently 
entering a recessionary phase, consumer spending is declining. 
Whilst our business is dependent on the variety of goods produced 
and new product development rather than the volume sold, a 
prolonged decline in consumer spending could result in a reduction 
in product development. We aim to grow our revenue by developing 
new services, integrating our services and providing innovative 
supply chain solutions to our customers. 
Inspiring confidence
By integrating safety, quality  
and compliance at each point  
of the supply chain for one of 
North America’s largest retailers 
we provided confidence in a 
collaboration that assured the 
quality of their merchandise.

What we do
The Commercial & Electrical division provides services including 
testing and certification, electromagnetic compatibility testing 
(EMC), outsourcing, benchmark and performance testing and 
environmental testing. These are provided to a wide range of 
industries including the home appliance, lighting, medical, building, 
industrial and HVAC/R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning  
and refrigeration), IT, telecom, renewable energy and automotive 
industries. Our customers are primarily manufacturers, but also 
include retailers, industry organisations and government 
departments. Intertek has the widest range of owned marks  
and accreditations, including the ETL listed mark, the Warnock 
Hersey mark for North America and the S mark, Asta mark  
and BEAB mark for Europe. Intertek is also a leader in providing  
CB certification and the CE mark and GS mark for Europe. 
The market for our Commercial & Electrical services is driven 
primarily by increasing regulations over the safety of products,  
new technology, product variety and growing environmental 
concerns. This includes current concerns over climate change  
and the environmental impact of electrical products.
Our performance in 2010
Total revenue increased to £269.2m, up 10.0% (7.8% at constant 
exchange rates). Growth was wholly organic. Total adjusted 
operating profit was £38.2m, up 10.1% (up 7.0% at constant 
exchange rates). The total adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. 
After a slow start to the year, most business lines in the Commercial 
& Electrical division performed well and the margin recovered  
after dipping in the first half of the year due to the continued  
decline in the building products sector, as new construction projects 
failed to materialise in North America. The core electrical testing 
business reported good results worldwide, particularly in lighting, 
medical, HVAC and life safety. There was good growth in the 
renewable energy sector where we guided clients through the 
complex regulatory issues affecting renewable energies including 
photovoltaic and wind power equipment. Wireless testing also 
improved with several new programmes starting in the second half.

www.intertek.com
Customer demand for safe, reliable and energy efficient products 
continues to increase and the market for the Commercial & Electrical 
division continues to evolve, presenting opportunities for further 
growth. Market drivers in the medical and renewable energy sectors 
remain strong. Concerns over climate change are driving new 
directives regarding the energy usage of products, particularly in  
the HVAC industry and this is expected to extend to other industries. 
We will continue to strive for operational excellence and aim to 
strengthen our market share by offering superior service.
Competitive edge
When an international consumer 
electronics giant, Panasonic, 
wanted to market their  
high definition video camera  
models in the USA and Canada, 
they sought the ETL Mark –  
a recognised and trusted symbol 
of compliance – helping them get 
their product to market faster.

What we do
The Oil, Chemical & Agri division provides independent cargo 
inspection as well as non-inspection related laboratory testing, 
calibration and related technical services. Our customers include  
the world’s energy, petroleum, chemical and agricultural industries. 
Cargo inspection and testing is a well established global market in 
which Intertek is one of the leading service providers. High barriers 
to entry are principally due to the fixed costs of establishing a global 
network of operations and laboratories and our excellent reputation 
and experience earned through decades of service in the industry. 
The division also provides cargo scanning, fiscal support services  
and conformity assessment programmes to governments, national 
standards organisations and customs authorities.
Our performance in 2010
Total revenue increased to £452.7m, up 11.3% (8.7% at constant 
exchange rates). Excluding acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 
10.6% (8.0% at constant exchange rates). Total adjusted operating 
profit increased to £51.0m, up 16.7% (12.3% at constant exchange 
rates). Excluding acquisitions, organic adjusted operating profit 
growth was 15.3% (11.0% at constant exchange rates). The 
adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 11.3%. 
There was strong revenue growth in the EMEA and APAC regions 
and recovering growth in North America, where market conditions 
improved towards the end of the year. The demand for biofuels is 
also starting to recover. Our well-established conformity assessment 
programmes in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia performed very well,  
as did a smaller programme in Algeria which started in May 2009. 
On 1 July 2010, we acquired Expertises Technologies & Services SA 
(ETSA) from Air Liquide SA. ETSA provides cargo inspection and 
analysis services for the oil and gas industry through five operational 
sites in France. This acquisition was integrated with our existing 
business to France to increase our ability to support more outsourcing 
of new fuels research and development and provide refinery support 
to our local and global clients. The national strikes in France disrupted 
activity in October but had no lasting impact on our operations.

On 10 November 2010, we acquired Pacifica Marine which is a  
small business based in Papua New Guinea. This business provides 
petroleum inspections, agricultural inspections and marine 
consultancy services. 
The core inspection business is steady and we expect the demand 
for higher margin complex testing services to increase once the 
global recession recedes and investment resumes. We also expect 
the demand for biofuels to grow, leading to the development of 
new technologies and production methods. Whilst the US market 
remains variable, we are seeing growth opportunities in the rest of 
the world, particularly in emerging markets.

Analytical Services provides expert laboratory measurement

chemical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, and automotive and 
aerospace. We have an established track record of success in 
laboratory outsourcing with many large internationally 
recognised companies.
Our performance in 2010
Total revenue in 2010 was £151.5m, up 10.2% (10.3% at constant 
exchange rates) over the prior year. Organic revenue increased 6.2% 
(6.3% at constant exchange rates). Total adjusted operating profit 
for 2010 was £14.5m, which was flat on 2010. Organic adjusted 
operating profit increased by 0.7% (up 1.4% at constant exchange 
rates). The adjusted operating profit margin was 9.6%. 
There was good revenue growth from chemicals and advanced 
materials services with strong organic growth from our laboratories 
in the Netherlands and France, augmented by revenue from the 
acquired safety testing business which is described below. Growth  
in the upstream energy sector was slower than expected during  
the year although market conditions improved due to the increasing 
oil price stimulating demand. The Pharmaceutical sector remained 
challenging with good growth in the analysis of biologics and large 
molecules benefiting our laboratories in San Diego, USA and 
Manchester, UK, reduced by sales erosion in our small molecule  
bio-analysis businesses in Ireland and El Dorado Hills, USA with our 
product quality and cGMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) testing 
business remaining flat.
Capitalising on our strong track record in corporate laboratory 
outsourcing, we continue to expand the technical depth and 
geographic reach of our Analytical Services by acquiring new skills 
and services and cementing new relationships with strategically 
important clients.

On 31 March 2010, the Group acquired the Regulatory and Safety 
Testing businesses of CIBA Expert Services from BASF. The Safety 
Testing business conducts a range of expert pharmaceutical & 
chemical and safety services. The main laboratory for this business is 
located in Basel, Switzerland, with smaller facilities in India, the UK 
and the USA. These operations, including 92 employees are being 
integrated into Intertek’s global network to maximise opportunities 
and synergies and optimise costs. Once the integration has been fully 
achieved, the margin of the acquired business is expected to improve. 
On 20 July 2010, we entered a long-term outsourcing agreement 
with Air Products, a leading industrial gases company, in the USA. 
Air Products has outsourced its high-end laboratory in Allentown, 
Pennsylvania and transferred 31 scientists and materials engineers  
to Intertek. This contract provides the Group with a world class 
technology centre for advanced materials analysis in North America.
On 1 October 2010, we acquired Profitech, a small refinery and 
chemical manufacturing data modelling company in the UK. 
Profitech’s modelling techniques complement our oil and gas  
services business in areas including, process optimisation and yield 
improvement as well as in metering, measurement and allocation. 
The pharmaceutical market continues to be volatile, particularly in 
the USA, however good performance in other sectors is expected  
to result in sustainable growth.
Responsive solutions
In April 2010, Iceland’s volcanic  
ash eruption caused an 
unprecedented change in airspace

knowledge to rapidly assess the 
impact on safety and performance 
of their jet engines and systems.

assessment, asset integrity management, 3D laser scanning and 
dimensional control management, management systems 
certification, second-party auditing, supplier evaluation, training, 
health and safety consulting and greenhouse gas services. We serve 
a wide variety of industries including oil, gas, petrochemical, power, 
renewable energy, civil and infrastructure, aerospace and medical.
Our performance in 2010
Total revenue in 2010 was £93.8m, up 16.2% (14.1% at constant 
exchange rates) over the prior year. Organic revenue increased 9.7% 
(7.4% at constant exchange rates). Total adjusted operating profit 
increased to £7.3m, up 12.3% (9.0% at constant exchange rates). 
Organic adjusted operating profit increased by £0.2m or 6.7% and 
was flat at constant exchange rates. The adjusted operating margin 
was 7.8%.
Market conditions for Industrial Services remained challenging, 
particularly in the oil and gas sector. There has been little 
improvement in the availability of funding for major infrastructure 
projects. In systems certification, good results in the USA and 
Sweden were reduced by underperformance in Asia, where the 
business is under review. We continue to expand the geographical 
footprint and service offering in this division by acquiring new 
businesses. The regulatory business which we acquired from BASF 
on 31 March 2010, performed in line with our expectations.  
This business provides testing and consulting for the purpose of 
regulatory approvals, and is mainly based in Canada and the USA, 
with smaller operations in Switzerland, UK, Italy, China, India, Brazil 
and Japan. Clients are split across the food industry and other mixed 
industry client bases. The performance of this acquisition together 
with the impact of the REACH activities in meeting the registration 
deadline on 1 December 2010 have enhanced our health and 
environmental sector significantly.

at the concept, construction and operational stages of projects  
using all forms of renewable energy. These acquisitions bring us  
an excellent set of new advisory capabilities which we can offer  
to our clients in the energy sector.
We will continue to expand our service portfolio and regional 
footprint through organic investment and further acquisitions, 
focusing on the high-end of the market for each of our sectors, 
providing special attention to the innovative and young industries 
with long-term potential such as the renewable sector. Increasing 
project activities especially in Oil & Gas, together with continued 
regulatory pressures and the forthcoming REACH deadline in  
2013, will support our continued growth.

What we do
The Minerals division offers analytical testing, inspection and mine-
site laboratory services to the world’s minerals, exploration, ore and 
mining industries. We provide a wide range of analytical services  
for materials including precious metals, base metals and their raw 
content, such as iron ore, bauxite, coal and coke, as well as bulk 
commodities. We also provide marine and inspection services of 
minerals shipments. 
Our performance in 2010
In 2010, total revenue was £65.5m, up 40.3% (25.0% at constant 
exchange rates) over the prior year. Total adjusted operating profit 
was £7.3m, up 82.5% (65.9% at constant exchange rates). The 
adjusted operating margin was 11.1%. Growth was wholly organic.
 
The improvement in market conditions which started in the first  
half of 2010 continued through the rest of the year. The demand  
for commodities increased, particularly for iron ore and non-ferrous 
metals in China, and there was a resumption of exploration activity 
which benefitted our facilities in Australia, South Africa and 
Indonesia. Sample volumes increased in our key sites and 
productivity improved as capacity was utilised efficiently.
The exploration market continues to recover on the back of strong 
minerals commodity prices so we anticipate continued growth in our 
Minerals division. Skills shortage may be an issue as competition for 
labour becomes more intense.

Financial Review
2010 Financial performance 
Intertek has delivered a strong financial performance in 2010, 
capitalising on an improving recovery across many of our global 
markets. Revenue increased by 11.1% to £1,374m, including a  
10% growth in organic revenue
2
 (7.7% organic growth at constant 
exchange rates). The Group’s adjusted operating margin was 16.6%, 
down 30 basis points on the prior year, reflecting the one-off 
contribution during 2009 of US toy testing regulations.
The Group achieved good cash conversion during 2010 with  
cash generated from operations of £271.4m. The year saw further 
progress on the Group’s growth agenda with £65.9m invested in 
organic capital investment and £41.9m invested in a total of seven 
acquisitions. In addition, the Group paid £9.3m in respect of 
acquisitions made in prior years and ended the year in a strong 
financial position with net debt of £169.7m and a net debt to 
EBITDA ratio of 0.6. The Group has now completed the activities 
to refinance its existing borrowing facilities (see page 29 for  
further details). 
Results for the year
Adjusted profit before income tax
1
 increased by 11% to £211.9m. 
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate was unchanged at 26.7%. 
Adjusted earnings and diluted adjusted earnings per share were 
£144.9m and 89.4p respectively (2009: £131.4m and 81.5p). 
Including the effects of separately disclosed items, the Group’s 
reported profit before tax was £189.9m (2009: £169.2m), earnings 
and basic earnings per share were £128.6m and 80.7p (2009: 
£114.7m and 72.4p). 
Dividends
The Board recommends a full year dividend of 28.1p per share, an 
increase of 10%. This recommendation reflects the strong financial 
performance and position of the Group and the Board’s confidence 
in the Group’s outlook. If approved, the full year dividend of 28.1p 
represents a total cost of £45m being 31% of earnings for 2010 
(2009: £41m and 31%). The dividend is covered 3.2 times by earnings 
(2009: 3.2 times), based on diluted adjusted earnings per share.

Financial Review 
Key financial performance indicators
The Group uses a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) to 
monitor the financial performance of the Group. Similar indicators 
are used to review the performance of the operating divisions and 
business units. These KPIs are regularly reviewed by the Board and 
management and are used to assess past performance and set 
targets for the future. A number of the KPIs also form part of the 
management incentive scheme whereby managers may receive 
annual bonus payments on achieving or exceeding a range of 
targets set for the year. Further information on management 
incentives is given in the Remuneration Report which starts on  
page 54.
A critical performance indicator for the Group is the continuing 
expansion of the revenue base. Whilst the Group continues to seek 
opportunities for expansion through acquisitions, the Board places 
great emphasis on the achievement of sustainable organic revenue 
growth. During the year under review, total revenue increased by 
11%, of which 10% came from organic revenue growth (8% at 
constant exchange rates). This resulted in growth in both adjusted 
operating profit and organic adjusted operating profit of 9%  
(6% at constant exchange rates). 
As a people intensive business, it is critical that costs are closely 
controlled and that the cost base of individual operating entities 
remain relevant to underlying revenue generation. Accordingly,  
the operating margin of individual operating entities is the subject  
of critical review. During 2010, the adjusted operating margin was 
16.6% (2009: 16.9%).
Strong cash conversion is crucial for the Group to fund its growth 
programme. Working capital is kept to a minimum and each division 
has a range of targets on cash conversion. Operating cash flow  
is routinely monitored to ensure that it is comparable with past 
performance and is consistent with budgeted activity.
 
The Board seeks to achieve robust and consistently growing earnings 
per share performance. Earnings per share performance also forms 
an important part of the bonus criteria for management incentives. 
Basic earnings per share measures actual earnings attributed to 
shareholders in the financial year over the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share 
measures actual earnings attributable to shareholders in the financial 
year over the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
but adjusted for the impact of potentially dilutive share awards. 
These metrics are also adjusted to exclude certain costs (see page 91), 
to enable shareholders to gain a better understanding of the 
underlying trading performance of the Group.
The rate of return on invested capital measures the efficiency  
of Group investments; the higher the rate achieved means that 
investment gains compare more favourably with the cost of 
investment. This is an important measure to assess the year on year 
efficiency of investment decisions. It is also an important criteria  
in the decision making process when projects are competing for 
limited funds.

Capital investment
The Group continued to invest in its growth strategy during 2010, 
investing in both organic and acquisition led growth. Organic capital 
investment of £65.9m (2009: £52.8m) during the year represented 
4.8% of revenue (2009: 4.3%). Over the medium-term, the Group 
plans to invest between five and seven per cent of revenue in 
organic investment.
During the year the Group completed seven acquisitions for a  
cash investment of £41.9m (2009: three acquisitions for £23.9m), 
and there was £9.3m (2009: £10.2m) paid in respect of prior  
period acquisitions.

On 31 March 2010, the Group acquired the Regulatory and Safety 
Testing businesses of Expert Services (ES) from BASF for a cash 
consideration of £21.4m. ES provides services in two segments: 
regulatory testing and consulting services and environmental and 
safety testing, to companies in industries including pharmaceutical, 
chemical, food, healthcare, consumer product and agriculture. The 
business employs around 200 people across Switzerland, Canada, 
UK, USA, China, India, Brazil, Italy and Japan and offers a range of 
services and expertise complementary to Intertek Group’s services 
and clients. The businesses are being integrated into our Industrial 
Services and Analytical Services divisions.
The Group made six smaller infill acquisitions in 2010, details of 
which are given in the financial statements in note 22 and in the 
Operating Review by Division which starts on page 12. We expect  
to complete further acquisitions in 2011. 
Net financing costs
Details of the Group’s net financing costs are given in note 7 to the 
financial statements. The Group reported net financing costs of 
£16.6m in 2010 (2009: £17.5m). Total finance income in 2010 was 
£7.2m (2009: £7.7m), and primarily comprised the return on pension 
assets and interest on bank balances.
Total finance expense for 2010 was £23.8m (2009: £25.2m) 
comprising interest on borrowings, pension interest cost, foreign 
exchange losses on the revaluation of net monetary assets and 
liabilities and other financing fees. Included within the finance 
expense was a charge of £1.0m (2009: £nil) relating to an interest 
rate swap which was recycled from equity as it was ineffective 
hedge accounting. This was reported as a Separately Disclosed Item 
in the income statement (see note 4).

Directors’ Report – Business Review
* Adjusted for separately disclosed items. 28 Intertek Annual Report 2010
The Group continued to generate good cash flow in 2010. Cash 
flow generation during 2009 was at an exceptional level as the 
Group prioritised cash flow during the economic downturn. Cash 
generated from operations was £271.4m for 2010, compared to 
£278.4m for 2009. One of the key performance indicators we use  
to measure the efficiency of our cash generation is the percentage 
of operating profit that is converted into cash. As shown in the table 
above, in 2010, 100% of operating profit was converted into cash 
compared to the exceptional 121% in 2009.
In order to support our growth strategy we invest continually in our 
operations. In 2010, net cash flows used in investing activities were 
£115.4m (2009: £79.6m). We paid £41.9m net of cash acquired 
(2009: £23.9m), for seven new businesses, £9.3m (2009: £10.2m) 
for deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions, and £65.1m 
(2009: £52.5m) for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
and computer software, net of disposals. In 2009, we sold for  
£5.7m shares in a listed investment acquired in 2008 for £4.4m  
and also divested our 40% interest in the associate Allium for 
£0.9m. No such transactions took place in 2010. 
Cash flows from financing activities comprised proceeds from  
the issue of share capital following the exercise of employee share 
options of £2.8m (2009: £3.6m), purchase of own shares to  
satisfy the requirements of the Employee Share Ownership Trust  
of £0.5m (2009: £nil), the net drawdown of debt of £44.4m  
(2009: repayment of £58.7m) following the completion of the  
2010 refinancing programme, cash outflows of dividends paid to 
non-controlling interests of £6.6m (2009: £6.3m) and dividends paid 
to Group shareholders of £42.5m (2009: £34.7m) which resulted in 
net cash from financing activities breaking even compared to cash 
outflow of £96.1m in 2009.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings were £386.7m at  
31 December 2010, an increase of 15% over 2009. The Group’s 
borrowings are normally made in currencies which, as far as possible 
match its asset base. Borrowings at 31 December 2010 are primarily 
denominated in US dollars. The increase in borrowings was mainly 
due to the Group issuing a further US$250m of senior notes in 
December 2010 as part of the Group’s refinancing programme 
which in turn facilitated repayment of part of the multi-currency, 
multi-tranche syndicated facility.
Financial Review
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2010, were £217.0m,  
an increase of £82.8m (61.7%) over 2009. As shown in note 25 
to the financial statements, net debt at 31 December 2010 was 
reduced to £169.7m from £201.4m in 2009 and £308.3m in 2008.
Separately disclosed items
A number of items are separately disclosed in the financial 
statements as exclusion of these items provides readers with a clear 
and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance 
of the Group’s business.
When applicable, these separately disclosed items include 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, impairment of goodwill  
and other assets, the profit or loss on disposals of businesses or 
other significant fixed assets, costs of acquiring and integrating 
acquisitions, the cost of any fundamental restructuring of a business, 
material claims and settlements, significant recycling of amounts 
from equity to the income statement and unrealised market gains/
losses on financial assets/liabilities.
Separately disclosed items before tax were £22.0m (2009: £22.3m). 
The charge for 2010 comprised £12.9m for the amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles (2009: £12.8m), acquisition and related 
integration costs £5.3m (2009: £2.5m), restructuring £nil (2009: 
£3.2m), claims and settlements £2.8m (2009: £3.8m), and recycling 
£1.0m fair value of the interest swaps from the hedging reserve to 
the income statement (2009: £nil). Further information on separately 
disclosed items is given in note 4 to the financial statements.

Financing
The Group’s net borrowings as at 31 December 2010 were £169.7m 
compared with £201.4m at the beginning of the year. 
Details of the Group’s borrowings as at 31 December 2010 are 
shown in note 15 to the financial statements, and details of the 
Group’s cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2010 are 
shown in note 24.
As at 31 December 2010, Intertek Group had aggregate committed 
borrowing facilities of £722.9m, of which £386.7m were drawn.  
The Group’s financing is structured through bank facilities and 
private placement bonds. The bank facilities comprise a syndicated 
principal bank facility and two bilateral facilities. As part of the 
planned refinancing of the Group’s principal bank facility, the Group 
concluded further bond placements during 2010 and completed the 
refinancing on its principal bank facility in early 2011. Details of the 
Group’s borrowings as at 31 December 2010 are outlined below.

The Group’s policy is to ensure that a liquidity buffer is available  
in the short-term, to absorb the net effects of transactions made 
and expected changes in liquidity both under normal and stressed 
conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Group’s reputation. Where appropriate, cash is managed in 
currency based cash pools and is placed on short-term deposit, 
bearing interest at market rates.
Capital management
Financial capital is considered by the Group to include senior term 
loans, notes and other borrowings in additional to equity held by 
shareholders. The Group’s policy is to monitor and maintain a robust 
capital base to ensure that market and key stakeholders retain 
confidence in the capital profile. Debt capital is monitored by Group 
Treasury assessing the liquidity buffer on a short and longer term 
basis as discussed in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section. 
Interest bearing loans, notes and borrowings are discussed in note 
15. The capital structure is reviewed by the Board, using amongst 
other methods, return on invested capital and diluted adjusted 
earnings per share as key performance indicators.
Principal bank facility
In February 2011, the Group successfully completed the refinancing 
of the principal bank facility. The new syndicated facility comprises  
a US$600m multi-currency revolving facility available to 31 March 
2016. Advances under the new facility bear interest at a rate equal 
to LIBOR, or their local currency equivalent, plus a margin, 
depending upon the Group’s leverage. On execution of the new 
facility, the Group’s original principal bank facility was cancelled.  
The original facility was raised in 2004 and had a final maturity date 
of 15 December 2011. 
Private placement bonds
In June 2008, the Group raised US$100m by way of a senior note 
issue. The notes are repayable on 26 June 2015 and pay a fixed 
annual interest rate of 5.54%. 
In December 2008, the Group issued a further US$100m of senior 
notes. These notes were issued in two tranches with US$25m 
repayable on 21 January 2014 at a fixed annual interest rate of 7.5% 
and US$75m repayable on 10 June 2010 at a fixed annual interest 
rate of 8.0%.
In December 2010, the Group issued a further US$250m of senior 
notes. These notes were issued in two tranches with US$100m 
repayable on 15 December 2017 at a fixed annual interest rate  
of 3.2% and US$150m repayable on 15 December 2020 at a fixed 
annual interest rate of 3.91%.
Other facilities
In January 2010, the Group signed a US$60m bilateral, multi-
currency facility available to 25 January 2013. Drawings under  
this facility at 31 December 2010 were nil.
In December 2010, the Group signed a further bilateral multi-
currency facility available to 31 March 2016. The facility comprises  
a £20m multi-currency revolving facility and a €12m multi-currency 
term loan facility. Drawings under these facilities at 31 December 2010 
were nil.

Return on invested capital
The Group is committed to enhancing shareholder value, both  
by investing in the business so as to improve the return on 
investment in the longer term and by managing its capital structure. 
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Group seeks to maintain  
a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with 
higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security 
afforded by a sound capital position. Return on capital in 2010  
was 25.2% compared to 26.5% in 2009.

There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital

nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed  
capital requirements.
Impact of currency movements
The Group operates in 75 different currencies. The majority of the 
Group’s earnings are denominated in US dollars or currencies linked 
to the US dollar or which historically have moved in line with the 
dollar. Other currencies such as the Euro and the Chinese renminbi 
are also important constituents of our overseas earnings. Therefore 
the Group’s results, when translated into sterling, are exposed to 
changes in the value of the US dollar and other currencies. 
We show below the main currencies that make up the Group’s 
earnings and the cumulative average exchange rates that we have 
used when translating results into sterling in 2010 and 2009. 
 
Value of £1 2010 2009
US dollar 1.55 1.56
Euro 1.17 1.12
Chinese renminbi 10.47 10.63
Hong Kong dollar 12.00 12.06
Exchange rates in 2010 were more stable than those in 2009 and 
consequently there was less of an impact on our revenue and 
operating profit than in 2009. Our revenue growth was 11.1% (2009: 
23.3%) at actual rates and 8.8% (2009: 7.0%) at constant exchange 
rates. Growth in adjusted operating profit was 8.9% (2009: 26.9%) 
at actual rates and 6.3% (2009: 6.1%) at constant exchange rates.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
Introduction from the Chief Executive Officer
From the continual development of our own services we know that 
the importance of corporate social responsibility keeps growing.  
This year, to support the growing demand for environmental 
improvements, we have added a number of environmental services  
to our portfolio, details of which are given on page 32.
Additionally this year we have offered some of our audit customers 
the opportunity to offset the emissions generated through their use 
of our services. In this way customers can demonstrate their social 
responsibility to their own customers while at the same time verifying 
their own processes. We intend to extend this programme to other 
areas of our business that involve significant identifiable emissions.
We remain a service business that prides itself on its local flexibility, 
so we have not changed our fundamental model that allows our 
local businesses to react appropriately to local stakeholders, within 
the framework of our global policies. In this way the direction of 
charitable donations or the methods of engaging with employees 
can be decided at a local country level rather than centrally.
Our greatest contribution to corporate social responsibility is to 
provide services that enable our customers to develop more “green” 
and sustainable products through socially responsible supply chains. 
For that reason our focus at Board level is on providing an ethical 
and fair service that meets customers’ needs. We are pleased that 
this approach has been recognised in our nomination in 2010’s UK 
National Business Awards for bringing to the market a new style of 
customer-focused service.
Customers are facing increased challenges to reduce their carbon 
emissions arising from their operations, supply chain networks and 
end users. 
In response to such challenges, Intertek became the first company  
in the sector to launch a carbon offset program for our audit 
services. Our customers achieve carbon neutrality for audit services 
received through participation in one of a number of offset projects. 
The diversified project portfolio features carbon offset projects of 
the highest quality and standard guidelines such as Gold Standard, 
Voluntary Carbon Standard and Climate Action Reserve. Sample 
projects include a wind renewable energy project in Turkey and a 
biomass project generating steam for electricity production in Brazil. 
Our carbon advisory and sustainability services are also helping our 
customers apply the latest standards to mitigate their environmental 
and socio-economic impact. Our carbon services team helps 
customers assess the environmental impact of their products 
through lifecycle analysis consulting and tools. This enables them  
to strengthen their brands through carbon labelling schemes on 
products and in their stakeholder reporting.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
Our business
We provide testing, inspection, certification and related services in 
respect of a huge range of products and services. Our work ensures 
the quality and safety of customers’ products, processes and systems 
which ultimately benefit the end consumer. Our wide technical 
knowledge, valuable research and industry expertise are shared 
through our growing training and consulting services.
Intertek continues to develop and acquire new testing methods, 
laboratories and expertise to support innovation, particularly in the 
renewable products and commodities sector. We have committed 
new resources to the development of solar, wind and battery fuel 
cell technology and biodegradability testing and are opening state-
of-the-art testing laboratories in Europe, Asia and America. 
This year our renewable energy services have been augmented  
by the acquisition of Metoc in the UK, which through its provision 
of consultancy services from the initial concept to the design stage 
of energy infrastructure projects, is able to influence the interaction 
of clients with the environment. This includes wind, wave, solar and 
hydro-electric projects. Metoc’s work also mitigates the adverse 
impact of oil and gas exploration through its upstream services.
Technological solutions for oil and gas upstream clients, such as 
those provided by the advanced mathematical software modelling 
products of another UK acquisition, Profitech, support the efficiency 
of oil and gas production processes, while exhaust emission control 
is better evaluated by our ground breaking test technology in  
San Antonio, Texas, USA.
Our work also includes testing compliance and effectiveness targets 
in the production of biomass, biofuels and ethanol. This enables our 
customers to comply with ultra low sulphur diesel legislation and 
assess low energy and low emission equipment. New laboratories  
in Albany in the USA and Bilbao in Spain will provide additional 
testing capacity for biofuels and the Bilbao lab will also carry out 
environmental testing of contaminated water and soil.
We are a world leader in helping our customers design safe 
products, with particular expertise in children’s toys. Our centres  
of excellence in Chicago and London provide advice to some of  
the world’s largest product brands to advance the design of safe 
products in the marketplace. In partnership with industry and health 
bodies we collect and analyse safety data in connection with child 
accidents, and use this information to help our customers design 
safer products. 
Intertek provides audit and consultancy services to corporations, 
non-governmental and regulatory organisations to improve the 
social and ethical impact of their operations. Increasingly consumers 
around the world want peace of mind that products they have 
purchased have not been created through social or ethical abuse  
of workers or unfair trade. We audit factory conditions and work 
practices to help make sure that they are legal, ethical and humane.  
We work with corporations to develop bespoke global CSR 
standards and programmes to ensure that they exceed minimum 
social and ethical thresholds in their sourcing. We have successfully 
initiated partnerships and collaborations with non-governmental  
and not-for-profit organisations to improve standards.
Our new social compliance programme, ‘Workplace Condition 
Assessment’, represents the next generation in social auditing tools. 
Manufacturers and retailers can measure performance against 
industry benchmarks, communicate results and improve workplace 
conditions. A unique scorecard produces a measured result by 
comparing a facility’s performance against industry, country and 
global benchmarks. An automated report facilitates improvements 
and enables factories to showcase performance to stakeholders.
In partnership with Credit360, a CSR data management service 
provider, we enable the collection of social and environmental data 
in China and Hong Kong to a central secure location. The highly 
configurable system addresses numerous CSR challenges through  
its range of modules.
For manufacturers requiring energy testing, Intertek recently 
deployed 18 global Energy Efficiency Centres of Excellence 
throughout North America, Asia and Europe.
Intertek has been named an ‘EPA-Recognised Certification Body’  
for the new ENERGY STAR
®
 Enhanced Testing and Verification 
procedures, which will require manufacturers seeking use of  
the ENERGY STAR
®
 label to submit products for third-party 
certification from EPA-recognised certification bodies. 
 
‘This distinction by the EPA is a crowning achievement for Intertek,’ 
said Gregg Tiemann, Executive Vice President of Intertek’s 
Commercial and Electrical division. ‘Being the only EPA-Recognised 
Certification Body that has the breadth to cover all gas and electrical 
ENERGY STAR
®
 product categories is clear affirmation of Intertek’s 
market leading position and global expertise in energy efficiency 
across all types of products.’
Our values
Our principal aim is to use our resources to add value to our 
customers’ products and processes whilst employing the highest 
standards of integrity in business.
Our Mission Statement 
We will:
• value trust and personal responsibility; 
• act with integrity, honesty and respect;
•  deliver excellent services which add value to our 
customers’ business;
• focus on continual growth and outstanding performance;
• strive to create a safe work environment;
•  value each employee’s contribution toward achieving our 
business objectives;
•  promote a culture where motivated customer-orientated 
employees can flourish, experience professional fulfilment 
and reach their highest potential; and 
•  respect diverse perspectives, experiences and traditions 
as essential. Intertek Annual Report 2010 33
www.intertek.com
To help us ensure that our values are maintained:
personal integrity is as important as technical competence in our  •
recruitment and promotion decisions;
all employees and sub-contractors are required to sign the Group’s  •
Code of Ethics, which sets out our robust stance on upholding 
sound business ethics;
employees are trained regularly in our business ethics; •
our compliance network ensures that our policies and procedures  •
are properly applied in practice and that they remain appropriate 
to the business;
all employees have access to whistle-blowing hotlines. Employees  •
and external parties also have access to a hotline through the 
Group website; and
our Audit and Risk Committee regularly reviews the outcomes  •
from hotlines and compliance reports on behalf of the Board.
Our employees
Our principal strengths are the talent and integrity of our employees. 
Our intention is to unlock the potential of every employee to 
perform to the best of his or her abilities. This enables us to achieve 
maximum results for them, our customers and shareholders.
At 31 December 2010 we employed 27,000 people, an increase of 
7.4% over the prior year. The growth in employee numbers in each 
region over the past five years, is shown in the following graph.  
The largest increase during that period has been in the Asia Pacific 
region where 54% of employees are based. Because we operate  
in so many countries, we have adopted a framework of human 
resource policies to provide a guide to a fair and consistent approach 
to people around the Group.

Objectives
Our focus this year has been on:
•  assessing and improving the strength of our collective leadership; 
and
•  improving our capacity to attract, retain and motivate employees 
as our global presence expands.
Our policies
We have framework policies in place that enable fair treatment of 
employees across the Group, whilst still giving local managers the 
authority and flexibility to adopt what is right for their local area.  
As we grow, whether organically or by acquisition, we continue to 
promote and monitor these policies, which embrace matters such  
as fair recruitment, performance management, internal 
communications and remuneration.
The maps on pages 10 and 11 show how we are distributed 
geographically and why we strive to respect regional and cultural 
differences. Our human resource managers support the progress  
of our people through country-specific teams who are able to 
respond to local circumstances. Our strategy is to develop and 
promote locally for the best blend of understanding of the local 
market, with provision of career progress opportunities for everyone. 
We continue to give opportunities to the most talented individuals 
to advance into international management.
The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance 
to the Group. We aim to provide a safe working environment and 
ensure that our employees have the information and knowledge  
to perform their duties safely. We are committed to maintaining 
high standards and complying with relevant local legislation and 
guidelines in any area in which we operate. We continually seek  
to minimise risk to our employees and our procedures are regularly 
monitored by our compliance team to ensure that they are being 
properly applied in practice. 
As part of our equal opportunities policy, people with disabilities  
are given the same consideration as others when they apply for jobs. 
Depending on their skills and aptitudes, they enjoy the same career 
prospects as other employees. If employees become disabled every 
effort will be made to retain them in their current role or to look at 
possibilities for retraining or redeployment within the Group. Where 
necessary the Group aims to provide these employees with facilities, 
equipment and training to assist them in doing their jobs.
In the UK, Phillip Carson, one of our Quality Directors, and Derek 
Snowden, our UK Quality, Safety, Health and Environment Manager, 
contributed to the prestigious Institution of Chemical Engineers’ 
journal ‘Chemical Engineering Research and Design’ an article on 
health, safety and environment metrics and their application in 
promoting improvement. The depth of their expertise is an 
indication of the importance Intertek places on health and safety.
Intertek Singapore launched an employee safety campaign with a 
Laboratory Safety Day. More than 100 employees took part in the 
event designed to increase employee awareness of safety, which 
involved a quiz, slogan competition and a drawing competition for 
young family members. The day reinforced employees’ commitment 
to safety in a country where Intertek has reduced its lost-time injury 
rate by half in seven years.
Directors’ Report – Business Review 34 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Corporate Social Responsibility Report
In the US our injury and lost-time incident statistics once again 
improved over the previous year. 
Routine fire code, water quality, safety, and environmental audits 
took place in our US premises, without any significant citations.
Our safety programmes maintain an excellent regulatory compliance 
rating from external client-appointed safety consortia. Federal 
regulatory changes are reviewed when released and incorporated 
into the applicable safety programme.
Information about employees
It is important to monitor progress in matters such as diversity, 
employment of disabled people, training, employee retention  
and safety, to attain the best results for the Group. The more 
information we have, the better we will be able to make changes 
when they are necessary.
Group wide and regional human resource meetings and intranet 
based sharing of information are used to communicate objectives 
and share knowledge, and we have begun to introduce software 
that will once extended around the globe, provide us with more 
detailed and consistent data.
13% of the Intertek Council, which comprises the Group’s most 
senior functional and business leaders, are women.
17% of our senior leadership group, which includes about  
240 managers, are women.
Information for employees
Good communication is the basis of every successful relationship 
and we continually look for ways to increase the two-way 
communication opportunities with our employees. In particular,  
we ensure that our employees are aware of our Code of Ethics,  
risk and safety procedures. 
With the increasing range and complexity of our activities we are 
investing more in the flow of information across the Group to 
enhance commitment to Group values and consistency in how  
we support our customers and each other. We have extended the 
scope of our intranet to encourage Group-wide communication  
and knowledge sharing. Our intranet has become an online 
encyclopaedia of the Group, a home to internal communities,  
a reference for policies and information and an e-learning forum. 
We are delighted to have been awarded the 2010 Ektron All Stars 
Award for the best intranet site.
Our online training tool, SOLO, has been expanded to include a wide 
range of training modules including safety, technical, ethical, 
personal development and standard software training. The tool has 
been made available to new geographical locations and further 
developments are planned.
We use face-to-face review meetings, safety meetings, regular 
management meetings and, increasingly, country-focused 
newsletters to give and receive information. 
Employees are also able to use our confidential telephone and  
email hotlines if they have any issues that they want to communicate 
anonymously. All hotline calls are investigated sensitively by our 
compliance managers.
Our Intertek as One programme of cross-divisional liaison has 
contributed to increased knowledge of the Group and to better 
opportunities for our employees through regional and country-
based meetings, communications and workshops.
Share interests
We are committed to aligning the interests of our senior executives 
with the interests of shareholders and the Group’s performance 
through ownership of the Company’s shares. The Company 
operates a long-term incentive share plan for senior executives  
and requires the most senior of them to retain some of the shares 
they obtain through this plan. More information about the plan is 
contained in the Remuneration Report which starts on page 54.  
We are pleased to note that a number of our employees have 
chosen to invest in the Group and that shares to the value of around 
£10.4m were held by employees and Directors at the end of 2010.
Our communities
Because of the decentralised structure of our Group and the nature 
of our activities, community involvement is organised at local level  
by local managers. We recognise the importance of our relationship 
with the communities in which we operate, and encourage our 
businesses and employees to undertake community service and 
charitable giving. 
Employees from our Houston, USA headquarters and our Technical 
Centre in Deer Park, USA worked as ‘Rodeo Buddies’ at the Baytown 
Special Rodeo western theme day held for local special needs and 
handicapped children. Thirty staff members assisted children and 
their families participating in games, hay rides, horse riding and more.
In August 2010 our Singapore team took part in the New Moon  
Big Walk. The walk is a community project organised to raise rice for 
needy families in the North East Community Development Council’s 
constituencies in Singapore. Seventy-five Intertek employees and 
their families took part.
Hong Kong’s Red Cross blood transfusion service recognised the 
long term support for blood donation of staff at Intertek in Hong 
Kong with a special merit award in 2010.
At a Gymboree Play & Music event in China we used our expertise  
in child safety to advise parents and teachers how to choose safe 
products and what to look for when buying toys. Intertek Annual Report 2010 35
www.intertek.com
We also encourage the development of links with professional 
peers, providing lecturers and examiners and contributing to 
publications and presentations.
Our environment
As a service business, our consumption of energy is relatively 
insignificant and whilst we continually strive to make improvements 
in respect of our own operations, the positive impact we can have 
on the environment through our services to clients is far greater.
We have measured our carbon emissions at 10 key sites over the last 
four years to gain a better understanding of our energy use. This has 
helped us track the impact of various initiatives on CO2 emissions. 
Our compliance team carries out regular risk reviews at key sites,  
and as part of these reviews confirm that the sites comply with 
applicable environmental legislation. Any issues identified are 
corrected as part of the process. Local operational managers  
review environmental controls on a continuing basis.
In common with many areas of Intertek’s business, the 
implementation of our framework policy on the environment is 
operated by local management in accordance with relevant local 
legislation and guidelines. A number of projects have been carried 
out at a local level during the year. 
We have continued with the following:
reducing paper usage by introducing paper-free delivery to clients,  •
using electronic document management systems, using electronic 
communication with shareholders and increasing the use of the 
internet and intranet for all communications including voice calls;
increasing investment in low-energy equipment;  •
increasing recycling schemes throughout the Group;  •
reducing carbon-fuel travel by holding meetings by conference   •
call or Webinar and amending travel policies to include 
environmentally-friendly elements; and
‘green office’ initiatives have reduced paper usage, saved energy,  •
and cut costs.
In compliance with UK legislation we have declared our  
consumption of energy to the UK Environment Agency under the 
Energy Efficiency Scheme. Our declared consumption was 4,406 
megawatt hours.
Our new acquisition Metoc has been a winner of Anglian Water’s 
Corporate Responsibility Award for its technical solution that 
enabled Southend-on-Sea, in South East England, to retain Blue  
Flag status.
Our new green laboratory and office building in Mexico has 
environmental features that help reduce energy and water usage, 
carbon emissions and waste. The building is designed to maximise 
natural sunlight and the interior of the building uses light coloured 
materials with open floor plans and natural light to cut artificial 
lighting costs. Energy efficient lighting is used throughout the 
building. The cross-divisional headquarters building has an onsite 
water treatment plant that processes waste water from the textiles 
laboratory for use in the building’s gardens, cleaning areas and 
bathrooms. Biodegradable materials are used for cleaning 
and maintenance.
Intertek’s operational and compliance teams take an active role in 
identifying areas where the Group and its employees can have a 
positive effect on reducing our environmental impact. These include 
energy and water consumption, use of fuel by Group vehicles, 
reduced use of ozone-depleting substances and waste and by-
product production.
We aim to educate our employees so that we can all work  
towards a better future for the environment. For example, providing 
information on energy consumption is one of the ways we enlist  
the help of all employees in minimising specific and overall usage.
Our customers, standards providers, suppliers 
and shareholders
At Intertek we:
 maintain quality management systems in our divisions and  •
continually monitor the service we provide; 
value and serve our customers, as embodied in our customer- •
focused mission statement;
offer an integrated and unified service on a global basis; •
welcome feedback from all stakeholders; •
hold regular feedback meetings with customers and welcome  •
their inspection of our premises;
provide an accessible feedback service to assess the quality  •
of service provided; and
conduct customer satisfaction surveys.  •
Government regulators and industry bodies responsible for 
implementing better health, environmental, quality, safety and 
technical standards are also our stakeholders. We work with many 
standards bodies directly in a number of countries, such as Trading 
Standards in the UK to assist their development of standards. We  
are members of, and sometimes leaders of, standards development 
organisations and their technical committees.

in transforming the globally-recognised Energy Star
®
 Program into  
a third party energy efficiency certification program.
As a Group we do not have any individual suppliers on whom we 
are overly reliant and we aim to treat all suppliers with fairness and 
integrity. We strive to create relationships based on mutual trust and 
ensure payment of all invoices on a timely basis. 
Our global procurement teams, which are located in key regional 
bases, have introduced undertakings to be required of new 
suppliers, based on our own ethical guidelines.
We do not carry out testing on live animals.
Our Compliance Code sets out our business principles including  
their application in business relationships. The Code is available in 
the Compliance and Corporate Governance section of our website 
at www.intertek.com/investors/governance.
We work with our customers to make sure our Compliance Code  
is readily available and prominently displayed where inspection and 
audit activities take place. This encourages transparency and fosters 
open communication.
Communication with shareholders is given a high priority and a 
number of means are used to promote greater understanding  
and dialogue with investment audiences. Our investor 
programme includes:
regular individual meetings with shareholders and investment  •
managers during the year;
road shows in many countries;  •
regular analyst briefings; and  •
‘investor days’ where analysts and investors are invited to visit  •
some of our laboratories to meet our employees and observe 
work being performed.
In addition, Intertek has an experienced investor relations team to 
handle enquiries and report investor-related matters to the Board. 
Feedback on the Group’s investor programme has been positive  
and Intertek has a good relationship with investors and their 
representatives.
During the course of the year shareholders are kept informed on  
the progress of the Group through reports on our financial results, 
and other announcements of significant developments that are 
released through regulatory news services and our own website, 
which received a relaunch during the year. We have introduced the 
option of electronic communications with shareholders as a way  
of reducing paper-based reporting.  Intertek Annual Report 2010 37

Our corporate social responsibility structure
Intertek has businesses in many locations around the world.  
Our activities are organised to permit local managers to manage 
their operations within the framework established by the Board  
of Intertek Group plc. We consider local managers are best placed  
to understand and react to their local business environment. 
The corporate social responsibility framework within which these 
activities are to be managed, has been formally adopted by the 
Board of Intertek Group plc.
General policy
Intertek’s core businesses provide services that are ultimately of 
benefit to consumers and other stakeholders. We test substances  
for purity and performance. We test products for safety and quality. 
We measure air and noise emissions. We review imports to assess 
their content accurately. We provide advice that can lead to greater 
efficiency of production or operation. We carry out audits to help 
ensure that factory conditions and work practices are legal, humane 
and ethical. Intertek takes seriously the benefits that our businesses 
confer and will continue to endeavour in all its dealings to improve 
quality, safety and to bring about environmental benefits through 
improved efficiency of products. 
Environmental policy
Intertek will strive to prevent its operations causing adverse impact 
on the environment. We will comply with national environmental 
legislation and will endeavour to identify, monitor and control our 
environmental risks. We will seek to reduce emissions, effluents, 
waste and adverse effect on biodiversity. We will commit to 
recycling schemes and energy efficiency. We will provide benefits  
in respect of environmental impacts through our testing of 
environmental standards and will operate safely.
Ethical policy
Intertek prohibits the offer, giving or acceptance of bribes in any 
form. Intertek prohibits the provision of improper benefits. No 
reward, gift or favour dependent on the outcome of any work will 
be accepted by employees. Employees shall operate free from any 
conflict of interest. 
Employee policy
Intertek will strive to provide a safe and healthy environment for 
its employees to work in. It will comply with national employee 
legislation. In the absence of any local prescription, employees will 
be assessed solely on the basis of their ability irrespective of their 
race, religion, colour, age, disabilities, gender or sexual orientation  
or their participation in legitimate union activities. Employees’ 
diverse perspectives, experiences and traditions will be respected. 
Wherever possible, employees’ personal growth will be fostered 
through the provision of training. 
Community and stakeholder policy
Intertek will take into account, when making decisions, of their 
impact on all relevant stakeholders. 
Business practices policy

We have cascaded these policies through our management teams 
and published them on our corporate intranet. Employees are 
encouraged to supply ideas and information concerning our CSR 
performance by contacting us through the intranet.
Overall and ultimate responsibility for the Group’s CSR policies, 
issues and their implementation lies with the Chief Executive Officer. 
Direction falls under the remit of the Group Executive Vice President 
for Human Resources.
Directors’ Report – Business Review 38 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Foreign currency risks
The Group reports its financial results in 
sterling. A significant majority of the 
Group’s revenue and operating costs 
are incurred in currencies other than 
sterling. Accordingly, the Group’s profit 
is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. 
Two types of risk arise as a result:
(i) Translation risk
The risk of adverse exchange rate 
fluctuations affecting the translation  
of the foreign currency denominated 
net assets into the Group’s functional 
currency (pounds sterling).
(ii) Transaction risk
The risk of adverse exchange rate 
fluctuations affecting the sterling value 
of cash flows.
The Group’s policy is to match the 
currency of external borrowings to the 
currency of expected cash flows and 
the currency of net investments.
The Group’s policy requires overseas 
subsidiaries to hedge all significant 
transaction exposures with Group 
Treasury.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries 
represent a significant majority of the 
Group’s shareholders funds and a 
substantial percentage of the Group’s 
revenue and operating costs are 
incurred in currencies other than 
sterling. Accordingly the Group’s  
profit is exposed to exchange 
rate fluctuations.
Material changes in the exchange rates 
can create volatility in the results when 
they are translated into sterling.
Interest rate risk
The risk of adverse interest rate 
fluctuations.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that 
between 33% and 67% of its exposure 
to changes in interest rates on 
borrowings is on a fixed rate basis. 
Material changes in interest rates  
can create volatility in the results by 
increasing or reducing the cost  
of borrowing. 
Principal Risk/Uncertainty Description Commentary
This section sets out a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the 
Intertek Group’s strategy, performance, results, financial condition 
and reputation.
Risk framework
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and 
oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. There is  
an established, structured approach to risk management, which 
is described in the Corporate Governance Report which starts on 
page 46. All levels of management are responsible for managing  
and controlling risk throughout the Group. The Vice President of Risk 
Management and Internal Audit, who reports to the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Audit and Risk Committee, has accountability for 
reporting the key risks, controls and mitigating actions. Risks are 
formally identified and recorded in a risk matrix for each operating 
division and support function. The risk register is updated at least 
annually and is used to plan the Group’s internal audit and risk 
strategy. In addition to the risk matrix, all senior executives and their 
direct reports are required to complete an annual return to confirm 
that management controls have been effectively applied during the 
year. The return covers operations, compliance, risk management 
and finance. The Vice President of Risk Management and Internal 
Audit attends the meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee,  
and meets with the members of that committee alone at least  
once a year.
The Group Risk Controls and Assurance Committee complements 
the work of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Committee oversees 
the development and improvement of the Group’s internal control 
and assurance and the related procedures and systems arising 
therefrom and also oversees the operation and implementation  
of the procedures and systems identified. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Intertek Operations Committee where 
Group-wide policies are identified and develops the Group’s 
integrated responses to changes in the regulatory environment. 
In common with all businesses, the Group is affected by a number 
of risk factors, some of which are outside our control. Although 
many of the risk factors influencing the Group’s performance are 
macroeconomic and likely to affect the performance of business 
enterprises generally, others are particular to Intertek’s operations. 
Specific risks of which we are aware are detailed below, however 
there may be other risks that are currently unknown or regarded  
as immaterial which could turn out to be material. Any of these  
risks could have the potential to impact the performance of the 
Group, its assets, liquidity and capital resources. 
The principal risks and uncertainties of the Group are listed on  
the following tables together with commentary on mitigating 
actions that the Group has identified to manage these risks.  
These risks and uncertainties do not appear in any particular  
order of potential materiality or probability of occurrence. Intertek Annual Report 2010 39
www.intertek.com Directors’ Report – Business Review
Liquidity risk
The risk that the Group is unable to 
meet its financial obligations as and 
when they fall due.
Group Treasury manages liquidity  
risk through the use of daily forecast 
headroom calculations maintaining 
sufficient committed borrowing 
facilities from a range of investors. 
Group Treasury is in regular contact 
with the banks and capital debt 
markets, as well as other potential 
providers of debt to ensure a proper 
understanding of the availability and 
pricing of debt funding. The Group’s 
facilities are managed to ensure that 
borrowing facilities are of a mixed 
duration, mitigating the amount of 
borrowings that mature within a  
single period.
The availability of a liquidity buffer that 
is able, in the short term, to absorb the 
net effects of transactions made and 
expected changes in liquidity both 
under normal and stressed conditions 
without incurring unacceptable losses 
or risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation.
Credit risk
Customers 
Counterparties to a financial 
instrument.
All companies in the Group are 
required to operate a credit policy 
under which each new customer is 
analysed individually for creditworthiness 
before the company transacts business 
with the customer. Incentive schemes 
are in place to encourage and reward 
managers for minimising the extent of 
days sales outstanding for each division.
The Group monitors the distribution of 
cash deposits, borrowings and hedging 
instruments which are assigned to each 
of the Group’s counterparties and 
which are subject to periodic review.
This risk arises principally from the 
Group’s receivables from customers. 
There is limited concentration of  
credit risk with respect to trade 
receivables as the Group has a large 
number of customers which are 
internationally dispersed.
This risk arises with respect  
to a counterparty to a financial  
instrument who may fail to meet  
its contractual obligations.
Taxation risk
The risk that the value of tax assets  
and liabilities in the Group’s financial 
statements are misstated, resulting  
in financial loss to the Group, or that 
taxation regimes change, increasing  
the tax take in key countries.
The Group considers the tax estimates, 
assumptions and judgements to be 
reasonable but this can involve complex 
issues which may take a number of 
years to resolve. The final determination 
of tax liabilities could be different from 
the estimates reflected in the 
financial statements. 
The Group operates in more than 100 
countries and is subject to a wide range 
of complex tax laws and regulations.
Principal Risk/Uncertainty Description Commentary
 
Loss of key facilities
The risk that assets of the Group could 
be damaged or destroyed.
The Group maintains disaster recovery 
plans at key facilities for such events 
and endeavours to ensure that 
adequate insurance is in place. 
Intertek operates facilities in geographical 
locations which are subject to local, 
environmental and political factors. 
Natural disasters can disrupt operations, 
causing loss of revenue.  40 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Principal Risks
Principal Risk/Uncertainty Description Commentary
Risk of litigation
The risk that the Group could suffer  
a material financial loss resulting from  
a legal judgement against the Group 
which could also result in adverse 
publicity damaging the reputation  
of the Group. 
To reduce the likelihood of claims 
arising, the Group has extensive  
quality assurance and control 
procedures. All incidents that could 
potentially result in a claim against  
the Group are reported to compliance 
officers and are logged in a database  
of incidents. The Company Secretary 
reports significant claims to the Audit 
and Risk Committee. Legal counsel is 
appointed if appropriate. The Group 
mitigates the risk of financial loss 
arising from litigation by maintaining 
substantial insurance against potential 
claims although there is no certainty 
that this will be sufficient to cover any 
ultimate loss.
The Group is sometimes notified of,  
or involved in, claims and proceedings 
which are incidental to its ordinary 
course of business. Claims can arise 
where the Group has provided testing, 
inspection or certification services on 
behalf of customers.
Legal and regulatory compliance
The Group is subject worldwide to laws 
and regulations that govern and/or 
affect where and how our business 
may be conducted. This includes 
employment legislation.
The Group has implemented  
internal compliance and audit  
systems to facilitate compliance  
with the requirements of the laws  
and regulations affecting our 
business conduct. 
Non-compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations could result in criminal 
or civil liability on behalf of the Company 
and/or the Directors, imposition of 
significant fines, as well as negative 
publicity and reputational damage.
Dependence on accreditation
The risk of the loss of accreditations 
and affiliations that manufacturers 
need for the global market entry of 
their products. 
The Group has extensive quality 
assurance procedures and routines 
embedded through the Group to 
ensure that accreditations are 
maintained and that we uphold the 
highest standards in both our testing 
methods and our business practices.
Accreditations are granted by 
governments, accreditation bodies, 
manufacturers, retailers and other 
bodies to the legal entities operating 
within Intertek. Each accreditation has 
a defined scope and is site specific and 
is subject to regular audits. Failure to 
retain an accreditation could lead to 
loss of business in the relevant industry 
sector and damage to our reputation.
Risk of financial irregularities
The risk that the assets of the Group 
could be misappropriated resulting  
in financial loss to the Group, as  
well as the risk of management 
misrepresenting results.
The Group operates a rigorous 
programme of internal audits and 
management reviews. Each of the 
senior financial executives are  
regularly reminded of their fiduciary 
responsibilities and they and their  
direct reports are required to complete 
an annual return to confirm that 
management controls have been 
effectively applied during the year.
The Group has established financial and 
management controls in place to 
ensure that the Group’s assets are 
protected from major financial risks.
A sophisticated system of financial 
reporting is in place to facilitate the 
monthly monitoring of financial results. 
Regional financial centres around the 
world monitor and control local 
financial reporting. Group head office 
consolidates and controls worldwide 
financial reporting. Intertek Annual Report 2010 41
www.intertek.com Directors’ Report – Business Review
Environmental health and safety risks
The exposure to complex worldwide 
laws and regulations governing 
activities that may have adverse 
environmental effects.
The Group endeavours to be in 
compliance with all applicable 
environmental and health and safety 
laws where failure to comply would 
materially and adversely affect 
the Group.
Environmental laws and regulations 
may impose obligations to investigate 
and remediate or pay for the 
investigation and remediation of 
environmental contamination, and 
compensate public and private parties 
for related damages. 
Political risk
Political risk is the risk that the Group 
could suffer financial losses due to 
government actions.
The Group manages this risk by 
regularly reviewing the countries in 
which it operates and exiting those 
where the risk is considered 
unacceptable. The Group also 
maintains close relationships with 
government representatives but the risk 
of adverse government action cannot 
be entirely mitigated (See note 29 on 
page 117 for the location of major 
operating subsidiaries).
The Group operates in some countries 
where there is potential risk of political 
instability which can make it difficult to 
operate. In particular, government 
contracts in the Oil, Chemical & Agri 
division can be subject to change or 
termination at short notice.
Reputational risk
The risk of losing our reputation in the 
marketplace as an independent and 
trustworthy entity.
A combination of awareness training 
and targeted controls is in place to 
encourage and monitor adherence  
to these principles and prevent such 
events occurring. Media comments 
with regard to Group activities are 
centrally reviewed in order that senior 
management can, where necessary, 
take corrective action on a timely basis. 
The Group has a ‘whistle blowing’ 
programme, managed by the Group 
Risk, Controls and Assurance 
Committee, which is designed to 
encourage staff to report, without risk, 
any fraudulent or other activity likely to 
adversely affect the reputation of the 
Group. There is a zero tolerance policy 
with regard to any inappropriate 
behaviour by any individual employed 
by the Group.
Classroom and on-line training in our 
ethical policies is available to staff.
There is a rigorous and independent 
financial and legal due diligence process 
applied to every material transaction 
entered into by the Group in order to 
identify and mitigate any reputational 
risk prior to any acquisition taking place.
The Group’s primary business objectives 
require adherence to local, national  
and international laws and require  
all the Group’s employees to operate 
professionally, fairly and with integrity 
and honesty in all business dealings. 
Failure to follow these principles could 
result in adverse publicity which could 
harm our reputation among our 
customers, damage our brand  
and affect both our operational 
performance and financial position.
There is a reputational risk arising from 
any merger or acquisition entered into 
by the Group. There is a rigorous and 
independent financial and legal ‘due 
diligence’ process applied to every 
transaction entered into by the Group 
in order to identify and mitigate any 
reputational risk prior to any acquisition 
taking place.

Directors’ Report – Governance 46 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Corporate Governance Report
Chairman’s foreword
The Board of Intertek Group plc recognises and is committed to  
the highest standards of corporate governance. On 27 May 2010  
the Financial Reporting Council issued the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘new Code’) following its review of the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in June 2008 (the ‘Combined Code’), which is the end result of  
a year of consultation on the state of governance in the UK. 
The new Code applies to accounting periods beginning on or  
after 29 June 2010. 
In July 2010 the Board reviewed and discussed the new Code, 
noting that the ‘comply or explain’ reporting mechanism continues 
to underpin the UK corporate governance system and that the 
proposed changes have been made to increase the effectiveness  
of boards and make them more accountable to their shareholders. 
The Board concluded that Intertek Group plc is in a strong position 
to comply with the provisions of that Code. However, we will 
continue to explain fully our reasons for any non-compliance if the 
Board feels compliance is not in the best interests of the Company  
or our shareholders. In line with the recommendation made by the 
new Code we have decided to introduce the annual re-election of  
all directors from 2011. 
To ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board, each year all 
directors take part in a rigorous review of its effectiveness and the 
results of this review are discussed at the January Board meeting and 
an action plan formulated. During 2010 the Nominations Committee 
continued to consider if the Board has the right balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge necessary to face 
challenges on key business decisions and risks. We have recently 
announced that two additional Non-Executive Directors, Michael 
Wareing and Alan Brown will be joining the Board with effect from 
15 April 2011. I am delighted that they will be joining us and am sure 
that they will make a valuable addition to the Intertek Board. Steps 
have been taken to further strengthen the internal controls and risk 
management structures within the business. All these areas are 
described more fully in the following Corporate Governance Report.
I can confirm on behalf of the Board of Intertek Group plc that we 
are resolute in adhering to strong corporate governance guidelines 
and practices to ensure the continued effectiveness of the Board  
and the long-term success of the Group.

Governance framework
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and this report outlines its compliance with the provisions of the 
Combined Code which remains applicable to the accounting period 
under review, until the new Code becomes effective. The Combined 
Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. Throughout 2010 the Group 
complied with all but one of the provisions of the Combined Code. 
The one area of non-compliance is that prior to 13 May 2010 the 
membership of the Audit and Risk Committee included Vanni Treves, 
Chairman of the Company, which did not accord with the 
requirement of section C.3.1 of the Combined Code. On 13 May 
2010 the Board reviewed and discussed the composition of the 
Audit and Risk Committee. As Edward Astle had been appointed  
to that committee in 2009, the Board agreed to accept the decision 
of Vanni Treves to step down as a member of the Committee and 
since that date the composition of the Committee has complied  
with the Combined Code. 
The Board is responsible and accountable to shareholders for 
ensuring that the Company is appropriately managed and that  
it achieves its objectives. The Board’s main role is to understand  
and meet its obligations to the Company’s shareholders and others,  
to lead the Group within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed, to approve 
the Group’s strategic objectives and to ensure that sufficient 
resources are available to enable it to meet those objectives.  
The Board also ensures that plans are in place for orderly succession  
for appointments to the Board and to senior management.
During the year, the Board consisted of a Non-Executive Chairman, 
three Executive Directors and five independent Non-Executive 
Directors. All Directors have a wide range of experience and skills, 
bringing independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct. The Directors' 
biographies appear on page 43. During the year, the Board met 
eight times, in addition to frequent informal contact between 
Directors to discuss the Group’s affairs and develop its business. 
Directors’ attendance at Board meetings is shown in the table on the 
right. Also on several occasions during 2010, the Chairman met with 
the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being 
present. The Non-Executive Directors have also had discussions 
without the Chairman being present. 
If a Director has any concerns about the Group or a proposed 
action, then such concerns are recorded in the Board minutes  
as a matter of course. To enable the Board to discharge its duties,  
all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. 
Papers are circulated well before the Board and Committee meetings 
to ensure that Directors have the necessary time to read and review. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive monthly management reports  
and information which enable them to scrutinise the Group’s  
and management’s performance against agreed objectives and  
prior performance.

Directors’ Report – Governance 48 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Corporate Governance Report
Role of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and  
Senior Independent Director
In order to avoid any one individual having unfettered powers, 
there is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman  
and the Chief Executive Officer. These have been set out in writing 
and approved by the Board. 
Vanni Treves was appointed Chairman of the Board in May 2002,  
at which point he met the independence criteria as set out in the 
Combined Code. His responsibilities as Chairman include: the 
leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects  
of its role and setting its agenda; ensuring that the Directors  
receive accurate, timely and clear information; ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders; facilitating the effective 
contribution to the Board of the Non-Executive Directors in 
particular; and ensuring constructive relationships between the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman’s other  
main commitments are detailed in his biography on page 43. 
Wolfhart Hauser, the Chief Executive Officer, has direct charge  
of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board  
for the financial and operational performance of the Group.
David Allvey was appointed Senior Independent Director in May 
2002. His responsibilities include leading the Non-Executive 
Directors’ annual consideration of the Chairman’s performance  
and holding discussions with the Non-Executive Directors without 
management present. David Allvey is readily available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that remain unresolved after 
contacting the Group through the usual channels of the Chairman 
or any of the Executive Directors, or where such contact is 
inappropriate. 
Board balance and independence
The Nominations Committee reviewed the independence of all the 
Non-Executive Directors taking into account the criteria outlined  
in A.3.1 of the Combined Code. As a result, there was no change  
to the independent status of the current Non-Executive Directors  
and the Board considers David Allvey, Edward Astle, Gavin Darby, 
Christopher Knight and Debra Rade to be independent in character  
and judgement. All the Non-Executive Directors continue to 
demonstrate the necessary characteristics of independence expected 
by the Board and they have no material relationships or links  
to the business which would compromise their independence. 
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to 
ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are 
fully discussed and critically examined, not only in the best long-term 
interests of shareholders, but also to ensure that they take proper 
account of the interests of customers, employees and other 
stakeholders. The Non-Executive Directors are all experienced 
individuals and through their mix of skills and business experience 
they contribute significantly to the effective functioning of the Board 
and its committees, ensuring that matters are fully debated and that 
no one individual or group dominates the decision-making process.
At the forthcoming AGM all Directors will stand for re-election 
by shareholders.
Professional development
Upon appointment to the Board, new Non-Executive Directors 
receive a formal induction programme, co-ordinated by the Group 
Company Secretary, tailored to suit the individual’s previous 
experience. Ongoing training is provided to Directors as necessary, 
for example, on best practice and changes in legislation, 
developments in the economic and regulatory environment and  
on the Company’s businesses. In addition, visits to sites are usually 
arranged at least once a year and one Board meeting is held abroad 
which provides an opportunity for the Board to meet more senior 
managers within the Group and to further their knowledge of the 
Group’s operations. In November 2010 meetings were held in Miami 
with the focus on reviewing and discussing the regional strategy  
for Latin America. During the visit the Board met members of the 
Intertek Operations Committee and other senior managers within 
the Group. The Non-Executive Directors also attend various seminars 
during the year on topics relevant to a publicly listed company.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary, who will assist in arranging any additional 
training and information as required. The appointment and removal 
of the Group Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as 
a whole.
All Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional  
advice, at the Group’s expense, in the performance of their duties as 
Directors. No such advice was sought during the year. The Company 
has granted an indemnity, to the extent permitted by law, to each of 
the Directors and Group Company Secretary. Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance is in place.
  Intertek Annual Report 2010 49
www.intertek.com
The Board believes that strong corporate governance improves the 
performance of the business and enhances shareholder value. During 
its meetings in 2010 the Board received and discussed reports from  
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer on strategy, debt financing, market reports, share trading 
reports, analysts’ forecasts, potential acquisitions, litigation reports, 
final and interim dividend recommendations, potential contract bids, 
road show and investor feedback, budgets, tax policy, Annual Report, 
Half Year Results, interim management statements, announcements 
and a wide range of other issues. 
Performance evaluation
Once again, the Board engaged in a rigorous performance  
evaluation process led by the Chairman comprising a series of  
detailed questionnaires which provide a framework for the evaluation 
process. This provides a source of information not just on the Board’s 
performance but also on that of individual Directors and the Chairman. 
There are questionnaires for each of the following: the Board;  
each individual Director; and the Audit and Risk, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees. For 2010, no external facilitated evaluation 
was carried out as it was felt that an internal evaluation continued  
to be appropriate. The performance evaluation process will continue  
to be under review in the future. 
This annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees ensures that the performance of each individual  
Director and the functioning and constitution of the Board and  
each Committee are properly measured and debated. 
The Chairman assesses the individual performance of each Director, 
taking into account discussions with other Directors. The Senior 
Independent Director has discussions with the other Executive  
and Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman being present,  
in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance during the year.
Following feedback from the Board evaluation process which was 
discussed by the Board in January 2010, presentations from senior 
management to the Board have continued throughout 2010 and 
a session held on regional strategy to increase the understanding  
of the operations and opportunities. Each of the presentations made 
to the Board also includes a section on risk to ensure that all Directors 
are fully briefed in this area. The performance of the Board and each 
Director was, and is, effective, and all Directors demonstrate full 
commitment in their respective roles to the Company evidenced,  
inter alia, by the Board and Committee attendance records set out  
in this report. The evaluations further demonstrate that the Board  
has an appropriate set of skills, that all the Directors add value to  
the overall effectiveness and success of the Group, and that no 
substantial issues have arisen out of the evaluation process. 
The Audit and Risk, Nominations and Remuneration Committees 
also each held an evaluation of their work and effectiveness during  
the year, the results of which were reported to the Board by the 
Group Company Secretary. The reviews concluded that each 
Committee was operating in an efficient and effective manner.  
The Board will continue to develop the evaluation process in order  
to ensure that it can properly review, on an annual basis, its 
performance and that of its individual members and Committees. 
Procedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts of interests
The Board has a formal system to deal with conflicts of Directors’ 
interests. Each year all Directors complete a questionnaire in order  
to identify any conflicts or potential conflicts of interests. The 
decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by non-
conflicted Directors, meaning those who have no interest in the 
matter being considered. The authorised decisions are reviewed on 
an annual basis or, where appropriate, authorisation is sought prior 
to the appointment of any new directors or if a new conflict arises. 
During 2010 this procedure operated effectively.
The Board and its Committees
The Group has identified a number of key areas that are subject  
to regular reporting to the Board, so that the performance of 
management can be reviewed and monitored. A Board Approval 
Matrix is in place which formally outlines the matters specifically 
requiring the consent of the full Board. Matters include:
group strategy; •
annual budget; •
annual Report, Half Year Results and related announcements; •
capital expenditure; •
acquisitions, disposals and other transactions outside  •
delegated limits;
material contracts; •
dividend policy; •
approval of tax, treasury and risk management policies. •
The Board Approval Matrix also identifies areas where the Board has 
delegated authority to executive management, subject to certain 
financial limits. Where any of the activities involve amounts greater 
than those limits they are referred to the Board. 
Directors’ Report – Governance 50 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Corporate Governance Report
In order to operate effectively and to give appropriate attention 
and consideration to matters, the Board has established three 
Committees, each with clearly defined terms of reference, procedures 
and powers. These terms of reference are available on request from 
the Group Company Secretary at the registered office or can be 
downloaded from www.intertek.com. These Committees comprise 
the Remuneration Committee, the Nominations Committee and 
the Audit and Risk Committee. The Board is kept informed by 
the Committee chairmen through the provision of a summary 
of the issues discussed and decisions taken by the Committee.
The following sections explain the responsibilities of each Board 
Committee and the areas that they covered during the year. 
The Remuneration Committee
At the end of 2010, this Committee comprised three independent 
Non-Executive Directors, David Allvey (Chairman), Gavin Darby and 
Christopher Knight together with Vanni Treves. The Combined Code 
requires the Remuneration Committee to have at least three 
independent Non-Executive Directors whilst allowing the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors of the Company, if considered independent 
on appointment, to be a member.
The Committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with 
the Board the framework or board policy for the remuneration of 
the Chairman, the Executive Directors and senior executives and for 
the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of additional 
benefits for each of the Executive Directors, including pension rights 
and any compensation for loss of office. The Committee is also 
responsible for the implementation and operation of employee share 
incentive arrangements. Details of the matters discussed and actions 
taken by the Remuneration Committee, including the Group’s 
remuneration for Executive Directors, and details of benefits, share 
options, pension entitlements, service contracts and compensation 
payments are given in the Remuneration Report which starts on 
page 54.
Membership and attendance at meetings during the year was  
as follows:
Name Attendance*
David Allvey Chairman 7 (7)
Gavin Darby 7 (7)
Christopher Knight 7 (7)
Vanni Treves 7 (7)
*  Actual attendance (maximum number) of meetings a Director could attend  
as a Committee member.
The Nominations Committee 
This Committee currently comprises, Vanni Treves (Chairman),  
David Allvey and Christopher Knight. During 2010 this Committee 
was evaluated and the Board agreed that membership of the 
Committee was appropriate and effective. The composition  
of the Committee is in compliance with the Combined Code.
The main purpose of the Committee is to nominate candidates to  
fill Board vacancies, review talent mapping and succession planning 
for the Board and senior management and make recommendations 
on the balance and composition of the Board. In the event of any 
perceived conflict of interest, a sub committee comprising non-
conflicted Directors is appointed.
During the year the Board accepted the Committee’s 
recommendations that Lloyd Pitchford be appointed as successor  
to Bill Spencer who retired as Chief Financial Officer from the Board 
on 31 March 2010. 
The Nominations Committee membership and attendance at 
meetings was as follows during the year:
Name  Attendance*
Vanni Treves Chairman 2 (2)
David Allvey 2 (2)
Christopher Knight 2 (2)
*  Actual attendance (maximum number) of meetings a Director could attend  
as a Committee member.
Organisation and succession planning are important components in 
ensuring the continued success of the Group. As part of the strategy 
processes our operations plan the future organisation needed and 
address the consequent talent pipelines for all key roles across the 
Group. The Group first introduced a global integrated approach  
to talent in 2006. This is central to building our customer-centric 
organisation for continued growth. Linked with the other HR 
frameworks in place across the Group, this delivers a pragmatic 
approach to talent management in a global yet geographically 
dispersed business. 
Organisation and talent reviews cascade across the global organisation 
conducted by ‘career committees’ of the appropriate Executives. The 
principal actions resulting from these reviews relate to development  
of executive capacity across Intertek. Annual reviews of the overall 
process and global priorities, as well as detailed plans at the most 
senior levels, are reviewed annually by the Nominations Committee.
Bearing in mind the balance of existing skills, knowledge and 
experience of the Board, a job description is prepared for any new 
Board position and when a Non-Executive Director is appointed, the 
Committee requires confirmation that he or she can devote sufficient 
time to fulfil the commitments of the role. The Committee ensures 
that the search for any board candidate is conducted, on merit, 
against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of 
diversity on the board, including gender. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection 
by any person at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting 
and during the meeting). All new Directors are subject to election  
by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment and then 
subject to re-election by shareholders every year. Intertek Annual Report 2010 51
www.intertek.com
The policy on Directors’ service contracts is set out in the 
Remuneration Report.
The Audit and Risk Committee
This Committee currently comprises three Non-Executive Directors, 
David Allvey (Chairman), Edward Astle and Christopher Knight.  
Until 13 May 2010 Vanni Treves also served as a member of the 
Committee. As Chairman of the Board of Directors, Vanni Treves 
was not viewed as independent and therefore the Committee did 
not comply with the Combined Code. Notwithstanding the non-
compliance with the Combined Code, the Committee felt that  
Vanni Treves continued to contribute valuable legal knowledge and 
experience to the discussions of the Committee and hence remained 
a member until 13 May 2010 when, following the appointment of 
Edward Astle in September 2009, Vanni Treves stepped down as  
a member of the Committee. Both David Allvey and Christopher 
Knight have recent and relevant financial experience as detailed  
in their biographies on page 43.
The key functions of the Audit and Risk Committee are to monitor 
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s performance and review  
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and  
risk management. In accordance with its terms of reference,  
the Committee is responsible for:
monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process   •
and making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and remuneration of the external 
auditors, and for ensuring that an appropriate relationship  
is maintained between the Group and its external auditors; 
reviewing annually the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of  •
internal control, risk management, the processes for monitoring 
and evaluating the risks facing the Group and the efficacy of the 
internal audit function; 
monitoring the progress of internal audit activity against the  •
annual plan, and reviewing the strategy, scope and approach  
of the internal audit and risk management teams; 
reviewing the corrective action taken by management to address  •
any control issues identified by the internal audit and risk 
management function; and
approving the appointment and termination of the Vice President  •
Risk Management and Internal Audit and meeting with him  
at least once a year without management present.
Committee meetings are usually attended by the Group’s external 
auditors, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice 
President Financial Control and the Vice President Risk Management 
and Internal Audit. The Group’s external auditors meet with the 
members of the Audit and Risk Committee at least once a year 
without management present.
The Audit and Risk Committee seeks to ensure the continued 
independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors.  
A revised policy on the provision of non-audit work by the external 
auditors has been approved in February 2011 to ensure that auditors’ 
objectivity and independence are safeguarded. To this end, the policy 
highlights those areas where the external auditor cannot provide 
services to the Group, including inter alia, the provision of Group 
management functions, internal audit outsourcing, provision of legal 
advice and recruitment and remuneration advice. The external auditors 
confirm by way of a letter to the Board that processes to ensure 
compliance with this policy are in place, and that these processes are 
monitored regularly. A detailed breakdown of the audit and non-audit 
fees paid to the Group’s auditors during the year is set out in note 5  
to the financial statements.
The Committee has recommended to the Board that KPMG Audit Plc 
be reappointed the Group’s external auditor at the forthcoming AGM.
 
At its meetings during 2010 the Committee reviewed and endorsed 
prior to submission to the Board, the Group’s 2009 Annual Report and 
2010 Half Year Results. The Chairman and other Committee members 
also attend meetings with the external auditors and management to 
discuss any accounting issues associated with the annual audit. It also 
reviewed the Group’s arrangements for the avoidance and detection 
of fraud and related matters, whistle-blowing and hotlines, 
compliance, training, quality assurance systems and potential claims 
affecting the Group.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and the Half Year Results announcement remains with 
the Board.

Directors’ Report – Governance 52 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Corporate Governance Report
Internal control
The Group’s primary business objectives require adherence to local, 
national and international laws and require the Group’s employees 
to show integrity and honesty in all business dealings. Risk 
management and internal controls are therefore embedded in the 
running of each division and support function, assuring the accuracy 
and validity of reports and certificates that the Group provides to 
customers. The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
the Group’s system of internal control and risk management and  
for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system can realistically only 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
There are number of controls in place to ensure that the Group 
has robust procedures for preparing consolidated accounts and for 
financial reporting. Intertek has a clear set of Accounting Policies and 
Procedures available to all staff. This gives instructions on accounting 
treatment and reporting. There are ongoing reviews of adherence to 
these policies by Group Internal Audit and by Finance Management. 
The Group is audited externally by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Board confirms that in addition to internal audits, there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any 
significant risks to the Group’s short-and long-term value, including 
those arising from social, environmental and ethical matters. This 
process, which is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with 
the Turnbull Guidance, has been in place for the year under review  
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. Any breaches 
of internal controls identified by the Group’s control review 
procedures are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee and 
corrective action taken. In carrying out the risk review, the Board is 
satisfied that it received adequate information from the operations 
around the world. Training is provided to Directors on these matters 
where necessary. 
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of financial and non-financial internal control during the year. 
In particular, it has reviewed and continues to seek to improve the 
process for identifying and evaluating all significant risks affecting 
the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks  
are managed. This is reinforced by the Intertek Compliance Code  
and Code of Ethics, which provide practical guidance and instruction 
for employees. The Codes are available at www.intertek.com. 
The Group maintains a robust stance in regard to breaches of ethics 
and all employees are required to sign a certificate confirming their 
understanding that any breaches of the Group’s Code of Ethics will 
result in disciplinary action that may include summary dismissal of 
the employee concerned. To support Group policies and to facilitate 
the raising of concerns about possible improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or any other matters, the Group provides and 
publicises email and telephone hotlines so that staff may report 
anonymously any inaccurate or unethical working practices. 
All complaints are investigated thoroughly with action taken  
as appropriate. The number of complaints received, together  
with the corrective actions taken, is reported to the Audit and  
Risk Committee. During 2010, 141 complaints were received and 
investigated (122 in 2009). The Group continues to publicise the 
existence of hotlines to internal and external parties, and sees 
hotlines as an important tool in eradicating isolated cases of poor 
behaviour. Most investigations concluded that the complaint was 
unfounded, but corrective action was taken where appropriate.
In carrying out its review, the Audit and Risk Committee endeavours 
to ensure that the Group has in place the most appropriate and 
effective controls, checks, systems and risk management techniques 
so as to be in line with best practice on such matters. During 2010 
the control environment within the Group has been strengthened  
by the establishment of two internal committees. The Risk Control 
and Assurance Committee (‘RCA’) was established in July 2010  
with the remit of overseeing the development of the internal  
control framework, reviewing risk matrices and risk management 
procedures, monitoring issues and providing a conduit of 
information to senior management. The Committee comprises the 
Chief Financial Officer, Group Company Secretary, Group Executive 
Vice President of Human Resources, Vice President Financial Control, 
Chief Financial Officer Asia and Vice President Risk Management and 
Internal Audit and meets every month. An Investment Committee 
has also been established with the remit of approving and reviewing 
requests for expenditure throughout the business within certain 
limits as outlined in the Board Approval Matrix. This Committee 
comprises the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
Each operating division and support function is responsible for the 
identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to that 
area of business, together with the design and operation of suitable 
internal controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and 
are reviewed by the RCA, and may be associated with a variety  
of internal or external factors including control breakdowns, 
disruption of information systems, litigation, loss of key facilities, 
retention of key staff, competition, natural catastrophe and 
regulatory requirements. Operation of the controls is designed  
to minimise the occurrence of risk or its consequences.  Intertek Annual Report 2010 53
www.intertek.com
A process of control using self-assessment and hierarchical  
reporting has been established which provides a documented  
trail of accountability. These procedures are applied across Group 
operations and provide for continuing assurances to be given at 
increasingly higher levels of management and finally, to the Board. This 
process is facilitated by Internal Audit which also provides assurance as 
to the operation and validity of the system of internal controls. Planned 
corrective actions are independently monitored for timely completion.
Each division and support function reports annually to the Audit 
and Risk Committee via the Vice President Risk Management and 
Internal Audit on its review of risks and how they are managed. Each 
year senior operational managers throughout the Group confirm the 
adequacy of their systems of internal controls, compliance with Group 
policies, local laws and regulations and report any control weaknesses 
identified in the past year. A separate review of the key financial 
controls is undertaken by the finance function. One of the Audit and 
Risk Committee’s main roles is to review, on behalf of the Board, the 
key risks inherent in the business and the system of controls necessary 
to ensure such risks are properly managed. 
Quality assurance audits are carried out by the divisions, and the 
findings reported to divisional management and to compliance 
officers. Each division has at least one compliance officer who 
undertakes investigations of issues that arise either from quality 
assurance audits or by other means, such as the employee hotline. 
Reports of significant findings are presented to the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
 
Each geographic region has at least one internal auditor who  
is independent of the divisions. Sites are reviewed regularly on  
a schedule based on materiality and perceived risk. Reports of 
significant findings are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee 
which monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function. The internal audit department was awarded ISO 9001 
accreditation in 2003 which was successfully renewed for a further 
three years in 2009. An external accreditation body conducts 
surveillance audits of the internal audit department every year  
and conducts a more detailed review every three years. 
The Group will, from time to time, be required by its customers to 
operate in countries where there is potential political and economic 
risk. In doing so, the Group fulfils its policy of facilitating international 
trade inspection and audit services that help to prevent corruption and 
assist with humanitarian aid. Where there are no laws in place that 
prohibit business dealings in certain countries, the Group will consider 
operating in those countries, but only in compliance with its stringent 
Code of Ethics.
The Chief Executive Officer also reports to the Board on significant 
changes in the business and the external environment which could 
impact on risk. The Chief Financial Officer provides the Board with 
monthly financial information, which includes the comparison of  
key performance figures against budgets and forecasts. Information  
is also provided with regard to risk indicators. The Board approves  
the treasury policy and the Treasury department’s activities are also 
subject to regular internal audits. 
Shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining an effective 
investor relations and communication programme as part of its 
ongoing relationship with the Company’s shareholders. The Group 
produces an Annual Report which is available to shareholders and also 
publishes interim management statements and Half Year Results. The 
Group website www.intertek.com contains up-to-date information on 
its activities and published financial results. Shareholders can subscribe 
via the Investors’ section of www.intertek.com to receive email alerts 
of important announcements made by the Group. The Companies Act 
2006 and the UK Listing Authority Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
enable communications with shareholders using electronic means via 
the Group website or by email. The Group’s Annual Report, notices  
of meetings and proxy forms are provided electronically as a default 
option. However, shareholders are also able to request paper copies  
of documents if they so choose.
Any significant comments received from institutional shareholders  
are communicated directly to the Board, and all analysts’ and brokers’ 
reports on the Group are sent to each Director.
The Company’s AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity  
to further develop their understanding of the Company and to ask 
questions of the full Board on the matters put to the meeting, 
including the Annual Report. All Board members attend the AGM  
and in particular, the Chairmen of the Audit and Risk, Nominations  
and Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions.  
At General Meetings a schedule of the proxy votes cast is made 
available to all shareholders and is also available on the Group website. 
The Company proposes a resolution on each substantially separate 
issue and does not combine resolutions inappropriately.
Going concern
After making diligent enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s 
financial statements.
Directors’ Report – Governance 54 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Remuneration Report
Commentary from the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
In 2010 the Company saw a stabilisation and improvement in its 
markets; and the Remuneration Committee has focused on the 
continuing suitability of Intertek’s reward arrangements to drive our 
strategy as a successful, increasingly complex, growing and global 
FTSE100 company. This has included a ‘fit for purpose’ review of 
total remuneration comprising salaries, cash bonuses and share 
incentives. With the help of our advisers we have also considered  
a number of improvements to ensure our continuing competitive 
position in the increasingly global markets for talent.
In May 2010 the Financial Reporting Council issued the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Committee has kept a close eye 
on developments and concluded that the views we had previously 
taken on the extent to which Intertek should and does comply  
with external guidance remained unchanged; we feel that we have 
sufficient regard to risk factors, adequate overview of Intertek’s 
remuneration processes and their contribution to strategy and 
continue to tie rewards effectively to the continued long-term 
success of the Group.
The following report contains explanations wherever we have 
decided that a change is necessary to continue to ensure we 
motivate and keep the employees we need and to attract the  
best new talent worldwide to grow the Group.
One change we intend to make is to alter the performance criteria 
for performance-related long term share awards for our forty or so 
most senior executives to a balanced mix of Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) and Earnings Per Share (EPS) where it was previously based 
wholly on relative TSR. This use of EPS as a measure of organic 
growth provides a more immediate driver for senior management 
than TSR alone and adds balance because there are few companies 
that are direct comparators for Intertek.
We are continuing our policy of preferring appropriate variable 
incentives to promote and reward good performance over 
movement in fixed salaries. We ensure targets continue to be 
sufficiently stretching to drive the continuing growth and excellence 
of the Group.
We were delighted to announce that Lloyd Pitchford would join  
us to replace Bill Spencer as Chief Financial Officer following Bill’s 
retirement in March. Details of Lloyd’s contractual arrangements  
can be found on page 59 of this report. 
Policy
Our remuneration strategy is to: 
•  attract, engage, motivate and retain the best available people by 
positioning total pay and benefits to be competitive in the 
relevant market and in line with the ability of the business to pay;
•  reward people equitably for the size of their responsibilities and 
performance;
•  align and recognise the individual’s contribution to success in our 
strategy and long-term business goals;
•  engage motivated high performers and, through variable bonus 
schemes, share the success with those who build and lead Intertek 
as a world class business.
This Report
This report sets out the Group’s policy and disclosures in relation  
to Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2010.  
It will be subject to a separate shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
The report has been prepared on behalf of the Board and complies 
fully with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code)  
as applicable for the financial year and has been audited by  
KPMG Audit Plc to the extent required by the Regulations.
The Group has applied the Principles of Good Corporate 
Governance relating to the remuneration of its Directors and this 
report outlines how the Group has complied with the provisions  
of the Combined Code as well as some of the latest guidelines 
issued by institutional shareholder bodies.

Each year the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) approves 
the general strategy for pay packages for the Group and considers 
individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and 
other senior executives. There are no executives whose 
remuneration exceeds that of the Executive Directors. 
We consider the balance between base salary and performance-
related pay, rewarding excellent performance through variable pay 
and long-term incentives. We also review and set future reward 
objectives and targets to drive our business strategy. We continue  
to ensure resulting outcomes are a true reflection of the 
fundamental performance of the Group.
As a global service business, success is critically dependent on  
the performance and retention of key people. Employment costs 
represent the major element of Group operating costs but there  
is considerable variation in those costs amongst businesses. As a 
global group our pay arrangements take into account both local  
and international markets. For these reasons there is in place a 
global Remuneration Policy Framework to achieve our reward 
strategy, with each operation retaining the freedom to navigate 
within that framework to find the best local solution.
When determining salary increases for executives, we take account 
of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, as well 
as the general appropriate market. This is achieved by reviewing 
detailed information for the four countries (mainland China, USA, 
UK and Hong Kong) in which the Group employs the greatest 
number of employees. 
Our peer groups for the majority of our employees consist of 
international industrial or business services organisations and  
similar-sized businesses. In respect of our more senior executives  
we base our pay comparisons on a blend of factors, including sector, 
job location, responsibility of the role and performance, whilst 
recognising the Company is UK listed.
We believe that for reward and retention of senior executives a 
significant proportion of remuneration should be performance-
related with part of that remuneration being deferred in the form  
of share awards vesting well after grant. We also believe that share 
ownership should form a significant element in senior executives’ 
compensation so that total remuneration will depend on the 
sustained future success of the Group.
The following table sets out the elements that make up the remuneration of the Executive Directors:
Performance: short-term 
Annual cash performance bonus
The cash bonus serves to drive and recognise short-term performance against targets which are a mix  
of shareholder, business and personal objectives, both numeric and non-numeric. The criteria and targets 
are reset each year to fit changing business objectives and the economic environment.
Performance: long-term
Deferred and Matching Awards
made under the Intertek 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan
For the purposes of retention and to link reward clearly to shareholders’ interests in the long-term success
 of the Company, a significant element of reward determined by business success has a value dependent
on our share price at the end of the deferral period. 
Fixed
Base salary
The annual base salary takes account of the size of the job and the competence and contribution
 of the job holder. We target annual base salary for fully competent performance at the median for  
the appropriate market.
Fixed
Pension
Provisions for retirement reflect the appropriate market and respect past obligations.
Fixed
Other benefits
These may include car allowances, life and private medical insurance and annual medicals,
as appropriate for the Executive Directors of a listed company.
Executive Directors and other executives
Last year the total remuneration for our Executive Directors and the balance between the above elements was:
The base salary, benefits, cash bonus, deferred shares and, for Wolfhart Hauser and Lloyd Pitchford, pension, are shown in the table on page 61. The pension for Mark Loughead  
is the increase in actual transfer value for 2010 as shown on page 62. The performance matching share award is half the fair value of the maximum potential number of matching 
shares that may vest, subject to performance. Details of how the fair values of the deferred and matching shares have been calculated are set out in note 23 to the financial 
statements. The remuneration for Lloyd Pitchford excludes the mirror share awards on page 64.

by the Committee each year and set to ensure they are linked to 
strategic and immediate current business goals, and are sufficiently 
demanding, taking full account of economic conditions and risk 
factors. Achievement of business targets typically delivers half of  
the bonus opportunity so as to encourage and reward performance 
above expectations.
Senior executives’ bonus criteria for 2010 comprised the following: 
(i) Group performance elements; (ii) divisional performance elements, 
where the executive is responsible for divisional results, or job 
specific objectives; and (iii) non-financial elements. The goals derive 
from the annual planning process for the Group, which forms the 
cornerstone of the Group’s results-focused culture. The divisional 
elements of bonus are based upon financial performance indicators 
similar to the Group elements but with targets appropriate to that 
division. The effect of exchange rate movements on earnings is one 
of the elements we consider before finalising bonus outcomes.

Salaries
Salaries are reviewed annually, in accordance with the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy Framework. Increases in base salary are linked to: 
• the growth in size and complexity of the business; 
•  demonstrable effort and sustained contribution of an individual  
to the development of Intertek’s strategy, synergy and efficiency; 
• retention; and
• market movement. 
Where a decision is made to increase a senior executive’s base  
salary we will expect the individual, taking into account levels of 
experience, to have demonstrated strong leadership within the 
business combined with a results-orientated approach. Whilst the 
Committee takes benchmarking information into account, it 
primarily reviews the performance of the individual concerned 
against the above measures to ensure that there is no unjustified 
upward ratchet in base remuneration.
Salaries for the continuing Executive Directors were increased in 
2010 and will increase in 2011 (see the table below). Applying the 
above criteria consistently with previous years, we considered that 
the performance of the individuals, taken in conjunction with the 
continuing growth, increasing complexity and financial success of 
the Group, justified the increases. In the case of Wolfhart Hauser, 
we regard his leadership of the Group as superior and his 
performance as exemplary. Lloyd Pitchford has made an excellent 
start in the role of CFO and delivered exceptional results since he 
started last April.
Elsewhere in the Group salary increases were also awarded where 
justified by the growth, increasing complexity and results of the 
relevant businesses or by market conditions.

in 2010 (2009: £43,000).
Cash bonuses
The Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible for annual 
cash bonus payments for the achievement of the financial and 
strategic goals of the Group and its businesses. These bonuses are 
not pensionable. They are a mix of numeric and non-numeric 
measures and are reset each year. Intertek Annual Report 2010 57
www.intertek.com
Combined with the decisions on the non-financial part of total 
bonus, explained below, this resulted in total annual bonus outcome 
for the Executive Directors of 125.6%, 86.9% and 86.9% of base 
salary for Wolfhart Hauser, Mark Loughead and Lloyd Pitchford 
respectively, to be paid in March 2011. 
For 2010 the non-financial, general contribution element of up  
to 20% of total bonus has been determined by taking into account 
the overall personal contribution of the executive to the goals and 
results of the Group for the year, the development of the medium-
term strategy of the Group, the achievement over the year of 
strategic objectives and demonstrable efforts and results in  
team-building and leadership.
The Committee can award additional discretionary payments  
to recognise very exceptional performance or where circumstances 
have occurred which were beyond the direct responsibility of the 
executive and the executive has managed and mitigated the impact 
of any loss, or to address key retention issues. The Committee has 
the ability to reduce bonus payments if it believes that short-term 
performance has been achieved at the expense of the Group’s  
long-term future success. The Committee also retains the discretion 
to reclaim payments if the performance achievements are 
subsequently found to have been significantly misstated. This 
discretion was not exercised in respect of the bonuses paid in 2010.
Share Awards
Deferred Bonus Share Plan
The only long-term incentive plan in use in 2010 has been the 
Intertek Deferred Bonus Share Plan (the Plan). The purposes of  
this Plan are the reward and retention of senior executives and key 
specialists and the alignment of their interests with shareholders  
by linking rewards to Intertek’s share price performance. 
The Plan has two elements:
•  Deferred Shares are awarded to executives based on their annual 
achievement. For the Executive Directors and Intertek Operations 
Committee (IOC), who form the senior management of Intertek, 
the value of Deferred Shares will be equal to the cash bonus.  
We believe that this provides a simple and well-targeted form  
of reward. The awards normally vest three years after grant, 
provided the participant is still employed in the Group.
•  Matching Share awards, which are subject to long-term 
performance requirements, are, at the discretion of the Committee, 
awarded to the most senior executives. Awards of Matching 
Shares are linked to awards of Deferred Shares, and for the 
Executive Directors and IOC are granted at the maximum ratio of 
two Matching Shares for every Deferred Share. Matching Shares 
vest after three years, once the Committee has determined the 
extent to which the applicable performance conditions have been 
satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Group. 
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares or by purchasing 
shares in the market.
Performance conditions
For awards granted during the years 2007-2010 the performance 
test for Matching Shares comprised the Company’s relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against a peer group of 
companies from the FTSE Index (excluding investment trusts). For 
awards granted in 2008 the peer group comprised the members  
of the FTSE 250. For awards granted in 2009 the peer group 
comprised FTSE Index members 76 to 175. Grants made in 2010 
used the peer group of FTSE Index members 51 to 150 (excluding 
investment trusts and banks).
In respect of outstanding awards, irrespective of the Company’s TSR 
performance, no part of a Matching Award can vest unless the 
Company’s normalised EPS growth over the performance period 
was, on average, at least 2% per annum above the growth in the 
UK Retail Prices Index (RPI). TSR calculations are conducted 
independently by advisors. 
Awards vest as follows in respect of the TSR condition: 
TSR Ranking   % of Matching Award that vests
Below median  None
Median  25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata on a straight line 
   between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile    100%
During the course of 2010, we undertook a full review of the  
Plan. Whilst we believe that the overall structure remains fit for 
purpose we consider that several changes are desirable to improve 
its operation.
The first proposed amendment is to the performance conditions  
for the performance-related share awards. 
In our consideration of share plan incentives in 2010 we reviewed 
the performance criteria for Matching Share awards, taking full 
account of the economy and business climate at the time of the 
award. In respect of awards made in March 2010, the previously-
intended change to include an EPS element was discarded, as 
prevailing economic turbulence had continued to make the setting 
of realistic stretching EPS targets very difficult. In respect of awards 
granted in 2011, however, now that the economic climate has 
stabilised, we have decided that the performance measures 
applicable to Matching Awards made in 2011 should include EPS. 
The vesting of half of the Matching Share awards will depend on  
the same TSR criteria as in 2010, but EPS targets will now apply  
to half the award. For the TSR element to vest, the Committee will 
need to be satisfied that the resulting outcome is a true reflection  
of underlying performance (which, in general, we expect to be 
determined by reference to EPS growth).
The proposed EPS performance condition will be set as a compound 
annual percentage growth over three years, measured against the 
base year, which is the year prior to the start of the measurement 
period. For each cycle the Committee will determine a threshold 
level of EPS growth and an upper vesting target for EPS growth.
 
Although the use of the RPI is common amongst UK companies in 
setting EPS targets, the wide geographical dispersion of Intertek’s 
business means that this is of limited relevance to the majority of 
participants. We therefore propose to measure EPS growth as a 
nominal percentage.
Directors’ Report – Governance 58 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Executive Directors and other key employees are eligible to 
participate in our share plans. Non-Executive Directors are not. 
The Company has undertaken to limit the number of awards satisfied 
by newly issued shares under the Plan in the 10-year period from the 
time the Plan was adopted to 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. As at 31 December 2010 outstanding awards represented 
1.83% of the Company’s issued share capital and 0.48% of issued 
share capital had been issued in satisfaction of awards. 
The Committee has decided not to publish the part way 
achievement of performance conditions applicable to outstanding 
awards, nor the expected value of the anticipated vested awards,  
as it considers this information would be misleading to a greater 
extent than it is informative. 
Mirrror share awards
As part of the arrangements made in respect of the appointment  
of Lloyd Pitchford, the Company agreed to compensate him for the 
loss of share incentive awards made to him by his previous employer 
by replacing each of his outstanding awards with an award (a ‘mirror 
share award’) over an appropriately adjusted number of Intertek 
Group plc shares. Details of these awards, and their performance 
criteria, are set out on page 64. All of the shares required to satisfy 
the mirror share awards will be obtained by market purchase.
Share retention
A shareholding retention requirement continues to be operated as 
set by the Committee. Executive Directors and the members of the 
IOC, who form the senior management of Intertek, are required to 
build up a shareholding in the Company worth at least 100% of 
base salary within five years. To assist in the building of this holding, 
we require that, after allowing for tax and similar liabilities, all the 
shares subject to each vested award under the Intertek Deferred 
Bonus Share Plan will be retained by the executive until the 
ownership target is attained.
Pensions
As the result of its international profile, Intertek operates a number 
of pension arrangements around the world, appropriate to the 
employing location. Our review of the competitiveness of rewards 
included the assessment of the competitiveness of the various 
pension provision arrangements in place.
Our proposed definition of EPS is fully diluted and adjusted for 
separately disclosed items. It will be calculated on the basis of 
foreign exchange rates adopted at the start of the cycle for internal 
budgeting purposes. This is an appropriate basis given the wide 
spread of operating currencies across the Group’s global activities.
To the extent that acquisitions and disposals occur during the 
performance period, the Committee will judge whether EPS targets 
should be adjusted and, if so, by how much; or whether the effects 
of such transactions should be excluded from the calculation. 
Material adjustments would be disclosed in the Committee’s report 
to shareholders.
The Committee anticipates that for the first award cycle for which 
EPS is used, the threshold level of EPS growth will be set at 6% per 
annum and the upper target at 16% per annum. We anticipate that 
targets for future cycles on both measures will be similarly stretching 
to the targets above and would expect to discuss any substantial 
changes in this range with shareholders.
Awards will vest as follows in respect of the EPS condition: 
EPS growth out-turn   % of Matching Award that vests
Below threshold    None
Threshold EPS    25%
Between threshold and upper target  Pro-rata on a straight line  
     between 25% and 100%
Upper target    100%
The Committee can set different performance conditions from those 
described above for future awards. Any such new targets will not,  
in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, be materially less 
challenging in the circumstances than those described above.
The second change proposed relates to the link between earned 
annual bonus and grants of share awards. For the most senior 
executives, for whom specific limits apply, the Committee has found 
that the rewards under the Plan may not provide sufficient retention 
incentive in the event that they receive a minimal or no cash bonus. 
Accordingly we propose to amend the Plan to allow, in exceptional 
circumstances, limited awards of performance-related shares only. 
The Committee would exercise discretion over whether or not, to 
provide a long-term incentive for these managers, a modest award 
of performance-related shares should be made, capped at a level 
which would ordinarily result from an individual earning 30% of 
their maximum cash bonus.
In order to effect this change and also a number of other 
administrative improvements, a revised plan is being proposed to 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. More information about  
the proposed changes will appear in the Notice of AGM. 
Remuneration Report Intertek Annual Report 2010 59

The pension arrangements for Executive Directors are as follows:
Wolfhart Hauser
Wolfhart Hauser is not a member of a Group company pension 
scheme. Instead the Group contributes an amount equal to 25%  
of his base salary to a personal pension arrangement. For 2010  
this amounted to £143,000 (2009: £114,000). He has life cover 
benefit comprising a lump sum payment equivalent to four times  
his base salary. 
Mark Loughead 
Mark Loughead was a member of the legacy defined benefit 
section of the Intertek UK Company Pension Scheme throughout 
the year. This is a defined benefit and defined contribution 
occupational pension scheme approved by HMRC. Page 62  
shows the increase in transfer value applicable to Mark Loughead’s  
pension entitlement.
Lloyd Pitchford
Lloyd Pitchford is not a member of a Group company pension 
scheme. The Group instead contributes an amount equal to 20%  
of his salary in lieu of a pension. From his date of appointment  
this amounted to £48,000 in 2010. He is entitled to life cover  
benefit comprising a lump sum payment equivalent to four times  
his base salary. 
Further details of the Group’s pension schemes, including the 
funding position, are disclosed in note 21 to the financial statements. 
Details of the pension arrangements for those who have served as 
Executive Directors during the financial year are shown above and 
on page 62.
Service contracts and appointment arrangements
Details of the service contracts currently in place for Executive 
Directors who served during the year are as follows:
  Date of contract
Wolfhart Hauser  1 March 2005
Mark Loughead 1 January 2008 
  (retired 31 December 2010)
Bill Spencer 24 May 2002 (retired 31 March 2010)
Lloyd Pitchford 13 January 2010 (effective 26 April 2010)
Wolfhart Hauser has an executive service contract subject to  
12 months’ notice on either side. It contains provisions by way of 
compensation for loss of office, limited to payment of salary over  
a 12-month period in lieu of notice. The contract permits payments 
in lieu of notice to be made, at the Company’s election, either (i)  
in full on termination or (ii) on a monthly basis, but only for so long  
as he receives no remuneration from any other business. If he does 
receive any such remuneration, the monthly amount payable will be 
reduced by that remuneration, determined on a monthly basis. The 
service contract contains no provisions regarding a change of control. 
Mark Loughead, who retired from the Board on 31 December 2010, 
had both an executive service contract with Intertek USA Inc. and 
a letter of appointment in respect of his directorship of Intertek 
Group plc during 2010. The executive service contract was subject 
to 12 months’ notice on either side and contained provisions for him 
to continue to receive an amount equal to salary and benefits during 
the period of notice in accordance with his normal payroll schedule 
unless he received remuneration from any other business. Bonuses 
not already received were not to be paid unless pro-rata payment 
formed part of the bonus criteria. The service contract contained 
provisions regarding a change of control based on the same criteria 
as apply to the Intertek Deferred Bonus Plan. The appointment as  
an Executive Director of Intertek Group plc was for an initial term  
of three years, but terminable by either party giving one month’s 
notice and provided for an annual fee of £43,000. 
Lloyd Pitchford has an executive service contract subject to 12 months’ 
notice on either side. It contains provisions by way of compensation 
for loss of office, limited to payment of salary and pension 
contributions over a 12-month period in lieu of notice. The contract 
permits payments in lieu of notice to be made, at the Company’s 
election, either (i) in full on termination or (ii) in the amounts and at 
the times it would have been paid if he had continued to work 
throughout the period of notice but only for so long as he receives  
no remuneration from any other business. If he does receive any such 
remuneration, the monthly amount payable will be reduced by that 
remuneration, determined on a monthly basis. The service contract 
contains no provisions regarding a change of control and permits 
bonus payments to be reclaimed in the event that performance 
achievements are found to have been significantly misstated.
In consideration of Lloyd Pitchford accepting the Company’s offer  
of the appointment as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, the 
Committee agreed to make mirror awards over Company shares,  
as described on page 64, in compensation for the loss of share 
incentive awards forgone by reason of resigning from his former 
employment.
Policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that, during their employment with  
the Company, Executive Directors may be invited to become  
non-executive directors of other companies and that such duties  
can broaden their experience and knowledge. Executive Directors 
may, with the written consent of the Company, accept such 
appointments outside the Company, and the policy is that any fees 
may be retained by the Director. Wolfhart Hauser is a Non-Executive 
Director of Logica plc. His earnings for this appointment in 2010, 
which he retained, were £50,000.
Directors’ Report – Governance 60 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Remuneration Report
Pursuant to the policy of aligning Directors’ interests with those  
of shareholders, a proportion of the fees due to the Non-Executive 
Directors is used each year to purchase shares in the Company.  
A summary of the Non-Executive Directors’ fees and the pre-tax 
amounts of those fees used to purchase shares in the Company in 
2010 is shown in the table above. The Non-Executive Directors’ base 
fees remained at the same level during 2010 and the Chairman’s  
fee increased by £12,000 per annum with effect from 1 April 2010. 
With effect from 1 April 2011 the base fee for Non-Executive 
Directors will rise to £55,000 and the Chairman’s fee will increase  
to £200,000. The Remuneration Committee, having reviewed 
benchmarking information for the Chairman, felt that the increases 
to his fees in 2010 and 2011 are justified by the increased demands 
of the Group.
Other than Vanni Treves, who has the benefit of a company car,  
no other benefits-in-kind are provided.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company. The letter of engagement for each Non-Executive Director 
states that they are appointed for an initial period of three years  
and all appointments are terminable by one month’s notice on  
either side. At the end of the initial period the appointment may be 
renewed for a further period, usually three years, if the Company 
and the Director agree and subject to reappointment at the AGM. 
Each letter of engagement states that should the Group terminate 
the appointment, on such termination the Non-Executive Director 
will not be entitled to any compensation for loss of office. 
In accordance with current best practice all Directors will be 
standing for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
The Committee
On behalf of the Board, the Committee: 
determines the Company’s policy on the remuneration of,   •
and incentives for, the Chairman, Executive Directors and other 
senior executives (mainly the IOC which comprises the Group  
and Executive Vice Presidents); 
determines their remuneration packages, including any  •
compensation on termination of office; 
reviews the remuneration arrangements for the wider Group and  •
considers issues relating to remuneration packages that may have 
significant impact on the Group;
provides advice to, and consults with, the Chief Executive Officer  •
on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of senior 
executives; and
keeps remuneration policy under review in the light of regulatory  •
and best practice developments and shareholder expectations. 
Due regard is given to the interests of shareholders and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and associated guidance. 
The Committee met seven times during 2010. Attendance statistics 
appear in the Corporate Governance Report on page 50. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on our website at 
www.intertek.com. 
The following Non-Executive Directors of the Company served  
on the Committee in 2010: David Allvey (Chairman), Gavin Darby, 
Christopher Knight and Vanni Treves.
David Allvey, Gavin Darby and Christopher Knight are independent in 
accordance with the Combined Code. Vanni Treves was independent 
at the time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board. 
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, except 
as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. When there is any 
Executive Director or the Group Vice President Human Resources in 
attendance in an advisory capacity, that individual will absent himself 
from meetings for matters relating to his own remuneration.

Directors’ Report – Governance
TSR Performance graph 
TSR comprising the changes in value of a share and dividends distributed can be represented by the value of a notional £100 invested at the 
beginning of a period and its change over that period.
The graph above shows the TSR in respect of the Company over five years. The TSR for the Company is compared with;
i)  the TSR for the FTSE 250 Index, which is the index we have used since the Company’s flotation in 2002 as the most appropriate 
comparator, being a broad market index; and
ii)  the TSR for the FTSE 100 Index. The Company joined the FTSE 100 in March 2009 and the Committee considers it helpful also to show  
this comparison. 62 Intertek Annual Report 2010

Advisors
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices drive and support 
achievement of strategies, are market competitive and help to 
achieve our objectives, we obtain advice from various independent 
sources. The Committee has appointed and taken independent 
advice on ensuring that remuneration is ‘fit for purpose‘ and  
on share incentive arrangements from Kepler Associates (KA),  
on remuneration matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street (Hewitt), 
on remuneration benchmarking from Towers Watson (TW) and on 
UK pension matters from Premier Pensions Management Limited 
(PPM). During 2010, PPM’s associate company provided additional 
FSA-regulated services in respect of UK pension matters. PPM,  
TW, KA and Hewitt have no other connection with the Company  
or its senior officers.
Other benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to the use of a company car or the 
cash equivalent, a fuel allowance, life assurance, an annual medical 
and private medical insurance. Vanni Treves is entitled to a 
company car.
Transactions with Directors 
As disclosed in note 27 to the financial statements, no Director had  
a personal interest in any business transactions of the Group.

1.  The increase in the accrued entitlement during the year is the increase in the accrued pension over the year, excluding the effect of inflation, on the accrued pension at the 
start of the year. The increase in the accrued entitlement has been calculated based on service to 31 December 2010 for Mark Loughead and 31 March 2010 for Bill Spencer. 
Including inflation, the increase during the year for Mark Loughead was £1,990, and for Bill Spencer, £7,179. Transfer values have been calculated using the Cash Equivalent 
Transfer Value Basis adopted by the Trustees with effect from 1 October 2008, in accordance with The Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2008 (SI2008/1050).
2.  The transfer values disclosed do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director, instead they represent a potential liability of the Pension Scheme. The value 
represents the full transfer value without reduction for any shortfall in scheme funding.
3. Based on service to 31 March 2010.
4.  In addition to the benefit accrued under the Intertek Pension Scheme shown above, Bill Spencer also has an additional fixed pension payable at 65 of £9,777 per annum  
in relation to previous transfers in. The liabilities in respect of the transferred-in benefits are included in the transfer values for Bill Spencer stated above. Intertek Annual Report 2010 63

Mirror share awards
On 14 May 2010, Lloyd Pitchford was granted conditional rights  
to acquire 49,039 1p shares in Intertek Group plc under a one-off 
arrangement in facilitation of his recruitment as Chief Financial 
Officer of the Company. 
The principal terms of the awards are summarised below:
The award comprised eights parts (tranches A to H). The number  
of Intertek Group plc shares comprised within each tranche was  
as noted in the table below together with details of each tranche’s 
normal vesting date.
Each tranche will ordinarily vest on its normal vesting date subject  
to Lloyd Pitchford’s continued employment with Intertek.
In addition, in the case of tranches A, B, D and G the extent to 
which such tranches may vest is also contingent on the satisfaction 
of performance criteria.
The performance criterion applying to tranche A was a measure  
of BG Group plc’s TSR performance over the three year period  
from 5 September 2007 when ranked against the TSR performance  
over the same period of companies in a comparator group of  
listed international oil and gas companies. Approximately 87%  
of tranche A vested against this performance criterion in 2010;  
the balance of tranche A lapsed.
The performance criterion applying to tranche B is a measure of  
BG Group plc’s normalised EPS performance over a period of three 
financial years ending 31 December 2009. One half of tranche B 
may vest if EPS growth over the period is RPI +15% and thereafter 
rising on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth over the 
period of RPI +30%.
The performance criterion applying to tranche D is a measure of 
Intertek Group plc’s TSR performance over the period 26 April 2010 
to 2 September 2011 (by reference to three month averaging periods 
expiring on such dates) against the TSR performance of a comparator 
group over the same period. For median performance, one quarter 
of tranche D may vest, rising proportionally to full vesting for upper 
quartile performance. The comparator group in the case of 
tranche D comprises the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts) as at the start of such performance period.
The performance criterion applying to tranche G is a measure of 
Intertek Group plc’s TSR performance over the period 26 April 2010 
to 7 September 2012 (by reference to three month averaging 
periods expiring on such dates) against the TSR performance of a 
comparator group over the same period. For median performance, 
one quarter of tranche G may vest, rising proportionally to full 
vesting for upper quartile performance. The comparator group in 
the case of tranche G comprises the constituents of the positions  
76 to 175 in the FTSE Index (excluding investment trusts and banks) 
as at the start of such performance period. Intertek Annual Report 2010 65
www.intertek.com
The awards will ordinarily lapse on cessation of employment save  
in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances. Awards that vest early in 
connection with cessation of employment shall ordinarily vest to  
the extent that the performance conditions (if relevant) have been 
met over the shortened period and the extent of vesting ordinarily 
subject to time pro-ration.
In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding-up of the 
Company, the award will vest early at such time to the extent not 
already vested. In such circumstances, the vesting of the awards will 
be subject to the extent that the performance conditions (if relevant) 
have been met over the shortened period. In addition, time pro-
ration will apply in the case of tranches D and G and may apply  
in the case of tranches C, E, F and H.
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or  
in the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar 
event which materially affects the market price of the Shares, the 
Committee may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate  
to the awards. 
No amendments to the advantage of Lloyd Pitchford will be made 
to the material terms of the awards without shareholder approval 
other than any minor alteration to (i) benefit the administration of 
the awards, (ii) take account of a change in legislation, or (iii) obtain 
or maintain favourable tax, exchange or regulatory treatment for 
Lloyd Pitchford or the Company. 
The awards are not transferable (save on death) or pensionable.
The awards may only be satisfied with market purchased shares  
or cash. No newly issued shares or treasury shares will be used  
in connection with the awards.
The gain made on vesting during 2010 was £333,300.

Other Statutory Information
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
(‘the Act’) and UK Listing Authority Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the following section describes the matters that are required 
for inclusion in the Directors’ Report and were approved by the 
Board. Further details of matters required to be included in the 
Directors’ Report that are incorporated by reference into this  
report are set out below.
Directors
The Directors who held office during the year are set out below. 
Vanni Treves Chairman
Wolfhart Hauser Chief Executive Officer
Mark Loughead Chief Operating Officer (retired on  
31 December 2010)
Bill Spencer Chief Financial Officer (retired on  
31 March 2010)
Lloyd Pitchford Chief Financial Officer (appointed on  
26 April 2010)
David Allvey Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
Edward Astle Non-Executive Director 
Gavin Darby Non-Executive Director
Christopher Knight Non-Executive Director
Debra Rade Non-Executive Director
The biographies of the Directors at the date of this report are set 
out on page 43.
The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions relating  
to the retirement, election and re-election of Directors but in 2011 
for the first time, all Directors will stand for re-election at the AGM.
Directors’ powers and Articles of Association
The Directors are responsible for the management of the business  
of the Company and their powers to do so are determined by the 
provisions of the Act and the Company’s Articles of Association.  
The Articles of Association set out the internal regulation of the 
Company and cover such matters as the rights of shareholders, the 
appointment or removal of Directors and the conduct of the Board 
and general meetings. Copies are available upon request from the 
Group Company Secretary and are available at the Company’s AGM. 
Further powers are granted by members in general meeting and 
those currently in place are set out in detail within the appropriate 
section of this report.
Directors’ interests 
Other than employment contracts, none of the Directors of the 
Company had a personal interest in any business transactions of  
the Company or its subsidiaries. The terms of the Directors’ service 
contracts and the Directors’ interests in the shares and options  
of the Company, in respect of which transactions are notifiable  
to the Company under the UK Listing Authority Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 3.1.2 are disclosed in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 54 to 65.
Directors’ indemnities
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Group to 
attract and retain the services of the most able and experienced 
directors by offering competitive terms of engagement, including 
the granting of indemnities on terms consistent with the applicable 
statutory provisions. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as 
defined by section 234 of the Act), were accordingly in force during 
the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2010, for the 
benefit of the Directors and, at the date of this report, are in force  
in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur  
(or have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers or office.
Principal activities and business review
The Group’s principal activities, business and principal risks and 
uncertainties are contained in the Business Review, on pages 8 to 41 
and the Corporate Governance section, on pages 46 to 53 which 
are incorporated by reference into this report. 
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 18.8p per 
ordinary share (2009: 17.3p) making a full year dividend of 28.1p per 
ordinary share (2009: 25.5p) which will, if approved at the AGM,  
be paid on 17 June 2011 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 3 June 2011.
Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company, and details of the 
movements in the Company’s share capital during the year,  
are shown in note 18 to the financial statements.  Intertek Annual Report 2010 67
www.intertek.com
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when 
declared, to receive the Company’s report and accounts, to attend 
and speak at general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies 
and exercise voting rights. A waiver of dividend exists in respect of 
11,834 shares held by the Intertek Group Employee Share Ownership 
Trust at 31 December 2010. There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the Company.
The rights attached to shares in the Company are provided by  
the Articles of Association, which may be amended or replaced by 
means of a special resolution of the Company in a General Meeting. 
The Directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK legislation and 
by the Company’s Articles of Association.
No ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to control  
of the Company and there are no restrictions on voting rights except 
that a shareholder has no right to vote in respect of a share unless 
all sums due in respect of that share are fully paid. There are no 
arrangements known to the Company by which financial rights 
carried by any shares in the Company are held by a person other 
than the holders of the shares, nor are there any arrangements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights known to the Company.  
All issued shares are fully paid.
Shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange and 
may be traded through the CREST system. 
Allotment of shares
At the AGM held in 2010 the shareholders generally and 
unconditionally authorised the Directors to allot relevant securities 
up to approximately two-thirds of the nominal amount of issued 
share capital. It is the Directors intention to renew this authority in 
line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers. The 
resolution will be set out in the Notice of AGM, which shareholders 
will receive in April. 
Also at the AGM in 2010 the Directors were empowered by the 
shareholders to allot equity securities, up to 5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, for cash under section 570 of the Act. It is 
intended that this authority be renewed, up to 5%, at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Purchase of own shares
Shareholders also approved the authority for the Company to buy 
back up to 10% of its own ordinary shares by market purchase until 
the conclusion of the AGM to be held this year. The Directors will 
seek to renew this authority for up to 10% of the Company’s issued 
share capital at the forthcoming AGM. This power will only be 
exercised if the Directors are satisfied that any purchase will increase 
the earnings per share of the ordinary share capital in issue after  
the purchase and accordingly, that the purchase is in the interests  
of shareholders. The Directors will also give careful consideration 
to gearing levels of the Company and its general financial position.  
Any shares purchased in this way may be held in treasury which, 
the Directors believe, will provide the Company with flexibility in  
the management of its share capital. Where treasury shares are used 
to satisfy share options or awards, they will be classed as new issue 
shares for the purpose of the 10% limit on the number of shares 
that may be issued over a 10-year period under our relevant share 
plan rules.
Policy and practice on payment of suppliers 
The Group does not follow a single standard on payment practice 
but has a variety of payment terms with its suppliers. Payment terms 
are agreed at the commencement of business with each supplier 
and it is the policy of the Group that payment is made accordingly, 
subject to the terms and conditions being met. The holding 
company, Intertek Group plc, does not trade and therefore has  
no trade payables.
Significant relationships
The Group does not have any contractual or other relationships  
with any single party which are essential to the business of the 
Group and therefore no such relationships have been disclosed. 
Social and community issues
We encourage our local managers to foster community links 
appropriate to the businesses they manage. Further details are given 
in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 31 to 37.  68 Intertek Annual Report 2010

During 2010 the Group made charitable donations of £103,000 
(2009: £107,000) to a wide variety of charities, including support

precautionary basis, to authorise the Company to make donations 
to EU political organisations and to incur EU political expenditure  
(as such terms are defined in the Act) not exceeding £90,000. During 
the year the Group did not make any political donations (2009: £nil). 
It is the Company’s policy not, directly or through any subsidiary,  
to make what are commonly regarded as donations to any political 
party. However, at the forthcoming AGM of the Company, 
shareholders’ approval will again be sought to authorise the Group 
to make political donations and/or incur political expenditure (as 
such terms are defined in Sections 362 to 379 of the Act). Further 
details of this will be contained in the Notice of the AGM. 
Auditors
The auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, have indicated their willingness to

Statement of Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors  
are unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that he or  
she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that  
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them  •
consistently;
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •
for the Group financial statements, state whether they have   •
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether  •
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,  
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the Parent Company financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  •
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors, 
having prepared the Financial Statements, have asked the auditors  
to take any steps and to undertake any inspection they consider  
to be appropriate to enable them to give their Audit Report.  
The auditors’ responsibilities are set out in the Independent  
Auditors’ Report on page 70.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement  
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the 
annual financial report
Each of the Directors, whose name and functions are listed  
on page 43, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the  •
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development  •
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Notes to the financial statements
1  General
Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2010 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates. The Parent Company financial statements present 
information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group’s activities are the testing, inspection and certification of products, commodities and services against a wide range of safety, 
regulatory, quality and performance standards. Note 3 provides a segmental analysis of the Group’s performance.
2 Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs). The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 118 to 121. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial 
assets are stated at fair value. 
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency. All information presented  
in sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
Adjusted results
In order to present the performance of the Group in a clear, consistent and comparable format, certain items are disclosed separately  
on the face of the income statement. Separately disclosed items are items which by their nature or size, in the opinion of the Directors, 
should be excluded from the adjusted result to provide readers with a clear and consistent view of the business performance of the Group 
and its operating divisions. When applicable, these items include amortisation of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and other assets,  
the profit or loss on disposals of businesses or other significant fixed assets, costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions, the cost of  
any fundamental restructuring of a business, material claims and settlements, significant recycling of amounts from equity to the income 
statement and unrealised gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities. Details of the separately disclosed items are given in note 4 of the  
notes to the financial statements. 
Changes in accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these consolidated financial statements, 
except as explained below which addresses changes in accounting policies.
The Group has adopted in the year the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations: 
(i) IFRS 3 – Business Combinations (revised 2008)
(ii) IAS 27 – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended 2008)
(iii) Amendments to IFRS 7 – Improving disclosures about financial instruments
(iv) Amendments to IFRIC 9 – Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
(v) Amendments to IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible hedged items
(vi) Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions
(vii) Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2009 
(viii) Amendments to IAS 38 – Intangible assets – consequential amendments arising from IFRS 3 (revised)
(ix) Amendments to IFRIC 16 – Hedges of a net investment in foreign operation
(x) Amendments to IAS 36 – Impairment of assets
(i)   IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008)  
From 1 January 2010, the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008) in accounting for business combinations.  
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively. The impact of the change on basic earnings per share is three pence  
in the current year.
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from  
its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. 78 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Notes to the financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
 Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
  For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the 
fair value of any previously-held equity interest in the acquiree) and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, 
less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the 
acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
   The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally 
recognised in the income statement.
  Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in separately disclosed items. 
See note 4 for the application of the new policy to the business combinations that occurred during the period.
  Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.
  When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees 
(acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in 
measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. The determination is based on the market-based value of the 
replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards 
relate to past and/or future services.
  Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009
  For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. 
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
  Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with 
business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
(ii)  IAS 27 – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended 2008) 
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008) in accounting for acquisitions 
of non-controlling interests. The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively and has had no impact on earnings per share.
  Under the new accounting policy, acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity 
as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based 
on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
  Previously, goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost 
of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2010 and have not been applied in preparing consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on 
the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European 
Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions. The Board has also reviewed the 
Group’s funding requirements and has taken into consideration the issuance of US$250m notes in December 2010, the US$60m bilateral facility 
signed in January 2010, and the signing of a £30m bilateral multi-currency term loan facility in December 2010. It also took into consideration 
the refinancing of the Senior Bank Facility in February 2011 with a new syndicated US$600m multi-currency revolver available to 31 March 2016. 
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Group’s funding and liquidity position. The Board believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully. In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, 
which are described in note 15, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position is set out in the Business Review on pages 8 to 23. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the primary statements and in note 15 to the financial statements. In addition note 24 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s financial risk management objectives and also gives details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs, requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions  
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may  Intertek Annual Report 2010 79
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected. 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements. Also discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation at the reporting date, that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year. 
Income tax 
The actual tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations is 
unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements. 
The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a 
number of years to resolve. The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial 
statements, see note 8.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, judgement is 
used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future 
taxable income, see note 12.
Intangible assets 
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets 
should be recognised separately from goodwill. If such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows 
expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset. Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit 
and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation, see note 11.
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use  
of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value-in-use requires the Group to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill, at a determined discount rate to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows, see note 11. 
Contingent consideration 
When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable  
on agreed post completion dates. These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.  
At the date of acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent 
consideration that is likely to be due, see note 17. 
Basis of consolidation 
Judgement is applied when determining if an entity acquired is controlled by the Group, and therefore is defined as a subsidiary. Control  
is presumed to exist when the Group owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power of an entity. 
However, even if the Group owns half or less of the voting power of an entity, control may still exist. In assessing control, the Group considers 
whether it has the ability to control on a legal or contractual basis rather than whether that control is actually exercised. Specific examples  
of where the Group has control of subsidiaries are where it has the power to govern the entity’s financial and operating policies by virtue  
of statute or agreement and where it has the power to cast the majority of votes of the entity’s governing body, see note 22. 
Claims 
In making provision for claims, management bases its judgement on the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external 
legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents. The Group’s legal and warranty 
claims are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis by senior management, see note 17.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations 
The Group has four principal defined pension benefit plans. The obligations under these plans are recognised in the statement of financial 
position and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by independent actuaries, with input from management. These actuarial 
valuations include assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from 
time to time according to prevailing economic and social conditions, see note 21. 
Recoverability of trade receivables 
Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses. This provision is based primarily on a review of all 
outstanding accounts and considers the past payment history and creditworthiness of each account and the length of time that the debt  
has remained unpaid. The actual amounts of debts that ultimately prove irrecoverable could vary from the actual provision made, see note 24. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that  80 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Notes to the financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. 
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the Group applies the ‘entity concept method’. Under this method, the entire 
difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary, and the non-controlling interest’s share of the assets and liabilities 
reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of acquisition of the non-controlling interests, is reflected directly  
in the shareholders’ equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions,  
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,  
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(c) Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except 
those arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, and on retranslation 
of available-for-sale equity instruments which are recognised directly in equity. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange  
rate at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at 
cumulative average rates of exchange during the year. 
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates:
      Assets and liabilities Income and expenses 
     Actual rates Cumulative average rates
Value of £1        31 Dec 10 31 Dec 09 2010 2009
US dollar        1.55 1.60 1.55 1.56
Euro        1.17 1. 11 1.17 1.12
Chinese renminbi       10.26 10.90 10.47 10.63
Hong Kong dollar       12.05 12.38 12.00 12.06
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to equity in the 
translation reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal. The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1, 
to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs on 1 January 2004.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are discussed in accounting policy (e).
(d) Financial instruments
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses  
(see accounting policy (i)). Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents and net debt
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The Group’s investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are 
measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses (which are recognised in the income statement), and foreign 
currency differences on available-for-sale monetary items (see note (c)), are recognised directly in equity. When an investment is 
derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently are stated at their amortised cost. Intertek Annual Report 2010 81
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement  
to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, in which case the 
recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see accounting policy (e)). Derivatives that do  
not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting 
date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward 
exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the reporting date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward 
price and the exercise price of the contract. 
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet  
the following two conditions:
(i)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(ii)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments, or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share 
premium exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
(e) Hedging
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the 
hedging reserve. The ineffective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in the income 
statement when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or  
loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the same year  
that the hedged item affects the income statement.
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or 
liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be  
an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the cumulative amount in equity is transferred to the income statement as an 
adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. 82 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Notes to the financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation (see depreciation paragraph below) and 
accumulated impairment losses (see accounting policy (i)).
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in profit or loss.
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount  
of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred. 
Leased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Where land and 
buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased 
assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Other leases are operating leases. These leased assets are not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and 
equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings  50 years
Short leasehold buildings  Term of lease 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment   3–10 years
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are re-assessed at each reporting date.
Borrowing costs
In respect of borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets, the Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
(g) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses. All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses (see accounting policy (i)). Goodwill is 
allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the 
Group’s previous accounting framework.
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition, in accordance with 
the accounting standard then in force. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used. Any adjustments to these values made within  
12 months of the acquisition date are taken as adjustments to goodwill. 
Other intangible assets
Other than goodwill, intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless  
of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives. Intertek Annual Report 2010 83
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as 
follows:
Computer software         Up to 7 years
Customer relationships         Up to 10 years
Know-how         Up to 5 years
Licences          Contractual life
Covenants not to compete        Contractual life
(h) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of the inventories is based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) 
principle. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location 
and net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling costs.
(i) Impairment
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset  
is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, 
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Receivables with a short duration 
are not discounted.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively 
in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.  
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash generating unit  
is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets  
or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose 
of impairment testing, is allocated to cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss 
may no longer exist as a result of a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
(j) Employee benefits
Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will 
have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred. 84 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Notes to the financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of 
defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned 
in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past 
service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds 
that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the 
benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When 
the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the 
present value of economic benefits available in the form of (i) an unconditional right to a refund from the plan or (ii) reductions in future 
contributions to the plan as measured by the estimated future service cost less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in 
respect of the future accrual of benefits in that year. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, 
or on settlement of the plan liabilities. In addition a provision for future minimum funding contributions is recorded to the extent that such 
payments are required to cover an existing shortfall, as measured on a minimum funding contribution basis, and having been paid will not  
be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions to the plan.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees’ services in the accounting period is charged to the 
operating profit in the income statement. The expected return on the schemes’ assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes’ 
liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised immediately in equity.
Share-based payment transactions
The share-based compensation plans operated by the Group allow employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options or shares is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income 
statement over the vesting period of the relevant award. The charge for the share options and for the share awards is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of vesting where conditions are non-market based. The expense of the share awards under the deferred bonus 
plan is also adjusted for the probability of performance conditions being achieved. The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of  
IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and has recognised an expense only in respect of share options 
and share awards granted since 7 November 2002.
Own shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”)
Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT are included in the Group financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in  
the Company are debited directly in equity to retained earnings.
(k) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
(l) Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales related taxes and intra-group transactions. Revenue 
from services rendered is recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings  
is issued or in certain circumstances, in proportion to the stage of completion, normally determined by reference to costs incurred to date  
in proportion to the total anticipated costs of the transaction at the reporting date. Revenue in respect of outsourcing services is normally 
recognised when a tranche of work is complete and can be invoiced in accordance with contractual obligations. In certain countries it is 
standard practice for work performed on behalf of sub-contractors to be invoiced subsequent to the sub-contractors obtaining settlement 
from the main contractor. In these circumstances the revenue is recognised as deferred revenue on completion of a tranche of work. 
(m) Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, facility fees, interest 
receivable on funds invested, net foreign exchange gains or losses on external income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities, 
and gains and losses on hedging instruments, that are recognised in the income statement (see accounting policy (e)). Interest income is 
recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest rate method. 
(n) Income tax 
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Intertek Annual Report 2010 85
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax is provided using the statement of financial position liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; overseas retained earnings, the distribution of which is under  
the control of the Group, and which are not likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future; and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they 
intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the  
related dividend.
(o) Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as a movement in equity when they are paid. Final dividends are reported as a movement in equity in the 
year in which they are approved by the shareholders.
(p) Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
3 Operating segments and presentation of results
The Group is organised into six operating divisions each of which offer services to different industries and are managed separately: Consumer 
Goods; Commercial & Electrical; Oil, Chemical & Agri; Analytical Services; Industrial Services; and Minerals. The costs of the corporate head 
office and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions. 
These divisions are the operating segments that are reported to the chief operating decision maker and are the Group’s reportable segments. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. There is no significant seasonality in the Group’s operations. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly borrowings, pension fund liabilities, corporate expenses and assets and tax. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment, and computer software.
Principal activities are as follows:

Notes to the financial statements
4 Separately disclosed items (continued)
In line with IAS 38, acquisition intangibles are amortised over their useful economic life. This amortisation is excluded from adjusted results 
and is separately disclosed as this is consistent with the way in which results are reviewed by Intertek management and provides a consistent 
view of performance across the Group’s operations.
Acquisition and integration costs include £2.7m (2009: £1.9m) for costs in relation to discussions with Det Norske Veritas, £2.1m (2009: £0.6m)  
for costs associated with the acquisitions described in note 22 and ongoing acquisitions, and £0.5m (2009: £nil) in respect of integration costs.
Claims of £2.8m (2009: £3.8m) relate principally to the settlement of a claim from a group of employees in the USA in the Oil, Chemical & 
Agri division. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps of £1.0m (2009: £nil) was recycled from equity when the hedging instruments became ineffective on  
the repayment of senior term loans. 
The income tax associated with the separately disclosed items is a credit of £5.7m (2009: credit of £5.6m).

9 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share,  
an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, goodwill impairment and other separately disclosed items. It has been calculated to allow shareholders to have a better 
understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

In order to determine whether impairments are required the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each CGU. The calculation is  
based on projecting future cash flows over a five year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. 
The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity model which assumes long term growth rate on the operating cash flows of between 
2.5% to 4.1% (2009: 2% to 5%) reflecting the long term GDP growth forecasts in the various regions in which the respective CGUs operate.  
A discount factor is applied to obtain a ‘value in use’ which is the recoverable amount, unless the fair value less costs to sell the respective 
CGU is an amount in excess of the ‘value in use’. 
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs. The approved budget for the following 
financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU. The cash flow projections in the four financial years following the 
budget year reflect management’s conservative expectations of the medium term operating performance of the CGUs and growth prospects 
in the various CGU’s markets and regions. 
Key assumptions
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the revenue and operating margin growth rates which directly influence the 
forecasted operating cash flows, as well as the discount rate applied. In determining the key assumptions, management have taken into 
account the current economic climate and the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates. 
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to the following key assumptions:
(i) Operating cash flow
One of the key drivers of the operating cash flow is revenue. The 2011 revenue figures for each CGU are based on the 2011 approved budget. 
For the years 2012 to 2015, the likely organic growth rates were assessed for each region in the CGU, taking account of past experience and 
GDP growth prospects. The annual growth rates ranged from 8.3% to 13.9% (2009: 3.5% to 8.4%). In all cases it is considered that the 
assumed growth rates are conservative. 
The other key driver of the operating cash flow is operating profit. The assumed operating profit growth rates, which are considered 
conservative, ranged from 7.6% to 22.1% (2009: 1.3% to 16.7%) reflecting management assessment of current and future market environment 
of the sectors and countries in which the CGUs operate. 
(ii) Discount rate applied 
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks 
specific to the CGU. The discount rates applied to the CGU were in the range of 9.8% to 14.3% (2009: 10.6% to 14.5%). 
Sensitivity analysis
There are no realistic changes that could be made to the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of each CGU  
to exceed its recoverable amount. Management have also considered the effect of the following extreme scenarios: 
(i) Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2012 to 2015 from the 2011 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with base 
assumptions, all CGUs continue to show sufficiency of headroom. 
(ii) Assuming 0% growth in operating profit in 2012 to 2015, with revenues increasing per base assumptions, all CGUs continue to show 
positive headroom.
(iii) Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%, all CGUs continue to show headroom.
Management consider that the likelihood of any or all of the above extreme scenarios occurring is low. 
There are no intangible assets with indefinite lives. 96 Intertek Annual Report 2010

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the Group can utilise the benefits from them.
There is a temporary difference of £12.5m (2009: £11.7m) which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings. No deferred tax  
is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either 
repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.

15 Interest bearing loans and borrowings (continued)
Description of borrowings
Total undrawn committed borrowing facilities as at 31 December 2010 were £336.2m (2009: £153.2m).
Principal bank facility
In February 2011, the Group successfully completed the refinancing of the principal bank facility.  The new syndicated facility comprises a 
US$600m multi-currency revolving credit facility available to 31 March 2016. Advances under the new facility bear interest at a rate equal to 
LIBOR, or their local currency equivalent, plus a margin, depending upon the Group’s leverage. On execution of the new facility, the Group’s 
original principal bank facility was cancelled. 
The original facility was raised in 2004 and had a final maturity date of 15 December 2011. The facility comprised four separate tranches or 
facilities, all of which were cancelled in February 2011, which were as follows: 
Facility A was a £14m multi-currency term loan that was repaid prior to 2010.
Facility B was a £225m multi-currency revolving credit facility that was repaid during 2010. Drawings under facility B at 31 December 2010 
were £nil (2009: £106.4m).
Facility C was a 364 day £80m multi-currency revolving credit facility. Facility C was initially reduced to £48m prior to 2010 and then reduced 
to £44m in November 2010. Drawings under facility C at 31 December 2010 were £nil (2009: £8.1m).   
Facility D was a £100m multi-currency term loan facility that was reduced to £93.6m prior to 2010. Drawings under facility D at 31 December 
2010 were £93.6m (2009: £92.1m). 
Advances under the facilities bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, or other local currency equivalent, plus a margin. The margin over LIBOR 
for facility D was in the range of 0.3% to 0.5% in accordance with a leverage grid. As at 31 December 2010, the margin was 0.3%. 
Private placement bonds
In June 2008, the Group raised US$100m by way of a senior note issue. The notes are repayable on 26 June 2015 and pay a fixed annual 
interest rate of 5.54%. 
In December 2008, the Group issued a further US$100m of senior notes. These notes were issued in two tranches with US$25m repayable 
on 21 January 2014 at a fixed annual interest rate of 7.5% and US$75m repayable on 10 June 2016 at a fixed annual interest rate of 8.0%.
In December 2010, the Group issued a further US$250m of senior notes. These notes were issued in two tranches with US$100m repayable 
on 15 December 2017 at a fixed annual interest rate of 3.2% and US$150m repayable on 15 December 2020 at a fixed annual interest rate  
of 3.91%.
Other facilities
In January 2010, the Group signed a US$60m bilateral, multi-currency facility available to 25 January 2013. Drawings under this facility  
at 31 December 2010 were nil.
In December 2010, the Group signed a further bilateral multi-currency facility available to 31 March 2016. The facility comprises a £20m 
multi-currency revolver facility and a €12m multi-currency term loan facility. Drawings under these facilities at 31 December 2010 were nil.

Contingent consideration represents the additional amounts payable on acquisitions which are uncertain in amount, since they are based  
on the acquired businesses achieving agreed future performance targets.
From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The outcome of such 
litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings. Based on information 
currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to 
have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future. 
The provision for claims of £17.9m (2009: £15.8m) represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from 
customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs. The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is 
uncertain but is likely to be within one year. Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 26.
The other provision of £4.0m (2009: £4.2m) comprises £1.5m (2009: £2.5m) for restructuring in the Oil, Chemical & Agri division, £2.0m 
(2009: £1.7m) in relation to onerous contracts and £0.5m (2009: £nil) in relation to acquisition integration costs. 100 Intertek Annual Report 2010

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements. 
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The United Kingdom schemes 
are the Intertek Pension Scheme and the Capcis Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme that came into the Group through the 
acquisition of the Umitek group in January 2007. These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.  
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
In 2010, as part of the acquisition of Expert Services on 31 March 2010, Swiss pension assets were transferred by the vendors into an 
insurance plan on behalf of the employees transferred to the Group. Pension arrangements in respect of existing Intertek Swiss employees 
were also transferred into the same plan. This insured plan provides a guaranteed rate of return on investment and a guaranteed annuity 
conversion rate in accordance with Swiss law. As such this plan has been treated as a defined benefit plan. Subsequent to the acquisition 
date, a new fully insured Swiss pension scheme was formed.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined  
contribution schemes.
The Group fully recognises any actuarial gains and losses in each year in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

See (b) below for pension interest cost and expected return on scheme assets recognised in the consolidated income statement.
(b) The pension cost for the defined benefit schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. The last full triennial 
actuarial valuation of The Intertek Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom was carried out as at 1 April 2010, but this has been updated to  
31 December 2010 for IAS 19 purposes. The last full triennial actuarial valuation of the Capcis Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme  
in the UK was carried out as at 1 April 2007 and this has also been updated to 31 December 2010 for IAS 19 purposes. The last full actuarial 
valuation of the Hong Kong scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2009, for local accounting purposes but this has been updated to  
31 December 2010 for IAS 19 purposes. The Swiss plans were actuarially valued for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December 2010.
The Group is currently making additional contributions into the pension schemes with the overall objective of paying off the deficits in line with 
actuaries’ recommendations. 102 Intertek Annual Report 2010

* In July 2010, the UK Government announced its intention to base statutory minimum increases in revaluation in deferment and pension increases on the Consumer Prices index 
(CPI), rather than the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The Trustees of the main UK scheme therefore took legal advice on how this would impact on the scheme. Following this legal 
advice, the revaluation of benefits in deferment and pension increases in payment under the Scheme will, with effect from January 2011, be based on the CPI instead of the RPI. 
For pension accrued after 5 April 2005, pension increases in payment are subject to a cap of 2.5% per annum. For pensions accrued prior to 5 April 2005, pension increases in 
payment are subject to a cap of 5% per annum. It is estimated that the effect of this change to CPI has resulted in a reduction in liabilities of approximately £2.7m. This gain has 
been recognised within the actuarial gains and losses.
The retirement arrangements in Hong Kong pays lump sums to members instead of pensions and the Swiss schemes are insured plans.
The expected rates of return on scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices which take into account the current level of 
expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with equities and the expectation for future returns 
on such assets. The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance 
in the plan’s investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such 
assets at the reporting date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments. This is based on an out-performance assumption  
over gilt yields.
The actual return on scheme assets was as follows:

*   The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays lump sums to members instead of pensions at the point they retire. Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life 
expectancy of the members, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong scheme.
** Applies from March 2010 following the acquisition of Expert Services.
The table above shows, for the United Kingdom schemes, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were  
aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December. The 2010 mortality tables adopted are the PNA00 projected by year of birth, with an allowance for  
the medium cohort effect and a minimum improvement of 1% (the same tables were used in 2009). For the Swiss schemes, the mortality 
table adopted is the BVG 2005, an industry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Swiss pension funds.

23 Share schemes
(a) Share option schemes 
The Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997. The maximum number of options that can be 
granted under the scheme have been allocated and that scheme has been discontinued. In May 2002, the Intertek Group plc 2002 Share 
Option Plan (the 2002 Plan) and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option Plan (the Approved Plan) were established for 
employees to be granted share options at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. These plans have also been discontinued and  
the last grants under these plans were made in September 2005.

(c) Mirror share awards
On 14 May 2010, Lloyd Pitchford was granted conditional rights to acquire 49,039 1p shares in Intertek Group plc under a one-off 
arrangement to facilitate his recruitment as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. During the year 19,166 shares vested and 2,940 shares 
lapsed. At 31 December 2010, there were 26,933 shares outstanding. 
Details of the share option schemes, the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and the mirror share awards are shown in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 54 to 65.
(d) Equity-settled transactions
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for shares and share options granted to employees, is measured by 
reference to the fair value of shares and share options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based  
on the Monte Carlo formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of shares and share options. 
During the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group recognised an expense of £7.4m (2009: £4.9m) in respect of outstanding share and 
share option awards granted from 7 November 2002 onwards. 110 Intertek Annual Report 2010

The deferred and matching shares, under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan, are granted under a service condition. Such condition is not taken into 
account in the fair value measurement at grant date. The matching shares, issued under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan, are also granted under  
a performance related market condition and as a result this condition is taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
24 Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interest rate and 
currency risk are set out in the Directors’ Report – Financial Review on pages 27 to 29 and Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 38 to 41.

(ii) Impairment losses
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows:
           2010 2009 
           £m £m
Under 3 months         205.2 173.5
Between 3 and 6 months        21.8 22.7
Between 6 and 12 months        11.7 10.8
Over 12 months         7.3 6.6
Gross trade receivables        246.0 213.6
Allowance for impairment        (10.3) (9.9)
Trade receivables, net of allowance       235.7 203.7
Included in trade receivables under three months of £205.2m (2009: £173.5m) are trade receivables of £118.2m (2009: £101.1m) which are 
not yet due for payment under the Group’s standard terms and conditions of sale.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:
           2010 2009 
Impairment allowance for doubtful trade receivables       £m £m
At 1 January         9.9 10.0
Exchange differences         0.3 (0.6)
Cash recovered         (0.4) (0.4)
Impairment loss recognised        4.8 6.2
Receivables written off         (4.3) (5.3)
At 31 December         10.3 9.9
There were no significant individual impairments of trade receivables.
Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. The Group assesses 
periodically the creditworthiness of customers. The Group’s credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities that make up the 
Group’s customer base and the diversification across many different industries and geographic regions.
Allowance for impairment is based on the risk profile of the trade receivable based on the likelihood of the amount being recovered. Based 
on historic default rates, reflecting the track record of payments by the Group’s customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance 
is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the 
bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable. The Group provides fully for all trade receivables over  
12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable. Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific trade 
receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable. At that time the trade receivable is written off.
 (iii) Counterparty 
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings. Given this, management does 
not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
(b) Liquidity risk

(c) Interest rate risk
(i) Hedging
The Group assesses and monitors its interest rate risk.  The Group has entered into swaps to maintain an appropriate level of fixed and floating 
rate interest payments. Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals,  
the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. 
During the year, the Group increased its proportion of fixed rate debt, repaying its floating rate debt. On repayment of the floating rate  
debt, the interest rate swaps attached to the relevant tranche of debt became ineffective. Consequently, an amount of £1.9m (2009: £nil) 
was recycled to the income statement from the hedging reserve. The remaining swaps mature over the next year and have fixed swap  
rates ranging from 3.3% to 3.8%. At 31 December 2010, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of £64.6m 
(2009: £88.5m).
The net fair value of swaps at 31 December 2010 was £1.0m (2009: £3.0m) comprising liabilities of £1.0m (2009: £3.0m). These amounts 
were recognised as fair value derivatives.

Notes to the financial statements
24 Financial instruments (continued)
(iii) Sensitivity
At 31 December 2010, it is estimated that a general increase of 3% in interest rates would decrease the Group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £0.4m (2009: £0.5m). Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation. This analysis assumes all other variables 
remain constant. 
(d) Foreign currency risk
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Group’s shareholders’ funds and a substantial percentage of the 
Group’s revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling. Because of the high proportion of international activity, 
the Group’s profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Two types of risk arise as a result: (i) translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse 
currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and (ii) transaction risk, 
that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Group’s commercial cash flows in various currencies.

Trade payables    32.2 6.5 6.4 2.6 2.0 6.1 8.6
(ii) Recognised assets and liabilities
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and  
for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement. 
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of forward exchange contracts was £nil (2009: £nil).
(iii) Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries
The Group’s foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Group’s investment in its respective subsidiaries.  
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2010 was £383.6m (2009: £237.9m).
A foreign exchange loss of £6.3m (2009: gain of £27.2m) was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans  
to sterling.
(iv) Sensitivity
It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar (the main currency impacting the Group) would 
have decreased the Group’s profit before tax for 2010 by approximately £13.8m (2009: £15.8m). The forward exchange contracts have been 
included in this calculation. This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.

Interest rate swaps       – (3.0) – (3.0)
The major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments are summarised below.
(i) Interest rate swaps
Bank valuations are used to estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps. Valuations are tested by considering the equivalent swap rate  
as at 31 December and calculating the difference in interest earned at this rate compared to the original swap rates.
(ii) Forward exchange contracts
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted market price, if available. If a quoted market price is not available,  
the fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual 
maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
(iii) Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The fair value of the floating interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the floating interest rates were reset just 
prior to the year end. The fair value of the fixed interest bearing loans and borrowings has been calculated based on the present value of 
future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate at the reporting date. 
(iv) Trade receivables and payables
For trade receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.  
All others are estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
(v) Available-for-sale financial assets
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date. 
(vi) Interest rates used for determining fair value
Prevailing market interest rates at the reporting date are used to discount future cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets  
and liabilities.
g) Capital management
The Group actively monitors the financial capital of the Group to maintain a robust capital base to ensure that market and key stakeholders 
retain confidence in the capital profile. This is discussed in more detail in the Financial Review on page 29.

Litigation
From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims  
for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with employees and former employees.  
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of litigation to which the Intertek Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen as in some cases the facts are unclear 
or further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case. However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider 
that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the 
financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future. 
Tax
The Group operates in more than 100 countries and is subject to a wide range of complex tax laws and regulations. At any point in time  
it is normal for there to be a number of open years in any particular territory which may be subject to enquiry by local authorities. Where  
the effect of the laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which  
are recognised in the financial statements. The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable; but this can 
involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different 
from the estimates reflected in the financial statements. 
27 Related parties
Identity of related parties
The Group has a related party relationship with its key management.

Director Director
Intertek Group plc – Company Balance Sheet
As at 31 December 2010 Intertek Annual Report 2010 119
(a) Accounting policies – Company  
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and under the historical 
cost accounting rules.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated 
accounts which it has prepared. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. All foreign exchange differences 
are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. Deferred tax 
assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits  
to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions:
(i) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
(ii) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments, or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share 
premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges. Finance payments 
associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds are dealt with as appropriations in the reconciliation  
of movements in shareholders’ funds.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds 
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised 
and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the 
financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Intercompany financial guarantees
When the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as  
a contingent liability, until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments
Intertek Group plc runs a share ownership programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company. In order to encourage 
share ownership, a share option scheme for senior management was established in March 1997. This option programme was discontinued in 
2006 and was replaced by a new Long Term Incentive Plan.
Notes to the Company financial statements  120 Intertek Annual Report 2010
Notes to the Company financial statements 
(a) Accounting policies – Company (continued)  
The fair value of options and share awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. As the Company has no employees, there is no recognition of an employee expense nor the corresponding 
increase in equity. However, the Company grants options and awards over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and therefore 
the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries, equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge 
recognised in respect of employees of the subsidiaries, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The fair value granted is measured using the Monte Carlo model. This method, in calculating the fair value, takes into account 
various factors including the expected volatility of the shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
The fair value of shares granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan is also measured using the Monte Carlo model and is spread over the 
period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
See note 23 in the Group financial statements for further information on the share schemes. 
(b) Profit and loss account
Amounts paid to the Company’s auditor and their associates in respect of services to the Company, other than the audit of the Company’s 
financial statements, have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis.
The Company does not have any employees. 
Details of the remuneration of the Directors are set out in the Remuneration Report.

Aggregate amount of dividends paid in the financial year     42.5 34.7
The aggregate amount of dividends proposed and recognised as liabilities as at 31 December 2010 is £nil (2009: £nil). The aggregate amount 
of dividends proposed and not recognised as liabilities as at 31 December 2010 is £30m (2009: £27.5m).

The Company has granted options over its own shares and made share awards to the employees of its direct and indirectly owned 
subsidiaries, and as such, the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in subsidiaries of £7.4m (2009: £4.9m). Details  
of the principal operating subsidiaries are set out in note 29 to the Group financial statements.
The Company had two direct subsidiary undertakings at 31 December 2010. Intertek Testing Services Holdings Limited and Intertek Holdings 
Limited, both of which are holding companies, are incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in England and Wales. All interests are 
in the ordinary share capital and all are wholly owned. In the opinion of the Directors, the value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings 
is not less than the amount at which the investments are stated in the balance sheet.
There is no impairment to the carrying value of these investments.

Environmental impact 
At Atkins we are genuinely concerned about 
our environmental performance. You can 
help us to reduce our environmental impact 
by opting to receive electronic versions of 
shareholder communications (e-comms).  
As well as the obvious “green” benefits, 
e-comms is also faster than the post.
Please visit www.myatkinsshares.com  
to sign up for e-comms. We will donate  
£1 to RedR (Register of Engineers for  
Disaster Relief) for each shareholder who 
chooses this method of communication. 
At our AGM this year we are seeking 
approval to communicate with our 
shareholders electronically, except  
where a shareholder specifically  
requests otherwise. Full details are  
contained in the notice of meeting. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

RESULTS
I am pleased to report that the Group performed well last 
year, with revenue up 20% and normalised profit before 
taxation up by 19%. This result was driven by substantial 
growth in the Middle East; good performance from our Design 
and Engineering Solutions, and Highways and Transportation 
segments; and the recovery in the workload of our Rail 
segment. The Group’s cash performance continues to be 
strong and we ended the year with net funds of £199.1m.
The Group’s results, however, were adversely impacted by 
an exceptional loss of £121.3m (£120.1m after tax) in relation 
to the Metronet Enterprise. This loss includes an impairment 
write-down which reduces the carrying value of the Group’s 
investment in Metronet to £nil.
On 21 June 2007, Metronet announced its intention to 
invite the Arbiter to conduct an Extraordinary Review on 
Metronet BCV in July and on Metronet SSL later in the year. 
Negotiations are ongoing with Metronet’s banks to ensure 
that it has adequate funding until the completion of the 
Extraordinary Review.
Atkins is committed to working with Metronet, its banks 
and other stakeholders to ensure that it can continue through 
to the outcome of the Extraordinary Review.
PEOPLE
Headcount rose by over 1,900 in the year to nearly 
17,000 and it is encouraging that our focus on people has 
reduced staff turnover from 14.1% to 13.8%. We have 
made significant investment in enhancing our training and 
development programmes to ensure that our employees can 
continue to develop their careers within the Group. Staff 
mobility remains a priority to allow the transfer of skills 
and sharing of resources on significant projects. To remain 
successful with an increasingly diverse workforce we must 
continue to encourage excellence and create an environment 
in which all our people can flourish.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 
employees throughout the Group for their efforts in the year.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
On 31 December 2006 Christopher Kemball retired as a 
non-executive director. I would like to thank Christopher for 
his valued contribution to the Board over the last four years, 
during which time the Group has seen many challenges. On 
13 March 2007 we welcomed Fiona Clutterbuck to the Board 
as a non-executive director and on 1 April 2007 she joined 
the Audit Committee. Fiona heads the financial institutions 
advisory practice of ABN AMRO. Our Group HR director  
Alun Griffiths also joined the Board on 13 March 2007  
as an executive director.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 14.0p,  
making the total dividend for the year 20.0p (2006: 16.0p), 
an increase of 25%.
OUTLOOK
We start the new year in a very good position with work  
in hand representing 58% of our budgeted revenue (2006: 
62%). The demand for our services in our key markets is 
strong and we are confident that the Group will continue  
to achieve further progress in the year ahead.

Ed Wallis
I am pleased to report that the Group performed 
well last year, with revenue up 20%. CHIEF EXECUTIVE – OUR STRATEGY
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE EIGHT 
Plan, Design, Enable is what we do. We now have a focused 
company, extremely well positioned to both improve our 
consultancy services and continue to grow in a whole range of 
sectors where our depth in design, engineering and planning 
skills can be brought to bear. The complexity of our client 
capital programmes continues to increase and skills from 
all our business segments are absolutely key to our ability 
to address them successfully. Internal boundaries are being 
eroded to enable greater collaboration by people across 
teams, business segments and countries. 
Identity and Excellence is our shorthand for how we are 
taking the Group forward. It is about keeping the balance 
between our development of technical and design skills, staff 
retention and recruitment, generation of cash, the winning 
of the work we want to have and, most importantly, the 
successful completion of the work we have won. All must  
be continually kept in balance as the Group goes forward.  
But the last point is absolutely fundamental. 
We have successfully done this for the past three years and 
are confident growth will continue to be the consequence 
of this strategic focus. While we continue to have a strong 
balance sheet which could position us well for acquisitions, 
our focus is on organic growth with excellence as the driver. 
With selective bolt-on acquisitions to supplement, it is vital 
we keep our ethos clearly intact as we continue to grow in 
both capability and size. Our size means we must continue 
to decentralise and build local management strengths and 
simultaneously glue the Group together to allow not only  
staff mobility and flexible career development within the 
whole Group, but also to ensure resources are focused  
on projects that transcend business segment boundaries.  
The protocols we applied to the Dubai Metro project have 
been an excellent first example of how we wish to achieve  
this as a matter of course.
A significant challenge for us is to continue to attract 
talented people to the Group and to retain them. We are 
establishing links with academia and are looking to recruit  
a broader cross-section of talent and experience. We are  
also accelerating recruitment in our Global Design Centres  
in Bangalore and Sharjah – not to save costs, but to enable  
us to recruit some of the brightest engineers in the world  
to our organisation.
Chief executive – Our strategy 
Keith Clarke
We are focused on answering increasingly 
complex questions. CHIEF EXECUTIVE – OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE NINE
The next half decade will see the most radical changes 
to the design process (including procurement) we have 
ever seen. It will be a far greater impact than the advent of 
Computer Aided Design (CAD) or climate change. The need  
to move rapidly towards a sustainable society will introduce 
extra complexity. This is not about bolt-on green initiatives, 
nor offsetting, but introducing at the very start of the 
conceptual planning of all projects – whether buildings, 
utilities, urban design or infrastructures – a different set of 
values. Atkins with its breadth and depth of skills is ideally 
placed to tackle such complex projects if we keep to our 
strategy of Identity and Excellence. Within this context and 
exciting future we must not lose sight of leadership on health 
and safety, and not just Atkins’ staff but of the construction 
industry as a whole. 
To conclude, we have a great position, good markets, 
opportunities to lead change and a proven track record  
with a strong reputation.

RANK OVERVIEW
Our headcount grew by 1,917 to 16,824 full-time equivalent 
employees and agency staff as at 31 March 2007. Our people 
are based in a number of locations across the world with 
nearly three-quarters employed in the UK. The major increases 
have been in the Middle East where headcount grew by over 
70% to approximately 2,000.
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
Recruitment and retention are essential to growing our 
business. Our investment over the past few years in building 
a strong recruitment capability has enabled us to recruit 
effectively in a highly competitive market. During the year,  
our e-recruitment platform was extended to include our China 
business (where applicants can now apply in Chinese as well 
as English). We are currently recruiting around 4,000 staff 
per annum. Atkins’ success depends on our ability to recruit 
and retain talented professionals and provide them with an 
environment in which they can excel.
Staff turnover was 13.8% last year, continuing the positive 
trend seen since 2005.
We have seen strong growth in the number of staff 
employed in Global Design Centres (GDCs) with headcount now 
exceeding 450. This marks an important shift in our recruitment 
practice as we access signiﬁcant talent pools outside the UK, 
in particular in India, in response to a growing skills shortage 
in the UK. Whilst located outside the UK staff employed in the 
GDCs are not an outsourced service but an integral part of our 
established businesses, employing high calibre staff with skills in 
engineering, architecture and project management. We expect 
this shift to accelerate over the next few years. 
This year we recruited over 250 graduates into the Group 
and have close links with a number of UK and non-UK 
universities. We visit over 40 universities as part of our 
recruitment process and attract applicants from over 60 
institutions. Our profile as a leading graduate recruiter in 
the UK continues to improve as evidenced by our improved 
ranking in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers (up to  
59 from 66). We were also voted the most popular graduate 
recruiter in the construction sector of the Target National 
Graduate Recruitment Awards for the second year running. 
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Investment in training and development increased during 
the year, reflecting the high priority we give to developing 
the skills and capabilities of our staff. In total, we now invest 
2.5% of payroll and expect this to rise further to 2.8%  
during 2007/8.
Participation in our core training programmes was high,  
with over 1,800 employees attending courses focused on 
people management, commercial and client management. 
These courses were run in the Middle East and China for the 
first time. Many more staff have attended technical training 
relevant to their professional discipline.
A new partnership was formed with Ashridge School 
of Management to develop bespoke courses to enhance 
management capacity. So far over 200 managers have attended 
masterclasses on leadership and business management. 
The number of managers attending in-house management 
development centres increased by 25% to 257, with a further 
35 managers attending our senior management development 
programme. 
This year has also seen the successful implementation of 
corporate induction events held in the UK, Middle East and 
China, which have been well regarded by more than 2,500 
new starters who have attended.

COMMUNICATION AND EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
The staff response rate to “Viewpoint”, our employee 
engagement survey, increased from 71% to 73%. For the 
first time, we were able to make the survey available not only 
in English but also in Chinese, Swedish, Danish, Polish and 
Portuguese. Our Employee Engagement Index, a measure of 
how staff view the Group and how they are contributing to  
its success, rose from 71% to 72%. Our profile as a Group 
shows that we perform very well in terms of job clarity, client 
focus and equipping staff with the skills to do their jobs, but 
less well in areas such as feedback and recognition. Whilst this 
profile is typical of organisations in science, engineering and 
technology, we are committed to making Atkins a better place 
in which to work and will be focusing effort to improve our 
performance in these areas.
REWARD
It is our policy to reward staff competitively in line with good 
practice for the markets in which we operate and we continue 
to monitor our remuneration practices accordingly. Over 500 
senior staff now participate in our executive bonus scheme 
which significantly increases remuneration for delivering 
superior business performance. Others are able to benefit 
from discretionary bonus schemes, with awards made to 
approximately 20% of staff during the year.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and 
defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and other 
regions. In March, the Group began consultation with the 
members of the principal final salary scheme regarding a 
proposal to close the scheme to future accrual. As part of the 
proposed changes, approximately 1,900 staff would in future 
accrue pension via the defined contributions section of the 
Plan. In parallel, a cash injection of £140m over four years  
is proposed to significantly reduce the actuarial deficit.
DIVERSITY
Atkins operates in a changing world. We recognise that our 
success will in part be determined by our attractiveness as 
an employer to an increasingly diverse population and by our 
effectiveness in bringing staff from different backgrounds 
together to work on projects. 
Whilst we were delighted to be recognised as one of the 
Top 50 Places Where Women Want to Work in The Times’ 
inaugural awards, and are proud of the growing diversity of 
our workforce, we recognise that we have much to achieve  
if we are to meet our aspirations as an employer of choice. 
We have established a diversity steering group of business 
representatives drawn from the principal businesses and 
regions and chaired by the managing director of our 
engineering solutions business. This has a remit to champion 
this issue, to initiate change and to monitor our performance. 
Atkins Horizons, a networking group for women in science, 
engineering and technology, continues to expand. This 
provides a forum to discuss a range of issues affecting women 
in the workplace. We are using our influence in the sector to 
drive change with Sir Peter Williams and Alun Griffiths sitting 
on the advisory board of the UK Resource Centre for Women 
in Science, Engineering and Technology, the body established 
to support the delivery of the Government’s strategy for 
women in those disciplines.

Operating and ﬁnancial review
Overview of the business and performance in the year
Atkins provides professional 
design and engineering 
consultancy services. We are the 
largest engineering consultancy 
in the UK and the third largest 
global design ﬁrm.
Our business
Our core business is helping our clients 
to plan, design and enable their capital 
programmes that resolve challenges  
in the built and natural environment.
We are able to plan all aspects 
of our clients’ projects, conducting 
feasibility studies and impact 
analyses covering technical, logistical, 
legal, environmental and financial 
considerations. We design systems, 
infrastructures, processes, buildings 
and civil structures. We enable our 
clients’ complex programmes by 
optimising procurement methods 
and managing supply chains on their 
behalf, to reduce timescales, cost  
and risk.
The Group’s operations and 
customers are primarily UK-based, with 
82% of revenue being derived from UK 
operations (2006: 85%). Revenue from 
our non-UK operations grew by 43% 
in year, driven by strong growth in the 
Middle East, while our UK businesses 
grew 16%. Our most significant 
businesses outside the UK are in the 
Middle East, China and the US.
We report our activities in seven 
business segments as this reflects how 
we manage the business according 
to different markets and geographies 
where appropriate. An overview 
is shown on pages 4-5. Details of 
activities and results by business 
segment are shown on pages 18-29. The Group uses a range of performance measures to monitor 
and manage the business. Those that are particularly 
important in monitoring our progress in generating 
shareholder value are considered key performance indicators 
(KPIs). Our KPIs measure past performance and also provide 
information to allow us to manage the business into the 
future. Revenue, operating profit and margin, earnings per 
share (EPS) and operating cash flow indicate the volume of 
work we have done, its profitability and the efficiency with 
which we have turned operating profits into cash; work in 
hand measures our secured workload over the next year; 
headcount and staff turnover show us how effective we have 
been in recruiting and retaining our key resource. KPIs for 
2007 are shown below, along with prior year comparatives. 
In the year ended 31 March 2007 the Group’s revenue grew  
by 20% to £1,263.6m. Operating profit before exceptional 
items increased by 22% to £76.6m while the Group’s 
underlying operating margins grew slightly to 6.1%.
Operating cash flow in the year was £106.1m and net 
funds at 31 March 2007 were £199.1m. Normalised diluted 
EPS grew by 11.4p per share to 61.5p, an increase of 23%.
At 31 March 2007 we had secured 58% of budgeted 
revenue for 2007/08, compared with 62% last year.  
If Metronet work is excluded, our work in hand is 58% 
compared with 58% last year. 
Headcount increased by over 1,900 (13%); five acquisitions 
added 300 staff in the year but the majority of growth

Design and Engineering Solutions had a good year with 
growth in revenue of £52.9m (18%) and an increase in 
operating profit of £4.7m (20%). Our core markets remain 
strong and the focus on strengthening relationships with key 
clients has enabled us to increase operating margins. We 
have successfully added 695 staff during the year; 70% of 
this growth was organic, with the remaining staff joining the 
Group as a result of the two acquisitions made in the year.
During the year our nuclear business grew strongly and we 
now have over 440 employees working in this market, up from 
320 last year. We provide a range of engineering services in 
the design of new facilities and infrastructure, in extending 
the operational life of existing nuclear facilities and in 
decommissioning. Our clients include AWE where we continue 
to grow our design house services under a three-year contract 
to 2008, and British Energy, with whom we have been working 
under a three-year contract to 2008. This year we have also set 
up a ‘Nuclear Training Academy’ supported by the University 
of Surrey, focused on training suitably qualified engineers to 
satisfy the industry requirements for working in the nuclear 
sector. Forty staff have graduated from the academy to date.
Our aerospace business performed well this year with 
significant growth from Airbus where we are supporting three 
of their major aircraft development programmes. We provide 
independent structural stress analysis and certification on 
the A380 wings, design and analysis services for the wings 
of the military A400M and we are incorporating the use of 
composite materials in the design of the developmental A350 
extra wide body aircraft. 
Our architecture and design business in the UK works on 
significant public and private sector projects both in the UK 
as well as non-UK locations: examples include the design of 
a new 400-unit residential tower in Swansea; the Regatta 
Jakarta, a major new design project in Indonesia; and concept 
proposals for a mixed-use development in central Islamabad, 
which will boast Pakistan’s tallest building.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) continues to change 
the way that it procures large capital projects by using 
independent systems houses such as Atkins to manage its 
capital programmes. Our success on the Future Rapid Effect 
System (FRES) programme has continued and will provide 
further work for our defence business. The acquisition of 
Advantage in March 2007 brought through-life capability 
management expertise to the Group, complementing our 
existing skills in defence systems engineering and enabling 
increased access to the defence market. 
Our oil and gas business has seen significant growth to

STAFF LOCATION (APPROX %) more than 260 staff; an increase of more than 100 compared 
with last year. The integration of both MSL and Boreas, 
which were acquired in March 2006 and December 2006 
respectively, has gone well and contributed to a 60% growth 
in revenue. These acquisitions brought complementary safety 
and reliability skills to the Group and help our clients extend 
the life of oil and gas fields by managing the integrity of  
their infrastructure. 
Our work for UK water companies continues to grow 
significantly. During the year, our contract with United 
Utilities grew substantially, and we are working with them in 
integrated work streams covering design and commissioning 
work as part of their five-year investment programme. We 
were also the only consultancy to be appointed to each one 
of the six four-year framework contracts awarded by Scottish 
Water and have won outsourcing contracts issued under 
Southern Water’s five-year master framework agreement. 
Revenue from environment and planning services 
accounted for nearly 20% of the segment’s revenue this year. 
Our involvement in the London Olympic Park regeneration  
project continues to grow and complements our wider 
regeneration activities in the Thames Gateway. We are 
assisting with the creation of sustainable communities of 
mixed-use developments within the region, which faces the 
challenge of accommodating population growth without 
building on green belt or other open spaces.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for Design and Engineering Solutions is positive 
with good medium-term prospects in each of our targeted 
sectors. We have secured 42% of our budgeted revenue for 
2007/08, slightly down from 44% last year. Prospects for the 
year ahead are good and our diverse range of complementary 
technical skills that can be applied in several markets enables 
us to be confident in the future.
We are increasingly hiring front-office engineering 
professionals in our offices in Bangalore (India) and Sharjah 
(UAE) to service our clients. The number of people working  
in Bangalore and Sharjah for Design and Engineering 
Solutions is now over 200 and we expect this to increase 
significantly next year and beyond.

Our Highways and Transportation segment had a good year 
with growth in all parts of the business, despite a slow start. 
Operating profit increased by £2.2m (20%) as margins grew 
to 5.3% (2006: 5.1%) due to the strong demand for our 
higher margin design activities. The business continues to 
offer a broad range of services in highways management, 
transport planning and design. Over 90% of revenue  
comes from public sector clients, both central government 
and agencies.
For the second year running we’ve 
received a top award for our safety 
management systems
The highways services business, which represents around 
65% of this segment, is engaged in operating, maintaining 
and improving highways and motorways on behalf of the 
Highways Agency and local authorities. This year’s results 
included the first year of our five-year Gloucestershire County 
Council contract, which commenced in April 2006, and the 
first seven months of our up to ten-year £250m integrated 
contract to provide transport consultancy and highways 
management services for Cambridgeshire County Council. 
We have been granted a seven-month extension to our 
Northamptonshire contract to March 2008.
Whilst capital funding remains relatively strong there is 
continuing downward pressure on revenue budgets for local 
authorities. This is leading to longer term, more complex 
service contracts where quality and certainty of service 
outcome are as important as price. Our technical expertise 
in these areas was an important factor in securing our 
Gloucestershire and Cambridgeshire contract awards.
Our transport design business, which delivers all aspects  
of design of highway infrastructure and transport technology, 
performed well. The results in the year benefited from the 
Hackney M11 Link Road and Transport Direct Portal projects 
together with Dubai Metro where a substantial and technically 
complex contribution was made to the design of the viaducts 
by our UK teams. Delivery of this project required the input of 
over 50 staff in Highways and Transportation and represents 
an excellent example of collaborative working across 
segments and geographical regions.
During the year we were awarded a new contract by 
the Highways Agency to provide design and maintenance

systems in the north-west of England in partnership with 
Telent. This £30m five-year contract commenced in December 
2006. We were granted a two-year extension on a similar 
contract in the West Midlands.
Our transport planning business performed well with 
improved margins. A highlight of the year was the completion 
of a research and evaluation study for the Department for 
Transport on the Local Transport Plan that considers options 
for future local transport planning policy beyond 2011. 
There were also significant new contract awards from the 
Department for Transport, Slough Borough Council and 
Transport for London.
Safety is a vitally important operational aspect of our 
Highways and Transportation segment. We have improved our 
investigations into root causes of incidents and accidents and 
have commenced a regime of audits that focus on behaviours 
and attitudes towards safety. For the second year running  
we have achieved a gold award from the Royal Society for  
the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) for our safety 
management systems.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the Highways and Transportation segment 
remains strong with good medium term prospects from 
local authorities and the Highways Agency. Our order book 
increased to 77% of work for 2007/08 (2006: 75%), as full 
year revenue from Cambridgeshire County Council more than 
compensates for the loss of the Highways Agency Area 10 
contract that concludes in the second half of 2007/08.
During the next 12 months we will be working on a number 
of important bids and rebids including for Northamptonshire 
County Council and several Highways Agency contracts.
There are good opportunities to increase the volume  
of high-level advisory work we undertake, especially in  
the south-east of England through the period leading up  
to the London Olympics in 2012. We will also continue to  
be active in the area of advanced driver information and 
traffic control systems, which has shown strong growth  
over the past five years.

Revenue increased in the Rail segment by £60.9m (35%) 
although performance was mixed. While we continued to see 
the benefit of the recovery of the UK rail market, the impact 
has yet to be fully reflected in increased operating profit.  
Our results were also affected by a loss of approximately £3m 
associated with cost over-runs on two EU-funded rail study 
projects for the Polish Rail Authority, which are now largely 
resolved. Operating margins also continued to be adversely 
impacted by our work on the Metronet supply chain.
A substantial share of our revenue is derived from 
re-signalling contracts which increased signiﬁcantly to 
approximately £100m. We have successfully completed the 
ﬁrst phase of the major re-signalling contract at Basingstoke, 
which is due for ﬁnal completion in September 2008, and our 
other major re-signalling project, at Port Talbot, is substantially 
complete. We were also selected, on a negotiated basis, to 
design, commission and test the signalling for the Rugby/
Nuneaton section of the West Coast Mainline upgrade. This 
contract will provide signiﬁcant revenue over the next two years.
During the year we won a contract to provide design and 
technical consultancy for the Glasgow Airport Rail Link project, 
for the new railway line running from Glasgow Central Station 
to the international airport. Work was also secured on three 
out of the five Network Rail regional three-year framework 
contracts for switch and crossing renewals, an increase from 
the two previously held. We have commenced the design of  
the track layout for the South African Gautrain rail project 
covering 80km of new track from the international airport  
to Johannesburg. 
The demand from the UK rail industry for innovative 
solutions to meet the need for a capacity enhanced, reliable, 
‘open all hours’ railway is growing, and we are well placed  
with over 1,800 rail specialists with a broad range of capability 
to provide such solutions.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for our Rail segment is good. Our work in hand 
at 66% compares to 75% last year. However, if our work 
for Metronet is excluded, underlying work in hand is 65% 
compared to 56% last year.
Passenger demand forecasts predict significant growth in UK 
rail usage over the coming ten years and in anticipation of this 
Network Rail has planned a substantial programme of renewals 
and enhancements. Increased regionalisation of rail spending 
to Scotland, Wales, Transport for London and through 
other local passenger transport executives will also provide 
significant opportunities and we are well placed to benefit.

The Middle East and China segment had another year of 
signiﬁcant growth and improving performance. This growth has 
been driven by the continuing strong demand in the Middle 
East region, which now accounts for approximately three-
quarters of the segment’s revenues. The Dubai Metro contract, 
along with other major commissions, contributed to the 61% 
increase in revenue in the year to £108.2m. Whilst the China 
business is proﬁtable, the majority of the segment’s proﬁt 
is derived from the Middle East. During the year our range 
of services in the Middle East continued to expand and now 
includes rail engineering, masterplanning and urban building 
design. We also provide project management services in the 
Middle East under the Faithful+Gould brand.
The Middle East business now employs over 1,700 people, 
an increase of 70% in the year. The increasing demand for 
high-quality residential, leisure, healthcare and education 
developments mirrors the maturing local economies. Our strong 
reputation for delivery helped us achieve continued growth.
During the year we secured the civil design services contract 
for the Red Line of the Dubai Metro light rail scheme. This 
complex multidisciplinary project required the mobilisation of  
up to 400 staff across the Group, and within three months of  
our appointment by the Japan Turkey Metro Joint Venture, we 
delivered the necessary designs to enable the client to commence 
construction. A substantial proportion of our design work on  
the Red Line is now complete and we are also now engaged  
on the design of a second line, the Green Line. Together these 
two contracts require 70km of railway line and viaducts and  
44 stations.
Involvement in sustainable building design research 
partnerships with Cardiff University and the British University  
in Dubai has enabled the Group to move closer to clients’ design 
solutions based on the very latest research linked to sustainability.
We continued to make progress in China and our business 
delivered a small operating proﬁt, reﬂecting our investment 
for future positioning in this market. We continue to be highly 
selective as the trading conditions become more open. We won 
a design competition for a major new high-density residential 
community in one of China’s developing cities and we have won 
a number of projects for the concept design of airport terminals. 
OUTLOOK
The outlook for this segment remains very good, especially  
in the Middle East. Our work in hand at year end was 64% 
(2006: 78%) but increased in absolute terms reﬂecting 
improved revenue expectations for the year ahead.
Prospects in the Middle East are encouraging and numerous 
clients are actively seeking and creating development 
opportunities in response to demand for urban planning  
and infrastructure design.
Capital investment in China continues to accelerate, driven 
strongly by the urbanisation process that has so far affected 
one-third of the population. The market offers great potential 
and our approach is to concentrate on infrastructure projects  
in China’s secondary and tertiary cities, which are likely to 
attract increasing investment.

The performance of the Management and Project Services 
segment this year was disappointing. The Faithful+Gould 
business, which represents approximately 70% of the 
segment, had a good year but the Management Consultants 
business performed behind our expectations. Operating 
profit and operating margin were primarily impacted by the 
re-organisation of the Management Consultants business and 
the integration costs associated with the acquisition of Mantix 
in June 2006.
Faithful+Gould, which provides project management and 
cost consultancy across a broad range of markets, maintained 
its strong performance overall. Approximately two-thirds of its 
work is in the private sector and includes work in the UK banking 
sector for clients such as Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. 
Performance in the US continues to improve and there  
are signiﬁcant opportunities in this market. The commercial 
sector is strong and capital spending by the oil majors continues, 
and we have won contracts with BP and ExxonMobil.
Mantix employs 60 staff in project and programme 
management and provides management consultancy services 
to UK central government. The skills acquired from Mantix 
broadened our capacity to assist clients to manage their 
major investments in technology and business change. Our 
revenue from supporting the Government Communications 
Headquarters (GCHQ) facility grew during the year as we 
commenced work on a new five-year framework contract to 
deliver project and programme management support services. 
OUTLOOK
Work in hand for the whole segment at 31 March 2007 
represented 42% of budgeted revenue for 2007/08, 
compared to 39% last year.
The outlook for Faithful+Gould is good with a strong UK 
market and further growth in the US business anticipated.
Whilst demand for our management consultancy services 
is likely to increase due to the UK Government’s drive 
for organisational change and continuing private sector 
requirements, we are experiencing an increasingly  
competitive marketplace.

The results of this segment were broadly in line with our 
expectations as last year’s results included a non-recurring 
benefit of approximately £2m arising from temporary 
extensions to certain MoD contracts.
During the year we continued to work with private sector 
clients such as Barclays Bank, with whom we have extended 
our relationship for a further three years. Our results also 
included the benefit of last year’s wins with the Metropolitan 
Police and HBOS.
Our activity with the MoD is now procured via the Defence 
Housing Prime Contract in which we have a 25% interest 
through the Modern Housing Solutions Joint Venture. Our 
work on Colchester Garrison continues to meet expectations 
although our historical hospital and schools contracts,  
where contracting risk was taken, remain challenging.
OUTLOOK

LAMBERT SMITH HAMPTON
PERFORMANCE IN 2007
LSH, which operated independently under its own brand, had 
an exceptionally strong year with operating profit of £7.3m 
(2006: £3.6m). The results for the year benefited from some 
significant revenues arising from transactions completed in 
the year. Two small acquisitions, Poolman Harlow (Swansea)  
in April 2006 and Young & Butt (Fareham/Southampton)  
in November 2006, were completed.
The market for commercial property investment remained 
strong in the year, although rising UK interest rates and 
the increasing commercial prices are reducing yields on 
investment properties. 
During the year LSH was re-appointed to the BBC and 
both Hertfordshire and Essex County Councils to provide 
professional estate services for their property portfolio on 
contract periods from three years to six years. 
Nearly 60% of LSH’s revenue is generated from consultancy 
services, reflecting in part the growing level of outsourced  
work now being performed for UK national and public  
sector clients.
METRONET ENTERPRISE
The results of the Metronet Enterprise included within the 
Group’s profit before tax for the year are as follows:
METRONET
During the year Metronet’s operating performance was  
mixed and while some progress was made on its capital 
programme, the stations and certain other programmes 
remain behind schedule.
The Metronet PPP contracts contain provision for an 
Extraordinary Review to protect Metronet against significant 
additional costs or revenue shortfalls arising between the 
periodic reviews that occur every seven and a half years.

reimbursement by London Underground provided that they 
have been incurred in an “economic and efficient” manner, 
although Metronet is required to bear the first £50m in each 
infraco. As previously stated, the costs of Metronet’s capital 
programme are substantially higher than anticipated and as 
a result on 21 June 2007 Metronet gave notice to London 
Underground of its intention to invite the Arbiter to conduct 
an Extraordinary Review on Metronet BCV in July and on 
Metronet SSL later in the year. The review process is likely to 
take at least six to nine months to conduct and it is too early 
to assess its outcome.
The Arbiter reported in November 2006 that Metronet was 
not wholly “economic and efficient” in the first three years 
of operation, from April 2003 until March 2006, although 
he also noted that Metronet was making improvements to 
its operations. There is therefore a risk that some of the 
additional costs in excess of the first £50m per infraco will  
be borne by Metronet.
As a result of the additional cost being incurred, Metronet 
accelerated the payment of committed equity contributions 
from its shareholders. Atkins injected a total of £18.0m in 
the year, bringing our total cash investment in Metronet 
to £50.7m at 31 March 2007. The Group’s remaining 
equity commitment of £19.3m has also been accelerated. 
As at today’s date £15.6m of this commitment has been 
contributed, with the remainder likely to be contributed in 
the first half of the current year, taking our total investment 
to £70m.
Metronet is currently unable to access its lending facilities. 
Metronet, its banks and shareholders are in discussion  
about how to ensure that Metronet is able to continue  
until the completion of the Extraordinary Review. Metronet’s 
financial structure demands that a resolution of this issue  
is achieved if it is to continue to be able to deliver its  
PPP programmes.
Given the current uncertainties associated with Metronet’s 
funding position and the outcome of the Extraordinary Review 
process, the results for the Group for the year include an 
exceptional loss of £91.3m (after JV tax). This reflects the 
total equity investment of £70m plus the reversal of £21.3m 
of profit recognised in earlier years. This exceptional loss has 
no cash impact but reduces the carrying value of the Group’s 
investment in Metronet to £nil.
TRANS4M
Trans4m is primarily responsible for the delivery of 
improvements to stations. The stations programme remains 
behind plan and the costs have risen significantly. Trans4m 
has recently started awarding station contracts to outside 
contractors rather than using companies within its tied supply 
chain. In the short term, this increases capacity and also 
provides an external benchmark against which it may more 
easily assess whether the delivery of the station improvements 
has been carried out in an “economic and efficient” manner. 
To further address the stations programme, Metronet and its 
shareholders have recently reached agreement on heads of 
terms for the future early termination of Trans4m’s contract. 
This agreement is subject to approval by Metronet’s banks.
The cost of delivering stations is significantly higher than 
originally anticipated and Trans4m bears a contractual share 
of the over-run together with penalties for late delivery of 
stations into service. Although Trans4m’s liabilities for the cost 
over-runs are capped, the Group’s results include a loss for 
the year of £1.0m and an exceptional loss from Trans4m of 
£26.0m to take account of the expected outturn for Trans4m’s 
remaining contract.
The cash impact of this is expected to be around £30m,  
the majority of which will be paid by Atkins to Trans4m during 
the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
ATKINS’ SUPPLY CHAIN
The work that Atkins carries out for Trans4m is primarily 
related to station design. Given the changes to Trans4m’s 
supply chain noted above, some of the work that Atkins  
was originally in line to undertake may now be carried  
out by other companies. As a result an exceptional loss  
of £4.0m is included in the results for the year to take  
account of expected future losses.
Our supply chain performance is expected to result in  
a cash outflow of around £35m during the year ending  
31 March 2008, primarily in settlement of previously 
accounted-for liabilities.
OUTLOOK
In the short term, the outlook for Metronet is dependent upon 
reaching agreement with its banks upon its future funding.  
Atkins is committed to working with Metronet, its banks  
and all its other stakeholders to enable Metronet to reach  
a successful conclusion to the Extraordinary Review process.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE TWENTY-NINE NET FINANCE INCOME
Finance income for the year was £2.0m higher than the prior 
year at £9.9m and ﬁnance cost £4.5m lower at £6.7m, resulting 
in net income of £3.2m (2006: net ﬁnance cost £3.3m). 
The increase in finance income is largely a consequence of 
the Group’s improving cash position. The reduction in finance 
cost in the year was principally due to a decrease of £4.3m  
in the net finance cost on retirement benefit liabilities. 
TAXATION
The Group’s income tax expense for the year reduced by 
£0.2m to £17.7m.
The Group’s effective income tax rate after adjusting for the 
impact of exceptional items reduced to 22.6% (2006: 29.6%). 
This reduction comes from HMRC’s agreement of our claim for 
three years’ research and development tax credits (£4.1m) and 
the increasing proportion of profits from lower tax regimes, 
principally the Middle East. 
We anticipate an annual continuing benefit from research 
and development tax credits, and the increase in profits 
earned by operations in countries with tax rates lower than 
the UK will continue to have a favourable impact on our 
effective tax rate. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
Normalised basic EPS before exceptional items was 62.2p  
(2006: 51.1p), reducing to a loss per share of 56.8p after 
exceptional items. Normalised diluted EPS before exceptional 
items, which is considered to be a more representative 
measure of underlying trading, was 61.5p (2006: 50.1p),  
an increase of 23%. Further details are given in note 11  
to the financial statements.
PENSIONS
Funding
The latest actuarial valuation of the defined benefit Atkins 
Pension Plan (the “Plan”) was carried out as at 1 April 2004 
and indicated that the Plan had an actuarial deficit of £69.0m. 
A funding programme was agreed with the Trustees at that 
time but since then, recognising the likely increase in the 
deficit, the Group has accelerated contributions to the Plan.  
In the year the Group paid a further accelerated contribution 
of £25.0m (2006: £20.0m) to the Plan, making total 
accelerated contributions over the last three years of 
£53.6m. As at 30 June 2006 our actuaries estimated that the 
deficit had increased to approximately £187m despite the 
accelerated cash contributions due to changes in discount 
rates, longevity and other assumptions. Our next actuarial 
valuation, as at 1 April 2007, is currently underway and the 
results are expected to be available in autumn 2007.
The Group is currently in consultation with approximately 
1,900 employees regarding a proposal to close the Plan to 
future accrual in conjunction with further additional cash 
contributions of £140.0m over the next four years: £50.0m 
in the next 12 months, followed by £30.0m in each of 
the subsequent three years. These proposals do not affect 
members of the Plan whose benefits are protected through 
either a contractual obligation or statutory protection. 
Charges
The Group accounts for pension costs under IAS 19, Employee 
benefits. The total charge to the Income Statement in respect 
of defined benefit schemes amounted to £24.9m (2006: 
£24.8m), comprising total service cost of £22.5m (2006: 
£18.1m) and net finance cost of £2.4m (2006: £6.7m). The 
charge relating to defined contribution schemes amounted 
to £16.0m (2006: £12.3m) and is expected to continue to 
increase as the membership of these schemes grows.
IAS 19 valuation and accounting treatment
The Group assesses pension scheme funding with reference 
to actuarial valuations but for reporting purposes uses IAS 19. 
Under IAS 19, the Group recognised a post-tax retirement 
benefit liability of £175m at 31 March 2007 (2006: £210m). 
The post-tax actuarial gain recognised through equity 
amounted to £21.7m for the year ended 31 March 2007 
(2006: actuarial loss of £26.4m).
The assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation are detailed 
in note 27 to the financial statements.

Financial performance Buy-out basis
The deficit on the Atkins Pension Plan measured on a solvency 
buy-out basis is estimated to be £520m, pre-tax.
CASH
Net funds at 31 March 2007 were £199.1m (2006: £176.6m), 
which comprised cash balances and current financial assets of 
£237.3m (2006: £218.2m) less bank loans and finance lease 
payables of £38.2m (2006: £41.6m).
Cash generated from operations was £106.1m (2006: 
£111.7m). This is partly driven by a decrease in working 
capital despite significant revenue growth over the same 
period. Much of the reduction in working capital is driven 
by advance cash receipts on large contracts, principally in 
the Middle East, and timing differences on our work on the 
Metronet supply chain. We anticipate an increase in working 
capital in the coming year driven by a cash outflow of up to 
£65m in relation to the Metronet supply chain, as discussed  
in the Metronet Enterprise section above.
There was a net tax refund of £2.9m (2006 tax paid: 
£10.9m). This follows our successful claim for research and 
development tax credits and timing issues associated with 
Metronet consortium tax relief.
As described in the Metronet Enterprise section above, 
the Group made injections amounting to £18.0m into the 
Metronet PPP companies during the year (2006: £11.2m). The 
Group is committed to making further loan capital payments 
to the Metronet PPP companies amounting to £19.3m.
Net capital expenditure in the year, including the purchase 
of computer software licences, amounted to £25.1m (2006: 
£28.2m). We expect a similar level in the year ahead.
Cash payments relating to acquisitions in the year 
amounted to £31.5m (2006: £4.9m). Further details are  
given below.
ACQUISITIONS
Three acquisitions, adding to the capability and reach of our 
core business, were completed during the year. In addition 
Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH) acquired Poolman Harlow Ltd 
in April 2006 and Young and Butt Ltd in November 2006.
Further details of all these transactions are given in note 39  
to the financial statements. 
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 25 June 2007 contracts were exchanged for the disposal  
of LSH for an estimated consideration of £46.5m together with 
earn-out potential for a further £10m depending upon on LSH’s 
performance in the year ending 31 March 2008. The profit 
on disposal is estimated to be approximately £20m assuming 
that no additional payments are made by LSH in relation to the 
performance in the year ending 31 March 2008. 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
The Group had 104.5m fully paid ordinary shares in issue  
at 31 March 2007 (2006: 104.5m), full details of which  
are shown in note 29 to the financial statements. As at  
31 March 2007, the Group had a shareholders’ deficit  
of £76.1m (2006: deficit of £36.1m). 
TREASURY POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES
The Group’s treasury function manages and monitors external 
funding and investment requirements and financial risks in 
support of the Group’s corporate objectives. The Board reviews 
and agrees policies and authority levels for treasury activities.
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, 
comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various 
items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that 
arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally 
forward foreign currency contracts. The main risks arising 
from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate 
risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk, along with the 
risks arising from the financing of the Group’s activities in 
the Public Private Partnership and Private Finance Initiative 
sectors. The Group’s policies for managing each of these 
risks are summarised below. These policies have remained 
unchanged during the year. The Group does not trade in 
financial instruments.

BOREAS CONSULTANTS LTD OIL & GAS DECEMBER 06 £2.9M £3.9M
ADVANTAGE BUSINESS GROUP LTD DEFENCE MARCH 07 £15.3M £19.5M Interest rate risk and liquidity risk
The Group funds its ongoing activities through cash  
generated from its operations and, where necessary, bank 
borrowings and finance leases. The Group has banking 
facilities which include cash facilities and bonding lines,  
as well as a letter of credit facility in relation to the ongoing 
equity obligations of the Group’s PPP/PFI projects. The Group 
accepts some interest rate risk and any loans drawn under  
the banking facilities are at floating rates. At 31 March 2007, 
the amount undrawn under the Group’s credit lines was 
£31.0m (2006: £36.7m).
Foreign currency risk
The Group, through its ownership of companies based  
outside the UK, has foreign currency-denominated assets.  
To mitigate the effect of currency exposures arising from  
net investments overseas, it is the Group’s policy to 
hedge those exposures, where material, using borrowings 
denominated in foreign currency. At 31 March 2007 the 
Group had £17.3m (2006: £23.3m) of loans denominated  
in foreign currency.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures. These 
exposures arise from sales or purchases in currencies other 
than its subsidiaries’ functional currencies. It is the Group’s 
policy to hedge such risks, where material, using forward 
currency contracts. At 31 March 2007 the Group had 
outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts amounting  
to the equivalent of £12.3m (2006: £6.8m).
The Group accounts for financial instruments in accordance 
with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement. Where a derivative is a designated hedging 
instrument and is assessed as effective under IAS 39, any  
gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to equity. In all other 
cases the gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Private Finance 
Initiative (PFI)
The Group’s PPP and PFI projects involve the arrangement 
of finance as part of the overall project service. Individual 
projects are undertaken by Special Purpose Companies (SPCs) 
in Joint Ventures with other parties. These SPCs contract 
with end users for the provision of serviced facilities and also 
arrange funding, construction, facilities management services 
and, where required, operational support for projects. Except 
for equity commitments, the funding of the SPCs is arranged 
without recourse to the rest of the Group.
The Group’s share of the gross assets and liabilities of 
the SPCs is reflected separately in the Group accounts in 
accordance with the provisions of IAS 31, Interests in  
joint ventures.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group’s principal accounting policies are described in note 
1 to the financial statements. The financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2007 have been prepared under IFRS; 
however for years prior to 2005 the amounts included within 
the five year record on page 101 are under UK GAAP but are 
presented alongside current figures in IFRS format.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event 
or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates. Material estimates applied across the Group’s 
businesses and Joint Ventures are reviewed to a common 
standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that 
consistent treatment of similar and related issues that require 
judgement is achieved upon consolidation. Any revisions  
to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The accounting policies and areas that require the most 
significant estimates and judgements to be used in the 
preparation of the financial statements are in relation to 
contract accounting and defined benefit pension schemes.
Contract accounting
Profit is recognised on contracts on a percentage completion 
basis, provided the outcome of the project can be reasonably 
foreseen. Full provision is made for estimated losses. Where 
contracts span more than two accounting periods profit is  
not generally recognised until the project is 50% complete.
The projected outcome of any given contract is necessarily 
based on estimates of revenues and costs to completion. 
Whilst the assumptions made are based on professional 
judgements, subsequent events may mean that estimates 
calculated prove inaccurate, with a consequent effect on  
the reporting of results. 
Defined benefit pension schemes
Accounting for pensions involves judgement about uncertain 
events in the future such as inflation, salary levels at 
retirement, longevity rates, rates of return on plan assets 
and discount rates. Assumptions in respect of pensions 
and post-retirement benefits are set after consultation with 
independent qualified actuaries. Management believes the 
assumptions are appropriate. However, a change in the 
assumptions used would impact the Group’s results and  
net assets. Any differences between the assumptions and  
the actual outcome will affect results in future years.

Financial performance
Continued PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
In order to achieve our business objectives the Group must 
respond effectively to the associated risks. The Group has 
established risk management procedures, involving the 
identification and monitoring of strategic and operational 
risks at various levels of management. The Board regularly 
reviews material risks identified and risk management is 
embedded in our annual budgeting and strategic planning 
processes. It is, however, not possible to fully mitigate all  
risks that the Group enters into. The principal key risks for  
the Group have been assessed as follows:
Recruitment and retention of sufficient high calibre staff
The Group’s people are its key resource and the recruitment 
and retention of top quality staff are crucial to our future 
success. Failure to do so would constrain the growth of the 
business and prevent the Group from achieving its potential. 
The skills needed are in short supply especially within the UK 
and the Group has to compete with a large number of other 
organisations to secure the best staff. The Group expends a 
great deal of management effort and resource in this area, 
and a summary of our approach is shown in the Human 
resources review on page 10.
Changes in the competitive environment resulting from 
government policy
Many of the markets in which the Group operates are 
regulated and funded by government bodies. These markets 
may be altered by government policy (in the UK and abroad) 
in the form of increased or reduced regulation or a change in 
public sector procurement practices. There is a risk that any 
withdrawal of government funding will impact our operations. 
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by working in a diverse 
portfolio of sectors and markets and regularly monitoring 
government spending patterns.
Competition
In common with all companies, the Group faces competition 
from others in all of our markets. Some of the markets in 
which the Group works serve limited clients and barriers to 
entry are high. In other markets such as architectural design 
and environment there are numerous competitors and barriers 
to entry are lower. To ensure that the Group continues to win 
work, we work hard to develop long-term relationships with 
our clients at multiple levels. A measure of this success is our 
work in hand, which measures our secured workload over 
the next year. Our overall work in hand is 58%, representing 
seven months of 2007/08 revenue that is already  
contractually committed.
Health, safety and environment
The Group’s business is concerned with the built environment 
and this entails significant health, safety and environmental 
risks. Should the Group’s policy or practice in this area prove 
inadequate, there is a consequent risk to employees, clients, 
contractors and third parties. The Group takes health, safety 
and environment issues seriously and ensures that all staff are 
appropriately trained and that procedures are continuously 
reviewed and improved. We look to take a leadership role 
on health and safety matters in our sector and we have 
representation on a number of committees. Many of our 
clients insist on the Group attaining appropriate standards 
in health and safety and environment. We are regularly 
independently audited by external consultants against these 
industry standards. 
Changes to the contracting environment resulting from 
market developments
The ways in which business is conducted inevitably change 
over time. The nature of the contracting environment is 
especially important for companies like Atkins. The trend 
remains one where clients increasingly seek to transfer risk to 
consultants; contractors will also seek to share risks. There is a 
possibility that, in securing new work, the Group accepts risks 
that are insufficiently understood or evaluated, with ensuing 
financial loss. We actively mitigate this risk via a range of 
internal review procedures that enable contract terms to  
be subjected to appropriate scrutiny and manageable risks  
to be reduced.
Financial risks associated with the Metronet Enterprise
Atkins is a 20% shareholder in the Metronet PPP companies 
and has committed to invest equity and loan capital of £70m. 
Although the Group’s liability to Metronet is contractually 
limited to the committed equity and loan capital, there is a 
reputational risk should Atkins fail to give additional support 
to Metronet if required.
Reputation risk
Our reputation for delivering complex projects relies on the 
perception of our clients and how this is portrayed in the 
public arena. There is a risk that a major failure from poor 
design, poor project management or delivery could impact our 
ability to win future work. We mitigate this risk by ensuring 
we have robust cost and project management systems 
linked to our internal quality processes. These are regularly 
independently audited by external consultants against 
industry standards.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE THIRTY-THREE Atkins is committed to being a good neighbour and 
acting responsibly to all our stakeholders. Every year the 
Group publishes a Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report 
simultaneously with the Annual Report. The CR report 
provides details of our CR strategy and performance.  
A summary of the key issues and developments during  
the year are presented here.
CR MANAGEMENT
The Board sets Group policies on CR. Our chief executive  
is the Board member responsible for CR and for the Group’s 
performance, supported by Group-wide frameworks.  
A common management structure governs quality, health  
and safety and environment (QSE). A director of QSE, 
reporting to the chief executive, is responsible for Group  
QSE at a corporate level. Each Atkins business also has 
dedicated QSE representatives to manage issues at a local 
level, reporting quarterly.
For the first time this year a joint QSE plan has been 
produced by the businesses with guidance from Group QSE; 
and our QSE policies and minimum requirements have been 
defined and communicated in a single, integrated policy 
manual, which sets the framework for QSE management  
and supports strategy across the Group.
CR-related Group policies include quality, health and safety, 
the environment, business conduct, data protection, dignity 
and equality at work, employee disclosure (whistle-blowing) 
and the appropriate use of information technology. These 
are published on the corporate intranet and are provided 
externally on request. They are regularly reviewed and 
updated to reflect changes to legislation, emerging good 
practice and business needs.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We have a duty to provide safety leadership across our 
range of global services, in addition to complying with 
local legislation, safety standards or other specific client 
requirements. 
We work to ensure that the principle 
of safety leadership is firmly embedded 
in our business
We work to ensure that the principle of safety leadership 
is firmly embedded in our business, promoting continual 
improvement in operational health and safety risk reduction 
as well as safety in design. Our Group QSE policy manual 
describes how our safety values and principles are to be 
applied across all Atkins’ businesses. This year we achieved:
  Additional OHSAS 18001 certifications with China receiving 
its full certification; with only Portugal and Faithful+Gould  
in the US yet to receive certification
  Release of the Group QSE policy manual
   Development and implementation of a Construction Skills 
Certification Scheme (CSCS) card test in the UK for 
Professionally Qualified Persons (PQP) 
  Development and implementation of a Middle East and India 
PQP card test
  Improvements to our accident/near miss reporting system 
  Development and pilot of an expanded Director Safety Tour 
course within our e-learning portfolio.
An important indicator of the Group’s performance on 
safety is the Accident Incident Rate (AIR), which measures 
the annual number of reportable accidents per 100,000 
employees. AIR statistics are measured both for employees 
and contractors and are divided into office, engineering and 
construction activities in order to prioritise improvement 
programmes for those most at risk. AIR performance in 
2006/07 compared to the previous year and benchmarks  
is shown in the table below:
AIR OFFICE ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION
BENCHMARK 162 417 1,890

04/05  0 124 317
(AIR = no. of accidents per 100,000 staff or contractors)
During the year the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the UK 
made 16 site visits and issued no improvement or prohibition 
notices. We have not been prosecuted for any health and safety 
breaches during the year, other than in connection with 
ongoing proceedings against two employees in Doha, Qatar  
on charges which we believe have been wrongly brought and 
of which we expect them ultimately to be found innocent.
ENVIRONMENT
The Group promotes sustainability and the reduction 
of environmental impact in our designs and we explore 
opportunities for improvement in all our operations and 
services. Our most significant environmental impacts are  
those that we control and influence through our range of  
multinational design and engineering projects. In addition 
to our overall commitment to continually improve our 
performance and comply with relevant legislation, we aim to:
  Ensure environmental impact is assessed throughout our 
projects to prevent pollution, minimise impact and consider 
opportunities for improvement
  Incorporate sustainability measures into our operations and 
services focusing on the specification and use of materials, 
energy use, travel impact, waste and recycling.

impact of its operations through measurement of certain 
performance indicators. The most significant of these are our 
CO

 emissions arising from office accommodation, business 
travel and non-hazardous waste. The data in the table below 
is derived only from our UK operations.
Our UK activities received no improvement or prohibition 
notices from the Environment Agency or any local authority 
during their visits to our offices and sites. We have not been 
involved in any prosecutions for breach of environmental 
legislation globally.
CUSTOMERS
Understanding our clients’ needs and delivering the highest 
standards of technical expertise, competence and excellence 
are essential to our success. We take a partnership approach 
to achieving shared aims and forging strong and long-lasting 
relationships. Feedback, review and continual improvement 
are central to the process.
All our certified UK and overseas businesses have continued 
to demonstrate their compliance with the requirements of  
ISO 9001. 95% of our businesses are now certified including 
all of our operations in Europe, the Middle East and China.  
It is only our Faithful+Gould offices in the US that still  
need to gain approval.
Over the year Atkins as a whole, our businesses and 
disciplines, project teams and individuals have won  
numerous awards from customers and independent 
commentators, endorsing the quality of our work and  
our level of customer service. 
COMMUNITY
During the year the Group made charitable donations of 
£205,813 (2006: £97,534). The principal beneficiaries of such 
donations were the charities RedR, WaterAid and the PSP 
Association. A number of groups and individuals throughout 
the Group also organised and took part in sponsored events 
for charitable causes.

WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE THIRTY-EIGHT 
Directors’ report
The directors present their annual report on the affairs of 
the Company and the Group, together with the financial 
statements and the independent auditors’ report, for the year 
ended 31 March 2007. These will be laid before shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held at 4.30pm 
on Wednesday 5 September 2007.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
The Chairman’s statement (page 7), Our strategy (pages  
8 to 9), the Human resources review (pages 10 to 11), the 
Operating and financial review (pages 16 to 33) and Corporate 
responsibility (pages 34 to 35) report on our principal activities 
and performance during the past year and our prospects  
for the future. The statement, reviews and report are 
incorporated into this report by reference, together with the 
list of the principal subsidiary undertakings and the countries 
in which they operate (note 40 to the financial statements).
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The Group loss after tax for the year of £57.3m (2006: profit 
£56.9m) is shown in the Consolidated Income Statement  
on page 51.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 14.0p  
(2006: 11.5p) per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 
31 March 2007, to be paid on 28 September 2007 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register on 17 August 2007 if approved, 
which, together with the interim dividend of 6.0p paid on  
26 January 2007, makes a total dividend of 20.0p for the  
year (2006: 16.0p).
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
Acquisitions and disposals made by the Group are described 
in notes 5, 16 and 39 to the financial statements on pages 68, 
78 and 99.
DIRECTORS
The composition of the Board and full biographical details  
of the Company’s directors at the date of this report are  
given on pages 36 to 37. 
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all 
directors appointed during the year retire at the AGM  
and may offer themselves for re-appointment. In addition,  
one-third of directors must retire at each AGM and may  
be re-elected. 
Christopher Kemball retired from the Board on 31 
December 2006.
Fiona Clutterbuck and Alun Griffiths, who were appointed 
by the Board as directors on 13 March 2007, will retire at the 
AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-appointment.
Robert MacLeod and Sir Peter Williams will retire by 
rotation at the AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. 
The Board considers that the performance of those 
directors proposed for re-appointment and re-election 
continues to be effective and that they demonstrate a strong 
commitment to their role.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS AND INDEMNITIES
Directors’ interests in the Company and the Group are 
described in the Remuneration report in Table 5 on page 48.
Directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries 
have the benefit of a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
policy, which provides appropriate cover in respect of legal 
actions brought against its directors. The Company’s practice 
has always been to indemnify its directors in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association and to the maximum 
extent permitted by law. Disclosure of such indemnities is 
required by the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”). All directors 
have deeds of indemnity that are in force as at the date of  
this report. These indemnities are available for inspection  
by shareholders at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours and will be available for inspection  
at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities provide cover 
where the director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION
A report on Corporate governance is on pages 41 to 44 and 
the Board’s report on directors’ remuneration is on pages  
45 to 49.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
A summary of the Group’s corporate responsibility activities  
is contained on pages 34 to 35. In addition, the Group 
produces a separate annual report on corporate responsibility, 
which includes detailed information in respect of health and 
safety, the environment, the community, people and suppliers. 
A copy of that report is sent to all shareholders and is also 
available on the Company’s website www.atkinsglobal.com. 
EMPLOYEES
The Group communicates financial results and significant 
business issues to all employees via the use of email, the 
Company’s intranet and in-house publications. Feedback 
from employees is obtained annually via a confidential survey. 
Where appropriate, consultation with employee and union 
representatives takes place.
Employee share ownership has been encouraged over a 
long period. UK employees have the opportunity to become 
shareholders via the Company’s Share Incentive Plan.
The Group is committed to the fair and equitable 
treatment of all its employees irrespective of gender, race, 
age, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Policies have 
been implemented across the Group to ensure that this  DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE THIRTY-NINE
commitment is acted on in practice. The Group’s policy and 
practice is to encourage the recruitment and subsequent 
training, career development and promotion of disabled 
people on the basis of their aptitude and abilities, and the 
retention and re-training of employees who become disabled.
BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICY
The Board is responsible for the Group’s business conduct 
policy. The Group believes that integrity is a fundamental 
prerequisite for successful business relationships, both 
internally and externally. Reputation, trust and confidence 
are essential elements which we seek to protect and enhance 
to the benefit of all with whom we have a relationship. The 
Group seeks to understand and meet its customers’ needs, 
whilst seeking continuous improvement. Across the Group 
there are procedures in place which seek to underpin this 
approach. By so doing the Group aims to meet the needs  
of all stakeholders.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
It is Group policy to agree terms and conditions for its 
business transactions with suppliers and endeavour to make 
payment to these terms, subject to the terms and conditions 
being met by suppliers. WS Atkins plc, as a holding company, 
did not have any amounts owing to trade creditors as at  
31 March 2007.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
During the year the Group made charitable donations of 
£205,813 (2006: £97,534). The principal beneficiaries of 
such donations were the charities RedR, WaterAid and the 
PSP Association. For 2007, the Group has chosen to focus its 
efforts on local charities serving the communities in which the 
Group operates or charities relevant to the Group’s activities. 
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations, either 
in the UK or overseas. 
The Group has no intention of making any political 
donations or incurring such expenditure in the future. 
However, the Act defines “EU political organisation” widely. 
There is some uncertainty over which organisations are 
covered by the definition and what types of expenditure will 
be classified as a “donation”. The Board will therefore seek 
authority at the forthcoming AGM for the Company and its 
main trading subsidiary Atkins Limited to make such political 
expenditure up to £100,000 in order to prevent inadvertent 
breach of the Act.
SHARE CAPITAL
Full details of the Company’s authorised and issued share 
capital, including changes during the year, can be found  
in note 29 to the financial statements.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
The Company is authorised to purchase its own shares in the 
market pursuant to an authorisation given by shareholders at 
its AGM held in 2006. Although no such purchases have been 
made, the Company will seek to renew this authority from 
shareholders at its forthcoming AGM. Any shares purchased 
pursuant to that authority may be held as treasury shares in 
accordance with the Act.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
Until 19 January 2007 the Company maintained a register of 
substantial shareholdings in accordance with the provisions of 
section 211 of the Act. As at 19 January 2007, the Company 
had been notified of the following interests in the ordinary 
share capital of the Company:
   NUMBER OF PERCENTAGE OF
  ORDINARY ISSUED 
NAME OF HOLDER  SHARES CAPITAL
SCHRODERS PLC  12,592,518 12.06%
STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS  4,249,130 4.07%
RESOLUTION ASSET MANAGEMENT  4,206,885 4.03%
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC  3,830,384 3.37%
On 20 January 2007 the provisions of the Act in respect  
of substantial shareholdings were repealed and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
came into force. As at 26 June 2007, the Company had 
been notified of the following holdings exceeding the 3% 
notification threshold in the total voting rights attaching  
to the issued ordinary share capital of the Company:
   NUMBER OF PERCENTAGE OF
  VOTING TOTAL VOTING 
NAME OF HOLDER  RIGHTS RIGHTS
STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS  4,962,936 4.75%
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC  3,646,794 3.49%
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
the remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The directors have  DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

Directors’ report 
Continued
prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view  
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and  
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent
  State that the financial statements comply with IFRS  
as adopted by the European Union 
  State whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, and disclose and explain any material departures 
from those standards
  Prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business, in which case there should be 
supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and that 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
remuneration report comply with the Act and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
system of internal control is in operation to provide them 
with reasonable assurance that the assets of the Company 
and the Group are properly safeguarded and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the website and legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
The directors confirm that, as at the date this report was 
approved, so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information.
GOING CONCERN
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the accounts.
AUDITORS
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 
have expressed their willingness to continue in office and 
resolutions for their re-appointment and to authorise the 
directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by
Philip Davis, company secretary
26 June 2007
Cautionary statement 
Under the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), a company’s directors’ report 
is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review by the directors of 
the Group’s business through a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the 
development and performance of the business of the Group and the position  
of the Group at the year-end, consistent with the size and complexity of  
the business.
The Directors’ report set out above, including the Chairman’s statement, Our 
strategy, the Human resources review, the Operating and ﬁnancial review 
and Corporate responsibility incorporated into it by reference (together, 
the “Directors’ report”), has been prepared only for the shareholders of the 
Company, as a whole, and its sole purpose and use is to assist shareholders to 
exercise their governance rights. In particular, the Directors’ report has not been 
audited or otherwise independently veriﬁed. The Company and its directors 
and employees are not responsible for any other purpose or use or to any other 
person in relation to the Directors’ report.
The Directors’ report contains indications of likely future developments and  
other forward-looking statements that are subject to risk factors associated  
with, among other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring 
from time to time in the countries, sectors and business segments in which the  
Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed 
under ‘Risks and uncertainties’ on page 33 in this document. These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy and prospects.  
Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  
They relate to events and/or depend on circumstances in the future which  
could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those  
currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to update any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Corporate governance report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE FORTY-ONE
This report sets out our commitment to corporate governance,  
how we have applied the principles contained in the new Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting 
Council in June 2003 (“the Code”) and the extent of our 
compliance with the Code.
A. DIRECTORS
A.1 The Board
The Board of directors is the body responsible for corporate 
governance, for establishing policies and objectives and for the 
stewardship of our resources. Whilst the Board has delegated the 
normal operational management of the Group to Keith Clarke as 
chief executive it has agreed a formal schedule of matters reserved 
specifically for its decision. This schedule includes strategy, the 
approval of financial statements and shareholder circulars, treasury 
policy, major capital investments, risk management strategy and 
acquisitions and disposals.
Currently the Board is made up of the chairman, three executive 
directors and four non-executive directors. James Morley is the 
senior independent director. The biographies of the directors as  
at the date of this report are given on pages 36 and 37.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings and holds further 
meetings when required. In addition, directors meet as members 
of relevant committees. The attendance of directors at meetings of 
the Board and of Board committees of which they were members 
during the year ended 31 March 2007 is shown in Table 1 (below).
The chairman and the non-executive directors also meet without 
the executive directors present at least annually.
The Board’s committees meet regularly to enable them to 
discharge their responsibilities. Each committee has terms of 
reference which are reviewed annually by the Board. Copies are 
available on request from the company secretary or on the Group’s 
website www.atkinsglobal.com. Following formal decision-making 
the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a standing 
committee consisting of any two directors to facilitate final  
sign-off for an agreed course of action within defined parameters.
The Group Executive is the chief executive’s executive team 
through which the operational management of the business is 
discharged. Its members currently comprise the group finance 
director, the managing directors of our principal business 
segments, the group HR director, the group communications 
director and the general counsel and company secretary. It meets 
regularly during the year. Those members of the Group Executive 
who are not directors of the Company are invited to attend four 
Board meetings each year and also meet periodically with the  
non-executive directors without the executive directors present.
The respective roles of the Board and Group Executive are 
discussed further under internal control on page 42.
A.2 Chairman and Chief Executive
It is the Group’s policy that the roles of chairman and chief 
executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities clearly 
divided and recorded. 
Ed Wallis, our chairman, normally spends two days per week 
on the business of the Group. His other significant commitments 
are disclosed in his biography on page 36. The Board considers 
that these commitments do not hinder his ability to discharge his 
responsibilities to the Company effectively.
Keith Clarke, our chief executive, is responsible for the executive 
management of the business. This includes responsibility for 
formulating and recommending the Group’s strategy for the 
creation of long-term shareholder value.
A.3 Board balance and independence
It is the opinion of the Board that the non-executive directors 
are independent of management and have no business or other 
relationship which could interfere materially with the exercise  
of their judgement.

A.4 Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating 
candidates for appointment to the Board. The committee makes 
appraisals of the processes in place for succession planning in 
respect of both Board and senior appointments. 
The committee currently comprises Ed Wallis, Lord Boyce,  
Keith Clarke, Fiona Clutterbuck, James Morley and Sir Peter 
Williams. The Committee is chaired by Ed Wallis. Christopher 
Kemball was a member of the committee until his retirement  
on 31 December 2006. Fiona Clutterbuck was appointed as  
a member of the committee on 25 June 2007.
During the year the committee recommended the appointment 
of two new directors. Fiona Clutterbuck as a non-executive 
director and Alun Griffiths as an executive director. Both were 
appointed on 13 March 2007. 
Fiona brings a proven track record in advising Boards on 
strategic issues which, coupled with her significant corporate 
finance experience, will be a considerable asset to the Group as 
we continue to drive development and grow the business. The 
committee used an external search consultancy to assist in making 
the recommendation for her appointment.
Alun’s appointment to the Board follows many years experience 
in Atkins, latterly as Group HR director. He has an exceptional 
understanding of our business and his counsel has already been 
valued by the Board on many occasions. 
All non-executive directors are advised of the time commitment 
considered necessary to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities 
prior to appointment.
A.5 Information and professional development
A rolling schedule of matters for Board consideration is maintained 
to ensure timely provision of information. During the year the 
Board’s discussions have included:
 The Group’s strategic plan
  The approval of the Group budget, including financial and  
non-financial targets
 Our health, safety and corporate responsibility performance
  The development of our business segments  
including acquisitions
 The Group’s financial results and dividend
 Our people
 The Group’s pension plan arrangements
 Metronet
 Our corporate governance arrangements.
We have a continuing professional development framework 
to assist the chairman, executive directors and non-executive 
directors in discharging their responsibilities effectively. Non-
executive directors meet regularly with members of the Group 
Executive and receive regular business updates via scheduled 
presentations. This, coupled with site visits and the attendance  
by key employees at Board dinners, ensures non-executive 
directors gain first hand experience of developments within  
the Group. External training is provided when appropriate.  
This includes briefings from the Company’s advisers at Board 
meetings and presentations on relevant subjects from guest 
speakers at Board dinners.
All our directors have access to the advice and services of the 
company secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. 
There is an agreed procedure for directors to obtain independent 
professional advice, paid for by the Group.
A.6 Performance evaluation
The Board, as part of its commitment to ensure its effectiveness 
and evaluate its ongoing performance, completed an evaluation 
of its performance during the year. This evaluation consisted of 
private discussions between the chairman and each director with 
the recommendations arising from these discussions distilled into  
a report considered by the Board. In addition, the Audit 
Committee completed a detailed formal assessment of its 
performance and processes; and the Remuneration Committee  
has scheduled a similar exercise for the current financial year. 
The non-executive directors have met alone to appraise the 
chairman’s performance.
A.7 Re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,  
one-third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year. 
In addition, any director appointed during the year will stand for 
election at the next general meeting, ensuring that each Board 
member faces re-election at regular intervals.
B. REMUNERATION
Details of the directors’ remuneration and the work of the 
remuneration committee, as required by the Code and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, are set  
out in the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 49.
C. ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
C.1 Financial reporting
All shareholder communications are designed to present a balanced 
and understandable view of the Group’s activities and prospects. 
Details of directors’ responsibilities and the going concern 
statement are given in the directors’ report on page 39 and 40.
C.2 Internal control
The Board has accountability for reviewing and approving the 
adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management. It is the role of management to implement the 
agreed policies on risk and control.
Our system of internal financial and operational controls is  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE FORTY-THREE
designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and aims to 
facilitate effective and efficient operations, to safeguard the 
Group’s assets, ensure proper accounting records are maintained 
and ensure that the financial information used within the 
business and for publication is reliable. Our risk management 
process identifies the key risks facing each business and reports 
to the Board on how those risks are being managed.
Such a system of internal control can only be designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement and loss.
The Board has a continuing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the risks we face and that process has been in 
place for the year under review and remains current. This process 
covers subsidiaries in which the Group has an interest of 50% or 
more. Joint Ventures in which we do not have overall control are 
not treated, for these purposes, as part of the Group. For these 
Joint Ventures, systems of internal control are applied as agreed 
between the parties to the venture. For the Metronet Joint 
Venture the Board has reviewed the risks faced by the  
Group separately.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the operation and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, which operated 
during the period covered by the Directors’ report and financial 
statements, up to and including the date of approval by the Board.
Key features of our system of internal control are as follows:
Group organisation and culture
By its statements and actions the Board emphasises a culture  
of integrity, competence, fairness and responsibility.
The Board focuses mainly on strategic issues, senior 
management performance and financial performance. Our  
chief executive and the Group Executive, as his senior executive 
team, concentrate on operational performance, operational 
decision-making and the formulation of strategic proposals to the 
Board. The Group’s managing directors manage their businesses 
with the support of senior managers. The Board determines how 
the chief executive operates within a framework of delegated 
authorities and reserved powers which seek to ensure that  
certain transactions, significant in terms of their size or type,  
are undertaken only after high-level review.
Control environment
Our operational structure has clearly documented and 
communicated principles of delegation of authority and segregation 
of duties. The Group’s management systems include financial 
policies and procedures, corporate and business quality assurance 
manuals, health and safety procedures and environmental 
management procedures. These procedures are subject to review  
to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made.
Financial reporting
The Board approves a strategic plan and annual budgets for the 
Group. The financial performance of individual business segments 
is reported regularly and compared to annual budgets. We report 
to our shareholders on a half-yearly basis. Forecasts for the Group 
are updated and reviewed by the Board regularly.
Project and contract control
Procedures seek to ensure that risks are identiﬁed through the project 
lifecycle from bidding to completion. Regular review procedures are 
in place to ensure that issues are appropriately reported to the Board. 
A commercial risk and audit framework is in place which requires 
peer review to be carried out for all signiﬁcant bids and opportunities 
or where signiﬁcant investment decisions have to be taken.
Individual business controls
Individual businesses and central corporate functions complete 
an annual self-certification statement. Responsible managers 
personally confirm the review of their systems of internal control 
and their compliance with Group policies. The statement also 
requires the reporting of any significant control issues that have 
emerged so that areas of Group concern may be identified, 
addressed and experience shared. The results of the process are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and reported to the Board.
Functional speciality reporting
The Board assesses the risks facing the business on an ongoing 
basis and has identified a number of other key areas which are 
subject to regular reporting to the Board such as human resources, 
health and safety, environment, tax and treasury.
Risk management review
The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group, aided 
by the Group Risk Committee and detailed reviews of internal 
controls and risk management. The Group risk management 
framework requires businesses to record formally all significant 
risks facing their business and detail the steps being taken to avoid 
or mitigate those risks. A summary of the key risks facing the 
Group is placed on risk registers which are reviewed regularly  
by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Group maintains insurance policies to provide protection 
from losses arising through claims from clients. The adequacy of 
the Group’s insurance cover, including arrangements within the 
captive insurance company, is reviewed by the Board annually. 
Internal audit
The internal audit function undertakes a programme to address 
internal control and risk management processes with particular 
reference to the Turnbull report. Its conclusions are communicated 
to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct 
reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED

Metronet
Metronet is the Group’s most significant Joint Venture. Given  
its importance to the Group, an experienced senior manager  
is responsible for representing the Group’s interest as a non-
executive director on the Board of Metronet and is responsible  
for monitoring the progress of Metronet on behalf of the Group. 
Metronet has regular meetings of its Board of directors. It also has 
its own Audit and Remuneration Committees, at which a Group 
representative is also present. 
C.3 Audit Committee and auditors
The Audit Committee comprises James Morley, Fiona Clutterbuck 
and Sir Peter Williams, all independent non-executive directors. 
James Morley, a chartered accountant, is chairman of the 
committee. Fiona Clutterbuck was appointed as a member of  
the committee on 1 April 2007. Christopher Kemball served as  
a member of the committee until his retirement on 31 December 
2006. The Board considers all members to have recent and 
relevant financial experience.
The independent auditors and head of internal audit have 
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee and, in accordance 
with usual practice, meet privately with the committee at each 
scheduled meeting.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference address the provisions 
in the Code in relation to audit committees and auditors. The 
Board and the Audit Committee monitor the cost-effectiveness of 
audit and non-audit work performed by the independent auditors 
and also consider the potential impact, if any, on the corporate 
relationship with the auditors before awarding any non-audit 
work. For details regarding fees paid to the independent auditors, 
see note 4 to the financial statements.
The independent auditors continue to operate procedures to 
safeguard against the possibility that their objectivity and 
independence could be compromised. These include the use of 
independent concurring partners, use of a technical review panel 
(where appropriate) and annual independence confirmations by all 
staff. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee on 
matters including independence and non-audit fees on an annual 
basis. In addition, the role of the audit partner is rotated on a 
periodic basis.
During the year the committee’s activities have included:
  A formal review of the draft annual report, interim statement 
and associated announcements focusing on key judgemental 
areas and accounting policies
  A review of the independent auditors’ strategy and their findings 
in respect of the annual report and interim statement
  Regular examination of the reports in respect of work 
undertaken by the internal audit function
  An assessment of the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control, risk management process and the Company’s employee 
disclosure policy
  A detailed review of the internal audit plan
  Analysis of audit and non-audit fees and of the auditors’ 
independence, including the rotation of the audit partner during 
the year
  An appraisal of its own effectiveness and that of the 
independent auditors and the internal auditors.
D. RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
D.1 Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Board gives communication with all shareholders a high 
priority. The Group’s website contains information on current 
activities including our annual and interim results presentations  
to City analysts and institutional investors.
Our chairman maintains contact with institutional shareholders 
writing to them annually to set out our commitment to open, 
ongoing dialogue. Both he and the senior independent director 
make themselves available for the regular investor meetings held 
by the chief executive and Group finance director if they are 
requested to do so. A wide range of relevant issues are discussed 
at investor meetings including strategy, performance, management 
and corporate governance. Non-executive directors are kept 
informed of the views of shareholders and the executive directors 
provide reports to them on investor meetings. The Group’s brokers 
provide briefings to the Board on shareholder opinion and compile 
independent feedback from investor meetings.
D.2 Constructive use of the AGM
All our shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s AGM, at 
which all directors are present. We seek to encourage shareholder 
participation by enabling proxy votes to be lodged online via our 
shareholder services portal at www.myatkinsshares.com.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE
We complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the  
Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2007 except for the 
short period following the retirement of Christopher Kemball  
on 31 December 2006 and the appointment of Fiona Clutterbuck 
as a member of the Audit Committee on 1 April 2007. During  
this period the Committee temporarily comprised of two  
non-executive directors. Due to our early adoption of the June 
2006 Combined Code on Corporate Governance, as encouraged 
by the Financial Reporting Council, there was a technical  
non-compliance from 1 January 2007 to the  year-end following  
the appointment of Ed Wallis as a member of the  
Remuneration Committee.

26 June 2007 REMUNERATION REPORT
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE FORTY-FIVE
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”).  
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the Company’s AGM at which the financial 
statements will be presented for approval.
This report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited 
and audited information. The Regulations require the independent 
auditors to report to our shareholders on the “audited information” 
section of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that 
part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
Our Remuneration Committee comprises Sir Peter Williams, Lord 
Boyce, James Morley and Ed Wallis. Sir Peter Williams, Lord Boyce 
and James Morley are independent non-executive directors. 
Ed Wallis, our chairman, who was considered independent on 
his appointment in 2006, was appointed as a member of the 
committee on 1 January 2007. His appointment followed changes 
to the Combined Code. The committee is chaired by Sir Peter 
Williams. Details of attendance at committee meetings can be 
found on page 41.
The committee reviews the remuneration policy for the chairman 
and executive directors and, more generally, the remuneration 
policy of the Group. The committee determines the level of 
remuneration, incentives and other benefits, compensation 
payments and terms of employment of the chairman and each 
executive director. The committee seeks to provide appropriate 
incentives to enhance performance and align the interests of the 
executive directors with those of shareholders. The committee 
also reviews the salaries and benefits of members of the Group 
Executive, the company secretary and other senior managers 
reporting directly to the chief executive.
In determining remuneration, the committee consulted the  
chief executive, the Group HR director and, where required,  
the company secretary about its proposals. No director or senior 
manager participates in meetings at which his own remuneration 
is under consideration. 
The committee appointed, and continued to use, New Bridge 
Street Consultants LLP (NBSC) to provide advice on structuring 
executive remuneration packages. NBSC do not provide any other 
services to the Group.
Remuneration policy
The objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy are to attract, 
retain and incentivise management with the appropriate 
professional, managerial and technological expertise to realise our 
business objectives and to align their interests with those of our 
shareholders. We continue to strive to link payment to performance 
and thereby create a performance culture. A significant proportion 
of the executive directors’ total remuneration is linked to 
performance through participation in the performance bonus plan 
and long-term share incentives.
To ensure that we offer the best available incentive to enhance 
shareholder value, the committee continued to assess the 
following constituent elements of the remuneration of the 
executive directors and review the same for members of the  
Group Executive and senior managers:
(i) basic salary and other benefits
(ii) performance bonus payments
(iii)  long-term share incentives 
(iv)  all employee share plan
(v) retirement benefits.
(i) Basic salary and other benefits
The committee reviews the basic salary of the executive directors, 
members of the Group Executive and senior managers each  
year to ensure they remain appropriate and competitive. A wide 
range of data is utilised, together with assistance from NBSC  
as appropriate.
In accordance with the Group’s remuneration policy, Keith 
Clarke’s salary was increased to £403,000 per annum and Robert 
MacLeod’s was increased to £273,000 per annum with effect 
from 1 April 2007. The committee considered that the basic salary 
paid to Robert MacLeod should be significantly increased to bring 
it more closely into line with that paid to finance directors in 
comparable companies. The increase was based on data obtained 
from NBSC as part of its review conducted in 2006. Alun Griffiths’ 
salary was increased to £183,000 with effect from 1 April 2007 
following his appointment as an executive director.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 the executive directors and 
members of the Group Executive participated in the Performance 
Salary Incentive (PSI), which pays a cash bonus subject to 
exceeding budgeted Group targets. Under PSI, payments range 
from 0-12% of basic salary and are contractual and non-
pensionable. No PSI payments have been made in respect of the 
year. With effect from 1 April 2007, however, the committee 
determined that PSI should be incorporated into the performance 
bonus plan for executive directors and Group Executive members 
outlined in paragraph (ii) below. 
Other benefits for executive directors include a car allowance  
or a car and payment of its operating expenses, life assurance  
and entitlement to a non-contributory private healthcare scheme.
Keith Clarke received no remuneration for his services as non-
executive chairman of Metronet in the year ended 31 March 2007.
The Company’s bonus and long-term incentive plans seek to 
provide executive directors and members of the Group Executive 
with the opportunity to increase overall remuneration levels to 
the upper quartile for comparable businesses but only following 
demanding performance targets being achieved.

WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE FORTY-SIX 
Remuneration report 
Continued
(ii) Performance bonus payments
Following the amalgamation of PSI with the performance bonus 
plan, executive directors are now eligible to receive a bonus of  
up to 80% of their basic salary for achieving Group financial  
and individual performance targets. 
The targets against which bonuses are paid, which include 
non-financial targets relating to management of issues such as 
health and safety and staff retention, have also been reviewed  
by the committee. In exceptional circumstances, the committee 
may increase the bonus to pay out up to 100% of basic salary. 
Members of the Group Executive also participate in the bonus plan.
Executive directors are required to take approximately one-
third of any bonus in the form of an award over shares, under 
the terms of the Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). The DBP 
is designed to aid retention, with the award being subject to 
forfeiture on resignation within three years from grant. There 
are no further performance conditions once the award has 
been made. Dividends declared on DBP awards since 2006 are 
rolled up and delivered to participants in cash on release of the 
award to further align their interests with those of shareholders. 
Members of the Group Executive have until the present time also 
participated in the DBP. However, with effect from the current 
year, the committee intends to make awards to them under the 
Retention Bonus Plan (RBP), a newly adopted plan which is similar 
to the DBP but which allows for a shorter vesting period. It is 
intended that awards made to members of the Group Executive 
this year will vest two years following award.
Bonus awards are non-pensionable and non-contractual.
(iii) Long-term share incentives
Shareholders approved amendments to the Atkins Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) in 2006. In particular, the performance 
targets for LTIP awards were changed to enable them to better 
motivate and retain the executive directors, members of the 
Group Executive and other senior executives. Under the amended 
LTIP, awards to executive directors and members of the Group 
Executive are made on the following basis:
   50% of the award is subject to the Company’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance relative to the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) on the date of 
award. Full vesting is achieved if the Company ranks in the 
upper quartile, 30% for a median ranking, and pro rata vesting 
for intermediate performance. No vesting occurs for a ranking 
below median 
   50% of the award is subject to the Company’s real growth 
in normalised earnings per share (EPS) over the performance 
period. An increase in EPS of more than 10% per annum above 
the UK retail price index (RPI) over the three-year performance 
period enables the shares to vest in full; an increase of less than 
4% per annum above the UK RPI means that none of the shares 
vest. A sliding scale to determine vesting operates for growth  
in EPS between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Dividends declared on shares subject to LTIP awards are rolled  
up and delivered to executives in cash on release of the  
underlying award.
This year the committee intends to make LTIP awards at around 
the 100% of salary level to the executive directors. As in 2006, 
the number of shares subject to the awards will be based on a 
share price determined at the beginning of the financial year prior 
to the award date, a practice which the committee intends to 
continue to follow in future years. The upper limit in the LTIP  
is 150% of salary.
A full summary of the performance conditions attaching 
to existing share plan awards can be found in note 30 to the 
financial statements.
The Group encourages share ownership by its executives, and 
executive directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company 
(either directly or through the DBP) equivalent to the level of their 
annual basic salary, based on the value of such shares at the time 
of their acquisition (or award), or their current market value from 
time to time, whichever is the higher. 
(iv) All-employee share plan
The Company’s Share Incentive Plan, as approved by HM  
Revenue and Customs, continues to be offered to all eligible  
UK employees, including the executive directors. 
(v) Retirement benefits
Pension and retirement benefits provided to the executive 
directors are comparable to those provided by other companies.
Performance graph
The Company’s performance, measured by TSR, is compared with 
the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
trusts) over the past five years. This is considered the most 
appropriate index against which to measure performance as  
the Company has been a member of the FTSE 250 for the  
majority of the five year period.

TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they 
held a notional number of shares and received dividends on those 
shares over a period of time. Assuming dividends are re-invested 
into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth 
in the Company’s share price together with the value of any 
dividends paid.

Independent auditors’ report
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF WS ATKINS PLC
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of WS Atkins plc for the 
year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements 
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in 
the Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS  
AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out  
in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including 
the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in 
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
report is consistent with the financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information 
presented in the Operating and financial review and Chairman’s 
statement that is cross-referred from the Business review section 
of the Directors’ report. 
In addition, we also report to you if, in our opinion, the company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or 
if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code 2003 specified for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Financial 
highlights, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief executive – Our 
strategy, the Human resources review, the Operating and ﬁnancial 
review, Corporate responsibility, the Board of directors, the Directors’ 
report, the Corporate governance report and the unaudited part of 
the Remuneration report. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities  
do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report  
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the  
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity  
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
  The Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of  
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of  
its loss and cash flows for the year then ended

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2007
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
WS Atkins plc is a public limited company registered and domiciled 
in the UK. Its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, 
Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of WS Atkins plc have 
been prepared in accordance with EU-Endorsed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), IFRIC interpretations and 
the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by available-for-
sale financial assets, pensions, share-based payments and financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments)  
at fair value through the income statement. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates. Material estimates 
applied across the Group’s businesses and Joint Ventures are 
reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate 
to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related issues 
that require judgement is achieved upon consolidation. Any 
revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements, are disclosed on page 32 of  
the Operating and Financial Review.  
Basis of consolidation
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the 
periods presented. 
The consolidated income statement and balance sheet include 
the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its 
share of Joint Ventures. The results of the subsidiary undertakings 
acquired during the year are included in the income statement 
from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings 
disposed of during the year are included in the income statement 
up to the date of disposal.  
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled 
by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken 
into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date 
of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference  
is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different 
from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group transactions 
and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Where subsidiaries 
do not adopt accounting periods that are co-terminous with the 
Group’s, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn  
up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator 
of the asset transferred.
The accounts of the Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) are 
incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are 
administered by independent Trustees and their assets are held 
separately from those of the Group, in practice the Group’s advice 
on how the assets are used for the benefit of employees is normally 
accepted. The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the 
assets held by the EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally in the 
employees. Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown  
as a reduction in retained loss/earnings. Other assets and liabilities  
held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Financial risk management    
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: 
market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, 
cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department 
(Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in 
close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board 
provides written principles for overall risk management, as well  
as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative 
financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments,  
and investment of excess liquidity.
Details of the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency 
risk have been set out in the Operating and financial review. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Foreign currency transactions and translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency  
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional 
currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented 
in pounds sterling (“£”), which is the Company’s and Group’s 
functional and presentation currency.  
(b) Transactions and balances  
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges  
and qualifying net investment hedges.  
Trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at average 
rates of exchange. Differences resulting from the retranslation of 
opening net assets and results for the period at closing rates are 
taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Segment reporting    
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged 
in providing products or services that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other business segments. 
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within 
a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of segments operating in 
other economic environments.   
The Group is organised into seven operating segments for 
management purposes, reflecting its key markets and service 
offerings. The segments are Design and Engineering Solutions, 
Highways and Transportation, Rail, Middle East and China, 
Management and Project Services, Asset Management and Equity 
Investments. These segments form the basis for reporting the 
Group’s primary segment information as it is the main determinant 
of the Group’s risks and returns. The basis for reporting the 
secondary segment information is the geographical sectors of 
the United Kingdom, other European countries, Middle East, 
North America and Asia Pacific. These represent the Group’s most 
significant geographical sectors. The majority of central costs are 
allocated to segments based on revenue or utilisation of resource. 
All revenue relates to revenue from services.  
Inter-segment transfers and transactions are entered into  
under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would  
be available to unrelated third parties. 
Revenue
Revenue from long-term contracts comprises the value of work 
performed during the period calculated in accordance with the 
Group’s policy for contract accounting set out below. Revenue 
from other contract activities represents fee income receivable  
in respect of services provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer 
expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from 
third-party contractors and recharge them on to the customer 
at cost. The amounts charged by contractors and recharged 
to customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales. 
Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions  
are included in the Group balance sheet.  
Revenue recognition and contract accounting
The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs 
incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads 
and attributable profit. Fees invoiced on account are deducted 
from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately 
disclosed in trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable 
on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in 
progress on any contract when the excess is separately disclosed  
in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance. 
Profit is recognised on a percentage completion basis when 
the outcome of a contract or project can be reasonably foreseen. 
Provision is made in full for estimated losses. Where the outcome 
of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on 
completion. Where contracts span two or more accounting  
periods profit is not generally recognised until the contract is  
50% complete.
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined 
by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to 
date. Where the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal 
or termination of a contract are higher in the final period of the 
contract a proportion of revenue is deferred each period to meet 
these anticipated costs. Full provision is made for losses  
on outsourcing contracts if the forecast costs of fulfilling the 
contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast 
income receivable. In assessing the amount of the loss to provide 
on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Group’s share  
of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures which the contract 
is servicing.
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using 
the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the 
Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, 
being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original 
effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding 
the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans 
is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment 
is established.   
Pre-contract costs
The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with 
IAS 11, Construction contracts. Costs incurred before it becomes 
probable that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses. 
Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised  WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

in the balance sheet and charged to the income statement over 
the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, 
over the same period as the Group’s interest in any Special Purpose 
Company (SPC) charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the 
income statement.   
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income 
statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/
PFI concessions, over the same period as the Group’s interest in 
any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income 
statement. Where the Group’s interest in any SPC reduces, the 
deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement  
in proportion to the reduction of the Group’s interest.
Exceptional items    
Where certain expense or revenue items recorded in a period are 
material by their size or incidence, the Group reflects such items  
as exceptional items and these are shown separately in the  
income statement.
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental 
analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension schemes which require payments to be made into 
separately administered funds. For defined benefit schemes, 
regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally 
qualified actuaries to determine the level of contributions required 
to fund the benefits set out in the scheme rules. 
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, 
Employee benefits. The cost of the defined contribution schemes 
is charged to operating profit as incurred. The cost of the defined 
benefit schemes is charged as follows:
  The current service cost incurred during the period to provide 
retirement benefits to employees is charged to operating profit
  Gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not 
covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating profit
  A charge representing the expected increase in scheme liabilities 
is included in net finance costs. This is based on the present 
value of scheme liabilities at the beginning of the period; and
  A credit representing the expected return on scheme assets is 
included within net finance costs. This is based on the market 
value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the period 
allowing for expected cash flows during the period.
For defined benefit schemes, differences between actual and 
expected returns on assets during the period are recognised 
immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, 
together with differences arising from changes in assumptions. 
The difference between the market value of scheme assets and 
the present value of scheme liabilities is recognised as a retirement 
benefit asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. To 
the extent that it is recoverable, any related deferred tax asset or 
liability is included in the relevant category of receivable/payable.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses  
in full as they arise through retained loss/earnings.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost 
of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is 
charged to the income statement over the performance and 
vesting periods of the instruments. The cost is based on the 
fair value of the awards made at the date of grant adjusted for 
the number of awards expected to vest. In accordance with the 
transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge is made in respect 
of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002. The credits 
associated with the amounts charged to the income statement are 
included in retained earnings/loss until the awards are exercised. 
Where awards are settled by new issue shares any proceeds 
received in respect of share options are credited to share capital 
and share premium. Where awards are settled in shares held by 
the EBTs any proceeds are credited to retained earnings/loss.
Joint Ventures
In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, the 
Group accounts for Joint Ventures under the equity method of 
accounting. The Group’s share of a Joint Venture’s profit after 
tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires 
joint control. Within the consolidated balance sheet the 
investment is recorded at cost (classified as a non-current asset) 
and subsequently adjusted to reflect the Group’s share of the 
movements in the Joint Venture’s net assets post acquisition.
The results, assets and liabilities of Joint Ventures are stated in 
accordance with Group accounting policies. Where Joint Ventures 
adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, 
their reported results are restated to comply with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt accounting periods that  
are co-terminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are  
based upon accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting  
reference date.
PPP/PFI concessions
Assets constructed by PPP/PFI concession companies are classified 
in the accounts of the Joint Ventures as financial assets or 
intangible assets, depending on whether the grantor or user has 
the primary responsibility to pay the operator for the concession 
services. To date all of the Group’s PPP/PFI concession assets have 
been classed as financial assets.
The financial asset represents an interest-bearing, long-term 
receivable. The cost of the financial asset at any one time is equal to 
the accumulated value of service delivery plus accumulated interest 
charged to the financial asset less amounts received to date.
The financial asset is measured at fair value. Where it is classed 
as a loan receivable any movement in fair value is taken to the 
income statement. Where it is classed as available for sale any 
movement in fair value is taken to reserves.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE FIFTY-SEVEN 
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received 
for goods and services provided in the normal course of business 
net of value added tax rebates and discounts. Revenue from 
contracting activities represents the value of work carried out during 
the year including amounts not invoiced. Interest income is accrued 
on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life 
of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying value amount.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be measured 
reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage 
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date 
as measured by the contract costs incurred. Where the outcome 
of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract 
revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract 
costs incurred will be recovered.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected resultant loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Income tax
Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the income 
statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a 
result of a transaction or event that is recognised directly in equity. 
Income tax arising on transactions or events recognised directly in 
equity is charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax 
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted 
by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment. Prior to 1 April 2004, 
goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic life. 
Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of 
existing goodwill was frozen at that date and subject to annual 
impairment review.
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business 
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arises when the fair value of 
the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of 
the net assets. In accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, 
goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to 
impairment review both annually and when there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to 
retained earnings/loss. Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying 
businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill 
previously recorded as a deduction from equity. 
Acquired intangibles
The Group accounts for acquired intangible assets in accordance 
with IAS 38, Intangible assets. Intangible assets are stated at 
amortised cost less impairment. Such intangible assets are 
recognised separately if they meet the criteria for recognition,  
and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives unless 
these are indefinite, in which case they are reviewed regularly  
for impairment.
Corporate information systems
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Group’s corporate 
information systems are treated as an intangible asset. Costs 
included are those directly attributable to the design, construction 
and testing of new systems (including major enhancements 
and internally generated costs) from the point of inception to 
the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future 
economic benefits arising from the investment could be assessed 
with reasonable certainty at the time the costs were incurred. 
Maintenance and minor modifications are expensed in the income 
statement as incurred. The corporate information systems are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
economic life of six years.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises purchase price after 
discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing 
the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis calculated at annual rates to write-off the cost less residual 
value of each asset over the term of its estimated useful economic 
life as follows:
  Freehold buildings – 10 to 50 years
  Short leasehold – over the life of the lease
  Plant and machinery – 3 to 10 years
  Special purpose industrial motor vehicles – 3 to 12 years
  Other motor vehicles – 3 to 4 years
  Information technology – 2
1
/2 to 5 years
  No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The directors annually review the estimated useful economic lives 
and residual values of property, plant and equipment. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
Continued
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are reviewed for impairment annually and 
when there are indications that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed 
for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets 
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairments.
Financial assets
Financial assets include restricted cash deposits, which are shown 
at market value, and floating rate notes and certificates of deposits 
which are valued at the mid-market price quoted on a recognised 
stock exchange. Debt securities issued at a significant discount to 
the maturity value are valued at cost plus amortised discount over 
the life of the security. Restricted cash deposits relate to accounts 
where withdrawals are restricted under contractual agreements.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The fair value of financial assets is measured at each balance sheet 
date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow 
allocated to the financial asset. The movement in the fair value of 
available-for-sale financial assets since the previous balance sheet 
date is taken to equity.
With effect from 1 April 2005 financial instruments are accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition 
and measurement. Derivatives are initially accounted for and 
measured at fair value on the date a contract is entered into 
and subsequently measured at fair value. Where a derivative is a 
designated hedging instrument and is assessed as being effective  
in accordance with IAS 39, the gain or loss on re-measurement  
is recognised in equity. In all other cases the gain or loss is taken  
to the income statement.   
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is calculated  
on a first-in, first-out basis.   
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less provision for 
impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or 
financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments 
are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits 
and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
Lease obligations
Finance leases
Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and the useful life of the asset. A liability is recognised for 
the present value of the minimum lease payments within current 
and/or non-current liabilities as appropriate. Rental payments are 
apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a 
constant rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation.
Where the Group acts as a lessor in a finance lease, receivables 
under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these 
agreements less finance charges allocated to future periods. Finance 
lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so  
as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Operating leases
Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, 
the costs of operating leases are charged to the income statement 
as incurred. Lease incentives received are recognised over the lease 
term on a straight-line basis.
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease 
arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted 
for on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease 
incentives provided are recognised over the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Provisions 
Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts 
where the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the 
contract period exceed the forecast income receivable. In assessing 
the amount of the loss to provide on any contract, account is taken 
of the Group’s share of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures 
which the contract is servicing. The provision is calculated based  
on discounted cash flows to the end of the contract.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has 
committed to a course of action that will result in the property 
becoming vacant. The provision is calculated based on discounted 
cash flows to the end of the lease. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective  
in the current financial year but not relevant
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are 
mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2006 but are not relevant to the Group’s activities:
  IAS 39 (Amendment), Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast 
Intragroup Transactions
 IAS 39 (Amendment), The Fair Value Option
 IAS 39 and IFRS 4 (Amendment), Financial Guarantee Contracts
 IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources

Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 6 (Amendment), 
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources
  IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specific Market 
– Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
  IFRIC 4, Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease; 
and
  IFRIC 5, Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, 
Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds. 
(b) Standards that are not yet effective and have not been 
early-adopted by the Group 
  IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosures (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007) 
replaces IAS 30 and the disclosure requirements in IAS 32 
and locates in one place all disclosures relating to financial 
instruments. The new requirements incorporate many of IAS 
32’s disclosures as well as additional qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures on the risks arising from financial instruments. The 
Group will apply IFRS 7 from 1 April 2007 and will increase the 
level of disclosure in the Group’s accounts.
  IFRS 8, Operating segments, (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009) replaces IAS 14 and aligns 
segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard 
SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and 
related information. The new standard uses a management 
approach, under which segment information is presented on  
the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.  
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 April 2009 but it is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s accounts.
(c) Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet 
effective and have not been early-adopted by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been 
published that are mandatory for later accounting periods but  
the Group has not early-adopted:
  IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives, (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006) clarifies 
that an entity should assess whether an embedded derivative is 
required to be separated from the host contract and accounted 
for as a derivative when the entity first becomes a party to the 
contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited, unless there is 
a change in the contract’s terms, in which case it is required. The 
Group will apply IFRIC 9 from 1 April 2007 but it is not expected 
to have any impact on the Group’s accounts
  IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment (effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006). 
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim 
period on goodwill, investments in equity instruments and 
investments in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at 
a subsequent balance sheet date. The Group will apply IFRIC 10 
from 1 April 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on 
the Group’s accounts
  IFRIC 11 – IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions – 
which requires arrangements whereby an employee is granted 
rights to an entity’s equity instruments to be accounted for as an 
equity-settled scheme by the entity even if the entity chooses or 
is required to buy those equity instruments from another party 
or the shareholders of the entity provide the equity instruments 
needed. This interpretation becomes effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
(d) Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet 
effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations
The following interpretations to existing standards have been 
published that are mandatory for later accounting periods but  
are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
  IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, 
Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies (effective  
from 1 March 2006). IFRIC 7 provides guidance on how to  
apply requirements of IAS 29 in a reporting period in which  
an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the 
economy of its functional currency, when the economy  
was not hyperinflationary in the prior period. As none of  
the Group entities have a currency of a hyperinflationary  
economy as their functional currency, IFRIC 7 is not relevant  
to the Group’s operations
  IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 (effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 May 2006). IFRIC 8 requires consideration of 
transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments – where 
the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value 
of the equity instruments issued – to establish whether or not 
they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. 
(e) Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet 
effective but have been adopted early by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been 
published that are mandatory for later accounting periods but 
which the Group has early-adopted:
  IFRIC 12 – Service concession arrangements which outlines an 
approach to account for contractual arrangements arising from 
entities providing public services. Notes to the ﬁnancial statements

(c) Metronet
On 4 April 2003, financial close was reached on the 30-year Metronet London Underground PPP in which the Group is a 20% equal partner.
At financial close, Atkins received £20.1m in respect of bid cost recoveries and project development fees from Metronet. In line with the 
Group’s accounting policy in relation to pre-contract costs incurred on PPP/PFI investments, this sum was recognised on the balance sheet 
and will be released to the income statement over 30 years.
Atkins is required to invest £70m in Metronet by way of equity and shareholder subordinated debt over the first six years of the concession. 
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Group invested £18.0m (2006: £11.2m). The outstanding investment required is £19.3m  
(2006: £37.3m) of which £15.6m was paid post year-end. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE SIXTY-SEVEN
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The contract
Metronet has two separate 30-year performance-based contracts which together cover over two-thirds of the London Underground 
network. The contracts, which are split into four 7
1
/2-year periods, cover inter alia the repair, refurbishment and modernisation of the 
infrastructure. The contracts are subject to periodic review at the end of each 7
1
/2-year period. The periodic reviews allow for restating  
the scope of the work, the level of payment, the contractual terms and the performance requirements.
Metronet has contracted with Trans4m Ltd, a Joint Venture company in which Atkins has a 25% shareholding, to undertake the civil 
engineering work and the refurbishment programme. Trans4m Ltd has signed a 7
1
/2-year contract with Atkins for premises and civil design, 
inspection and assessment work and the design and build of new communication systems.
Metronet’s revenue consists of a fixed element (Underlying Infrastructure Service Charge) which is adjusted for performance.  
Performance is measured under three categories: capability, availability and ambience. Shareholder returns are sensitive to these 
performance-based measures.
Consolidation of Metronet’s results
In line with the Group’s accounting policies on Joint Ventures, the results of Metronet have been accounted for under the equity method  
of accounting.
As part of its consolidation of Metronet’s balance sheet, Atkins initially recognised £8.7m of goodwill associated with liabilities inherited 
when the PPP companies were acquired from London Underground Limited. Under the transition rules for the implementation of IFRS this 
balance was frozen at the carrying amount on 1 April 2004 of £7.8m and will be subject to an annual impairment review. The carrying 
value of the Group’s investment in Metronet has been fully impaired in the current year (see note 9).

5. PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF JOINT VENTURES (2006)
In line with the Group’s stated strategy to recycle cash invested in PFI project companies at the appropriate time, the Group disposed of its 
25% stake in South Manchester Healthcare (Holdings) Limited and its 42.5% stake in NewSchools (Penweddig) Holdings Limited during the 
previous financial year.
The disposal of South Manchester Healthcare (Holdings) Limited was completed on 23 November 2005 for a consideration of £7.8m 
resulting in a profit of £5.7m in the year to 31 March 2006. Atkins’ contract for the maintenance and upkeep of the Wythenshawe Hospital 
NHS Trust estate will remain in place. The Group’s share of post-tax profit from Joint Ventures up to the date of disposal in relation to  
South Manchester Healthcare (Holdings) Limited was £0.3m.
The disposal of NewSchools (Penweddig) Holdings Limited was completed on 22 December 2005 for a consideration of £1.4m resulting in a 
profit of £0.7m in the year to 31 March 2006. The Group’s share of post-tax profit from Joint Ventures up to the date of disposal in relation 
to NewSchools (Penweddig) Holdings Limited was £0.6m.
The Joint Ventures disposed were both attributed to the Equity Investments segment. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

9. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Metronet Joint Venture
During the year Metronet’s operating performance was mixed and the stations and certain other capital programmes remain behind 
schedule. The costs of the programme are substantially higher than anticipated and as a result on 21 June 2007 Metronet gave notice to 
London Underground of its intention to invite the Arbiter to conduct an Extraordinary Review for Metronet BCV in July and for Metronet 
SSL later in the year. The Arbiter’s review will determine the extent to which the additional costs in excess of the first £50m per infraco 
qualify for reimbursement by London Underground and is likely to take at least six to nine months to conduct. There is a risk that some  
of the additional costs will be borne by Metronet.
Metronet is currently unable to access its lending facilities. Metronet, its banks and shareholders are in discussion about how to ensure  
that Metronet is able to continue until the completion of the Extraordinary Review. Metronet’s financial structure demands that a  
resolution of this issue is achieved if it is to continue to be able to deliver its PPP programme.
Given the current uncertainties associated with Metronet’s funding position and the outcome of the Extraordinary Review process, the 
results for the Group for the year include an exceptional loss of £91.3m (after Joint Venture tax). This exceptional loss has no cash impact 
but reduces the carrying value of the Group’s investment in Metronet to £nil.
Trans4m Joint Venture
Trans4m is primarily responsible for the delivery of improvements to stations, which as indicated above remain behind plan, and its costs 
have risen significantly. Trans4m has recently started awarding station contracts to outside contractors rather than using companies within 
its tied supply chain. To further address the stations programme, Metronet and its shareholders have recently reached agreement on heads 
of terms for the future early termination of Trans4m’s contract. This agreement is subject to approval from Metronet’s banks.
Trans4m bears a contractual share of the cost over-run together with penalties for late delivery of stations into service. Although Trans4m’s 
liabilities for the cost over-runs are capped, the Group’s results include an exceptional loss from Trans4m of £26.0m (after Joint Venture tax) 
to take account of the expected outturn for Trans4m’s remaining contract.
The cash impact of this is expected to be around £30m, the majority of which will be paid by Atkins to Trans4m during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2008.
Atkins’ supply chain
The work that Atkins carries out for Trans4m is primarily related to stations design. Given the changes to Trans4m’s supply chain noted 
above, some of the work that Atkins was originally in line to undertake may now be carried out by other companies. As a result an 
exceptional loss of £4.0m is included in the results for the year to take account of expected future losses.
Our supply chain performance is expected to result in a cash outflow of around £35m during the year ending 31 March 2008, primarily  
in settlement of previously accounted for liabilities.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability  
in these financial statements.
The Employee Beneﬁts Trusts, which held 3,251,358 ordinary shares (2006: 4,367,898), have agreed to waive a proportion of their dividends 
relating to the year. As at 31 March 2007 dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share had been waived on 3,247,622 of the shares held in return 
for an equivalent gift. These arrangements reduced the dividend paid in year by £0.6m (2006: £0.5m) and the proposed ﬁnal dividend by £0.5m 
(2006: £0.5m).
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) which have not unconditionally vested in the employees.
Diluted earnings per share is the basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the  
number of options outstanding during the year. The options relate to the SAYE schemes, Equity Participation Plans and Long Term Incentive Plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets at least annually. The recoverable amount of goodwill 
has been based on value in use as represented by the net present value of future cash flows. Cash flows are projected forward for five  
years based on approved budgets and plans, beyond which they are inflated by a GDP-based growth factor. They are then discounted  
using a discount rate based on the Group’s post-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital.
Following the impairment test during the year and the prior year, no charge has been recognised through the income statement  
in respect of goodwill impairment. 
The allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units has been completed during the year. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

Bank borrowings bear interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from three to six months by reference to the relevant currency’s 
inter-bank rate.
Finance leases are on a fixed repayment basis, with interest rates fixed at the contract date. The average effective borrowing rate was  
7.2% (2006: 7.2%) over a weighted average remaining period of 33 months (2006: 34 months).
The carrying value of the Group’s borrowings approximates their fair value.

The Group did not use any derivative instrument during the year other than forward currency contracts and foreign exchange swaps to 
hedge foreign currency receipts and payments on current contracts. These will be transferred to the income statement when the related 
revenues and purchases are realised.
At 31 March 2007 the net future sterling receipts from these instruments was £12.3m (2006: £6.8m). The Group has reviewed all  
contracts for embedded derivatives and does not have any such instruments that are not closely related to the host contract.

27. RETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITIES
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The two main defined benefit schemes are the  
Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes. The assets of both schemes are  
held in separate trustee-administered funds. Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, 
which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent.
During the year the Group undertook discussions with the Trustees of the Atkins Pension Plan to explore ways of limiting any further 
increases in the Group’s defined benefit liabilities. Subsequently a proposal involving the closure of the scheme to future accrual of benefit 
was put before the members of the scheme during a two-month consultation period that ended on 18 May 2007. The outcome of the 
consultation is currently being evaluated and a final decision regarding changes to the plan is expected shortly. 
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are now offered membership of the defined 
contribution section.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows:
 CHANGE IN ASSUMPTION  EFFECT ON PLAN LIABILITIES
  ATKINS PENSION PLAN RAILWAYS PENSION SCHEME
DISCOUNT RATE  INCREASE/DECREASE 0.5% DECREASE/INCREASE 10.0% DECREASE/INCREASE 9.0%   
INFLATION  INCREASE/DECREASE 0.5% INCREASE/DECREASE 6.5% INCREASE/DECREASE 9.0%   
REAL RATE OF INCREASE IN SALARIES  INCREASE/DECREASE 0.5% INCREASE/DECREASE 2.0% INCREASE/DECREASE 3.0%   
LONGEVITY  INCREASE 1 YEAR INCREASE 4.0% INCREASE 3.0%  
The effect of the change in inflation on liabilities assumes a corresponding increase in salary increases and inflation-related pension increases.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit method is a solvency basis, which is a discontinuance measure, often estimated 
using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer assuming all active members became deferred 
pensioners at that date. This amount represents the notional amount that would have been required at the balance sheet date to settle 
the retirement benefit liabilities if a defined benefit-type plan were to be wound up. The Group estimates the amounts required to settle 
its retirement benefit liabilities on a solvency basis at the balance sheet date are approximately £520.0m (Atkins Pension Plan) and £30.0m 
(Railways Pension Scheme).

30. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2006 onwards
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees which are settled in equity, or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There are different performance targets for different categories of management. Awards made to executive 
directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to 
the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) on the date of the award. Full vesting of this portion of the award 
will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile, 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking with pro rata vesting 
for intermediate performance. No vesting will occur for a ranking below median. 50% of the award is to be subject to the Company’s real 
growth in normalised earnings per share (EPS) over the performance period. 
For the 2006 awards the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) in 
the three-year performance period to allow full vesting; if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no 
vesting. A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI. Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS 
condition. As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse. In the event that a participant 
leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2003 to August 2006
A share plan for senior executives and key employees to make awards to employees which are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, 
in cash. The performance condition is TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with the financial year 
beginning immediately after the award is granted. Full vesting of any award will take place for a top 20% ranking against a group of up to 
16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median. The EPS growth underpin is the 
UK RPI plus 2% per annum. As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse. In the event 
that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) pre September 2003
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees which are settled in equity. Awards have an EPS 
performance condition. EPS growth is required to be more than 12% per annum above the UK RPI in the relevant three-year performance 
period to enable all of the ordinary shares to be acquired, but if the EPS growth is less than 5% per annum above the UK RPI then none 
of the ordinary shares can be acquired. A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that can be acquired operates for growth  
in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI. Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest,  
on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise. As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment 
prior to vesting will lapse. In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Atkins Pre-Tax Equity Participation Plan (Pre-Tax EPP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part  
of their bonus in the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares (the Bonus Award) which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them  
a right to obtain a matching number of ordinary shares (the Matching Award). The right to the matching ordinary shares is subject to  
a performance condition identical to those in the WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan prior to 
amendment on 16 September 2003. Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest, 
on the shares subject to the Bonus Award after exercise and the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to  
the Matching Award between vesting and exercise. As a general rule Matching Awards made to participants who leave employment prior 
to vesting will lapse. In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Atkins Post-Tax Equity Participation Plan (Post-Tax EPP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees which was designed to encourage investment in the Group by taking all or part of 
their bonus in the form of ordinary shares (the Deposited Shares) which, if retained for a three-year period, gave them a right to obtain  
a matching number of ordinary shares (the Matching Award). The right to the matching ordinary shares is subject to a performance 
condition identical to those in the WS Atkins 2003 Senior Executive and Key Employee Long Term Incentive Plan prior to amendment  
on 16 September 2003. Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject  
to the Matching Award between vesting and exercise. All awards have now vested.
WS Atkins Employees’ Stock Option Plan (ESOP)
A share plan used to make awards to key employees in the US which is settled in equity or in cash and which permits options to be granted 
at an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share at the time of grant. Options vest after three years and must be exercised 
within ten years of the date of grant. All awards have now vested. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE NINETY-THREE
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Atkins Restricted Stock Unit Plan (RSU)
A share plan used to make awards to key employees following the acquisition of Hanscomb. There is no performance condition but awards 
are restricted for three years from the date of award. As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting 
will lapse. In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they will receive their award in full.
Deferred Bonus Plan
Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees which is settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash. There is no performance 
condition but awards are restricted for at least three years from the date of award. As a general rule awards made to participants who leave 
employment prior to vesting will lapse. In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they will receive their award in 
full. In the case of awards to executive directors and senior executives, the value of the shares over which an award may be granted under the 
plan shall be taken to form part of the annual bonus payable to that participant. Awards may also be granted under the plan to employees 
below the level of senior executives which do not form part of their annual bonus (for instance, on recruitment of the employee).
Sharesave Schemes
Atkins Sharesave Scheme (Sharesave)
A savings-related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three-year period, towards the purchase of 
shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted. The option price was set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time 
of grant. The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract; otherwise it lapses. Participants leaving for  
a qualifying reason have six months in which to use their savings to exercise their options on a pro-rated basis. This plan has now closed. 
The Group’s share-based payments charge for the year of £5.1m (2006: £3.0m) has been included in administrative expenses in the income 
statement. There is no charge in the Company (2006: £nil).
The effect of the share-based payment transactions on the Group’s result and financial position is as follows:

On 29 June 2006 the Group issued awards over 325,414 shares to employees under the Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) and 27,000 
awards to employees under the Atkins Restricted Stock Unit Plan (RSU). On 28 July 2006 the Group issued a further 1,168 awards to 
employees under the DBP. 
On 11 September 2006 the Group issued awards over 577,119 shares to employees under the Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  
On 28 November 2006 the Group issued awards over 41,100 shares to employees under the DBP. On 7 December 2006 the Group issued 
awards over 3,567 shares to employees under the DBP.
At 31 March 2007 the Group’s Employee Benefit Trusts held 3,251,358 shares (2006: 4,367,898 shares) at a nominal value of £0.0m  
(2006: £0.0m) and market value of £31.6m (2006: £35.6m).
For the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with market performance conditions, the Monte-Carlo model has been used to arrive at the  
share-based payments charge. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
     LTIP    LTIP
     2007  2006
RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE     N/A     5 %

– ALLOCATIONS     100% YEAR 4     100% YEAR 4
Volatility was determined based on the movement in the share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over 
which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history (2006: a two-year share price history). The fair value of 
share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte-Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group. In 2007 the 
comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts (2006: a group of 15 competitor companies). The model takes into 
account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of 
relative share performance. Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at date of award  
and discounted in the event that the award does not benefit from dividends during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 797.50p (2006: 477.81p). WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

The balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares in issue.
Merger reserve
The balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares 
issued in an acquisition made by shares where the Group took relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement  
to establish a share premium account.
Retained loss/earnings
The balance held in retained loss/earnings is the accumulated profits and losses of the Group. WS Atkins plc shares held by the EBTs are 
deducted from retained loss/earnings.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 amounting to £15.9m, of which positive and negative goodwill totalled £26.3m and £10.4m

and import duty guarantees issued on its behalf. The amount outstanding at 31 March 2007 was £80.6m (2006: £66.7m) including £44.3m 
in respect of Metronet (2006: £37.3m). During the year £25.0m of additional Letters of Credit were issued to Metronet whilst £18.0m of 
the original Letters of Credit under the Shareholder Agreement were released. This resulted in a net movement of £7.0m. The indemnities, 
which arose in the ordinary course of business, are not expected to result in any material financial loss. WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

38. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
In 2007, the UK government announced its intention to reduce the UK corporate income tax rate from 30 percent to 28 percent with effect from 
April 2008. As of 31 March 2007, the tax rate change was not substantively enacted. The deferred tax expense for 2007 would have decreased 
by approximately £0.2m and the effective tax rate by approximately 0.3 percent, had the change of nominal tax rate been substantively enacted 
as of the said date.
On 25 June 2007 contracts were exchanged for the disposal of LSH for an estimated consideration of £46.5m together with earn-out 
potential for a further £10m depending on LSH’s performance in the year ending 31 March 2008. The profit on disposal is estimated to  
be approximately £20m assuming that no additional payments are made in relation to the performance in the year ending 31 March 2008. 
39. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Included in the goodwill recognised above are items that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.  
These include new customers and synergy benefits.
The initial accounting for these acquisitions has been determined provisionally. Any adjustments to the accounting required following 
finalisation of the fair values to be assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities will be recorded from the acquisition date within 12 
months of the acquisition date. Additional goodwill of £0.7m was recognised for MSL Engineering Limited as a result of finalising the 
accounting for the business combination acquired on 31 March 2006.
Included in the Group’s results for the year is £0.6m profit before taxation and £0.4m profit after taxation in relation to the acquisitions 
above. If the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year then the Group’s results would have included £35.6m revenue, 
£2.3m profit before taxation and £1.6m profit after taxation for the year in relation to the acquisitions. Notes to the ﬁnancial statements

Investor relations website 
The Company’s investor relations website can be visited at  
http://ir.atkinsglobal.com. Many commonly asked investor 
questions are addressed under the shareholder services section.
E-communications
Shareholders can choose to receive company communications 
electronically. To register please visit our shareholder services portal 
at www.myatkinsshares.com.
Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
The Company offers a dividend reinvestment plan to shareholders 
as a cost-efficient way of increasing their shareholding in the 
Company. Should you wish to participate in the DRIP please 
contact the Registrar on 0870 162 3100 to request a mandate 
form and an explanatory booklet. Your completed mandate form 
must be received by the Registrar no later than 29 August 2007  
if you wish your final dividend for the year to be reinvested to buy 
additional shares.
Amalgamation of accounts
Shareholders who receive duplicate sets of Company mailings 
owing to multiple accounts in their name should write to the 
Registrar to have their accounts amalgamated.
Unsolicited mail
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register available 
to other organisations who may then use it for a mailing list.  
If you wish to limit the receipt of unsolicited mail you may do  
so by registering with the Mailing Preference Service (MPS). 
Registration can be made in writing to: The Mailing Preference 
Service (MPS), Freepost 29 LON20771, London W1E 0ZT or  
online at www.mpsonline.org.uk.
Gifting your shares to charity
If you only have a small number of shares whose value makes 
it uneconomic to sell them, you may wish to consider donating 
them to charity through ShareGift, an independent share donation 
scheme. The relevant share transfer form can be obtained from 
the Registrar. ShareGift is administered by the Orr Mackintosh 
Foundation, registered charity number 1052686. Further 
information may be obtained on +44 (0)20 7828 1151 or from 
www.ShareGift.org. 
Identity theft
Identity theft is on the increase. Criminals may steal your personal 
information, putting your Atkins shareholding at risk.
Tips for protecting your Atkins shares:
  Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your 
shares electronically in CREST via a nominee. 
  Keep all correspondence from the Registrar which shows 
your shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy 
correspondence by shredding. 
  If you change address inform the Registrar in writing or via our 
shareholder services portal. 
  Know when dividends are paid and consider having your dividend 
paid directly into your bank account. This will reduce the risk of 
the cheque being intercepted or lost in the post. If you change 
your bank account, inform the Registrar of the details of your 
new account. You can do this via post or online using our 
shareholder services portal. Respond to any letters the Registrar 
sends you about this.
  If you receive a letter from the Registrar regarding a 
change of address or a dividend instruction but have not 
recently moved or requested a change to how you receive 
your dividends please contact them immediately as you 
may have been a victim of identity theft.
  If you are buying or selling shares only deal with brokers 
registered in your country of residence or the UK.   01   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Environmental impact 
At Atkins we are genuinely concerned about 
our environmental performance. You can 
help us to reduce our environmental impact 
by opting to receive electronic versions of 
shareholder communications (e-comms).  
As well as the obvious “green” benefits, 
e-comms is also faster than the post.
Please visit www.myatkinsshares.com  
to sign up for e-comms. We will donate  
£1 to RedR (Register of Engineers for  
Disaster Relief) for each shareholder who 
chooses this method of communication. 
At our AGM this year we are seeking 
approval to communicate with our 
shareholders electronically, except  
where a shareholder specifically  
requests otherwise. Full details are  
contained in the notice of meeting.

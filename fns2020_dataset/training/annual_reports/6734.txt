Business Highlights In a demanding year Goldshield continues its development. As the Chief Executive reports in
detail, your Company has focused upon delivering a number of key near term business objectives
during the year. In this way Goldshield has created a platform for future growth. This success has
been achieved at a time when a considerable amount of management time has been absorbed by
the Department of Health case against the Company and the SFO case against both the Company
and two of its leading executives including the CEO.
Within the business we set a number of key objectives for the year; to maintain sales, to build our
cash reserves and to develop our strategy in India. All three have been achieved. As a result, our
prospects for the future look strong.
The SFO case has, ﬁnally, moved forward. While we continue to deny vigorously the SFO’s
allegations, Ajit Patel, Kirti Patel and the Company have now been charged. The next step is the
service of the prosecution case in mid-July 2006. This will be the ﬁrst opportunity that we have
had, to get a more detailed insight into the case put forward by the SFO. The legal costs
associated with both the SFO action and Department of Health claims are signiﬁcant and are
disclosed separately as exceptional items in the Income Statement and provided for where
appropriate. 
We have taken these allegations very seriously and have established an independent Board
subcommittee whose function is to consider the Company’s strategy and formal response at each
stage of the proceedings.
The Board is delighted to welcome Keith Hellawell as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman
designate. Keith’s impressive public sector experience as Chief Constable of Yorkshire and the
‘National Drugs Coordinator’ is supplemented by signiﬁcant main Board experience in large private
businesses. We look forward to beneﬁting from his experience on the main Board and Board
committees.

Chairman’s Overview 5
Introduction
It is my pleasure to report on the year ended 31 March 2006. I am delighted with the ﬁnancial
achievements during the year as well as progress made in operations and the future strategic
direction of the Group.
Our overall aims for the year were to maintain the current business, to build cash reserves and 
to develop new strategies to support future growth. This is the ﬁrst year that the company is
reporting in accordance with the new IFRS’s standards. For that reason, the sales and Proﬁt and
Loss accounts for previous years have been adjusted. In line with our aim for the year, I am
pleased to report that sales have been maintained at the same level as last year at £80.0 million.
Proﬁt before tax was ahead of last year at £6.8 million (2005: £4.5 million). Pre-exceptional
earnings before tax, amortisation and impairment losses (EBTA) were ahead of last year at £17.3
million (2005: £16.3 million). The exceptional costs for the year were £1.7 million (2005: £1.0
million). The net cash at the end of the year was £15.9 million (2005: £6.2 million).
Based on the results, I am pleased to announce that the Board is recommending a dividend of 5.1
pence (2005: 4.5 pence). The dividend paid during the year was 6.2 pence (2005: 4.0 pence).
In addition to maintaining and developing the current business, to be known as “Wellbeing
Products” and building cash reserves, a comprehensive review of strategic options for the future
has been completed. We have decided to extend the sphere of our activity and focus on the
market for Wellbeing services to include Wellbeing Clinics, Wellbeing Resorts and Wellbeing
Villages. These services are explained in more detail below.
The Indian economy is growing rapidly, attracting foreign direct investments at unprecedented
levels. India has been predicted to become the World’s third largest economy. Signiﬁcantly, for a
provider of healthcare services, the Indian population has a much younger age proﬁle than those of
the other large economies. With our managerial infrastructure now established in India, it makes
sense for us to concentrate our energies in this region over the next ﬁve years. Accordingly, the
overall strategy for the short to medium term will be to maintain the current Wellbeing Products
business. The initial wellbeing centres will be ﬁnanced from the Group’s existing cash ﬂows.
The last four years have been the most turbulent in our Group’s history. However, we are focusing
our resources on the business areas of the future. The Company still faces a number of
challenges; in particular we have to clear ourselves of the charges brought against the Company,
myself and Kirti Patel, by the Serious Fraud Ofﬁce. In relation to this matter, I am grateful for the
continuing support and conﬁdence shown by many shareholders as well as the Group Board
Directors. Despite these challenges, we remain conﬁdent that over the next few years the Group
will deliver signiﬁcant progress.
Operations
The emphasis during the year has been on maintaining the current business, building cash reserves
and evaluating our future options for growth. During the year we experienced failed transfers on
products earlier acquired from Wyeth. This resulted in a revenue loss in excess of £1.5 million. 
In our UK NHS business, we suffered an enforced price reduction of 7% from the Department of
Health (DoH). Despite these difﬁculties the overall sales for the year were similar to last year at
£80.0 million. Proﬁt before tax was ahead of last year at £6.8 million (2005: £4.5 million). Pre-
exceptional EBTA for the year was ahead of last year at £17.3 million (2005: £16.3 million).
The sales for our Hospitals business in Europe were £11.1 million (2005: £12.0 million), despite
loss of revenue resulting from product transfer failures. New product development has been slow
although three new products were launched during the period. One of which the Ranitidine
injection received immediate adoption via the tender system. On the other hand Autodetect and
Noseeze, two new medical devices will require more marketing and sales support to grow. Our
range of differentiated Bupivacaine epidural infusions have received DoH and NPSA endorsement
resulting in a large number of NHS trusts preparing to switch to our infusions. This should lead to
increased sales over the next few months.
The Retail Generics business recorded sales of £9.5 million as against £9.7 million last year. This
was achieved despite increased competition. Whilst volumes increased, the value and proﬁtability
declined. Going forward we will put less emphasis on volumes and greater emphasis on margins
which will result a reduction in sales revenue.
Chief Executive Officer’s Operating Review 6
Our European Retail Brands business, despite an enforced price reduction of 7% in the UK by the
DoH, has continued to deliver the expected results with sales of £32.3 million (2005: £30.9
million). Codipar, a key product has shown a steady rise in sales from £0.5 million to £1.8
million as a result of increased promotion throughout the year. Fenbid Gel range, Nitrofurantoin
Suspension, Fersamal Syrup and the Cytacon range have shown a positive growth. The launch of
Ostex, a high dose Glucosamine product in the second half of the year enhanced sales. The
Dispensing Doctor team has had another good year with sales increasing by 18%. 
Opportunities have been identiﬁed to bring some of the health food supplements into Retail
Pharmacy starting with Lubramine and Lubramine G in June 2006. Line extensions to the Mother
and Baby range are planned in the ﬁrst half of next year including our ﬁrst “device” product, the
Kamillosan baby soother thermometer, and Kamillosan nappy cream.
The North American Direct to Consumer businesses continue to be fairly ﬂat, however proﬁtability
has improved. We did marginally improve on the new customer recruitment front which has
helped stabilize the overall sales and proﬁtability. The market has become more generic in nature
and hence in the coming year we will spend time evaluating options for more branded products.
In India, where we are currently test marketing, the results have been mixed and it is too early to
comment.
Both the Country Distributor and the Third Party Services businesses continue to perform on
target. With increased resource allocation and new management teams in place, both these
businesses will see better performance during the next year or so. 
Our back ofﬁce operations in Mumbai, India are now well established. Going forward we will
maintain our regional head ofﬁce in Mumbai, which is the main commercial hub of India.
However to counteract rising inﬂation and costs that are occurring throughout India, we have
acquired more ofﬁce space in Goa for future expansion.
Future Developments
Our new initiative of building “Wellbeing Villages” across India is well under way. These villages
will cater for the Wellbeing of active people over the age of 50. Each village will have facilities
including a hospital, nursing home, restaurants, shops, along with sports and leisure amenities. 
It will also include a hotel for short stay visitors, residents’ friends and relatives. Various levels of
assistance, including domestic and nursing care will be available not just to residents of the village
but the wider community at large. Our target customers will include people from various
demographics both Indian and overseas. 
The land for the ﬁrst project, measuring over 1,000,000 square feet, has been acquired in South
Goa. The total project size, to be built in phases and subject to milestones, will be in excess of
750,000 square feet of built up area. The ﬁrst phase of over 250,000 square feet is expected to
complete before the end December 2007. 
Our aim is to build several of these Wellbeing Villages in various locations in India over the coming
years. Therefore we will commence a land acquisition programme during the next 12 months. 
The second initiative of building Wellbeing Centres across India has also commenced. The larger
Wellbeing Centres will be located in major population areas and will provide facilities to include
Health and Beauty, Homeopathic, Ayurvedic, Dental, Opthalmic, Skin, Diet, and Fitness related
services. Smaller clinics providing basic diagnostic services will strategically be located in smaller
towns and villages. 
The ﬁrst Wellbeing Centre is on target to open in Mumbai in the autumn of 2006. Based on
milestones, we expect to open a total of 24 centres and clinics in the next 36 months. The main
customer groups being targeted are corporate clients for their employees, families and local
communities and insurance companies for their clients. 
The last of the initiatives, Wellbeing Resorts, will target a new breed of medical tourist. Tourists
who are looking to combine holidays with medical services to save both time and cost. The land,
measuring about 810,000 square feet, to build the ﬁrst dedicated resort of its kind in India, has
been acquired in South Goa. This project is due to commence building by December 2006 and
the ﬁrst phase is expected to be completed by December 2007. It will house a Medical Centre,
Spa, a Hotel and Leisure Facilities. 
Chief Executive Officer’s Operating Review
(continued) 7
The ﬁrst phase of this project will provide 100 rooms with a total built up area of 150,000 square
feet with the capacity to build up to 500,000 square feet if required. The main target customers
will be European as well as wealthy Indians. Whilst wishing to take full advantage of the
opportunities within the rapidly growing Indian market your management is very conscious of the
risks of over expansion and will adopt a conservative ﬁnancing strategy. We will also seek to ensure
that the individual business models are established and viable before rolling out other sites.
As reported in my last review, we have undertaken a review of our product development. Whilst
this process is not entirely complete, we have reorganized the Group so that it is more marketing
driven. To that extent we are building a more marketing focused management team. We expect
this to be in place during 2006. Our aim is to develop more branded products with more “Fast
Moving Consumer Products” approach.
I would like to thank Peter Brown for his support and sound advice during his Chairmanship and
am pleased that he is able to continue to serve in a Non-Executive capacity. 
Current Trading and Prospects
The current business redeﬁned as, Wellbeing Products, is expected to perform at similar levels
during the next 12 months, with renewed focus on building brands. Signiﬁcant resources are now
being directed at the new initiatives whilst continuing to keep the cash ﬂow from current
business healthy.
The year ahead is very exciting and challenging. We have done extensive preliminary legal work
on both the SFO and the DoH cases in the last four years. The expected date of the hearing has
been delayed until 2008 and so we can now concentrate all our energies on building the Group’s
future and developing the new initiatives. 
Despite the difﬁculties of the past four years, all the members of the Board of your Company are
very excited about our new initiatives and their signiﬁcant prospects for growth.

Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group financial statements have been prepared under IFRS to the extent applicable for both,
its interim and annual results. Application of IFRS’s has necessitated restatement of certain key
parameters in the Income statement, Balance sheet and Cash flow statement and certain new
accounting policies have also been adopted.
Turnover
As expected the turnover for the year came in at £80.0 million (2005: £80.8 million).
Revenues in the UK and Western Europe were marginally lower at £71.0 million (2005: £72.5
million) primarily due to decrease in sales of healthcare products. 
Revenues in North America have remained consistent at £7.0 million (2005: £6.9 million). 
Service revenue in India has increased by 58% to £2.0 million (2005: £1.3 million) due to
increased billing from existing customers and the addition of new customers during the year.
Gross proﬁt
The Group’s gross profit for the year was £51.6 million (2005: £51.8 million). The gross margin
achieved was 64.5% (2005: 64.2%.)
Earnings and operating results
The Group Earnings Before Tax, Amortisation, Impairment and Exceptional costs was at £17.3
million (2005: £16.3 million). The reconciliation to the Group’s operating profit is given below:

Report of the Finance Director 9
Taxation 
The taxation charge of £2.9 million (2005: £4.0 million) represents an effective tax rate of
43.0% (2005: 89.5%). The effective tax rate is slightly higher than the standard rate as a result
of tax losses due to impairment losses and certain non deductible expenses.
Deferred tax credit included in the tax charge was £0.5 million (2005: Deferred tax charge of
£1.3 million).
Earnings and dividend
Basic earnings per share is 10.5 pence (2005: 1.3 pence) and the diluted earnings per share is
10.4 pence (2005: 1.3 pence)
The Directors propose a dividend of 5.1 pence per share (2005: 4.5 pence). 
The dividend paid during the year was 6.2 pence (2005: 4.0 pence). The proposed dividend will
be subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 9 August 2006, and is
expected to be paid on 18 August 2006 to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 28 July 2006.
Cash ﬂow and liquidity
During the year the Group generated £12.9 million from operating activities (2005: £13.7
million). The primary use of the operating cash was towards the payment of corporation tax and
dividends to shareholders. In addition the Group has paid £0.7 million for land and building
acquisitions in India (March 2005: £nil million).
As at 31 March 2006 the Group had liabilities in respect of deferred consideration payments due

the training and development of its employees through ‘on the job’ training and through staff
attending courses. This is a continuous process of training and all staff regularly attend courses on
communication, planning, decision making and problem solving. In addition managers attend
courses and ‘on the job’ training on staff development, motivation, recruitment, appraisals and team
building. The Group also encourages staff to take vocational courses. 
The Group encourages all of its employees to participate in its growth and welcomes staff input at
all levels. The Group is also operating a well deﬁned performance pay scheme which is fair,
equitable, transparent and acts as a strong motivation to its staff.
Information about the Group’s activities is regularly communicated through notices and staff
meetings.
Employee sharesave scheme
An employee sharesave scheme is open to all eligible employees. Under the terms of the scheme
the Directors may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to employees who
enter into an Inland Revenue approved sharesave contract. The price of each share option was at a
discount of 20% from the market price at the date of granting the options. Options may normally
be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the sharesave contract.
Share options
During the year the Directors granted share options to employees. Details of these are set out in note
12 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Details of the Directors’ Share Options are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 24.
Charitable and political donations
Donations to charitable organisations amounted to £100,692 (2005: £28,236).
Donations to political organisations amounted to £nil (2005: £nil).

Substantial shareholders
As at 17 May 2006 the Company has been advised of the following holdings, in addition to those of
the Directors disclosed above, of 3% or more of the nominal value of the Company’s shares:
Name Shareholding %
Schroder Investment Management Limited 9,590,475 25.8%
Halifax Share Dealing Services 3,164,005 8.5%
Hermes Assured Limited 2,778,368 7.5%
Barclays Global Investors 2,396,615 6.5%
Axa Rosenberg 1,388,429 3.7%
Legal & General 1,329,919 3.6%
Payment policy and practice
It is the Group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the
transaction to ensure that suppliers are aware of these terms. In general the trading terms entered
into are payment at the end of the month following the month of invoice. Trade creditors due at the
year end amount to 45 days purchases (2005: 47 days).
Research and development
Details of research and development expenditure are shown in the Report of the Finance Director on
page 8 under research and development expenditure.
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP offer themselves for re-appointment as auditors in accordance with Section
385 of the Companies Act 1985.
Annual General Meeting
It is proposed that the next AGM be held on 9 August 2006, at 10.30 am, notice of which is set
out on pages 63 to 65. In addition to the proposed resolutions to receive the Report and Accounts,
declare a dividend, re-appoint Directors in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, to
appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as Auditors and to authorise the Directors to ﬁx the Auditors’
remuneration; and to approve the Remuneration Report, it is proposed that the following business
be transacted:
Directors’ authority to allot securities (Resolution 11 – Ordinary resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. The effect of resolution 11 is to
grant to the Directors authority to allot new securities limited to a maximum amount of £619,000
representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 31 March 2006
(being the date of the Company’s last Annual Accounts). This renewed authority would remain in
force for 15 months from the passing of the resolution or, if earlier, the next AGM.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights (Resolution 12 – Special resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. Under the Companies Act 1985,
shareholders have “rights of pre-emption” in relation to the issue of equity securities. This means
that if new shares in the Company are to be offered for subscription for cash they must ﬁrst be
offered to the existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings at the time of such offer. The
Companies Act requires that the Directors seek the approval of the shareholders if they wish to
disapply these rights. The Directors are seeking authority to disapply pre-emption rights over
1,856,331 equity securities, representing approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 31 March 2006. This renewed authority would remain in force for 15 months from
the passing of the resolution or, if earlier, the next AGM.
Report of the Directors
(continued) 15
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares (Resolution 13 – Special resolution)
The Directors are seeking to renew the authority for the Company to purchase in the open market up
to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company. The Company undertakes that it will, if the
resolution is passed, only exercise such authority to buy back its own shares if such purchase would
have the effect of increasing the earnings per share and if they believed that to do so would be in
the best interests of the shareholders generally. If the resolution is passed the Company will be
authorised to buy in one transaction or any number of transactions an aggregate maximum of
3,712,661 shares, representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as
at 22 June 2006 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of AGM). 
The maximum price the Company will be permitted to pay will be equal to 5% above the average
middle market quotations for the ﬁve business days preceding the transaction and the minimum
price will be 5 pence (being the nominal value of the shares).
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 22 June 2006 was
2,351,890, representing approximately 6.3% of the issued share capital of the Company at such
date. If the authority to purchase shares were to be exercised in full, the total number of options to
subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 22 June 2006 would represent 2.8% of the issued
share capital (assuming no other further ordinary shares were issued after that date).

Corporate Governance Report
Application of principles
The Group is committed to applying the best principles of Corporate Governance. The Group has applied
the principle of Good Governance contained in the Combined Code to the extent they are consistent with
its size. The Compliance Statement is given under the Combined Code 2003 (the FRC Code).
Compliance statement
The Company has complied throughout the year with the Code provisions set out in section 1 of the
Combined Code with the following exceptions:
During the year under review the company only had a single independent non-executive director and
two members of the audit committee and remuneration committee, one of whom is the Chairman and
was therefore in breach of provisions of A.3.2, B.2.1 and C.3.1. However, the Company has since
appointed a third non-executive director on 15 May 2006 thereby complying with the above provisions.
For the said appointment we conducted a search through an external agency. 
While the Board has introduced a scientiﬁc process of evaluating the performance of the Executive
Directors with an appropriate performance pay scheme with reference to the proﬁt and loss account of
different Business and Operation Units under their respective control, it is yet to introduce a process for
evaluating the performance of the Committees and Independent directors (provision A.6.1). It is
intending to work towards introducing an appropriate evaluation process.
Board composition
The Company is controlled through its Board of Directors. The Board comprises the non-executive
chairman and two other non-executive directors (whom the Board considers to be independent), the
chief executive and four executive directors. The Board’s main roles are to create value to shareholders,
to approve the Company’s strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and other
resources are made available to enable them to meet those objectives. Speciﬁc responsibilities reserved
to the Board include: setting Group strategy, reviewing operational and ﬁnancial performance, approving
major acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure; approving appointments to the Board and the
Company Secretary, approving policies relating to Director’s remuneration and the severance of
Directors’ contracts; and ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue takes place with shareholders.
The executive directors of the Board are:
Ajit R Patel
Kirti V Patel
Rakesh V Patel
Ajay M Patel
Mike Reardon
All the above executive directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three years and at the
ﬁrst AGM after appointment. 
The non-executive directors are Ken Pelton, Dr. Keith Hellawell and Peter Brown, who is also Chairman
of the Group.
Ken Pelton, the Senior independent non-executive director, has been associated with the Group for more
than 9 years and therefore submits himself for annual re-election in accordance with good corporate
governance principles. Although this length of service does not meet one of the criteria for Director
Independence under the Code, the Board considers that Ken Pelton meets all the other criteria and the
Chairman is satisﬁed that he acts as an independent and effective Director.
Peter Brown, is over 70 years old and therefore retires and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election
at the Annual General Meeting.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Dr. Keith Hellawell, who was appointed by the Board on
15 May 2006, retires, and being eligible, offers himself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Board met seven times during the year under review. At each meeting the Board receives reports
from the chief executive, the ﬁnance director, other directors and senior management as required.
The Board has four Committees, whose terms of reference can be inspected by prior arrangement at
Goldshield’s ofﬁce in Croydon. 17

from those of the Chief Executive, A R Patel and K V Patel who are charged as individuals. The
Warfarin Working Party is responsible for the selection of legal advisers to represent the Company in
both the civil and criminal cases and these advisers cannot represent any of the Directors as
individuals.
Audit Committee
Ken Pelton (Chairman)
Peter Brown
Dr. Keith Hellawell (w.e.f. 15 May 2006)
The Audit Committee’s duties include reviewing the external audit arrangements, including the scope,
results and cost effectiveness of the audit, any changes in accounting policies and procedures, the
judgmental decisions affecting ﬁnancial reporting, compliance with accounting standards and with the
Companies Act and considering the Auditors’ comments on internal controls and management’s
response. The Audit Committee monitors the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by
the Auditors to ensure their independence and objectivity is maintained. 
Audit Committee meetings are also attended by invitation by representatives of the Group’s auditors,
the Company Secretary and the Finance Director. The Committee considers the Group’s annual and
interim ﬁnancial statements and any questions raised by the auditors on the statements and
ﬁnancial systems.
During the year, the Audit Committee met four times and reviewed the Group’s draft ﬁnancial
statements and interim results statement prior to Board approval and considered the external
auditors’ detailed reports thereon. The Committee also reviewed the performance of the in-house
internal audit function.
The Group’s auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP , provide some non-audit services. The majority of
non-audit work are compliance services on the various taxation issues within the Group, and do not
compromise their independence as auditors. The level of non-audit fees (which are less than the
audit fees) are reviewed annually by the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
Peter Brown (Chairman)
Ken Pelton
Dr. Keith Hellawell (w.e.f. 15 May 2006)
The Remuneration Committee met twice in the ﬁnancial year and determined the Directors’
remuneration and the issue of share options. None of the Committee members have any personal
ﬁnancial interest in the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), nor potential conﬂicts of
interest arising from cross-directorships nor any day to day involvement in the running of the
business. The Committee consults with the Board about its proposals and has access to
professional advice from inside and outside the Group.

Shareholder relations
The Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director meet and telephone institutional
shareholders to discuss the Group’s strategy and ﬁnancial performance. Efforts are made to keep
shareholders informed through analysts’ meetings, road shows and soundings taken from individual
shareholders as and when required.
All shareholders can gain access to information about the Group, including the annual report,
through the Goldshield website www.goldshieldplc.com.
Risk management and internal controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls. The intent
is to manage risk rather than eliminate it and controls cannot provide an absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s systems of internal controls are as follows:
• Control environment: short and direct lines of responsibility are designed to ensure that business
risks are communicated for prompt review. The performance of each business unit is reviewed at
regular monthly meetings. The full Board also reviews the same at regular Board meetings held at
least six times each year. A period of at least ﬁve days each year is set aside for strategic planning
and assessment of risks affecting the Group attended by senior managers from all parts of the
Group. In addition, a meeting of Unit Heads is held at least two times in a year, when matters of
strategic importance are discussed with speciﬁc emphasis on training and development.
• Operating procedures: key ﬁnancial controls are documented as operating procedures setting out
responsibilities and ﬁnancial authority levels.
• Budgeting: a comprehensive budgeting procedure is followed by business units. The CEO presents
an annual forecast at Group Level for discussion and agreement by the Board.
Corporate Governance Report

Corporate Governance Report
(continued)
• Information systems: the Group’s accounting systems are backed up and scaleable to meet
business needs. Sufﬁcient precautions are taken to retain the processed data in an off-site
location, which forms part of the disaster recovery program followed by the company.
A regular review takes place with the Company’s insurance brokers to assess the adequacy of the
Group’s insurance cover in the face of operational and other risks of the business.
The Board fully recognises the importance of adopting appropriate risk and control measures. The
Audit Committee has reviewed the annual report from the in-house internal audit function and is
satisﬁed with the scope and quality of audit work taken up in different areas of operational controls.
Some aspects of the internal audit programme are on going and these will be covered in the current
ﬁnancial year.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. An explanation of
the Group’s cash ﬂow position at 31 March 2006 is set out in the Report of the Finance Director. Goldshield is committed to being a socially responsible corporate citizen.
Environment
Common sense measures to save energy and ﬁnite resources are taken where practicable; in
particular relating to controlled use of energy, paper and other resources. The Board does not
consider it appropriate to implement a detailed environmental policy for its activities given that it
does not itself manufacture products. The Board does however share current concerns on
environmental issues and will where possible ensure that its activities are carried out in an
environment friendly manner.
Health and safety
The Board aims to take due and proper care of risks to the health, safety and welfare of its
employees; taking account of the differences that apply to legislative requirements in the different
countries where it operates. Particular attention is paid to ﬁre drills and other safety procedures in
establishments operated by the Group.
Ethics
The Group has policies on business practices, receipt of gifts, use of the internet and whistleblowing.
The Group realises that its reputation depends on adopting ethical and socially responsible
procedures and will encourage adoption of employment, health and safety and other appropriate
procedures to meet this objective.
Employment
The Group employs over 859 employees worldwide based in the United Kingdom, India, Ireland and
the USA. Our success depends on the skills and attitude of our employees. Our human resource
strategies are aimed at ensuring that employees are trained to be competent to fulﬁl their roles and
with an opportunity to develop to their full potential. Emphasis is placed on sharing knowledge for
the beneﬁt of employees and the Group.
The Group operates in an international market and we believe it is important for all employees to be
treated with dignity and respect. Decisions relating to recruitment, development, promotion and
training of individual employees are based on an objective assessment of skills and attitudes and job
requirements. To this end a system of 360 degree appraisals is already in place to supplement the
existing one to one appraisal procedures.
Community involvement
Employees are encouraged to make contributions to charities and other community causes and
collections are regularly made for charitable purposes. Goldshield donated drugs amounting to
£79,027 of Antigen and Goldshield Products which were supplied to the WHO in Islamabad for the
relief effort in the Kashmir earthquake zone.

Corporate Social Responsibility 21
Directors’ remuneration
The Group recognises that Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders 
and is committed to following current best practice. 
Section 1: Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee
Main Board Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Committee, which also has an overview
of incentive payments and option issues to other members of the Company.
None of the Committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest in the matters to be decided other than
as shareholders, potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross directorships or any day-to-day
involvement in the running of the business. The Committee invites the Chief Executive and other
Executives to attend its meetings when it is appropriate to get their advice on the issues under review.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Peter Brown the Chairman of the Company.
Policy on Directors’ remuneration
The Committee aims to ensure that Directors’ remuneration is fair and in line with market rates 
in somewhat similar companies. Incentive schemes are designed to provide rewards for achieving
objectives that will increase shareholder value. 
There are three elements to the remuneration package:
• Basic annual salary and pension contributions
• Share option incentives
• Cash bonuses
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually by the committee which takes into
account salary levels of comparable companies. Salaries were last reviewed in June 2006 when it
was decided to give average increases to executive directors of 7.1%.
It is the Committee’s general strategy to pay salaries at or slightly below median levels with
increased remuneration coming from cash bonuses and the increase in value of the options held
by each Executive Director.
Executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s share option scheme and options
are granted at the discretion of the Remuneration committee. Share options issued to directors are
exercisable subject to meeting performance criteria with regard to growth in EPS and Turnover.
In establishing salary and bonus levels the Company considers the average remuneration packages
paid by all the listed UK companies with similar market capitalisations in the pharmaceutical and
healthcare sectors.
During the year 50,000 additional options were granted to M J Reardon.
Non-executive directors remuneration is set by the Board as a whole. All Non-executive Directors
are subject to six month notice provision. Their remuneration is shown in the table on page 23.
We have been asked by shareholders to give specific information on the following points: 
There is no minimum shareholding requirement for any director, although we obviously encourage
directors to buy shares in addition to any option entitlements.
The performance criteria for Executive Directors’ bonuses are meeting or exceeding the profit budgets
of the units for which they are responsible under our de-centralised management style.
For the Chief Executive they are meeting or exceeding the EBITDA and profit expectations in the
Company’s business plan and the market. The Remuneration Committee have discretion to vary,
increase or decrease bonuses that are mechanistically produced by these formulas.
The cap on the total options in issue is 10% of issued equity provided the excess over 5% are
issued as Super five years before encashment options, with very demanding performance conditions,
none have been issued to date. The size of any Executive’s option holding is 4 x salary in normal
and up to 8 x salary in Super options.
If there is a change of control, share options become encashable and compensation payments for
loss of office for all main Board Directors are nine, rather than six months; significantly less than the
twelve months that is standard for most UK quoted plc groups.
Directors’ Remuneration Report 22
Directors’ Remuneration Report
(continued)
Remuneration strategy throughout the Group
As shareholders realise a very high percentage of the management team now operate out of
Mumbai. The Chief Executive’s strategy with the support of the Remuneration Committee is to
ensure that support departments and sales units operate as if they were independent entities with
performance schemes structured for the delivery of commercial targets. This strategy is beginning
to work as managers used to a more generalised incentive structure begin to realise that decisions
concerning their individual operations make a very big difference to the potential bonus available
at the end of the year.
Main Board performance payments are decided by the Committee based upon the overall
performance of the Company and the achievement of targets by units answering to that director.
The Company contributes to Executive Directors’ money-purchase pension plans and provides a
range of health insurance beneﬁts for directors. Our normal retirement age is 60. The Company’s
contracts of service or letters of appointment are for a six monthly renewable period which is
rather shorter than the one year maximum required by the Combined Code.

Equity incentives for Directors and employees
The Company has three share option schemes:
• The ‘existing scheme’
Share options granted to employees prior to the ﬂotation of the Company.
• The ‘unapproved scheme’
The ‘unapproved scheme’ was introduced at the time of listing in 1998. Under this scheme
options have been granted to Executive Directors and other employees.
• Employee sharesave scheme
The Company established an Inland Revenue approved savings related sharesave scheme 
in 1998. These options are capable of exercise after either three, five or seven years at the
employees’ choice on the date of entering the contract.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
(continued) 26
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and UK generally accepted accounting principles.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the 
proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Group will continue in the business
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities and to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report includes information required by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
A copy of the financial statements of the Group is placed on the Goldshield website. 
The maintenance and integrity of the website is the responsibility of the directors and the work
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters. Accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occured to the financial statements since
they were initially presented on the website.
In so far as the directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware;
and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of
any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 27
We have audited the Group financial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year ended 
31 March 2006 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity,
and notes 1 to 25. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Goldshield Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2006 and the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,
whether the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors,
Secretary and Advisors, the Business Highlights, Chairman’s Overview, Chief Executive Officer’s
Operating Review, Report of the Finance Director, Five Year Review, Directors, Report of the
Directors, Corporate Governance Report, Corporate Social Responsibility and the unaudited part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of
the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
Report of the Independent Auditor on the
consolidated financial statements to the 
Members of Goldshield Group plc 28
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of its profit
for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements for the
year ended 31 March 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in Note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with
its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with
the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs,
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These are the
Groups first IFRS consolidated financial statements and IFRS 1 - First - time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS 1) has been applied. 
The date of transition to IFRS for the Group was 1 April 2004. A summary of the accounting policies applied in the preparation
of financial statements is given below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless
otherwise stated. The impact of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS is explained in note 25 to the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The Group has applied IFRS 1, which requires full retrospective application of all applicable accounting standards, but
exemptions are permitted in specific areas.
The Group has elected to make use of the following exemptions:
Business combinations
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 April 2004.
Share - based payment transactions
The Group has applied IFRS 2 - Share Based Payment, retrospectively to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002
and vesting on or after 1 January 2005.
Cumulative translation differences
Translation differences on the re-translation of foreign operations that arose prior to the date of transition have been deemed to
be zero. 
An explanation of how the transition to IFRSs has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows
of the Group is provided in note 25. This note includes reconciliations of equity and profit or loss for comparative periods reported
under UK GAAP to those reported for those periods under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
the basis of mandatory IFRS’s in issue at the Group’s first IFRS annual reporting date, 31 March 2006. It should be noted that
accounting estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ than those estimated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March
2006. Profits or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired
during the year have been included from the date of acquisition. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and
liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at the fair values reflecting their condition at that date. Goodwill
arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired, is capitalised net of any provision for impairment.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received/receivable by the Group for
goods supplied and services provided, excluding value added tax and trade discounts. Revenue from services rendered is
recognised in the income statement by reference to the stage of completion of transactions at the balance sheet date. The stage
of completion is determined by the man days spent on the project for rendering the service at the end of each billing cycle.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method and goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions of
subsidiaries. In respect of business combinations that have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference
between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts at 31 March 2004. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is no longer amortised but tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Other intangible assets 
Externally purchased product licenses, trademarks, brand-names, know-how and similar intangible items are capitalised at
historical cost, net of any provision for impairment and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic
lives which range between seven and ten years. The amortisation cost has been included within administrative expenses in the
income statement.
Impairment
The Group’s goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is based on internal discounted cash - flow evaluation. If at the balance sheet date there is any indication that an impairment
loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the
asset is reflected at the recoverable amount. 34
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the costs
are separately identifiable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Capitalised development costs are
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. All other research and development expenditure is written
off to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less the accumulated depreciation on the same. Depreciation is charged on a
straight line basis over the estimated useful lives on the cost of the assets less their residual value. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:
Freehold buildings and
leasehold improvements - 25 Years or over the period of lease
Office equipment - 5 Years
Plant and equipment - 6 to 7 Years
Motor vehicles - 5 Years
Residual values are re-assessed annually.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories are valued using the weighted average
price method.
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and / or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current
or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws
applicable to the fiscal periods to which they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences. This involves comparison of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business
combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when asset is realised or the
liability is settled, based on tax rates (tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. All
changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where
they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as translation reserve and pre 7 November 2002 grants
of share options) in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity. 
Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred
tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be recognised and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit
will be realised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme whereby contributions are made to individual employee pension plans
of certain employees. These costs are charged against profits in respect of the accounting period in which they are paid.
Indian Gratuity costs, which represent a form of long term service benefits are accrued based on actuarial valuation at the balance
sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary.
Leased assets
All leased assets are identified as operating leases if they do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards to the lessee.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of 
the lease.
Foreign currencies
The reporting currency for these financial statements is GB sterling (£) which is the parent company’s functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign entity are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
All assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet
date. The results of foreign operations have been converted into Group’s reporting currency at the actual rates over the reporting
period and the exchange differences arising have been taken to translation reserve, a component of equity. The exchange
differences arising from re-translation of the net investments in subsidiaries are directly taken to translation reserve. All other
exchange differences are dealt with through the income statement.

Share options
For all employee share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vesting on or after 1 January 2005, an expense is recognised
in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity. The equity share based payment is measured at the fair value at
the grant date using the binomial lattice method. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated
over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.
Provisions - Legal and other disputes
Provision is made where a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of legal or other disputes against the Group. In
addition, provision is made for legal and other expenses arising from claims received or other disputes. No provision is made for
other possible claims or where an obligation exists but it is not possible to make a reliable estimate. Costs associated with claims
made by the Group against third party are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
Dividends
Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet dates are not recognised as a liability. However the amounts of such
dividends are disclosed in the financial statements.
Segmental reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business
segment) or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographic segment) which is subject
to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual terms of the instrument.
- Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair values as reduced to equal the estimated present value of
the future cash flows.
- Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of instrument to the extent that
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
- Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair values.
- Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
2. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments, which
are the primary basis of segment reporting. The business segment-reporting format reflects the Group’s management and internal
reporting structure.
Primary - Business segments
The Group is organised into five major business units – Retail Brands, Retail Generics, Hospitals, Direct to Consumer Western
Europe (D2C WE) and, Direct to Consumer North America (D2C NA). Certain small business units like Country Distributors,
Global Services and Management Services constitute the other segments. These units form the basis for the Group’s reporting of
primary segment information.
Secondary - Geographical segments
The geographical segments are considered for disclosure as secondary segment. Geographical revenues are segregated based on
the location from which the revenues are generated.
Assets are identified to the segment on the basis of their place of use.
Segment results
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
All inter-segment transfers are priced and carried out at arm’s length. 
Segment assets and liabilities
Segment assets include all operating assets used by a segment and consist principally of operating cash, debtors and fixed assets,
net of allowances and provisions which are reported as direct offsets in the balance sheet. Segment liabilities include all operating
liabilities and consist principally of creditors and accrued liabilties.
Segment assets and liabilities do not include deferred income taxes.
Unallocated segment income and expenses.
Unallocated segment income comprises interest income and miscellaneous receipts not directly attributable to any particular
segment. Unallocated segment expenditure represents interest on loans and provision for income taxes, which cannot be directly
attributed to any segment.

Hospitals 7,090 7,033
D2C North America 2,280 3,183
Regina 867 1,092
10,237 11,308
The recoverable amounts for the cash generating units given above are determined based on internal discounted cash-flow
evaluation. The cash flow evaluation is based on actual operating results and five year forecasts at the growth rates stated in the
key assumptions.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued) 41
The key assumptions are:
Growth rates 2006 2005
Hospitals Constant Constant
D2C North America 4% 11%
Regina 7% 10%
Discount rates 2006 2005
Hospitals 8% 10%
D2C North America 8% 10%
Regina 8% 10%
The management assumes the Hospitals, D2C NA and Regina units to continue to earn the current level of profit margins and
achieve year on year sales growth as assumed in the five year forecasts. 
The growth rate assumed for the Regina business is based on the past trends and also supported by new marketing initiatives
undertaken to promote the brand. 
The US business expects to achieve its growth due the organisational restructuring undertaken, new product launches and
development of additional marketing channels. 
The growth rate for the Hospitals business is assumed to be constant based on past experiences. 
The discounting rate applied for the impairment review workings is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the Group.
Based on the current performance levels and achievement of key assumptions in the forecast of D2C NA and the Regina business
the management considers it appropriate to recognise the impairment charge.
The related goodwill impairment loss of £1,372,594 (2005: £4,623,010) is included under "Impairment losses" in the Income
statement. The amount attributed to D2C North America unit is £1,147,851 (2005: £4,499,684) and Regina unit is £224,743
(2005: £123,326).

As at 31 March 2006, the Group maintained two share- based payment schemes: 
Goldshield Group plc unapproved scheme
The unapproved share options scheme is administered by the Group. Options are granted to employees during their tenure of
service and these can be exercised until expiry of 10 years from the date of grant, provided the employee continues to remain
in service at the earliest exercise date. The options are exercisable based on the achievement of performance criteria with regards
to growth in Earnings per share and Turnover. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider any exception in
meeting the performance criteria when the options are exercised.
Goldshield Group plc sharesave scheme
The scheme allows all eligible employees to benefit from the growth of the Company through savings deducted directly from pay,
tax-free bonuses and a right to purchase Goldshield Group plc shares in the future but at a fixed price, which does not exceed
the middle market value of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the issue of this invitation. The approved
sharesave scheme has option exercise terms of 3,5 or 7 years. The sharesave scheme can be exercised for 6 months only after
the 3,5 or 7 year maturity dates.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2006 have an exercise price in the range of 126 pence to 871 pence and a weighted
average contractual life of 5.26 years.
282,804 additional options were granted during 2005. The fair values of options granted during 2005 were determined using
the Binomial Lattice valuation model. The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year was 107 pence.
Significant inputs into the calculation include a weighted average share price of 270 pence and exercise prices as illustrated above.
Furthermore, the calculation takes into account future dividends of 6 pence and a volatility rate of 45%, based on expected share
price. It is assumed that 3 and 5 year share save options are held for 3 and 5 years respectively ie. the durations of the savings
contracts, because the bonus is paid then and the employee has cash tied up. For employee stock options it is assumed that 3 year
options will be held for 5 years and that 5 year options will be held for 6 years. Both could be held for longer before expiry, but on
average employees are likely to seek liquidity or leave the company before the full term. Risk-free interest rate was determined at
5%. The underlying expected volatility was based upon calculation of historic volatility during the period 2002-2004.

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares
and the post tax effect of dividends, on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Lease payments recognised as an expense during the period amount to £1,064,700 (2005: £946,452). No sublease income 
is expected as all assets held under lease agreements are used exclusively by the Group.
All operating lease agreements do not contain any contingent rent clauses.
The office buliding in India has a renewal option and escalation clause for lease rentals. Apart from the India office building,
none of the operating lease agreements contain renewal options or escalation clauses.
The Company did not have any financial leases at 31 March 2006 (31 March 2005: nil).
20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses financial instruments, comprising cash, short term borrowings, trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise
directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
Short term debtors and creditors
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures except those relating to currency risk. The
Group’s trade and other receivables are actively monitored to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank facilities. Bank borrowings are made using
variable interest rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash
assets safely and profitably.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities and short/medium term borrowings.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn facilities available of £500,000 expiring within one year (2005: £250,000).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. In relation to translation risk the proportion of assets
held in the foreign currency are matched to an appropriate level of borrowings in the same currency. Transaction exposures are
hedged when known, mainly using the forward exchange hedge market.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposures using a variety of financial instruments, with the objective of minimising the impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and cash flows.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries operating in Ireland where reserves and expenses are denominated in Euros. The Group has
funded the acquisition cost and working capital by a Euro loan. As the Group receives net cash inflows in Euros this loan is being
reduced and replaced, as necessary, by funding denominated in Sterling.
£20.1 million (2005: £19.1 million) of the sales of the Group’s business is to customers in continental Europe/foreign markets
excluding North American operations. The majority of these sales are invoiced in the currencies of the customers involved. The
Group policy is to minimise all currency exposures on any balance not expected to mature within 30 days of its arising through
the use of forward currency contracts. All other sales of UK business are denominated in sterling. 
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
local currency.

23. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Indemnities and guarantees
The Group has given indemnities in respect of advance payments, deferred purchase consideration and import duty 
guarantees issued on its behalf in the normal course of business. The indemnities given at 31 March 2006 were £329,198 
(2005: £331,540).
Irish operations
On 28 November 2001 the Group acquired the sales, marketing and distribution rights for the Antigen brand from Antigen
Holdings Limited. The companies and assets were acquired at an estimated cost of £9.4 million. The estimated consideration
was to be settled in two parts, firstly by the payment of £5.2 million and secondly by an obligation to discharge the scheme of
arrangement liabilities of the acquired Antigen companies. The Directors obtained legal opinion that the Group’s exposure to the
debts covered by the scheme was restricted to the debts borne by the companies it acquired.
On 29 October 2002, Miza Ireland Limited and each of its Irish subsidiaries, parties to the wider scheme of arrangement, were
placed into examinership. During the prior year the liquidator of Miza Ireland Limited claimed the sum of ∆ 20.8 million although
no grounds for the claim have been specified in detail. Liability for the claim has been denied. The Directors have received legal
opinion that no basis for claim has been presented by the liquidator which could result in a liability on the part of the company
and that the subsidiaries concerned have grounds for defending the claim.
On the 2 November 2005, the liquidator of Miza Ireland Limited served High Court proceedings against the Group (and other
defendants) for the above-said claim and the claim is being defended with the help of our solicitors.
Serious Fraud Ofﬁce (SFO) Investigation
On 10 April 2002 the Group's premises and those of the Chief Executive were visited by the SFO and certain documentation
taken away. A press statement issued by the SFO stated that its operations formed part of an investigation into suspected
conspiracy to defraud the National Health Service (NHS) concerning the prices charged for penicillin based antibiotics and
Warfarin between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2000.
The Directors do not believe the Group has acted in an unlawful or improper manner, nor has it at any time conspired to defraud
the NHS and no provision has been made accordingly. Two of the Company Directors - Ajit Patel and Kirti Patel were interviewed
by the SFO in March and April 2005 and the company continues to provide co-operation in the conduct of the enquiry.
In April 2006, the SFO framed formal charges against the company and two of the Company Directors which are being defended.
Legal and professional costs in this matter have been expensed as incurred.
Department of Health (DoH) and related claims
On 20 December 2002, the DoH issued a legal claim against the Group and three other companies (Norton Healthcare Limited,
Norton Pharmaceuticals Limited and Regent GM Laboratories Limited) amounting to £28.6 million for alleged anti-competitive
practices involving the fixing of selling prices and controlling the market and production of Warfarin between January 1997 and
September 2000.
The Directors believe the Group is free from wrong-doing in respect of these allegations. A defence has been filed. 
Similar claims has been received from the Scottish Health Authorities and the Department of Health and Social Services and
Public Safety for Northern Ireland claiming damages of around £3.3 million and £1.0 million respectively. The Group vigorously
denies any liability for this claim.
The information required by IAS 37 is not disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of the
litigation. The Directors are of the opinion that the claim can be successfully resisted and the expected legal and professional
costs for this action have been provided for.
24. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
The Group test annually the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles for any possible impairment in accordance with the
accounting policy statement in Note 1. The achievement of the growth and profitability by the individual cash generating units
is critical in substantiating the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
Legal and other disputes
The Group faces ongoing litigation issues for claims against it, the same detailed in Note 23 on contingent liabilities. The Group
continues to vigorously deny any liabilities from these claims but the outcome of these legal issues and any resulting financial
implications could have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

25. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION OF IFRSs
As stated in note 1, these are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March
2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and in preparation
of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2004 (the Group’s date of transition). 
IFRS 1 requires full retrospective application of all applicable accounting standards, but exemptions are permitted in specific
areas. The Group has elected to avail of the exemptions pertaining to business combinations, share-based payment transactions
and recognition of cumulative translation differences.
An explanation of how the the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group’s financial position, financial performance
and cash flows is set out in the accompying notes:

Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
a) Under UK GAAP goodwill arising on business combinations was amortised on a straight - line basis over its estimated
economic life which ranged between seven and ten years. Under IFRS Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and not amortised. The Group has elected
not to apply IFRS 3 - Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to IFRS adoption. The effect of the
above adjustments is to add back the amortisation charge (administrative expenses) by £1,342,329 as on 31 March 2005. As
a result of the above the carrying value of Goodwill is increased by £1,344,004 as on 31 March 2005. The difference is because
of conversion of results at the average exchange rate and balance sheet items at closing rate.
b) Licenses related to acquired pharmaceutical products categorised as Goodwill under UK GAAP have been reclassified and
transferred to Brand Names, Know-How, Licenses and Trademarks (Other intangibles) there-by increasing the carrying value of
Brand Names, Licenses and Trademarks by and correspondingly reducing the carrying value of Goodwill by £5,675,274 as on
1 April 2004. The effect for 31 March 2005 is reclassification of amortisation by £740,444 respectively. This will have no effect
on retained earnings.
c) The Group applied IFRS 2- Share Based Payment, to all share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vesting on or after
1 January 2005. Under UK GAAP, the Group followed a policy of valuing the options at the difference between exercise price
and the market value at the date of grant and accruing the same over the period to which the benefit relates. Under IFRS 2 
the fair value is estimated by employing the binomial model. The resultant charges to the profit and loss account of the respective
periods under administrative expenses is £71,587 as on 31 March 2005 and correspondingly an increase in equity by the 
same amount.
d) Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were accrued in the accounting period to which they related. Under IAS 10 - Events
after Balance Sheet Date, dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are declared or approved by
shareholders. Under UK GAAP a provision for the dividend made was £1,668,185 as on 31 March 2005 and £925,443 as on
1 April 2004. The dividends as on respective closing dates were not declared or approved by the shareholders and as a result
the accrual for dividend is reversed in each respective periods.

We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year
ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the balance sheet, statement of total recognised gains and
losses, and notes 1 to 14. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year
ended 31 March 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report
and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and
fair view, whether the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors'
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial
statements.  We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited parent company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors,
Secretary and Advisors, Business Highlights, Chairman’s Overview, Chief Executive Officer’s
Operating Review, Report of the Finance Director, Five Year Review, Directors, Report of the
Directors, Corporate Governance Report, Corporate Social Responsibility and the unaudited part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent Company financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent Company financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent Company financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
Report of the Independent Auditor to the
Members of Goldshield Group plc 55
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31
March 2006; and 
•
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
•
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements for the

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under
the historic cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most
appropriate for the Company. The principal accounting policies of the Company have remained unchanged from the previous
year apart from adoption of the following standards:
• FRS 20 ‘(IFRS 2) Share Based Payment’ 
• FRS 21 ‘(IAS 19) Events After the Balance Sheet Date’
• FRS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ 
• FRS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ 
• FRS 25 ‘Accounting for Investments’ 
• FRS 26 ‘Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans’ 
The application of most of these standards has had no financial effect, those which have effected the results are explained below.
Changes in accounting policies
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the Company has adopted the following Financial Reporing Standards
that are relevant to the Company. 
FRS 21 ‘(IAS 10) Events After the Balance Sheet Date’
The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in a change in accounting policy in respect of proposed equity dividends. If the Company
declares dividends to the holders of equity instruments after the balance sheet date, the Company does not recognise those
dividends as a liability at the balance sheet date. Previously where these equity dividends were proposed after the balance sheet
date but before authorisation of the financial statements they were recorded as liabilities at the balance sheet date. The aggregate
amount of equity dividends proposed before approval of the financial statements, which have not been shown as liabilities at the
balance sheet date, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The financial effect of this change in accounting policy
is set out in note 4.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are included at the cost of the shares held less
amounts written off.
Intangible ﬁxed assets
Goodwill, brand names, know-how, licences, trademarks and similar intangible items are capitalised at historical cost net of any
provision for impairment and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which range between
seven and ten years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation to pay
more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are
recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Defered taxes are not discounted.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All other exchange differences
are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party
to the contractual terms of the instrument.
• Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal amounts as reduced to equal the estimated present
value of the future cash flows.
• Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of instrument to the extent that
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
• Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
• Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Notes to the Company’s Financial Statements 59
2. RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR

account in these financial statements. The loss after tax for the year of the Company was £1,289,380 (2005: Profit
£5,566,973) which is dealt with in the financial statements of the Company.

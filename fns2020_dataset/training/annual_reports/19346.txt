 GLOBAL EXPANSION
We continue to receive enquiries from across 
the globe from oil and gas operators that are 
considering POS-GRIP technology for its unique 
technical, safety and time saving capabilities.  
Expanding from our dominant position in the 
North Sea into new geographical areas is central 
to our growth strategy, especially at a time when 
the North Sea is under pressure from a low oil 
price.    Our primary revenue stream is derived 
from our POS-GRIP friction grip wellhead systems 
for jack-up drilling exploration activities.  In terms 
of sales achieved during financial year 2015, a 
strong performance was seen in Europe which, 
excluding the UK, grew 110% and accounted for 
51% of sales as compared to the UK North Sea 
which grew by 7% and accounted for 37% of 
sales.  Sales in the rest of world accounted for 
12% of sales, of which Asia comprised 9.2% an 
increase of 22% against last year.

EUROPE 
We secured our first 
contract with a South 
American company C ardon

between eni and Repsol) 
for an exploration well in 
Venezuela.
This was our largest growth region 
in terms of revenues for 2015, 
comprising of Norway, Denmark, and 
the Netherlands. It represented a 51% 
share with the majority of contract wins 
being secured in Norway.  With our 
headquarters in Aberdeen, where we 
have recently doubled our operational 
capacity, Europe will continue to remain 
a focus for Plexus and POS-GRIP North 
Sea contract wins.

POSGRIP / 
PRODUCT OFFERING
6
POS-GRIP Technology is a patented method of engineering which 
has the potential for a wide range of applications both within 
and outside the oil and gas industry.  For the upstream oil and 
gas markets POS-GRIP has been developed to deliver a method of 
wellhead engineering which is safer, faster and more cost effective to 
use for drilling activities across exploration, production and subsea. 
POS-GRIP TECHNOLOGY AND HG® SEALS
POS-GRIP is based on two very simple engineering 
concepts – elasticity of materials and friction.  
Every object moves a small amount when a force 
is applied to it, and POS-GRIP uses this to flex a 
high pressure body in and out within the elastic 
range.
In wellheads, POS-GRIP can replace the 
conventional load shoulder or slips to create a 
high-load hanger support mechanism which is 
adjustable, full-bore, fully elastic, and provides 
instant, high-capacity lockdown.
HG  seals are robust metal-to-metal seals which 
can be machined directly into the hanger, and 
are energised by use of an external POS-GRIP 
mechanism.  External activation results in direct 
control of contact stresses at the sealing surface, 
leading to exceptional reliability and repeatability.  
This simple and elegant sealing mechanism has 
been qualified for X-HPHT service using validation 
criteria well above and beyond standard industry 
seal performance verification requirements. 
POS-GRIP Technology and HG seals have already 
been applied to a wide range of wellhead and 
connector products, where the simplicity of the 
system results in robust products which are 
safer to operate, cheaper to install and offer 
unprecedented integrity for the life of field.

POS-GRIP  EXPLORATION 
WELLHEAD SYSTEMS 
Well integrity and safety is critical when drilling 
exploration wells. Plexus has pioneered the 
use of a ‘through the BOP’ wellhead systems 
for jack-up exploration drilling.  A welcome 
benefit from this design philosophy is time 
and cost savings. Our wellhead system saves 
a BOP lift for every casing string installed 
compared to conventional systems. This 
saves one to four days 
down time per well, 
generating significant 
cost reductions, and in 
many cases can make the 
rental cost negative for 
the customer. The systems 
are available from existing 
stock on a rental basis, 
reducing lead times  for 
customers.
TERSUS™ MUDLINE SYSTEMS  
The Plexus range of Tersus Mudline Suspension 
Systems is designed with proactive well 
control and safety in mind. Wherever possible, 
all procedures are carried out under full BOP 
protection, which is sadly not the case with 
most other commercially available systems.
Mudline Systems are often thought of as 
being cheap and simple, but significant 
value can be added through design details 
which enhance safety, create 
savings and reduce risk. For 
example, the Plexus Tersus-
TRT combined TA Cap is safer 
to use and quicker to install 
than multi cap options. The 
Tersus PCT system has the 
potential for huge savings by 
allowing the recovery of HP/
HT exploration wells, and 
enabling pre-drilling of HP/HT 
development wells. 
POS-GRIP HG 
PRODUCTION 
WELLHEADS
Integrity of equipment is 
essential for long term 
production wells, where many 
hundreds of pressure and 
temperature cycles can be 
seen throughout the life of a 
field. POS-GRIP HG Production 
Wellheads are designed and 
tested to meet worst case conditions, and 
provide the safest possible solution during 
drilling and production.
As well as offering the highest standards in 
safety and integrity, HG Production Wellheads 
are designed to be quick and simple to install. 
The through the BOP design combined with 
extremely simple hangers and running tools 
can generate days of time-savings per well.  
The systems are available for sale and require 
minimal maintenance during field life.

 TERSUS PCT HP/HT 
TIE-BACK 
CONNECTOR 
Our HP/HT up to 20,000 psi 
Tie-Back Connector, is an 
innovative and unique product 
sponsored by Maersk. The 
Tie-Back Connector features 
our metal-to-metal HG seals 
and for the first time allows 
HP/HT exploration and pre-
drilled production wells to be converted to 
either subsea or platform producing wells 
delivering significant savings in terms of 
capital expenditure and the acceleration of 
bringing a well into production. At a time 
when the industry is focusing strongly on 
cost and capex saving opportunities the 
benefits of such an innovative product are 
clear, and we are marketing this product on 
the basis that it is the only method available 
of achieving a remote casing connection with 
the same integrity and capacities as premium 
casing couplings.

M2S SUBSEA WELLHEADS
M2S wellheads are designed to be jack-up 
deployed and enable the conversion of pre-
drilled wells using mudline equipment to 
subsea production. M2S systems use POS-
GRIP and HG sealing to provide many of the 
unique safety features and benefits of Plexus’ 
other surface and subsea POS-GRIP products.
M2S benefits from the adjustable nature of 
POS-GRIP to enable Mudline Tieback Tools 
to be easily re-connected to the mudline 
hangers before the strings are precisely 
tensioned and locked into place in the high 
pressure subsea wellhead housing. This saves 
time and reduces the risk of problems, to 
maximise value for our users.

PYTHON SUBSEA WELLHEAD
Wellhead equipment is critical for the safe 
drilling and production of subsea wells. Long 
term performance and integrity are crucial, 
due to the remote location of the wellhead. 
Plexus has therefore combined the safety 
and reliability benefits of POS-GRIP and 
HG sealing into a wellhead system which is 
robust and fully tested to meet the conditions 
expected in deepwater and HP/HT wells.
As well as offering the highest standards 
in safety and integrity, the Python subsea 
wellhead is designed to be simple whilst 
delivering instant casing hanger lockdown. 
Many conventional components are 
eliminated, resulting in enhanced reliability 
and fewer trips. Time savings during drilling 
are up to four days in shallow water, and up 
to 12 days per deepwater well, compared to 
conventional systems.
SUBSEA WELLHEADS
POS-SET 
CONNECTOR  
The POS-SET Connector 
is designed to re-connect 
to bare conductor pipe 
for well re-entry or 
permanent abandonment 
operations. It creates 
a solid connection with 
reliable sealing directly 
against the pipe, and 
retains bend and load capabilities at 80% 
of pipe strength, for the safest possible re-
establishment of well control.
POS-SET can accommodate large variations in 
diameter, wall thickness and ovality which can 
be experienced with conductor pipe, while 
creating a direct sealing and load-bearing 
interface. This wide window of operation 
means tieback problems are minimised, 
resulting in more cost-effective operations.

“AS A COMPANY WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON 
OUR MANAGEMENT AND  ENGINEERING 
EXCELLENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND 
THE BOARD’S GRATITUDE TO OUR 
DEDICATED WORKFORCE WHICH INCLUDES 
 SOME OF THE MOST TALENTED OIL AND 
GAS ENGINEERS IN THE  INDUSTRY TODAY.”
“I am delighted to report 
another set of record 
financial results in terms of 
revenues, margins, and 
profitability. This 
performance is all the more 
impressive as it has been 
achieved during what has 
been, and continues to be a 
difficult trading cycle for the 
global oil and gas sector, 
driven by the significant fall 
in the oil price and related 
geopolitical circumstances. 
Despite the challenging 
backdrop, the year under 
review has been a 
transformational one for 
Plexus in terms of new 
strategic and product 
developments. We continue 
to develop the Company into 
a leading international 
wellhead engineering 
company supplying the best 
in class and safest wellhead 
equipment across 
exploration, production and 
subsea arenas, utilising our 
proprietary patented POS-
GRIP method of engineering. 
As such we remain as 
confident as ever in the 
superior nature of our 
technology and the 
important role it will play in 
the coming years, not only 
in our traditional European 
market, but globally as we 
look to continue to increase 
our international footprint. 
Following this strong 
performance, we are pleased 
to report a 182% increase in 
the final dividend to 1.75p 
per share which includes a 
special dividend payment to 
deliver an additional return 
to shareholders supported 
by our current strong cash 
position.
“Our proprietary POS-GRIP 
wellhead systems meet the 
critical safety and 
performance demands 
required of wellhead 
technology across all 
pressure spectrums. As 
exploration and production 
of oil and gas continues to 
pursue ever deeper and 
more complex formations, 
particularly for HP/HT 
environments, the need for 
innovative, safe and 
effective wellhead 
technology is being 
increasingly recognised by 
both regulators and 
operators. However 
conventional technology has 
known limitations and we 
maintain that for a variety 
of technical reasons 
wellheads have been, and 
continue to be the weak link 
in the well architecture 
chain which I believe needs 
addressing.
“Specifically there is a 
massive divide between 
qualification test standards 
to which wellheads and their 
casing hangers (the last 
connection of the casing 
pipe) and annular seals have 
historically been held by 
common industry test 
standards as compared to 
those required for premium 
casing couplings, 
(notwithstanding that both 
products effectively do the 
same job in a well). Further 
our design makes the casing 
hanger a much simpler 
object, which rather than 
being made up of as many 
as twenty parts is made 
CE O MESS A G E 12

from a single piece, 
significantly reducing the 
number of installation steps 
required by conventional 
systems. Therefore on the 
basis of current test 
standard levels, all subsea 
annular seals currently used 
in the market are a weak 
link, and one that in subsea 
applications is never truly 
tested after installation, and 
which furthermore has no 
means of monitoring for 
integrity and remedial 
intervention.
“For these reasons it is very 
pertinent and topical for us 
that the recent Volkswagen 
‘emissions rigging’ scandal 
has thrown a spotlight on 
the veracity of laboratory 
test standards. This 
developing story supports 
what I have been saying for 
a long time and demonstrates 
to me that when test 
standards and operating 
conditions move beyond 
what technology can 
achieve, then managers and 
engineers will conspire to 
artificially meet such 
standards so that 
qualification tests can be 
passed with inferior 
solutions, or indeed industry 
then lobbies to have test 
standards set at levels to 
which they can comply, even 
if not applicable to ‘real 
world’ conditions.
“I maintain that in the oil 
and gas industry key 
standard setters have 
managed to do both where 
wellheads and wellhead 
seals are concerned. Firstly 
they managed to convince 
the regulator that casing 
hangers and their seals only 
need three temperature and 
pressure cycles to be proven 
suitable for use forever and 
a day. Conversely, as 
operating conditions have 
moved onto HP/HT 
conditions, casing coupling 
(under pressure of end 
users), have now advanced 
to more than 1,700 test 
cycles. Secondly, casing 
hangers and annular seals 
are tested in fixtures which 
have no connection to ‘real 
world’ conditions. Rather 
than testing the full 
assemblies as a system, 
annular seals are allowed to 
be qualified as a single 
component, in specially 
configured fixtures, which 
eliminates movement and 
without any axial and 
bending loads being applied 
during pressure cycle testing 
as happens in the field. It is 
therefore disappointing that 
operators are planning to 
rely on these absolutely 
critical seal systems in 
subsea applications that 
may in the future operate 
under 20,000 to 30,000 psi 
gas pressures. The 
importance of meaningful 
and realistic testing was 
underlined recently by Sir 
James Dyson who was 
quoted as saying, “It seems 
that industry is rife with 
manufacturers engineering 
to find their way around 
tests, rather than 
engineering better, more 
efficient technology. This 
behaviour is seriously 
misleading customers”. This 
statement is of course in 
relation to a consumer 
product and its relative 
performance, whereas in our 
industry we should be 
placing safety and the 
environment first and 
foremost, which should lead 
to the genuine desire to 
only use the best and safest 
available technology.
“The significant time and 
cost savings that we can 
deliver are of course 
extremely relevant to a 
trading environment where

operators are looking to 
drive down the costs of new 
projects by 20-30%. This 
means that at the surface 
and subsea, POS-GRIP 
technology simply sets a 
standard no other wellhead 
technology can match. 
Encouragingly it has been 
reported that following the 
Volkswagen incident 
European regulators want to 
bring in real world tests by 
2018 that look at emissions 
from cars on the road, 
rather than in laboratories, 
and I believe that the oil 
and gas industry regulators 
should be taking a similar 
stance in relation to 
wellhead seal test standards 
and methodology. Perhaps 
the regulators are finally 
beginning to realise, as a 
journalist recently reported, 
that artificial outcomes 
often start in laboratories, 
and the gap between a well-
designed test and reality 
need not be huge, but bright 
minds will soon find out how 
to arbitrage the two. To this 
end it is positive that 
standard setters are 
beginning to recognise that 
new standards are required 
to address the new more 
challenging drilling 
conditions and enhanced 
regulatory scrutiny, and we 
believe that we are already 
in a position to meet these 
in a way that conventional 
wellhead designs cannot.
“In tandem with positioning 
Plexus as the supplier of 
choice in the standard 
pressure and HP/HT 
exploration markets in 
Europe, we have also been 
highly active during the past 
year in beginning to more 
actively market our products 
into new operating regions 
in line with our strategy to 
significantly increase the 
global reach of our wellhead 
equipment, offering 
significant growth 
opportunities. In line with 
this and following the 
establishment of our 
Malaysian and Singaporean 
hubs, we have substantially 
built on our existing position 
in the Asian region where we 
have achieved a number of 
significant milestones 
throughout 2014 and 2015.
“Post-period end in July 
2015 we had a flurry of 
activity starting with the 
signing of a pivotal licencing 
agreement with Yantai Jereh 
Oilfield Services Group Co., 
Ltd (‘Jereh’), a leading 
Chinese oil services provider 
to facilitate the rental, sale, 
and manufacture of our 
wellhead equipment into the 
important Chinese, wider 
Asian, Brazilian, Indian and 
Middle Eastern oil and gas 
markets. I see this latest 
agreement as an important 
building block for the 
transition of Plexus from 
being a niche supplier of 
specialist rental exploration 
wellhead equipment into the 
main stream volume market, 
allowing us to engineer and 
manufacture our best in 
class high standards whilst 
capitalising on being able to 
reduce operator’s costs. 
Alongside this first major 
licencing agreement a share 
subscription agreement was 
also entered into, and 
another entity in the Jereh 
Group subscribed in July 
post period end for 5% of 
the issued share capital of 
Plexus for a consideration of 
£8.04m.
“This was closely followed 
by a collaboration agreement 
with China Oilfield Services 
Limited (‘COSL’) a major 
integrated oilfield service 
solution provider which is

majority owned by Chinese 
state owned company 
CNOOC Group, Red Sea 
Technologies Ltd, a leading 
oilfield design and services 
company in South East Asia, 
and Jereh. This will see all 
parties explore commercial 
opportunities for shallow 
water subsea and crossover 
wellhead production systems 
for oil and gas field activities 
in China.
“The importance of China 
and Chinese trading partners 
has of course been  brought 
into sharp focus during the 
recent five day visit in 
September to China by 
George Osborne who 
declared that the UK should 
not be running away from 
China, that Britain should be 
“China’s best partner in the 
West”, and that we should 
“create a golden decade for 
both of our countries”. I 
certainly echo those 
sentiments and this month’s 
milestone state visit by the 
Chinese President Mr Xi 
Jinping further underlined 
the scale of these 
opportunities when the 
President said “As an old 
Chinese adage goes, 
opportunity may knock just 
once; grab it before it slips 
away”, and that as “China-
UK comprehensive strategic 
partnership enters the 
second decade this year, let 
us seize the opportunity, 
and work together to usher 
in an even brighter future 
for China-UK relationship”. 
For such reasons I am very 
excited about our new 
relationship with Jereh 
which only commenced in 
July, and I am confident 
that Jereh’s considerable 
manufacturing and 
commercial skills will blend 
well with our technology to 
create considerable value 
for both companies over the 
coming years.
“A third Asian development 
at the end of July 2015, was 
the announcement that we 
had secured in August 2014 
a local Petronas licence to 
supply our POS-GRIP 
equipment in Malaysia 
through PPA. As a result of 
these three major strategic 
moves, and on-going 
relationship building 
initiatives in other areas of 
regional importance such as 
the Gulf of Mexico (‘GOM’) 
and Russia, (where in the 
coming years, and of course 
subject to sanctions the 
Arctic will become very 
important requiring the very 
best and most convenient 
wellhead sealing technology) 
I believe that we are ideally 
placed to continue to 
increase our global reach.
“I am especially proud to 
report on the launch of our 
new Python subsea wellhead 
at SPE Offshore Europe 
Conference & Exhibition 
2015 (‘OE2015’), Europe’s 
biggest oil and gas trade 
show. This was the result of 
over four years of research 
and development supported 
by our Joint Industry 
Partners, BG, eni, Royal 
Dutch Shell, Maersk, Total, 
Wintershall, Tullow Oil, 
Senergy, and Oil States 
Industries Inc. The new 
Python Subsea Wellhead has 
been designed to address 
key technical issues and 
requirements highlighted by 
regulators following the 
GOM incident in April 2010 
and to achieve a new best in 
class standard for subsea 
wellheads. Entering the 
global subsea market has 
always been part of our 
strategy to expand the 
Company’s suite of POS-
GRIP wellhead equipment 
into larger fast growing 
markets. Subsea exploration 
and production has grown 
rapidly since 2000 in terms 
of total expenditure from 
USD$7billion to 
approximately USD$45billion 
in 2014. According to a 
report by Rystad Energy in 
May 2014 this strong growth 
is expected to continue, 
with subsea expenditure 
forecast to grow by an 
annual rate of 15% to 
USD$115 billion by 2020, 
making it a highly attractive 
market, and one that 
demands new technology 
and engineering solutions. 
We anticipate that our 
ground-breaking technology,

to product will be ready for 
offshore deployment in a 
trial well during the second 
half of 2016 and we look 
forward to updating the 
market further.
“Finally as a Company we 
pride ourselves on our 
management and 
engineering excellence. I 
would like to extend the 
Board’s gratitude to our 
dedicated workforce which 
includes some of the most 
talented oil and gas 
engineers in the industry 
today. Without our team we 
would not be able to win 
milestone contracts where 
only the best equipment will 
suffice such as with the 
recently announced £3.3m 
contract with Total for the 
Solaris well offshore Norway 
for which our technology 
was specifically chosen, and 
which is thought will be the 
highest pressure well ever 
drilled in the North Sea at 
up to 17,000 to 19,000 psi. 
The future opportunities for 
Plexus, in both our core 
markets and with ancillary 
new POS-GRIP developments 
such as our POS-SET 
Connector for the 
decommissioning market, 
are clearly exponential and 
we believe that we will 
continue to attract new 
customers worldwide either 
directly or through licensees 
as the wider industry places 
increasing emphasis on the 
development of HP/HT 
reserves. I look forward to
updating our valued 
shareholders on our latest 
organic and strategic 
developments throughout 
the rest of 2015 and 
beyond.”

BUSINESS PROGRESS
I am pleased to report that 
despite challenging trading 
conditions the Group 
delivered an excellent set of 
results whilst making strong 
progress in terms of 
operational, financial, and 
strategic developments. 
This performance resulted in 
a 5.6% increase in revenue 
to £28.53m for the year to 
30 June 2015 (2014: 
£27.02m) with the UK and 
European revenues 
increasing by 49.2%; a 5.7% 
increase in EBITDA to 
£9.53m (2014: £9.02m); a 
10.5% increase in profit 
before tax to £5.94m (2014: 
£5.38m); and a 18.8% 
increase in profit after tax 
to £5.43m (2014: £4.57m) 
helped by a lower effective 
tax rate, delivering a 17.5% 
increase in basic earnings 
per share of 6.40p (2014: 
5.44p). Such key financial 
performance indicators are 
of course only part of the 
progress made during the 
financial year and I am also 
delighted to say that this 
period and post period end 
were the most active since 
we were admitted to the 
London AIM market, and 
have laid firm foundations 
for our future expansion 
both geographically and in 
terms of new product 
development. It is clear to 
me that industry interest in 
our proprietary POS-GRIP 
friction-grip method of 
engineering is increasing in 
tangible ways beyond our 
traditional organic jack-up 
exploration rental wellhead 
business. Examples of such 
exciting initiatives which I 
will expand on include BG 
joining our Python subsea 
wellhead JIP; first contract 
for our new POS-SET 
Connector product to 
facilitate decommissioning 
and abandonment; securing 
of a major licensee in China 
(Jereh); a collaboration with 
COSL for the development 
and supply of a shallow 
subsea wellhead for China; 
the securing of a Petronas 
licence to enable the supply 
of equipment in Malaysia; 
entering into a collaboration 
with Aquaterra for the 
supply of HP/HT marine 
risers; and importantly the 
official launch of our new 
Python subsea wellhead at 
OE2015 last month in 
Aberdeen.
OVERVIEW
The 2015 financial year 
has seen Plexus achieve a 
number of significant 
milestones, not least, in 
terms of establishing 
strategic partnerships and 
investing time and resources 
into research and 
development for new 
product innovation, which 
we believe will help us 
further cement our position 
as the best in class supplier 
of wellhead equipment to 
the oil and gas industry, not 
just for jack-up exploration 
but  also in due course for 
surface production and

subsea. This progress 
however cannot be 
considered in isolation, and 
it is important to note that 
the various macro and 
geopolitical negatives that 
we identified this time last 
year persist, not only in 
terms of the much reduced 
oil price but also in terms of 
reduced operators capex 
spend and consumer demand 
levels.
Since our admission to AIM 
at the end of 2005, Plexus 
has grown in terms of 
revenues and profitability 
through our POS-GRIP 
surface exploration jack-up 
wellhead rental business 
model. This growth has been 
supported by necessary on-
going investment in R&D, 
personnel, rental wellhead 
inventory, and infrastructure 
both in the UK and 
increasingly worldwide 
where we are looking to 
grow sales beyond our 
traditional North Sea 
market. Our surface 
exploration offshore 
wellhead customer base 
continues to grow, and 
includes many of the world’s 
largest global oil and gas 
companies to which we 
added new customers Total 
and Cardon IV (a 50:50 JV 
between Repsol and eni) 
during the year. Of these oil 
and gas companies we have 
serviced over 400 wells 
globally offering our 
customers standard pressure 
wellheads and HP/HT 
wellheads, and we estimate 
that we hold a c.10% market 
share of the c.USD$400m 
global jack-up exploration 
market, as compared to the 
vast majority of the markets 
in the North Sea which 
underlines the significant 
growth opportunity within 
this arena. Our recognition 
of the importance of 
investment, and in particular 
R&D, and the willingness to 
commit to it clearly 
demonstrates our confidence 
in the superior nature of our 
POS-GRIP technology and its 
ability to become a new 
global standard.
In terms of rental sales and 
revenues for the financial 
year, we have been focussed 
on expanding beyond our 
traditional UK North Sea 
market, winning more 
contracts in Europe and 
pursuing new business 
opportunities in Africa, 
Australia, North America and 
Asia. Our sales mix 
illustrates the continued 
importance of both the UKCS 
and the European 
Continental Shelf (‘ECS’) in 
the North Sea where sales to 
offshore Norway, the 
Netherlands and Denmark 
were particularly strong and 
increased by 53.1%, 89.3% 
and 1,217% respectively 
compared to the same period 
in the prior year. We believe 
that the tax structures for 
example in Norway 
encourage exploration 
drilling as a result of 
allowances available where 
‘dry’ wells are concerned. 
With Brent Crude trading at 
circa USD$50 per barrel , 
following publication of the 
Wood Review, we hope that 
the latest tax incentive 
changes in the UKCS, as 
announced in the UK 
Government’s 2015 Budget 
which outlined measures 
worth £1.3bn over five years 
aimed at boosting flagging 
North Sea oil production by 
15% by the end of the 
decade, will have a similar 
positive impact which Plexus 
will benefit from. HP/HT 
equipment revenues 
continued to account for 
over 85% of all sales and, as 
such field conditions are the 
most technically challenging,

demonstrates the technical 
advantages offered by our 
proprietary POS-GRIP 
friction-grip method of 
engineering and wellhead 
equipment design.
As well as the significant 
contract wins for our POS-
GRIP surface exploration 
jack-up over the period, the 
two other areas where we 
have invested significant 
time and resources over the 
past year is our continued 
expansion into Asia, and on-
going product innovation 
which saw us enter a new 
lucrative market 
post period end 
following the 
launch of our 
uniquely superior 
Python Subsea 
Wellhead which 
addresses a 
number of issues 
identified following 
the Gulf of Mexico 
incident in 2010. 
Our Asian 
expansion has 
been demonstrated 
over three 
significant news events 
which have been explained 
by our CEO Ben Van 
Bilderbeek in his CEO 
commentary. Most notably 
was the post period end 
signing of our first licencing 
agreement with a major 
Chinese oil and gas field 
services company Jereh in 
July 2015. Licencing has 
been central to Plexus’ 
growth strategy as a way to 
penetrate the global market 
whist maintaining our best in 
class service, brand 
reputation and indeed strong 
patent protection where we 
have a growing patent suite 
in place to protect our POS-
GRIP friction-grip 
technology.
Plexus and Jereh, a world-
class supplier of oil and gas 
field equipment and services 
with a market cap of c.
USD$4bn, operating in more 
than 60 countries, share the 
ambition of delivering oil 
and gas drilling equipment 
and services, which are best 
in class in terms of safety, 
performance and reliability. 
By incorporating our 
patented POS-GRIP 
technology, the licencing 
agreement will push the 
boundaries in terms of 
wellhead performance and 
safety standards to facilitate 
the rental, sale, and 
manufacture of Plexus’ 
wellhead equipment into the 
major Chinese, wider Asian, 
Brazilian, Indian and Middle 
Eastern oil and gas markets. 
This relationship will be 
focused not just on rental 
wellhead exploration 
activities, but also on surface 
production and shallow 
water subsea, and 
connectors. In terms of 
positive market growth 
opportunities, according to 
Infield, the energy analysts, 
China and wider Asia is in 
the process of implementing 
the largest regional offshore 
capital expenditure 
programme for oil and gas 
activities which, from 2012 
to 2018, has been estimated 
to amount to USD$146bn. 
Indeed not so long ago 
Infield indicated that 
operations in Asia are 
increasingly moving 
exploration and production 
into deeper waters in a bid 
to boost oil and gas 
production, and that as a 
result Malaysia, Indonesia, 
India, and China are 
becoming major subsea 
industry hotspots attracting 
a range of operators from 
national oil companies such 
as CNOOC and ONGC, to 
international oil 
companies such as 
Shell and Chevron. 
As such whilst we 
will continue to 
expand our global 
presence we believe 
this licence 
agreement can over 
time generate 
substantial revenues 
from the partnership 
with Jereh, who 
have an exceptional 
track record as 
licensees for major 
partners around the world.
In line with our Asian 
expansion we were also 
delighted to report the 
formation of a new Malaysian 
company PPA in conjunction 
with a local Malaysian oil 
and gas partner, IPS. PPA 
was formed to create a fully 
operational Plexus Asian 
business hub with the aim of 
supplying POS-GRIP 
wellhead equipment and 
services to the Australian, 
Brunei, Indonesian, 
Malaysian, Thai, and 
Singaporean oil and gas 
exploration and production 
markets. This was signed in 
August 2014 and as further 
progress have since been

granted a local Petronas 
licence post period end to 
manufacture and supply 
Plexus’ POS-GRIP wellhead 
equipment. The securing of 
such a licence has been 
viewed as a major milestone 
for our company and we 
believe this will position us 
well to secure additional 
business and contract wins 
in this region.
In addition to our 
international expansion 
plans a defining moment of 
Plexus’ year was the launch 
of the Python Subsea 
Wellhead during Europe’s 
biggest Oil and Gas trade 
show, OE2015, in September 
2015. The Python launch 
was attended by Fergus 
Ewing, the Scottish Minister 
for Business, Energy and 
Tourism where he stated, 
 “this new technology will 
allow oil and gas companies 
around the world to increase 
the safety and reliability of 
their operations and it is a 
great testament to the skills 
and knowledge of Ben Van 
Bilderbeek and his team ”. 
The Python Subsea launch 
had been supported by 
Plexus’ joint industry 
partners which include BG, 
eni, Maersk, Royal Dutch 
Shell, Total, Wintershall, 
Senergy and Tullow Oil. 
Interestingly it was the 
industry that came to Plexus 
post the 2010 Macondo 
disaster to ask us to help 
design a safer, new best in 
class standard for subsea 
wellheads. The patented 
POS-GRIP friction-grip 
method of engineering 
offers ‘instant casing hanger 
lockdown’ and is used to 
secure hangers with HG 
Seals which provide direct, 
metal-to-metal, weld-
quality, high integrity 
sealing. Many components 
used in competing 
conventional subsea 
wellhead designs such as 
lock rings and wear bushings 
are eliminated, resulting in 
enhanced reliability and 
fewer installation trips to 
the sea bed by seven to ten 
trips on a complex well 
which will likely save 
operators using the Python 
Subsea wellhead between 
USD$2-10m per wellhead. 
Python’s formal launch 
marked the first commercial 
availability of our POS-GRIP 
enabled subsea wellhead 
system, and Plexus is

confident that Python will be 
ready for offshore prototype 
deployment in a trial well 
during 2016, where the next 
steps will be finding an 
operator to secure this first 
deployment.
Further to the launch of our 
Python Subsea Wellhead and 
expansion into new target 
markets, we have also been 
working on the extension of 
POS-GRIP friction technology 
and other new product areas. 
These products include: a 
low cost wellhead system for 
the volume production 
market - WellTree™ which we 
are currently working on with 
Jereh; this is in addition to 
products such as the HP/HT 
Tie-Back connector where we 
previously signed a joint 
industry project with Maersk, 
which for the first time allows 
the reconnection of 
production casing to HP/HT 
exploration and production 
wells which is now being 
marketed; the new POS-SET 
Connector which is designed 
to enable operators to re-
establish a connection onto 
rough conductor casing for 
the abandonment market, 
where the market for 
permanent plugging and 
abandonment of wells is 
increasing in the North Sea 
and beyond and could be an 
important new revenue 
stream for the Company; and 
the recent agreement with 
Aquaterra to jointly supply 
HP/HT dual barrier marine 
risers utilising Plexus’ POS-
GRIP technology to provide a 
safer, technically superior 
and cost efficient solution for 
the use on jack-up rigs. All of 
these product innovations 
are in line with Plexus’ 
strategy to extend our POS-
GRIP product reach into new 
and commercially attractive 
markets. 
In tandem with securing 
strategic partnerships for 
future international growth 
and new product 
development, the continuing 
communication of our unique 
offering is equally as 
important to Plexus’ future 
success. The Board, 
management team and 
dedicated engineers invest 
significant time into 
communicating and educatin g 
the wider oil and gas industry. 
Such activities included 
attending and presenting at 
the ‘World Oil HP/HT Drilling 
and Completions Conference’ 
in Houston, Texas, and in 
London at the ‘Oil and Gas iQ 
“HP/HT Wells Summit 2014 
and 2015’, as well as 
important events such as the 
St Petersburg International 
Economic Forum in June, and 
the Beijing China 
International Offshore Oil & 
Gas Exhibition in March.

Case Study
MOVING INTO 
SUBSEA
In September 2015, we 
launched our simple 
and technologically 
superior POS-GRIP 
Python Subsea 
Wellhead.  The 
patented technology 
was engineered to 
achieve best in class 
and safest standard 
for subsea wellheads 
with features 
that also reduce 
costs and deliver 
operational efficiency 
for operators.  The 
patented technology 
was in development 
for four years prior to 
its launch, in response 
to the Gulf of Mexico 
incident that occurred 
in 2011 and developed 
as a joint industry 
project supported 
by international oil 
majors including BG, 
eni, Maersk, Oil States 
Industries, Royal 
Dutch Shell, Senergy,

known as Competency@
Plexus. This is a qualification 
that our customers request 
during the tender and 
contract review process, 
especially in response to the 
findings from the Deepwater 
Horizon incident in 2010. 
Furthermore in September 
2014 I was delighted to see 
that our team’s efforts led 
to Plexus winning the 
“Commitment to Innovative 
Use of Research and 
Development” award at the 
Northern Star Business 
Awards 2014. Such work 
underpins the on-going 
development and application 
of our proprietary friction-
grip method of engineering. 
I would also like to welcome 
as a non-executive director 
Charles Jones who joined 
the Board in September 
2014 and who will be 
advising Plexus in respect of 
interacting with US oil and 
gas operators and service 
companies, industry bodies, 
and regulators, particularly 
in relation to the subsea 
arena.
OUTLOOK
I remain confident about 
the major growth 
opportunities available to 
Plexus and our on-going 
ability to market our 
proprietary POS-GRIP based 
wellhead equipment as a 
new and superior standard 
for the industry. We are in 
no doubt that we can 
ultimately penetrate all 
wellhead markets from 
surface to subsea, both 
organically and in 
conjunction with partners 
and licensees around the 
world. Notwithstanding our 
year on year growth and 
indeed record FY 2015 
financial results, FY 2016 
trading conditions are more 
challenging given the 
significant reduction in the 
oil price and related on-
going economic pressures 
which surround the oil and 
gas industry and the support 
services underpinning it, 
and this cannot be ignored. 
This is especially the case in 
the UK North Sea which 
traditionally has been an 
important market for us, 
and as recently as September 
2015 Oil and Gas UK 
reported that “exploration 
for new resources has fallen 
to its lowest level since the 
1970s” and that capital 
expenditure will probably 
decline by £2bn to £4bn 
annually to 2017. Looking 
forwards, the UK North Sea 
should not be written off 
just yet. Last year’s Wood 
Review of the North Sea 
estimated that there were 
still between 12bn and 24bn 
barrels of oil that could still 
be pumped in UK territorial 
waters compared to 45bn

barrels of crude extracted to 
date – logic dictates there is 
much drilling activity to 
come.
More encouragingly in recent 
weeks there has been a 
more positive sentiment with 
regards to oil price forecasts 
from a number of sources 
including UBS Wealth 
Management and Barclays. 
Only this month a Barclays 
analyst report argued that 
with prices at their current 
historic low levels, energy 
companies will not be 
sufficiently encouraged to 
continue to produce oil, and 
with “capex expected to fall 
20% globally in 2015 and a 
further 5-10% in 2016, the 
stage is set for a supply 
crunch”, meaning that after 
“some excess stocks are 
used up in 2016 and 2017, 
we believe the price 
appreciation seen thereafter 
is likely to be permanent”. 
Such sentiment is further 
endorsed by the industry 
itself, with Shell CEO Ben 
van Beurden declaring 
recently that the world faces 
an energy crisis unless 
investment in fossil fuels 
production is maintained 
because of the dramatic 
increase in demand that will 
come from 3bn people 
emerging from poverty over 
the next few decades.

Speaking to shareholders in 
The Hague Mr van Beurden 
said we “will need sustained 
and substantial (oil) 
investment to support 
economic growth” and that 
the world could face a 
catastrophic 70m barrel per 
day shortfall in crude by 
2040. According to the 
International Energy Agency 
who said global energy 
demand will increase by 
40% through to 2040, and 
an influential Exxon report 
further estimates that world 
population will increase 
by  30% from 2010 to 
2040, with global GDP rising 
by circa 140%. The 
achievement of higher oil 
prices, alongside our 
international growth and 
new product development 
strategies would certainly 
be favourable in terms of 
the growth outlook for 
Plexus, and indeed the wider 
oil and gas sector as a whole 
as exploration drilling 
activity would inevitably 
increase.
Our vision is to become a 
leading international oil and 
gas wellhead and related 
equipment engineering 
company, supplying the best 
in class and safest POS-
GRIP wellhead equipment 
for exploration, production 
and subsea applications 
around the world. In a 
global market dominated by 
a few large multi-national 
oil service and wellhead 
supply companies, Plexus 
reputation is growing, and 
the awareness of our ability 
to meet the demand for and 
provide critical innovative 
solutions required from 
wellhead technology, 
particularly for HP/HT 
applications is evidenced by 
a number of important 
collaborations that we 
entered into over the last 
twelve months. As extracting 
hard-to-reach oil and gas 
goes deeper and becomes 
more complex, innovative,

safe and effective wellhead 
technology is ever more 
important, and indeed 
essential, particularly for 
locations such as the Arctic 
where safety is paramount, 
and where wellheads cannot 
afford to be the weak link in 
the system.
With this vision in mind, the 
expansion of the organic 
jack-up rental business is 
now being focused on Asia, 
Russia and potentially North 
America, including fostering 
licensing agreements with 
the likes of Jereh. Whilst 
our rental sales showed an 
increase during the last 
financial year in terms of 
European and Asian sales, 
our next areas of geographic 
focus will be Russia and the 
CIS countries where I 
believe significant 
opportunities exist for 
Plexus’ equipment and 
technology, particularly in 
the Arctic where the 
selection of new, enabling 
and safer technology will be 
paramount. The scale of the 
Arctic opportunity is 
enormous, and this was 
clear to see from a recent 
report for the Secretary of 
Energy in Washington by the 
US National Petroleum 
Council in March 2015 titled 
“Arctic Potential – Realizing 
the Promise of U.S. Arctic 
Oil and Gas Resources” 
which highlighted two 
important statistics. Firstly 
that most of the Arctic 
offshore oil and gas 
potential lies in water 
depths of less than 100 
metres, and that the Russian 
Arctic shelf is even 
shallower. Secondly, that 
when analysing the global 
arctic conventional oil and 
gas resource potential by 
country in terms of “billion 
barrels of oil  equivalent”, 
Russia towers above the 
other major players. In 
terms of ranked estimated 
billions of barrels Russia 
was estimated at a massive 
287, USA 94, Greenland 39, 
Canada 34, and Norway 25. 
I believe the opportunity is 
additionally compelling 
given the high profile import 
replacement programme 
that is currently underway 
in Russia, and where last 
November Vladimir Markov, 
the head of gas giant 
Gazprom was quoted as 
saying that within the next 
two to three years “we can 
substitute up to 90% of all 
imports, considering the 
government has begun 
developing production of its 
own complex equipment”.
In addition to setting our 
sights on Asian, Russian and 
CIS expansion in the near-
term, we are also looking to 
the North American and 
GOM markets as part of our 
longer-term strategy for 
growth across exploration, 
production and subsea. This 
longer-term strategy will be 
boosted by our active 
presence in Houston where 
we have appointed a new 
USA non-executive director 
to the Board, Charles Jones, 
who has over 30 years of 
senior management and 
board experience in the US

recently engaged the 
services of Mr Lawrence 
Rucinski, who previously 
held the position of Director, 
Sales and Marketing for the 
Global Subsea business of 
FMC Technologies Inc., and 
will actively promote our

Lawrence will be advising 
and assisting the Plexus 
team in relation to potential 
US commercial and licencing

As well as expanding Plexus 
through new regional 
opportunities, as already 
stated new product 
innovation is just as central 
to our growth strategy. We 
therefore look forward to 
updating shareholders on 
these new product 
developments and marketing 
initiatives which include the 
launch of the new and 
superior Python subsea 
wellhead; our surface 
production wellhead 
WellTree; HP/HT Tie-Back

POS-SET Connector. To 
support such future 
initiatives, and as an 
indication of our confidence 
in the future we doubled the 
size of our Aberdeen 
operational headquarters 
with the acquisition in 
September 2014 of a circa 
36,000 sq.ft work shop and 
facility from Baker Hughes 
for £2.4m.
For the reasons outlined in 
my statement, despite 
widely reported on-going 
challenges for the industry I 
am confident of Plexus’ long 
term future prospects and 
our ability to deliver 
significant shareholder 
value from our patented 
POS-GRIP technology. I 
would like to extend my 
gratitude to my fellow Board

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The Group markets a patented method of 
engineering for oil and gas field wellheads 
and connectors, named POS-GRIP, which 
involves deforming one tubular member 
against another within the elastic range to 
effect gripping and sealing. This superior 
method of engineering for wellheads offers a 
number of important advantages to operators, 
particularly for HP/HT applications and can 
include improved technical performance, 
improved integrity of metal seals, significant 
installation time savings, reduced operating 
costs and enhanced safety. Revenues 
predominantly derive from the rental of 
POS-GRIP wellheads for jack-up exploration, 
although the range of commercial and safety 
benefits of POS-GRIP also apply to surface 
production and subsea wellheads which are 
significantly bigger market sectors which 
STR A T E GIC REPORT
Plexus is now actively pursuing organically 
and with international partners such as 
Jereh, China. The Directors believe that 
the Company’s proprietary technology has 
additional wide ranging applications both 
within and outside the oil and gas industry.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue
Revenue for the year was £28.53m, up 5.6% 
from £27.02m in the previous year. The 
growth in sales was supported by a number 
of on-going and new contract wins both 
from existing and new customers around 
the world. Geographically, a particularly 
strong year on year performance was seen in 
Europe excluding the UK which grew 110% 
as compared to the UK North Sea which grew 
by 7% and accounted for 37.2% of total 
“ POS-GRIP technology is being 
increasingly recognised by 
the industry, and the various 
initiatives and agreements that 
we entered into during the year 
clearly support our view that the 
POS-GRIP friction-grip method 
of engineering technology has 
many more applications beyond 
our traditional organic jack-
up exploration activities, in 
particular subsea.”

sales, an increase of 7.1% on the prior year. 
It is relevant to note that the UK North Sea 
has experienced a slowdown in activity, and 
as highlighted last year in the Wood Review 
there is a need for additional incentives to 
encourage the pursuit of remaining oil and 
gas reserves which last year the Office of 
Budget Responsibility estimated as up to 
24bn barrels remaining equating to 30-40 
years of production.
The rental of exploration wellhead and 
related equipment and services again 
accounted for approximately 95% of revenue 
reflecting the fact that the Company’s organic 
business model is focused on the supply of 
jack-up rental surface exploration wellhead 
equipment and services. Looking to the future 
the Company’s adopted strategy is to broaden 
its wellhead equipment product range to 
begin to address the surface production, 
subsea, and decommissioning markets 
both in the North Sea and internationally. 
Plexus’ wellhead designs are already proven 
for production wells, a significantly larger 
market than jack-up rental exploration. The 
global jack-up drilling market is relatively 
small at c.USD$400m, whereas the global 
wellhead market is estimated at USD$4.5bn. 
Importantly we launched last month our 
new Python subsea wellhead following an 
extensive and successful test programme 
and where we anticipate having a prototype 
in the field some time in calendar year 2016. 
HP/HT rental equipment and related service 
continued to account for the majority of 
sales revenues, rising to £25.23m up from 
£23.30m last year, an increase of 8.3%, 
and accounted for 88.4% of total sales, 
compared to 86.2% in the prior year. The 
growth in HP/HT revenue resulted from 
contracts for a number of existing and new 
customers including Statoil, Maersk, GDF 
Suez, and ConocoPhillips. Standard pressure 
equipment sales increased by 13.3% to 
£1.94m from £1.71m in the prior year, and 
accounted for 6.8% of total sales. Sales 
relating to services provided to support 
existing production wellhead installations 
totalled £0.10m compared to £0.35m last 
year. This year revenues of £0.02m were 
generated by engineering and testing 
compared to £0.37m last year with the 
balance of revenues made up of £1.24m for 
rebillable expenses compared to £1.29m last 
year for items such as freight, shipping and 
equipment hire. Despite the widely reported 
cyclical downturn driven by the major fall in 
oil and gas prices, we continued to invest 
for the future and increased our capital 
expenditure on rental assets to £2.53m as 
compared to £2.32m in the prior year, a year 
on year increase of 9.1%.
Margin
Gross margins have slightly reduced at 
69.9% (compared to 71.1% in the previous 
year) as a result of lower margin mudline 
equipment sales and contract mix. The 
majority of rental activity sales continued to 
be HP/HT which deliver higher margins than 
lower pressure equipment contracts.

Overhead expenses
In line with the increased level of sales activity and the incurring of increased overhead 
associated with the build out of an international growth strategy, particularly in relation to 
Asia where year on year revenues increased 22.4%, total overheads increased to £14.93m 
from £13.93m in the previous year. The additional overhead relates to additional infrastructure 
and personnel to support the organic business and the additional activities surrounding 
and supporting new product development and investment. Increased overhead spend was 
able to be controlled relative to sales and accounted for 52.3% of revenues compared to 
51.5% for the prior year. Overhead staff costs reduced to £7.53m from £8.17m partly due 
to related R&D allocation and reduced bonus levels, whilst the employee headcount at the 
year-end was 157 compared to 144 for the prior year, an increase of 9.0%. Other items 
which increased year on year as a result of the increased activity levels, staff increases, and 
expansion of infrastructure were contract staff, training, health and safety, overseas base 
costs, advertising and marketing, professional fees, and travel and subsistence.
EBITDA
EBITDA for the year (before IFRS 2 share based payment charges of £0.02m) was £9.53m, 
compared to £9.02m (before IFRS 2 share based payment charges of £0.03m) the previous 
year, an increase of 5.7%. EBITDA margin for the year was consistent at 33.4% as compared to 
33.4% last year. The EBITDA performance is the result of maintained operational efficiencies, 
coupled with the higher margins associated with HP/HT rental activity where the proprietary 
nature of the Plexus POS-GRIP friction-grip technology enables Plexus to deliver superior 
performance in terms of enhanced safety, time savings, and operational efficiencies. EBITDA 
is calculated as follows:

CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENT S
Profit before tax
Profit before tax increased to a record 
£5.94m compared to a profit last year of 
£5.38m, an increase of 10.5%. This increase 
has been achieved after absorbing higher 
depreciation and amortisation charges of 
£3.88m, up from £3.40m last year, the largest 
component being depreciation of rental 
assets which increased by 2.2%, reflecting 
the continued investment in Plexus’ wellhead 
rental inventory. Share of profit of associate 
contributed £0.24m and the disposal of the 
associate provided a gain of £0.35m while 
finance income includes a gain of £0.51m 
relating to the derecognition of a financial 
liability. The profit before tax is stated after 
an IFRS 2 charge for share based payments 
under reporting standard IFRS 2; the charge 
for the full year is £0.02m compared to 
£0.03m last year.
Tax
The Group shows an income tax expense of 
£0.51m for the year as compared to £0.80m 
for the prior year. The Group has an effective 
tax rate for the year of 9% (2014: 15%) 
which is below UK corporation tax rates. 
The effective rate of tax was lower due to 
a reduced tax charge arising as a result of 
SME enhanced R&D tax credits, which arise 
from the Group’s significant R&D programme. 
Following the preparation of the prior 
year’s financial statements Plexus engaged 
external consultants to assess the level of 
the R&D claim that could be made for the 
2014 financial year. This resulted in a higher 
level of claim being made than anticipated. 
As a result a credit of £393k is recognised in 
these financial statements as an adjustment 
in respect of prior year’s tax charge. 
Excluding this amount would have increased 
the effective tax rate to 15% (2014:11% 
measured after amending for adjustments in 
respect of prior year’s tax charge).
It is currently anticipated that for the 
foreseeable future, the Group will continue 
to report an effective tax rate that is lower 
than the prevailing UK corporation tax rate. 
This lower effective rate will depend upon 
the continuing eligibility to claim enhanced 
R&D tax credits as part of the on-going 
R&D programme and the expected potential 
reductions in tax rates arising from the 
Patent Box tax regime.
The prior year tax charge has been restated 
by £475k relating to a tax credit arising 
on the exercise of share options. This 
credit was originally recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income whereas, in accordance with IAS 
12 Income Taxes, the amount should 
have more appropriately been recognised 
directly in Equity. Full details relating to the 
restatement are disclosed in note  2 to the 
financial statements.

EPS
The Group reports basic earnings per share 
of 6.40p compared to 5.44p in the prior year, 
an increase of 17.5%.
Cash and Statement of 
Financial Position
The statement of financial position reflects 
the investment in operations during the 
year and in particular on-going capital 
expenditure. The net book value of property, 
plant and equipment including items in the 
course of construction increased to £17.15m 
compared to £13.28m last year. Capital 
expenditure on tangible assets increased 
to £7.02m compared to £3.02m last year 
including the acquisition of a 36,000 sq.ft 
work shop and office facility in Aberdeen 
in September 2014 for £2.40m. The net 
book value of intangible assets, including 
IP rights and R&D, increased by 26.1% to 
£13.17m compared to £10.44m last year. 
Capital expenditure on intangibles totalled 
£3.54m compared to £2.40m last year, an 
increase of 47.5%, of which importantly 
68.3% related to additions in respect of the 
Python subsea wellhead JIP. Receivables 
increased to £7.30m compared to £6.46m 
last year. Net borrowings closed at £2.95m 
(bank loans of £6.28m less cash and cash 
equivalents of £3.33m) compared to net 
cash at bank of £2.35m last year (cash and 
cash equivalents of £6.35m less bank loans 
of £4.00m) reflecting net cash outflow for 
the year of £5.30m (net decrease in cash of 
£3.02m per Statement of Cash Flows plus net 
increase in bank borrowings of £2.28m). This 
closing cash position was after absorbing a 
near doubling of total capital expenditure of 
£10.56m (2014: £5.42m) of which £3.02m 
related to the additional work shop and 
office facility, and disposing in June a 
25% shareholding interest in a private UK 
oil and gas equipment manufacturing and 
engineering company based in Scotland 
for £1.5m cash. The Group’s cash position 
changed materially post period end with 
the subscription by Jereh for new ordinary 
shares representing 5% of the issued 
share capital of Plexus for circa £8m net 
of expenses as part of the terms of the 
Licencing Agreement transaction also 
entered into post period end with Jereh. 
Post period end, the Group’s bank facilities 
have been renewed with Bank of Scotland 
Corporate and comprise £6m working capital 
lending facilities, and a £1.5m five year term 
loan which was entered into during the last 
financial year to part fund the acquisition 
of the additional Aberdeen facilities and 
which currently stands at £1.275m. These 
facilities combined with cash balances are 
anticipated to be adequate to meet on-going 
capital expenditure, R&D and related project 
commitments.
Intellectual Property (‘IP’)
The Group carries in its statement of financial 
position goodwill and intangible assets 
of £13.93m, an increase of 24.4% from 
£11.20m last year, reflecting the Group’s 
on-going investment in and commitment to 
the development of its proprietary POS-GRIP 
technology, the most important elements 
of which continued to be in relation to 
the POS-GRIP friction-grip method of 
engineering and the new Python subsea 
wellhead development JIP. The Directors 
have considered whether there have been 
any indications of impairment of its IP and 
have concluded, following a detailed asset 
impairment review, that there have been no 
such indications. The Directors therefore 
consider the current carrying values to be 
appropriate. Indications of impairment are 
considered annually.

friction-grip method of engineering and 
related IP. As Stephen Boyle the RBS Chief 
Economist recently said when addressing the 
oil and gas industry in Aberdeen, “Doubling 
down on innovation and productivity are 
becoming of greater importance than 
ever before”, and we certainly subscribe 
to that sentiment. Indeed Plexus’ R&D 
related activity prior to and during the 
year culminated in the achievement of a 
number of milestones and contracts which 
would not have been possible without such 
investment and related product developing 
and testing. Of particular note in relation to 
our organic business a new customer Total 
awarded a £3.3m contract for the supply 
of jack-up drilling wellhead equipment for 
a Ultra HP/HT (17,000 – 19,000psi) gas 
exploration well in the North Sea, offshore 
Norway where Plexus was identified as the 
most suitable supplier due to the unique 
ability to offer a through the BOP capability 
while supporting casing at the ocean floor 
on its proprietary mudline hanger system. 
As well as new and superior applications 
related to our organic jack-up exploration 
drilling business, we also gained traction 
with a number of new R&D driven product 
developments. One of these is our POS-SET 
Connector which is designed to re-establish 
a connection onto rough conductor casing 
previously cut above the seabed to facilitate 
tie-back or abandonment operations. 
Further proof of the unique advantages and 
capabilities of our friction-grip technology is 
the fact that full scale testing has shown 
that our connector can achieve 80% of the 
bending and tensile strength of the parent 
pipe, which is significantly better than 
conventional connector options can achieve. 
This could be a significant opportunity for 
Plexus, and Oil and Gas UK have stated that 
well plugging and abandonment expenditure 
could total £4.5bn from 2013 to 2022. This 
product follows on from our previously 
announced HP/HT Tie-Back connector which 
for the first time allows the reconnection 
of production casing to pre-drilled HP/HT 
exploration and production wells to the same 
standards as casing couplings. Full product 
development and qualification testing has 
been completed, and as this product can 
deliver significant time and cost savings to an 
operator interest continues to be shown by 
the industry. A second product extension is a 
post period end collaboration with Aquaterra 
to jointly supply HP/HT dual barrier marine 
risers utilising Plexus’ POS-GRIP technology 
to provide a safer, technically superior and 
cost efficient solution for use on jack-up 
rigs, initially in the North Sea market. What 
is important here in terms of the uniquely

enabling capabilities of POS-GRIP is that 
whilst marine risers exist for low pressure 
applications, as well as certain bespoke 
heavy wall higher pressure risers, the ‘Dual 
Barrier High Pressure Riser’ will be the first 
in the industry for HP/HT wells. The majority 
of our R&D expenditure has been related 
to the important subsea market and post 
period end we announced a collaboration 
agreement with CNOOC and RST to explore 
commercial opportunities for shallow water 
subsea and crossover wellhead production 
systems for oil and gas activities in China 
which fits well with our strategic focus 
on Asian opportunities. Finally our most 
significant R&D driven project, the new 
Python subsea wellhead JIP, not only 
gained BG as an additional and valuable 
JIP member, but the completed design was 
officially launched at OE2015, Europe’s 
biggest oil and gas show last month. Python 
has been designed to a new best in class and 
safest standard for subsea wellheads, and is 
engineered to be simple, whilst offering a 
range of unique and superior technologically 
advanced features, including ‘instant casing 
hanger lockdown’, and secures hangers with 
HG seals which provide direct, metal-to-
metal, weld-quality, high integrity sealing. 
Uniquely, many complex components used 
in competing conventional subsea wellhead 
designs such as lock rings, lockdown sleeves 
and wear bushings are eliminated, which 
results in greater reliability and fewer 
installation trips. R&D spend increased by 
28.9%, including the cost of building new 
test fixtures, to £4.12m from £3.19m in 
the prior year, and will continue during the 
2015/16 financial year as the Python subsea 
JIP nears completion and the POS-GRIP 
product expands into the surface production 
and connectors market sectors.
IFRS 2 (Share Based Payments)
IFRS 2 charges have been included in the 
accounts, in line with reporting standards. 
The fair value of share based payments has 
been computed independently by specialist 
consultants and is amortised evenly over the 
expected vesting period from the date of 
grant. The charge for the year was £0.02m 
which compares to £0.03m last year.
Dividends
The Company announced on 24 March 2015 
the payment of an increased interim dividend 
of 0.51p per share which was approved for 
payment on 22 April 2015.
In further recognition of the Group’s on-
going progress and confidence in the future 
the Directors have decided to propose a 
182.3% increase in the final dividend of 
1.75p per share for the year ending 30 June 
2015 compared to 0.62p last year, making 
a total dividend for the financial year of

this year in recognition of the Group’s 
strong balance sheet and cash position, and 
will be recommended for formal approval 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 10 December 2015. Subject to this the

OPERATIONS REVIEW
The main operational developments during 
the year were of both an organic and 
an international strategic nature. As the 
reputation of our proprietary POS-GRIP 
friction-grip method of engineering continues 
to grow and as our target mar ke t expands from 
our traditional jack-up exploration sector to 
surface production and subsea exploration 
and related new product developments, it is 
important that our operational capabilities 
across all disciplines, whether buildings, 
plant, and equipment or personnel are able 
to support such developments. Our ability to 
continue to invest in operations during the 
year was driven by our core jack-up drilling 
business and contracts awarded by existing 
and new customers the most significant of 
which were as follows:
•  July 2014 – £0.6m additional well order 
signed with Centrica to supply surface 
wellhead and mudline equipment 
services for Southern North Sea 
exploration
•  August 2014 – £1.0m order from 
Det Norske for the supply of HP/HT 
equipment for an oil and gas appraisal 
well offshore Norway with a value of 
£1.0m
•  October 2014 – significant order signed 
with BG Group to supply HP/HT surface 
wellhead and mudline equipment 
services for a standard pressure 
exploration well in the UKCS
•  November 2014 – £1.9m HP/HT wellhead 
equipment order for an exploration well 
in the UKCS from a major oil and gas 
operator
•  November 2014 – £0.9m Det Norske, 
Norway orders HP/HT equipment for 
an oil and gas appraisal well offshore 
Norway and is the seventh Det Norske 
well to use Plexus equipment since 
2012
•  January 2015 – £1.6m contract with 
Shell Brunei under an existing four year 
contract which runs to 2016 for three 
additional exploration wells
•  April 2015 – USD$0.8m new customer 
contract Cardon IV in new territory 
Venezuela awarded for the supply of 
equipment for a development well 
offshore Venezuela
•  May 2015 – £1.0m Premier Oil Norge 
order HP/HT wellhead equipment for 
an exploration well in the Norwegian 
Central North Sea
•  May 2015 – £1.25m third well equipment 
order from Maersk Oil under a contract 
signed in 2014 for an offshore well in 
the Danish sector of the North Sea
•  June 2015 – £3.3m ultra HP/HT 
wellhead equipment order received 
from new customer Total for potentially 
the highest pressure well ever drilled 
in the North Sea estimated at 17,000 – 
19,000psi, offshore Norway

To date our core organic jack-up exploration 
business, and associated on-going 
investment in wellhead rental inventory 
together with the infrastructure, systems, 
and processes needed to support it have 
continued to generate the majority of our 
revenues. However as the North Sea began 
to experience a significant and widely 
reported slowdown, it was essential that 
we increased our efforts to extend our 
international presence. As such, we secured 
a major licensing agreement with our new 
major trading partner Jereh for China and 
other important territories post period end. 
International growth continued with wells 
won in Brunei with Shell Brunei, and our 
first ventures into China with Shell China, 
and into Venezuela with Cardon IV (a 50:50 
Joint Venture between Repsol, S.A. and eni 
S.p.A). The operational base in Singapore 
supported wells in South East Asia and 
investment in personnel and infrastructure 
positions Singapore as a hub to support 
anticipated growth in the region. Supply 
chain rationalisation and emphasis on forging 
partnerships with our suppliers has resulted 
in reduction of overall risk and costs in the 
critical areas of our supply chain.
Further emphasis was placed on Asia with the 
formation of a new Malaysian company PPA 
in conjunction with a local Malaysian oil and 
gas partner, IPS. The establishment of PPA is 
a key milestone in Plexus’ strategy to create 
a fully operational Asian business presence 
to increase the supply of our pioneering POS-
GRIP wellhead equipment and services to the 
important Australian, Brunei, Indonesian, 
Malaysian, Thai, and Singaporean oil and gas 
exploration and production markets. At the 
time of the establishment of PPA the key task 
was the necessity to obtain a local Petronas 
licence, and importantly post period end 
in July PPA was awarded the licence. The 
licence enables PPA to manufacture and 
supply Plexus’ POS-GRIP wellhead technology 
into the Malaysian market and we hope over 
time will act as a springboard to becoming 
a major supplier of wellhead equipment in 
the region. To support these plans Plexus is 
slowly building the number of employees in 
the region, and will also be sending more 
personnel to China from Aberdeen to support 
the training and knowledge transfer process 
with Jereh at its headquarters in Yantai. It 
is anticipated that the Singapore business 
unit will in the future establish its ability to 
refurbish and inspect wellhead equipment for 
servicing the local market, which simplifies 
logistics from Aberdeen and reduces costs, 
whilst being able to offer customers a more 
responsive service.
In anticipation of future growth, not only 
internationally but also in Europe we doubled 
the size of our operational headquarters in 
Dyce, Aberdeen through the purchase of 
a circa 36,000 sq.ft work shop and office 
facility for £2.4m. The new facility is situated 
immediately adjacent to the existing 36,500 
sq.ft site in Aberdeen, and was previously 
occupied by leading oil services company 
Baker Hughes. This major increase in Plexus’ 
operational capacity is necessary not only for 
supporting our rental wellhead business, but 
also to ensure that we are able to support 
and respond to greater anticipated activity 
associated with our recently launched 
Python subsea wellhead, and other new 
product developments such as the POS-SET 
Connector. At a time when cost control and 
indeed cost savings are paramount within 
the industry, the additional space will also 
enable Plexus to consolidate its work facilities 
in Aberdeen, thereby significantly improving 
our logistical efficiencies especially due to 
the close proximity of our existing building.
As reviewed in the R&D section of 
our Strategic Report, as a proprietary 
technology led business investment, time 
and effort continually go into engineering

improvements and new inventions. 
During the year a number of such product 
development initiatives came to fruition 
and have now either arrived at a point 
where active promotion to the wider global 
marketplace can begin, for example, our HP/
HT Tie-Back product originally sponsored by 
Maersk as well as our POS-SET Connector 
to facilitate abandonment which has already 
been ordered by Centrica; or will be able 
to be marketed in the near future such 
as our new Python subsea wellhead. Such 
developments have to be properly supported, 
and our ability to respond to technical 
enquiries and the physical deployment and 
installation of equipment is key, and we 
therefore ensure that appropriate training, 
methods, procedures and systems are in 
place, and continually reviewed to meet our 
customer expectations and requirements. 
An interesting development that we have 
recently seen during the current cycle of 
low oil prices and focus on cost savings, 
and which is relevant to the unique nature 
of our technology and product designs, is 
one where operators’ engineers are looking 
more closely at technology that can offer 
a range of technical benefits from features 
such as monitoring, together with simplicity 
and avoidance of ‘in the field problems’ 
caused by conventional wellhead equipment 
that can arise for example from the use of 
lock rings and lock down sleeves. The more 
complicated nature of conventional wellhead 
equipment designs can lead to significant 
cost penalties whether direct or indirect 
through delayed or lost production. We hope 
this will prove positive for Plexus in the 
long-term.
Staff and staff development is essential for 
our current and future success. During the 
year there was further focus on recruitment 
with year end total employee numbers 
increasing from 144 to 157. As we expand 
our business internationally and support 
the development of our operational base in 
Singapore, we have recruited a number of 
local personnel each of which have enjoyed 
a significant induction and training period in 
the UK to support an effective transition of 
established working practices in the region. 
Particular emphasis was placed on our sales 
and marketing capabilities and a new sales 
strategy based around more forward looking 
market data for forthcoming projects was 
implemented post period end. This initiative 
is already showing positive signs of enabling 
us to engage with customers at an early 
stage of their well planning and equipment 
specification and selection process. 
Legislative changes have featured heavily 
during this period and in particular, we 
met our pension auto enrolment targets as 
stipulated by government. The role of field 
service technicians within Plexus is one of the 
most pivotal roles within the organisation, 
being integral to the safe operation of our 
equipment and the direct interface with 
our customers. The focus on training and 
competence within this group remains a 
key target for the business, bolstered by

a new assessment centre led recruitment 
process which successfully saw five new 
field service technicians being recruited. In 
recognition of the importance that we place 
on such initiatives at a time when safety 
is so key for the industry, we were also 
delighted to achieve a major milestone with 
the accreditation and approval by Offshore 
Petroleum Industry Training Organisation 
(‘OPITO’) for our competency management 
system (‘CMS’) known as Competency@
Plexus. OPITO is globally recognised and the 
accreditation is continually requested during 
tender and contract reviews by customers.
Health and Safety is a key operational 
discipline and Plexus remains fully committed 
to delivering the highest safety standards. 
We continue to manage our safety risks 
through assessment, implementation of 
controls, continual monitoring, and hiring 
and developing staff to meet the competency 
levels required. We encourage our personnel 
to get involved, have confidence to intervene 
and to challenge any unsafe act or condition 
and to ensure transparent reporting of 
incidents that meets our desired safety 
culture. Recent audits by Lloyds Register 
Quality Assurance (‘LRQA’), the world 
leading independent provider of Business 
Assurance services demonstrate that we are 
operating to the recognised industry and 
national standards, with our ISO 90001 and 
BS OHSA 18001 certification maintained. We 
recognise that the health and well-being 
of our employees is a crucial feature of 
our HSE and HR strategy, and building on 
our achievement of our Bronze and Silver 
Healthy Working Lives Awards presented 
in 2013, we received during the year our 
Healthy Working Lives Gold Award.
IT services and support are of course 
essential for any modern business and 
investment in IT has continued in both 
staff numbers and infrastructure. The 
IT infrastructure has undergone major 
networking and telecommunication upgrades 
to support the continued growth of Plexus 
internationally. These upgrades are required 
to ensure delivery of flexible and integrated 
business information systems. The bespoke 
nature of our in-house software development 
allows the IT department to quickly react to 
the ever changing demands of the business. 
It provides important information for 
decision making, providing managers access 
to accurate business data for planning 
and analysis. The recent updates to our 
sales system have given better visibility 
of worldwide sales opportunities to both 
the sales team and senior management. 
Plexus is committed to ensuring a safe 
and secure electronic environment and as 
a wide range of cyber risks are an ever 
evolving and on-going risk for all companies 
the IT department is working towards ISO 
27001:2013 accreditation which will help 
ensure that both internal and external 
risks are minimised. Certification provides 
customers and key stakeholders with the 
confidence that security risks are taken 
and addressed seriously. The certification 
process is rigorous and is expected to be 
completed in financial quarter 4 2016.
Finally, Plexus has to date, chosen not to 
own its own manufacturing capacity but 
it had previously acquired a 25% interest 
in a private UK engineering company 
which manufactures specialist oil and 
gas equipment. As Plexus becomes more 
international, and with stronger relationships 
developing with partners such as Jereh in 
China and IPS in Malaysia it was decided 
that higher cost base UK manufacturing was 
non-core and this interest was disposed of 
in June 2015.

STRATEGY AND 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Technology
Plexus’ unique and patented POS-GRIP 
friction-grip technology has wide ranging 
applications both within and outside of 
the oil and gas industry. It is important to 
remember that POS-GRIP is a method of 
engineering and not a product in its own 
right, and where there is an opportunity for 
the technology to improve upon conventional 
products, we look to integrate POS-GRIP into 
the product so that the benefits together 
with HG sealing can be realised. In simple 
terms POS-GRIP technology is based on a 
very simple concept. A compressive force 
is applied on the outside of a wellhead or 
pipe, to flex it inwards. As the bore of the 
vessel moves inwards, it makes contact with 
an inner pipe (or hanger) on the inside. 
Sufficient contact force is generated to fix 
the inner member (hanger) in place through 
friction between the two components. The 
Company’s strategy is primarily focused on 
delivering the highest standard of wellhead 
design for the upstream oil and gas markets, 
which is already proven to be uniquely 
advantageous in terms of safety features, 
operational efficiency, and cost savings for 
jack-up drilling HP/HT applications where 
Plexus has the majority market share in the 
North Sea.
POS-GRIP wellhead designs deliver many 
advantages over conventional “slip and seal” 
and “mandrel hanger” wellhead technologies 
for surface exploration and production 
activities, and in due course for subsea 
operation with our new Python subsea 
wellhead. These include larger metal-to-
metal seal areas, virtual elimination of 
movement between parts, fewer components, 
simplified design and assembly, enhanced 
corrosion resistance, simpler manufacture, 
long term integrity, annulus management, 
and reduced installation cost. In particular 
our subsea wellhead eliminates the need 
for wearbushings, pack-offs, lock-rings, and 
lockdown sleeves, whilst delivering instant 
rigid lock-down in all directions whilst 
being fully reversible for ease of workover, 
side-tracking or abandonment. At a time 
when unconventional HP/HT and deep-
water reservoir developments are growing 
in importance, the oil and gas industry is 
facing increasing technical challenges to 
meet rigorous regulatory and health and 
safety requirements, while having to ensure 
the commerciality of operations during the 
current volatile oil price environment. POS-
GRIP wellheads address many of these 
challenges, whilst also being able to deliver 
significant cost savings which in the case 
of our new subsea wellhead design have 
been independently estimated at up to 
USD$10m for a deep-water well. In our view, 
 EXPANDING INTO GLOBAL MARKETS
238506 Plexus p028-p045 (Strategic Report).indd   39 10/11/2015   23:56 40
PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
Plexus’ equipment sets a new standard and, 
having secured a leading position in jack-
up exploration drilling, is well placed to 
break into the significantly larger and more 
mainstream volume production wellhead and 
subsea markets, particularly in conjunction 
with partners such as our new licensee Jereh.
The superiority and potential of our POS-GRIP 
technology is being increasingly recognised 
by the industry, and the various initiatives 
and agreements that we entered into during 
the year with a range of industry partners 
such as Jereh, COSL, and Aquaterra clearly 
support our view that the POS-GRIP friction-
grip method of engineering technology 
has many more applications beyond our 
traditional organic jack-up exploration 
activities. Of course as with any major ‘game 
changing’ technology that has the potential 
to become a new standard, there have to 
be sound and genuine reasons for customers 
selecting our equipment. Apart from our 
operational time saving and related safety 
benefits, at the engineering level we believe 
that our technology can uniquely raise the 
integrity of wellhead testing and sealing to 
that of premium couplings, which supports 
our claim that wellheads should not be, and 
indeed now do not need to be, the ‘weak link’ 
in the well architecture chain. In support of 
these important principles an in depth report 
commissioned by the Company from OTM 
Consulting Inc, (‘OTM’), an international 
independent engineering consultancy, 
concluded that Plexus wellheads using its 
HG metal seals, offer the “best possible 
sealing performance through a metal-to-
metal seal that none of the existing designs 
can match. Moreover, sealing performance 
is not affected by pressure/temperature 
cycles as there are no movable components”. 
OTM concludes that after evaluating POS-
GRIP sealing technology against existing 
competing technologies, “it is the best and 
safest technology due to its enhanced safety 
performance”.
Business Model and Markets
Plexus’ traditional market has been the 
supply of adjustable rental wellhead 
equipment and associated running tools for 
jack-up exploration drilling in the UKCS. The 
exploration wellhead contracts are supplied 
from a rental fleet inventory, the majority 
of which are HP/HT wellheads as these are 
increasingly demanded not just for HP/
HT drilling but also for standard pressure 
wells where added benefits are appreciated. 
Initially this was only for standard pressure 
equipment of 10,000 psi or less, but with 
the development of POS-GRIP HP/HT 
equipment, Plexus has secured nearly 100% 
of the UKCS market, and commands a large 
share of the European North Sea thanks to 
the superior nature of its technology. The 
rental business has since expanded globally 
into other territories such as Australia, 
Brunei, Cameroon, China, Egypt, Malaysia, 
and Venezuela. Plexus also provides service 
technicians who install and maintain our 
equipment at various stages during the 
drilling of a well.
The Company’s focus on rental exploration 
allows customers to experience for 
themselves the many benefits of POS-
GRIP technology on temporary exploration 
wells, rather than those used for production 
where typically the wellhead equipment is in 
place for the life of the well. However with 
new partner Jereh we are working closely 
to develop a Plexus POS-GRIP surface 
production wellhead suitable for the volume 
Chinese land market. In addition renting out 
equipment from a growing inventory enables 
Plexus to outsource all of its wellhead 
manufacturing to a select number of third 
parties, and as a result avoid having to invest 
in and develop in-house manufacturing 
capabilities with attendant fixed overheads. 
Such a strategy led to the disposal of a 25% 
shareholding interest in a private UK oil and 
gas equipment manufacturing company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENT S
The jack-up wellhead exploration market 
is estimated to be worth circa USD$400m 
per annum. By contrast the combined value 
of the global exploration and production 
wellhead market was estimated by OTM at 
USD$4.5bn in 2014. Clearly the size of the 
markets that Plexus is only now beginning 
to address is far in excess of its traditional 
organic business, and even with the well 
reported decline in capex by the operating 
companies the upside of moving into these 
market sectors is substantial. As a result, 
in tandem with continuing to grow the jack-
up rental business in both its traditional and 
new market territories, Plexus is focused in 
particular on expanding into the mainstream 
volume production wellheads market, and 
the increasingly important subsea market. 
In the case of the subsea market Douglas-
Westwood expects deep-water capex to rise 
post 2016, and sees expenditure growing by 
almost 69% compared with the preceding 
five year period, totalling USD$210bn 
between 2015 and 2019, driven by Africa 
and the Americas which account for 82% of 
capex.
In light of volatile oil markets which saw 
Brent Crude fall during the financial year 
from circa USD$112 on 1 July 2014 to circa 
USD$63 on 30 June 2015, operators are 
increasingly focused on securing significant 
cost savings across their operations, and 
there is an industry wide push for savings at 
all levels of drilling operations. With this in 
mind, it is compelling that Plexus’ equipment 
generates material cost savings for the 
operator, while at the same time delivering 
a superior wellhead solution. Importantly, 
Plexus’ surface jack-up wellheads can be 
supplied at a rental cost that equates to 
less than the time savings for the operator, 
thereby making them cost negative. 
Similarly, our new Python subsea wellhead 
will also deliver substantial cost savings 
benefits, and we hope to be able to run the 
first prototype in the second half of calendar 
year 2016. Cost saving and safety features 
such as these underpin the value of Plexus’ 
IP and underpins Plexus’ growth potential as 
it enters new international markets directly 
or through licensees.
Strategy and the Future
Plexus has pioneered a safer, more cost 
effective, reliable and technically superior 
wellhead utilising POS-GRIP technology 
which we rent to many leading oil and gas 
operators worldwide for surface exploration 
jack-up drilling activities. Having battled with 
incumbent suppliers which have dominated 
the industry for decades, (where for example 
just five companies account for over 90% 
of the subsea wellhead business), Plexus’ 
wellhead equipment is gaining traction 
and major operators awareness of our

wellhead systems is increasing. To date our 
equipment has been used in over 400 wells 
worldwide by the likes of BG, BHP Billiton, 
BP, ConocoPhillips, Maersk, Shell, Statoil, 
Petronas, Tullow Oil, and Wintershall, which 
we believe is a testament to the commercial 
strength of Plexus’ offering.
Plexus’ long-term goal is to develop POS-GRIP 
technology as a new industry standard for 
wellhead design, and to continue to develop 
additional new products, which will also offer 
multiple benefits and advantages in terms of 
improved safety, functionality, and cost and 
time savings. For example Plexus’ connector 
technology is ideal for high integrity, low 
fatigue connector applications. Wellhead 
connectors, riser connectors, subsea jumper 
connectors, pipeline connectors, and even 
vessel mooring connectors can all benefit 
from the simplicity of POS-GRIP. A key factor 
in many of these commercial opportunities 
is our superior metal-to-metal sealing 
capability with unprecedented reliability, and 
true weld quality sealing, resulting from the 
huge amount of preload that we generate 
which prevents any possible movement at 
the seal interface over the life of the field.
We believe we have merely scratched the 
surface despite the excellent growth seen to 
date, and that despite the current industry 
wide slowdown we believe that we can still 
make inroads into the sizeable markets that 
to date we have not addressed. As a company 
we are implementing a strategy to expand 
from a dominant position in the North Sea 
into new geographical areas, as evidenced 
by the growth we have reported in FY 2015 
in Europe and Asia.
In an effort to continue to grow international 
revenues as a proportion of sales, and in 
particular access the growth of the Asian 
HP/HT market, we have established an Asian 
hub with offices in Singapore and Malaysia 
as we seek to further position ourselves in 
a number of countries including Australia, 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore 
and Thailand. With this in mind, we are 
working to re-locate a proportion of our 
wellhead rental equipment to Singapore to 
support and strengthen our current regional 
relationships and broaden our customer base 
outside of the UK.
Importantly, as well as establishing new 
regional hubs, and pursuing licencing 
agreements and strategic partners as a key 
part of strategy to continue increasing our 
global footprint, post period end we secured 
Jereh as a licencing partner in China; and 
secured a Petronas Licence in Malaysia 
through our joint venture entity. We are also 
in active dialogue with regards expansion 
into Russia and CIS countries as part of 
our wider focus on becoming less reliant on 
the declining North Sea area and seizing a 
foothold in major and emerging oil and gas 
economies.
In addition to our future strategy to 
accelerate the adoption of our POS-GRIP 
technology by the wider oil and gas market 
through licencing agreements, we are also 
developing new product lines to generate 
new revenue streams for Plexus. The launch 
of our Python Subsea Wellhead marks such 
a step. As mentioned the formal launch 
marked the first commercial availability 
of our POS-GRIP enabled subsea wellhead 
system, where we are looking to deploy a 
prototype offshore during the second half of

calendar year 2016. With over six majors, 
including the likes of BG, eni, Maersk, Shell, 
and Total, having supported the development 
of the wellhead and its launch at OE2015, 
we are actively working towards finding an 
operator to secure this first deployment 
by either one of the original JIP partners 
or another operator. In terms of market 
competitors there are five major suppliers of 
subsea wellheads, these are Aker, Cameron, 
DrillQuip, FMC, and GE who are all major 
multi-billion dollar corporations. However 
with a unique technology that is safer and 
more cost effective we have a powerful story 
to tell and the progress we have made to 
date demonstrates how large the potential 
is for future growth and value creation. The 
subsea systems market had been estimated 
to be valued at USD$41.6bn between 2009-
2013, including subsea trees, manifolds, 
wellheads, pumps, chokes and valves. The 
subsea wellhead market is therefore a 
sub-sector of this market, which broking 
house Numis has estimated to be valued 
at c.USD$10-12bn between 2014-2017. If 
Python is successfully commercialised this 
would be a significant step towards achieving 
our strategy of increasing adoption and 
brand awareness of our POS-GRIP product 
given the market size at hand.
R&D spend is also central to our strategy of 
investing time and capital into new product 
development. Excluding the cost of building 
test fixtures R&D spend increased 46.7% to 
£3.47m during the last financial year. R&D 
has been spent on such products as WellTree, 
the HP/HT Tie-Back connector, the new 
POS-SET Connector and the Python subsea 
wellhead. All of these product innovations 
are in line with Plexus’ strategy to extend 
our POS-GRIP product reach into new and 
commercially attractive markets. Successful 
R&D activity leads to new inventions, product 
designs, and IP. Plexus continues to pursue 
an active strategy of protecting existing 
and securing new IP and patents, and we 
have a number of exciting and we believe 
valuable patent applications registered or in 
the process of being applied for.

Principal Risks and 
Risk Management
There are a number of potential risks and 
uncertainties that could have an impact on 
the Group’s performance which include the 
following.
 (a)  Political and environmental 
risks
We participate in a global market where the 
oil and gas reserves and their extraction and 
oil and gas prices can be severely impacted 
by changes in the political, operational, and 
environmental landscape, particularly in 
relation to climate change and CO
2
 emissions 
relating to the oil and gas industry. The 
introduction of sanctions is one example of 
such a risk, and in extreme circumstances 
even regime change, and a volatile oil price 
is another where a severe fall in oil prices 
can have a significant adverse impact on 
customers’ drilling activities and associated 
capital expenditure. As a supplier to the 
industry we in turn can be adversely affected 
by such events which can disrupt the 
markets, and affect our ability to execute 
work for customers and/or collect payment 
for services performed. To help address such 
risks, the Group has continued to broaden its 
geographic footprint and customer base and 
applies a stringent approach to credit control.
 (b) Technology
The Group is still at a relatively early stage 
in the commercialisation, marketing and 
application of its POS-GRIP friction-grip 
technology beyond jack-up rental exploration 
wellhead equipment, both with regard to 
expanding into the surface production and 
subsea markets, as well as new product 
development. Current and future contracts 
may be adversely affected by technology 
related factors outside the Group’s control. 
These may include unforeseen equipment 
design issues, test delays during a contract 
and final testing and delayed acceptances 
of deliveries, which could lead to possible 
abortive expenditure and write downs, 
reputational risk and potential customer 
claims or onerous contractual terms. Such 
risks may materially impact on the Group. 
To mitigate this risk the Group continues 
to invest in developing and proving the 
technology and has a policy of on-going 
training of our own personnel and where 
appropriate our customers.
 (c) Competitive risk
The Group operates in highly competitive 
markets and often competes directly with 
large multi-national corporations who have 
greater resources and are more established. 
Product innovation or technical advances 
by competitors could adversely affect the 
Group and lead to a slower take up of the 
Group’s proprietary technology. To mitigate 
this risk Plexus maintains an extensive suite 
of patents and trademarks, and actively 
continues to develop and improve its IP to 
ensure that it continues to be able to offer 
unique superior wellhead design solutions.
 (d) Operational
Shortage of experienced personnel in the oil 
and gas industry is widely recognised and could 
deprive Plexus of key personnel necessary 
for operational activities and research and 
development initiatives. To mitigate this risk 
Plexus has developed effective recruitment 
and training procedures, which combined 
with the appeal of working in a company with 
unique technology and engineering solutions 
has enabled us to continue to grow our staff 
numbers, and achieve to date a low rate of 
turnover of personnel.

CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENT S
 (e)  Liquidity and finance 
requirements
In an economic climate that remains 
volatile and unpredictable it has become 
increasingly possible for both existing and 
potential sources of finance to be closed 
to businesses for a variety of reasons that 
have not been an issue in the past. Some of 
these may even relate to the lender itself in 
terms of its own capital ratios and lending 
capacity. Although this is a potential risk 
the Group took appropriate steps during the 
year to mitigate this risk by successfully 
renewing and extending its bank facilities 
with Bank of Scotland. The Group is required 
to meet certain financial criteria agreed as 
covenants in connection with its bank loans 
and monthly management accounts are 
prepared and reviewed against the covenant 
requirements to ensure that the Group’s 
obligations can be met.
 (f) Credit
The main credit risk is attributable to 
trade receivables. As the majority of the 
Group’s customers are large international oil 
companies the risk of non-payment is much 
reduced, and therefore is more likely to be 
related to client satisfaction and/or trade 
sanctions. Customer payments can involve 
extended period of times especially from 
countries where exchange control regulations 
can delay the transfer of funds outside 
those countries. The Group has credit risk 
management policies in place and exposure 
to credit risk is monitored continuously.
Risk assessment
The Board has established an on-going 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group. One of the Board’s control documents 
is a detailed “Risks assessment & management 
document” which categorises risks in terms 
of – business (including IT), compliance, 
finance, cash, debtors, fixed assets, other 
debtors/prepayments, creditors, legal, and 
personnel. These risks are assessed on a 
regular basis and could be associated with 
a variety of internal and external sources 
including regulatory requirements, disruption 
to information systems, control breakdowns 
and social, ethical, environmental and health 
and safety issues.

REPORT
INTRODUCTION
Although the rules of AIM do not require the 
Company to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), the Company 
fully supports the principles set out in the 
Code and will attempt to comply wherever 
possible, given both the size and resources 
available to the Company.
THE BOARD
The Board of Directors comprises three 
Executive Directors and four independent 
Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the 
Chairman.
The Board meets regularly throughout the 
year and receives a Board pack in respect 
of each meeting together with any other 
material deemed necessary for the Board to 
discharge its duties. The Board is responsible 
for formulating, reviewing and approving the 
Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of 
expenditure and acquisitions.
During the year to 30 June 2015 the Board 
met a total of twelve times.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established two committees; 
Audit and Remuneration each having written 
terms of delegated responsibilities.
It is considered that the composition and 
size of the Board does not warrant the 
appointment of a Nominations Committee 
and appointments are dealt with by the 
whole of the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises two Non-
executive Directors, J. Jeffrey Thrall and 
Christopher Fraser and is scheduled to meet 
twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s 
role to provide formal and transparent 
arrangements for considering how to apply 
financial reporting and internal control best 
practice, whilst maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the independent auditors 
of the Group. In order to comply with best 
practice that at least one member has 
relevant financial experience, the Chairman 
of the Board sits on the Audit Committee.
During the year to 30 June 2015 the Audit 
Committee met on two occasions.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises two 
Non-executive Directors, J. Jeffrey Thrall and 
Christopher Fraser and meets at least once 
a year. It is the Remuneration Committee’s 
role to establish a formal and transparent 
policy on Executive remuneration and to 
set remuneration packages for individual 
Directors.
During the year to 30 June 2015 the 
Remuneration Committee met on three 
occasions.

APPOINTMENT OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Charles Jones was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 18 September 2014. As required 
by Article 69.(B) of the Company’s Articles of Association, Charles Jones retired at the

re-election. The resolution to re-elect him as a director was passed without dissent.
RETIREMENT AND RE-ELECTION
Craig Hendrie and Christopher Fraser are to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting 
and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and

uses the annual report and accounts, interim statement and website (www.plexusplc.com) to 
provide further information to shareholders.

educating the workforce to provide as safe a working environment as possible.

FINANCIAL REPORTING
The directors have a commitment to best 
practice for the Group’s external financial 
reporting in order to present a balanced 
and comprehensible assessment of the 
Group’s financial position and prospects to 
its shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers and other third parties. This 
commitment encompasses all published 
information including but not limited to the 
year end and interim financial statements, 
regulatory news announcements and other 
public information. The Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities for preparing the 
accounts may be found on page  61.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the systems 
of internal control and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. Such systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risks and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material mis-statement or 
loss. Each year, on behalf of the Board, the 
Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of these systems. This is achieved primarily 
by considering the risks potentially affecting 
the Group and discussions with the external 
auditors.
The Group does not currently have an 
internal audit function due to the small size 
of the administrative function and the high 
level of Director review and authorisation of 
transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is 
completed once a year and is reviewed and 
commended by the Audit Committee for 
approval by the Board. The Group’s results, 
as compared against budget, are reported to 
the Board on a monthly basis and discussed 
in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance 
cover in respect of legal actions against the 
Directors as well as against material loss or 
claims against the Group and reviews the 
adequacy of the cover regularly.
The Group has established procedures 
whereby employees may in confidence raise 
concerns relating to matters of potential 
fraud or other improprieties, as well as 
health and safety issues.
RESERVED MATTERS
The board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision which includes 
the setting of Company goals, objectives, 
budgets and other plans. Board papers, 
comprising an agenda and formal reports and 
briefing papers, are sent to the directors in 
advance of each meeting. All directors have 
access to independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense, if required, as well 
as to the advice and services of the company 
secretary.
RISK ASSESSMENT
The Board has established an on-going 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group. The risks are assessed on a regular 
basis and could be associated with a variety 
of internal and external sources including 
regulatory requirements, disruption to 
information systems, control breakdowns 
and social, ethical, environmental and health 
and safety issues.

INTRODUCTION
Companies trading on AIM are not required 
to provide a formal remuneration report. 
However, in line with current best practice 
this report provides information to enable 
a greater level of understanding as to how 
Directors’ remuneration is determined.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board 
is responsible for considering Directors’ 
remuneration packages and makes its 
recommendations to the Board. The 
Committee comprises two Non-executive 
Directors J. Jeffrey Thrall and Christopher 
Fraser, and is required to meet at least once 
a year.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and 
motivate high calibre executives capable of 
achieving the Group’s objectives. Executive 
Directors receive salaries, annual bonuses 
(as and when appropriate), medical cover, 
and pension scheme contributions which are 
intended to be competitive within the sector 
in which the Group operates.
The Committee determines the policy 
of the overall remuneration package for 
Executive Directors and other senior 
executives. Basic salaries and benefits 
of all employees are reviewed every year, 
and the Group and the Committee as part 
of this annual process seeks advice from 
external remuneration consultants. In 
reviewing salaries, consideration is given to 
personal performance, the Group’s overall 
performance and external comparative 
information.
An annual performance bonus is payable to 
Executive Directors and senior staff, and 
each year an exercise is undertaken, again 
in conjunction with external remuneration 
consultants to look at market comparisons, 
benchmarks, relative performance as well as 
consideration of strategic progress in addition 
to simply financial ones. Comparator group 
analyses includes oil and gas exploration 
companies with broadly similar market 
capitalisations and numbers of employees, 
as well as oil and gas service companies 
where although the market capitalisation 
range is wide it is relevant as these are the 
sort of companies with which Plexus may 
compete for talent. A further comparator 
group for the Committee to consider is the 
FTSE AIM 100.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Executive Directors have service 
agreements with the Company dated 
25 November 2005 subject to termination 
upon twelve months’ notice being given by 
either party.
PENSIONS
The Group offers a contributory group 
stakeholder pension scheme, into which 
the Group makes matching contributions 
up to a pre-agreed level of base salary; the 
scheme is open to Executive Directors and 
permanent employees. Directors may choose 
to have contributions paid into existing 
personal pension plans.

re-elected as a director at the AGMs held in 2010, 2012 and 2014 respectively, are subject

PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Directors’ Report, Strategic Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent 
Company financial statements, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. Under company law 
the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the Group and 
of the profit of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
•  state that the financial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the group 
and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have a general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Under applicable law the directors are further 
responsible for ensuring that the Strategic 
Report and the Report of the Directors and 
other information included in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements is prepared 
in accordance with applicable law in the 
United Kingdom.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Group’s website (www.plexusplc.com). The 
work carried out by the auditors does not 
involve the consideration of these matters 
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred in the accounts since they were 
initially presented on the website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the group financial 
statements of Plexus Holdings plc for the 
year ended 30 June 2015 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and 
the related notes numbered 1 to 2 8.
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
We read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Directors’ Report, 
Chairman’s Statement, Strategic Report, 
Corporate Governance Report, Remuneration 
Committee Report and any other 
surround information to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Financial 
Statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which 
are considered material in relation to the financial information.
 a.  Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with 
the EU IAS Regulation and are in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have considered those standards and interpretations, which have not been 
applied in the financial statements but are relevant to the Group’s operations, that are in 
issue but not yet effective and do not consider that any will have a material impact on the 
future results of the Group.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest thousand pounds except where otherwise indicated.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention except 
where fair value adjustments are required.
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have carefully considered the availability 
of working capital along with future orders and satisfied themselves that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The 
Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Cost of sales includes salary and related costs for service personnel, and depreciation and 
refurbishment costs on rental assets.
 b. Going concern
The Group’s activities and an outline of the developments taking place in relation to its 
products, services and marketplace are considered in the Strategic Review on pages  28 to  45 
along with an explanation of revenue, trading results and cash flows.
Note  23 to the Financial Statements sets out the company’s financial risks and the management 
of capital risks.
At the year end, the Group had bank facilities of £7.275m comprising a £5m revolving credit 
facility repayable in September 2016, a £1m overdraft repayable on demand, and a term loan 
facility which had a balance of £1.275m, and which is repayable in quarterly instalments of 
£75k with the final repayment due by September 2019.
Post period end, the Group’s cash position changed materially with the subscription by Jereh 
for new ordinary shares representing 5% of the issued share capital of Plexus for circa £8m

net of expenses. Furthermore, the Group’s bank facilities have been renewed with Bank of 
Scotland Corporate and comprise of a £5m revolving credit facility, a £1m overdraft, and the 
remainder of the five year term loan running until September 2019.
Together with the profitable trading of the business, these funds and facilities are anticipated 
to provide sufficient funding for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, after careful enquiry and review of available financial information, including 
projections of profitability and cash flows for the period to 31 October 2016, the Directors 
believe that the company has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the consolidated and company financial statements.
 c. Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Plexus Holdings plc 
and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) drawn up to 30 June each year. Control comprises 
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain 
benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct and indirect ownership of voting 
rights; currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights; or by way of contractual 
agreement. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date 
on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such 
control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances 
and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra group transactions, have 
been eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Within twelve months of the date of acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking a re-assessment is 
made of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in order to assess any provisional 
values used in initial accounting.
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared in sterling (the 
functional currency), which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the 
underlying events and circumstances relevant to the Group. Transactions and balances in 
foreign currencies are converted into sterling in accordance with the principles set forth by 
IAS 21 (“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”). Accordingly, transactions and 
balances have been converted as follows:
•  Monetary assets and liabilities – at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet 
date; and
•  Income and expense items – at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition 
of those items. Non-monetary items are converted at the rate of exchange used to 
convert the related balance sheet items i.e. at the time of the transaction. Exchange 
gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.

 d. Associate
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence 
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but that 
is not a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity.
The results, assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial 
statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment 
in an associate entity is carried in the balance sheet at cost, plus post-acquisition changes 
in the group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any 
impairment in value of the investment. The group income statement reflects the group’s share 
of the results after tax of the associate entity. The group statement of other comprehensive 
income reflects the group’s share of any income and expense recognised by the associate 
entity outside profit and loss.
Financial statements of associate entities are prepared for the same reporting year as the 
group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those of the group.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associate entities are eliminated 
to the extent of the group’s interest in the associate entities. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The group assesses investments in associate entities for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with 
its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down 
to its recoverable amount.
The group ceases to use the equity method of accounting on the date from which it no longer 
has joint control over, or significant influence in the associate, or when the interest becomes 
held for sale.
 e. Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from wellhead rentals 
and sales of wellheads, plus associated equipment and services.
Income from rental contracts is recognised over the period of the rental on a straight-
line basis. Income from equipment sales is recognised following product acceptance by the 
customer. Income from services is recognised over the period of performance of the services. 
Income from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with paragraph ( n) below.
 f. Income taxes and deferred taxation
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised 
in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
238506 Plexus p070-p116 Notes.indd   72 11/11/2015   00:08 73
CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and 
its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
As set out in note  20 the group operates a share option scheme. Where the market price of 
the shares at the year-end exceeds the option price there is a potential tax deduction. This 
is treated as a deferred tax asset. The portion of the expected future tax deduction which 
is less than or equal to the associated cumulative IFRS2 charge is recognised in the income 
statement. The balance of the credit is recognised directly in equity.
 g. Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over 
the fair value of the separable assets acquired) arising on business combinations in respect 
of acquisitions is capitalised.
Goodwill is not amortised, it is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill has been determined on a value in use basis.
The key assumptions on which the valuation is based are that:
• Industry acceptance will result in continued growth of the business;
• Prices will rise with inflation; and
•  Staff wage inflation will be higher than general inflation but will not rise in line with 
sales.
These assumptions were determined from the directors’ knowledge and experience.
The cash flows are based upon an 11 year period which is the period covered by the relevant 
patents, and, in accordance with historical trends and current expectations, a revenue 
growth rate of 5-10% has been applied to periods beyond the current budget. The company’s 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital for discounting purposes has been measured at 8.65%. The 
cashflows are based upon approved budgets for the following 12 months, beyond this they 
are based upon management’s expectations of future developments.

PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
Management regularly assesses the sensitivity of the key assumptions and the probability 
that any of them would change to the degree that the carrying value would exceed the 
recoverable amount.
 h. Intangible assets and amortisation
Patents are recorded initially at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over 20 years 
which represents the life of the patent. The Group operates a policy of continual patent 
enhancement in order that technology enhancements and modifications are incorporated 
within the registered patent, thereby protecting the value of technology advances for a full 
20 year period.
Intellectual Property rights are initially recorded at cost and amortised over 20 years on 
a straight line basis. The technology defined by the Intellectual Property is believed to be 
able to generate income streams for the Group for many years; key Intellectual Property 
is protected by patents; the lowest common denominator in terms of economic life of the 
intangible assets is the life of the original patents and therefore the life of the Intellectual 
Property has been matched to the remaining life of the patents protecting it.
Development expenditure is capitalised in respect of development of patentable technology 
at cost including an allocation of own time when such expenditure is incurred on separately 
identifiable technology and its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. 
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic 
life, which the directors consider to be 20 years.
Computer software is amortised over 2 to 5 years on a straight line basis.
In all cases the amortisation period represents the expected useful life of the asset.
Amortisation is charged to the Administrative Expenses line of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
Expenditure on research and development, which does not meet the capitalisation criteria, is 
written off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed on an on-going basis by the directors 
and, where appropriate, provision is made for any indication of impairment in value. Where 
impairment arises, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount.

The key assumptions on which the valuation is based are that:
• Industry acceptance will result in continued growth of the business;
• Prices will rise with inflation; and
•  Staff wage inflation will be higher than general inflation but will not rise in line with 
sales.
These assumptions were determined from the directors’ knowledge and experience.
The cash flows are based upon an 11 year period, the remaining life of the Intellectual 
Property, and a revenue growth rate of 5-10% has been applied to periods beyond the 
current budget. The company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital for discounting purposes 
has been measured at 8.65%. The cashflows are based upon approved budgets for the 
following 12 months, beyond this they are based upon management’s expectations of future 
developments.
It would require a substantial movement (over 30%) in any of these assumptions before 
there would be any impairment to intangible assets.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
 i. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost 
represents the cost of acquisition or construction, including the direct cost of financing the 
acquisition or construction until the asset comes into use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation of property, plant and equipment 
less the estimated residual value by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic 
lives as follows:
Buildings  Over the remaining life of the lease on the land on which the 
building is constructed
Tenant improvements Over the remaining life of the lease of the relevant building
Equipment 7% – 50% per annum
Motor vehicles 20% per annum
The expected useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful life or residual value are accounted 
for prospectively.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or 
loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period the item is derecognised.

 j. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Group’s cash management and are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of 
cash flows.
 k. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of 
financial position date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling.
 l. Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over the period of the lease. Assets held under finance leases are recognised as 
assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are charged directly against income.
 m. Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on 
a first in first out basis and includes all direct costs incurred and attributable production 
overheads. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price allowing for all further 
costs to completion and disposal.
 n. Construction contracts and work in progress
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is 
recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. 
Revenue for such contracts is stated at the cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus 
attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any 
losses as soon as they are foreseen.
Contract work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not 
matched with revenue.
Construction work in progress is included in debtors and represent revenue recognised in 
excess of payments on account. Where payments on account exceed revenue a payment 
received on account is established and included within creditors.
The stage of completion for contracts is determined according to the level of progress of 
each item that is included in the contract and the estimated cost to complete.

PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
 o. Pensions
The Group offers a contributory Group stakeholder pension scheme, into which the Group will 
make matching contributions up to a pre-agreed level of base salary; the scheme is open to 
executive directors and permanent employees. Directors may choose to have contributions 
paid into personal pension plans.
 p. Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends 
to equity shareholders, this is when they are paid. In the case of final dividends, this is 
when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. Dividends unpaid at the statement of 
financial position date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that 
they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements.
 q. Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
In accordance with IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity 
(i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions:
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may 
be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company (or Group); and
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it 
is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its 
own equity instruments.
  To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as 
a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the 
Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called 
up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those 
shares.
  Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance 
charges. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as 
part of shareholders’ funds (see dividends policy), are dealt with as appropriations in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.
 r. Share based payments
The Group issues share options to directors and employees, which are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity settled options determined at the grant 
date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of 
the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Stochastic model 
238506 Plexus p070-p116 Notes.indd   77 11/11/2015   00:08 78
PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
to calculate the fair value of options, which enables the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance condition attached to the awards to be factored into the fair value calculation.
 s. Management of capital
The Group’s capital is composed of share capital and retained earnings along with a share 
premium account. The share premium account represents amounts received for shares issued 
in excess of the nominal share capital less any issue costs.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going 
concern so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its assessment of the risks that it 
faces. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order 
to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends 
paid or issue new equity.
 t. Significant judgements made by management
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.
 u. Key assumptions and sources of estimation
Employee share options are valued in accordance with a Stochastic model and judgement 
is required regarding the choice of some of the inputs to the model. Where doubts have 
existed, management have gone with the advice of experts. Variations in the estimated 
inputs would vary the charges to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Full 
details of the model and inputs are provided in note  20.
The estimated life of the Group’s rental assets for depreciation purposes is of significance 
to the financial statements. The life used is with reference to engineering experience of the 
probable physical and commercial lifespans of the assets. Changes to these estimates can 
result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
The estimated life of the Group’s Intellectual Property is estimated with reference to the 
lifespan of the patents which protect the knowledge and their forecast income generation. 
Changes to these estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and 
amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
Provisions require management estimates and judgements. Provision has been made against 
slow moving inventory based upon historical experience of the viability of the older parts 
as technological improvements have been made. Changes to these estimates can result 
in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.
When measuring goodwill and intangible assets for impairment a range of assumptions are 
required and these are detailed above in the Goodwill and Intangible Asset notes above.

2. PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENT
The comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2014 have been adjusted to correct the 
accounting treatment in relation to a tax credit received of £475k arising on the exercise 
of share options. This credit was originally recognised within ‘Income Tax Expense’ in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income whereas the amount should have been 
recognised directly in Equity in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. This adjustment arose 
following a review of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 
2014 by the Financial Reporting Council’s Conduct Committee.
The effect of the restatement in the year to 30 June 2014 has been to increase the income 
tax expense within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income by £475k, thereby 
reducing profit after tax by the same amount. This has had the effect of decreasing basic and 
diluted earnings per share to 5.44p and 5.21p respectively (basic earnings per share: 6.01p; 
diluted earnings per share: 5.75p as originally reported).
This adjustment has had no impact on net assets, tax payable, or the cash flow statement of 
the prior year and no impact on opening reserves in either the current or the prior period.

The Group derives revenue from the sale of its POS-GRIP technology and associated 
products, the rental of wellheads utilising the POS-GRIP technology and service income 
principally derived in assisting with the commissioning and on-going service requirements of 
our equipment. These income streams are all derived from the utilisation of the technology 
which the Group believes is its only segment.
Per IFRS 8, the operating segment is based on internal reports about components of the 
group, which are regularly reviewed and used by the board of directors being the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”).
All of the Group’s non-current assets are held in the UK.

20. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Share options have been granted to subscribe for ordinary shares, which are exercisable 
between 2006 and 2025 at prices ranging from £0.385 to £1.18. At 30 June 2015, there were 
4,077,739 options outstanding.
The Company has an unapproved share option scheme for the directors and employees of the 
Group. Options are exercisable at the quoted mid-market price of the Company’s shares on 
the date of grant. The options may vest in three equal portions, at the end of each of three 
assessment periods, provided that the option holder is still employed by the Group at vesting 
date and that the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions are satisfied. 
Options that do not meet the TSR criteria at the first available vesting date may vest at the 
end of the complete assessment period, provided that the compounded TSR performance is 
met over the complete assessment period. Vested but unexercised options ordinarily expire 
on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The options are equity settled.
On 9 July 2015 the directors approved an amendment to the rules of the scheme such 
that the Company is permitted to extend the exercise period for options granted under the

scheme by a further ten years. Subsequently on 9 July 2015 the Company entered into deeds 
of amendment with Ben van Bilderbeek, Graham Stevens, Craig Hendrie, J. Jeffrey Thrall and 
one employee in respect of options granted to them on 9 December 2005 under the scheme, 
to enable each holder to exercise these particular options up until 8 December 2025, subject 
to all other terms of the scheme rules.

The weighted average share price at the time of exercise was £1.81 (2014: £2.77).
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted that are outstanding at 30 
June 2015 is £740k (2014: £755k). The inputs to the Stochastic model for the computation 
of the fair value of the options are as follows:
Share price at date of grant varies from £0.385 to £1.18
Option exercise price at date of grant varies from £0.385 to £1.18
Expected volatility varies from 35.7% to 76.6%
Expected term varies from 4.5 years to 6.3 years
Risk-free interest rate varies from 0.4% to 5.7%
Expected dividend yield  0% to 1.7%
At the time of granting the older options, in the absence of sufficient historical share price 
data for the Company, expected volatility was calculated by analysing the median share price 
volatility for similar companies prior to grant for the period of the expected term. Since then 
sufficient historical share price data has been built up to enable the expected volatility to 
be based upon the Company’s own share price volatility. The expected term used has been 
adjusted based on the management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free interest rate is taken as 
the implied yield at grant available on government securities with a remaining term equal 
to the average expected term. At the time of granting the older options, no dividends had 
been paid and the directors did not envisage paying one therefore the dividend yield was 
0%. Since then the directors have introduced a dividend policy and at the time of the grants 
awarded the expected dividend yield varies between 1.2% to 1.7%.

The Stochastic model for the fair value of the options incorporates the TSR criteria into the 
measurement of fair value.
The Group has recognised an expense in the current year of £21k (2014: £26k) towards 
equity settled share based payments.
The weighted average contractual life of the share options outstanding at the end of the 
period is 3 years and 11 months.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Treasury management
The Group’s activities give rise to a number of different financial risks: market risk (including 
foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Group’s management regularly monitors the risks and potential exposures to which 
the Group is exposed and seeks to take action, where appropriate, to minimise any potential 
adverse impact on the Group’s performance.
Risk management is carried out by Management in line with the Group’s Treasury policies. 
The Group’s Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and investment of excess cash. The Group’s policy does not permit entering into 
speculative trading of financial instruments and this policy has been applied throughout the 
year.

PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
 (a) Market risks
 (i) Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. In order to 
protect the Group’s statement of financial position from movements in exchange rates, the 
Group converts foreign currency balances into sterling on receipt so far as they will not be 
used for future payments in the foreign currency.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which 
it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Group’s main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US dollar and 
sterling/euro exchange rates. Movements in these rates impact the translation of US dollar 
and euro denominated net assets.
As the Group does not use foreign exchange hedges, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income would be affected by a gain/loss of approximately £241k (2014: 
£(48)k) by a reasonably possible 10 percentage point fluctuation down/up in the exchange 
rate between sterling and the US dollar, and by a gain/loss of approximately £79k (2014: 
£18k) by a reasonably possible 10 percentage point fluctuation down/up in the exchange 
rate between sterling and the euro, by a gain/loss of approximately £38k (2014: £18k) by a 
reasonably possible 10 percentage point fluctuation down/up in the exchange rate between 
sterling and the Malaysian Ringgit.
 (ii) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. 
The Group borrows in sterling at floating rates of interest.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy 
is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a 
financial institution with a credit rating of ‘AA’ or better.
The consolidated income statement would be affected by gain/loss £48k (2014: £40k) by 
a reasonably possible 1 percentage point change down/up in LIBOR interest rates on a full 
year basis.
 (iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
 (b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables. Responsibility for managing 
credit risks lies with the Group’s management.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency. Where 
required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees 
and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies. Where a customer does not have sufficiently 
238506 Plexus p070-p116 Notes.indd   94 11/11/2015   00:08 95
CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments 
referred to above may be obtained. The Group’s customer base is concentrated on a few 
major companies but management believe that the calibre of these companies means that no 
material credit risk provision is required.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations 
to assess performance. There is significant management focus on receivables that are 
overdue. All receivables are with large corporations with good credit history with which the 
entity has not experienced any recoverability issues in the past. No debtor allowance has 
been provided for within the accounts.
Amounts deposited with banks and other financial institutions also give rise to credit risk. 
This risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any such institution by 
reference to their rating and by regular review of these ratings. The possibility of material 
loss in this way is considered unlikely.
The currency composition of trade receivable at the year end was:
2015
£’000
2014

Sterling  4,605 5,376
US Dollar  1,777 65
Euro  180 108
Australian Dollars  – 194
  6,562 5,743
 (c)  Liquidity risk
The Group has historically financed its operations through equity finance and bank borrowings. 
The Group has continued with its policy of ensuring that there are sufficient funds available 
to meet the expected funding requirements of the Group’s operations and investment 
opportunities. The Group monitors its liquidity position through cash flow forecasting. Based 
on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.

We have audited the parent company 
financial statements of Plexus Holdings 
plc for the year ended 30 June 2015 which 
comprise the Parent Company Statement 
of Financial Position, the Parent Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Parent 
Company Statement of Cash Flows and the 
related notes numbered 1 to 13.
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the

responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
We read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Directors’ 
Report, Chairman’s Statement, Strategic 
Report, Corporate Governance Report, 
Remuneration Committee Report and other 
surround information to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Financial 
Statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which 
are considered material in relation to the financial information.
 a.  Basis of preparation
The company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and they therefore comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and are in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have considered those standards and interpretations, which have not been 
applied in the financial statements but are relevant to the Company’s operations, that are in 
issue but not yet effective and do not consider that any will have a material impact on the 
future results of the Company.
The Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest thousand pounds except where otherwise indicated.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, believe that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Company 
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
 b. Income taxes and deferred taxation
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised 
in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and 
its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

106
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
As set out in note  20 of the group accounts, the company operates a share option scheme. 
Where the market price of the shares at the year-end exceeds the option price there is a 
potential tax deduction. This is treated as a deferred tax asset. The portion of the expected 
future tax deduction which is less than or equal to the associated cumulative IFRS2 charge 
is recognised in the income statement. The balance of the credit is recognised directly in 
equity.
 c. Intangible assets and amortisation
Patents are recorded initially at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over 20 years 
which represents the life of the patent. The Group operates a policy of continual patent 
enhancement in order that technology enhancements and modifications are incorporated 
within the registered patent, thereby protecting the value of technology advances for a full 
20 year period.
Intellectual Property rights are initially recorded at cost and amortised over 20 years on 
a straight line basis. The technology defined by the Intellectual Property is believed to be 
able to generate income streams for the Group for many years; key Intellectual Property 
is protected by patents; the lowest common denominator in terms of economic life of the 
intangible assets is the life of the original patents and therefore the life of the Intellectual 
Property has been matched to the remaining life of the patents protecting it.
Development expenditure is capitalised in respect of development of patentable technology 
at cost including an allocation of own time when such expenditure is incurred on separately 
identifiable technology and its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. 
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic 
life, which the directors consider to be 20 years.
Amortisation is charged to the Administrative Expenses line of the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
Expenditure on research and development, which does not meet the capitalisation criteria, is 
written off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed on an on-going basis by the directors 
and, where appropriate, provision is made for any impairment in value. It would require a 
substantial movement (over 30%) in the assumptions employed in valuations before there 
would be any impairment to intangible assets.
 d. Investments
The investment in subsidiary and associate undertakings is stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. Cost is the amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given 
to acquire the investment. Income from such investments is recognised only to the extent 
that the Company receives distributions from accumulated profits of the investee company 
arising after the date of acquisition. Distributions received in excess of such profit i.e. from 
pre-acquisition reserves are regarded as a recovery of investment and are recognised as a 
reduction of the cost of the investment.

 e.  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company’s cash management and are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of 
cash flows.
 f. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of 
financial position date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
 g. Pensions
The Group offers a contributory Group stakeholder pension scheme, into which the Group will 
make matching contributions up to a pre-agreed level of base salary; the scheme is open to 
executive directors and permanent employees. Directors may choose to have contributions 
paid into personal pension plans. Prior to 1 July 2007, the Group offered a basic stakeholder 
pension scheme, into which the Group did not make employer contributions; none of the 
directors or employees were members.
 h. Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends 
to equity shareholders, this is when they are paid. In the case of final dividends, this is 
when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. Dividends unpaid at the statement of 
financial position date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that 
they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements.
 i. Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
In accordance with IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity 
(i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions:
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may 
be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company (or Group); and
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it 
is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its 
own equity instruments.
  To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as 
a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the 
238506 Plexus p070-p116 Notes.indd   107 11/11/2015   00:08 PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
108
Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called 
up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those 
shares.
  Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance 
charges. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as 
part of shareholders’ funds (see dividends policy), are dealt with as appropriations in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.
 j. Share based payments
The Company issues share options to directors and employees, which are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity settled options determined at the 
grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate 
of the number of options that will actually vest. The Group has adopted a Stochastic model 
to calculate the fair value of options, which enables the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance condition attached to the awards to be factored into the fair value calculation.
 k. Key assumptions and sources of estimation
Employee share options are valued in accordance with a Stochastic model and judgement 
is required regarding the choice of some of the inputs to the model. Where doubts have 
existed, management have gone with the advice of experts. Full details of the model and 
inputs are provided in note  20 to the Group accounts.
The estimated life of the Company’s Intellectual Property is estimated with reference to the 
lifespan of the patents which protect the knowledge and their forecast income generation.
When measuring Intellectual Property for impairment a range of assumptions are required 
and these are detailed in the Intangible Assets note above.
2. PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENT
The comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2014 have been adjusted to correct the 
accounting treatment in relation to a tax credit received of £128k arising on the exercise 
of share options. This credit was originally recognised within ‘Income Tax Expense’ in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income whereas the amount should have been 
recognised directly in Equity in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. This adjustment arose 
following a review of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 
2014 by the Financial Reporting Council’s Conduct Committee.
The effect of the restatement in the year to 30 June 2014 has been to increase the income 
tax expense within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income by £128k, thereby 
reducing profit after tax by the same amount.
This adjustment has had no impact on net assets, tax payable, or the cash flow statement of 
the prior year and no impact on opening reserves in either the current or the prior period.

3. PROFIT FOR THE YEAR

of Comprehensive Income has not been included in these financial statements. The parent 
company’s profit after tax for the year was £3,294k (2014: profit of £1,529k as restated).

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s activities give rise to a number of different financial risks: market risk 
(including foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company’s management regularly monitors the risks and potential 
exposures to which the Company is exposed and seeks to take action, where appropriate, to 
minimise any potential adverse impact on the Company’s performance.
Risk management is carried out by Management in line with the Company’s Treasury policies. 
The Company’s Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest 
238506 Plexus p070-p116 Notes.indd   112 11/11/2015   00:08 CORPORATE GOVERNANC E STRATEGIC REPORT BUSINESS REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PLEX US H O LDIN GS PL C ANN U AL REP O RT 2 0 1 5
113
rate risk and investment of excess cash. The Company’s policy does not permit entering into 
speculative trading of financial instruments and this policy has been applied throughout the 
year.
 (a)  Market risks
 (i)  Foreign currency exchange risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. In order 
to protect the Company’s statement of financial position from movements in exchange rates, 
the Company converts foreign currency balances into sterling on receipt so far as they will 
not be used for future payments in the foreign currency.
The Company carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which 
it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Company’s main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US. 
Movements in this rate impacts the translation of US dollar denominated net liabilities. 
A reasonably possible 10% fluctuation up/down in the exchange rate between sterling and 
the US dollar would result in a corresponding gain/loss in the statement of comprehensive 
income of approximately £nil (2014: £58k).
 (ii) Interest rate risk
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Company’s 
policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with 
a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘AA’ or better.
 (iii) Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
 (b)  Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company 
receivables. Management believe that no risk provision is required for impairment.
Amounts deposited with banks and other financial institutions also give rise to credit risk. 
This risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any such institution by 
reference to their rating and by regular review of these ratings. The possibility of material 
loss in this way is considered unlikely.
 (c)  Liquidity risk
The Company has historically financed its operations through equity finance and the flow 
of inter-company loan repayments. The Company has continued with its policy of ensuring 
that there are sufficient funds available to meet the expected funding requirements of the 
Company’s operations and investment opportunities. The Company monitors its liquidity 
position through cash flow forecasting. Based on the current outlook the Company has 
sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
The bank facility provided to the Group includes a fixed and floating charge over the assets 
of the Company.

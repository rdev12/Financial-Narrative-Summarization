Chairman’s Statement
Michael Marx
Introduction
I am pleased to report Nationwide’s results 
for the year ended 31 December 2007. It is 
encouraging to have achieved such pleasing 
results while laying strong foundations 
for future growth.
Financial overview 
Revenue for the twelve months ended 
31 December 2007 increased to £151.9m 
(2006: £151.2m), a very creditable performance 
given our decision to let a £20m contract lapse 
due to unattractive commercial terms. Operating 
profit before non‑recurring items rose by 15% to 
£6.6m (2006: £5.8m). Adjusted profit before tax 
excluding non‑recurring items increased by 15% 
to £6.8m (2006: £5.9m) and adjusted earnings 
per share excluding non‑recurring items increased 
by 26% to 11.3p from 9.0p last year. 
The Company adopts IAS 19, the ‘corridor 
approach’, for its pension obligations. However, 
in order to provide shareholders with financial 
results which are comparable with other 
companies, results under IAS 19 (non‑corridor) 
are also shown. Under IAS 19 (non‑corridor), 
operating profit before non‑recurring items 
increased by 14% to £7.6m (2006: £6.7m). 
Profit before tax before non‑recurring items 
increased by 14% to £7.9m (2006: £6.9m) and 
earnings per share before non‑recurring items 
increased by 19% to 12.5p (2006: 10.5p). 
It should be noted that non‑recurring items 
affected last year’s results only.
The Group’s cash position remains very strong, 
with net cash at 31 December 2007 of £5.2m 
(2006: £6.9m), having acquired four new 
bodyshops during the year for a total 
consideration of £2.1m in cash. 
Dividend
The Group has a progressive dividend policy in 
place and the Directors are pleased to recommend 
the payment of a final dividend of 3.0p per share 
for the year, an increase of 15% on last year 
(2006: 2.6p). With the interim dividend of 1.5p, 
this takes the total dividend for the year to 4.5p 
(2006: 2.6p). Subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid 
on 2 June 2008 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 9 May 2008. 
Trading overview
The year started well with a good first quarter. 
However, in the second quarter we took the 
strategic decision to decline the renewal of 
a substantial contract which was offered on 
commercially unattractive terms. Since then, we 
have more than replaced the lost volumes from 
new and existing customers. While work from 
these new agreements has already started to 
flow, we expect to see the full benefits come 
through in the current financial year and beyond. 
As insurers look to consolidate the number 
of vehicle repair suppliers, our market‑leading 
position and high standards of customer service 
should ensure that we will continue to be well 
placed to take advantage of the changes, 
as these new agreements demonstrate. 
We remain focused on driving efficiencies and 
leveraging our scale in order to realise cost savings. 
By working together with customers we are able 
to manage our operations carefully, deploying 
work across the network of bodyshops in a way 
which allows for maximum efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. During the year, we have achieved 
cost savings and we will continue to look at 
further ways in which to enhance operations.

Revenue
During the period, we continued our acquisition 
growth strategy, with the purchase of four new 
bodyshops in order to meet demand from our 
customers in specific regions. We also refined 
our existing network of repair centres, disposing 
of five sites which were no longer suitable for 
our needs. 
Our Network Services division, which offers 
insurers and fleet operators a comprehensive 
‘one stop shop’ option of accident management 
services, continues to perform well. The Aquilo 
business, acquired in December 2006, was 
successfully integrated during the year and has 
contributed to Network Services’ success. 
Outlook
The strategic decisions which we took in 2007 
have established the foundations for future 
growth. We are focused on developing customer 
relationships which will enable us to leverage 
our scale and operational efficiencies to the 
benefit of both Nationwide and our customers. 
The new agreements we secured over the course 
of 2007 will bring further benefits in the current 
financial year and beyond, as the additional 
volumes are generated.
Furthermore we believe that our business is 
well placed to benefit from market consolidation 
by acquiring bodyshops where appropriate and 
by taking advantage of opportunities to win 
additional volumes from insurers consolidating 
their repair base. 2008 has started positively 
and the Board remains confident in its 
business prospects.

Chief Executive’s Report
Michael Wilmshurst
“ We remain confident 
of our trading prospects 
as we continue to 
execute our twin track 
strategy of organic and 
acquisitive expansion.”
Introduction
2007 was a record year for our Group and 
our ability to continue to improve our financial 
performance, at a time of customer and market 
change, is indicative of the strength of our 
business offer, model and team.
Customers
In 2007 we took the difficult, but strategic decision 
to decline a substantial contract on the basis of 
the terms offered. We believed that we would be 
able to replace this work (in excess of £20m) with 
other customers. A key part of our decision was 
driven by our underlying business approach, 
which is to align ourselves with customers whose 
business models reflect our strategy of increasing 
repair efficiency. We do this by directing work 
to the most suitable site, utilising our excellent 
IT platform to develop additional efficiencies and 
leveraging our own economies of scale. 
I am pleased to report that over the remainder 
of the year we more than replaced the lost work. 
This was achieved through a mix of new contract 
wins and volume extensions with existing customers. 
The new wins we secured were with Hastings 
Direct and Zenith and we agreed significant 
additional volumes with Norwich Union, AXA and 
Zurich. These agreements will help to underpin 
the Group’s growth in 2008 as they are 
fully implemented.
In expanding our business our strategy has been, 
and continues to be, to develop a broad base of 
customers. While typically half of our business is 
transacted with our top five insurance customers, 
these insurers change over time, reflecting market 
conditions. It is, therefore, important to us to 
maintain contact and foster relationships across 
the insurance industry as a whole and to adapt 
to the changing balance of work we carry out 
for customers in a way which suits both parties. 
Over the past few years, by adopting this ‘broad 
church’ approach and by investing time to 
understand our customers’ future strategies, we 
have successfully managed both the growth of 
contracts and a number of customer transitions. 
We are also applying this longer term account 
relationship methodology to customers outside 
our current core motor insurer customer base, 
namely fleet, rental operators and motor 
manufacturers and we currently have 23 customers 
operating in these fields. A new initiative, begun 
during 2007, was the launch of a retail sales 
operation. From a standing start this has generated 
sales of £1.84m in its first year and we will look 
to grow retail sales further in 2008.
Overall, the market consolidation highlighted 
in last year’s report continues, with a considerable 
number of insurance companies reducing the 
number of repairers to which they send work. 
With our skilled team, national coverage and 
sophisticated IT package, we believe that we 
are well positioned to benefit from 
ongoing consolidation.
People
Nationwide employs over 2,200 skilled and 
committed people, including 130 apprentices. 
In recent years, we have developed the Nationwide 
Academy, which provides structured training 
programmes designed to assist our team to hone 
their existing skills and develop new areas 
of expertise. The market in which we operate 
is becoming increasingly sophisticated and 
in 2008 it is our intention, with Government 
assistance, to extend the areas covered by 
the programme and to increase the number of 
staff enjoying the benefits that the Academy 
offers, including apprenticeships and National 
Vocational Qualifications. Our objective is to develop 
the most effective team in the sector and become

Chief Executive’s Report continued
the industry employer of choice. We have made 
good progress in 2007 and aim to improve 
further this year.
Operations
In 2007 we also took the opportunity to review 
the sites that we operate and the areas in which 
they are located. In a multi‑site business such 
as ours, such reviews are a normal part of our 
business, as sites approach the end of their leases 
or require additional capital investment. As a result 
of this review, we closed or disposed of five sites 
and acquired four, in Llandudno, Lincoln, Matlock 
and Hull. Since the year end, we have also acquired 
sites in Gravesend and Scunthorpe. To support 
our customers’ needs going forward, we are 
increasing our repair capacity and plan to 
expand in three ways:
  by increasing the throughput within 
our existing sites, with the employment of 
additional staff, introduction of shifts and 
extending working hours;
  by acquiring additional sites in geographical 
areas not served by our existing network or 
where our existing sites are at capacity; and
  by enlisting and managing a secondary network 
of Nationwide approved repairers who carry 
out work on our behalf. Our Network Services 
division already successfully operates 
this system.
Network Services
Our Network Services division offers a comprehensive 
Accident Management Service including:
  first contact (known as ‘first notification 
of loss’ or ‘FNOL’ in the industry);
 claims handling;
 replacement vehicles;
  deployment into our own or other repair 
networks;
 uninsured loss recovery;
 a glass replacement service; 
  electronic diagnostic and air conditioning 
services; and
 on site repair services for minor damage. 
In providing this service, we enjoy two key 
competitive advantages:
  the majority of the work is carried out within 
our own network, facilitating communication, 
efficient deployment and the ability 
to prioritise work; and
  Network Services and Nationwide Crash Repair 
Centres operate on a sophisticated and fully 
integrated in‑house IT platform. This system 
allows us to monitor electronically and manage 
the flow of work through our business far 
more efficiently than the traditional manually 
operated processes.
Thanks to these advantages, the division continues 
to demonstrate encouraging growth. This year 
we will invest in the ongoing development of our 
IT platform in the areas of ‘first contact’ and 
claims handling, further enhancing the services 
we offer our customers and the efficiency with 
which we manage repairs.
Outlook
We have made encouraging progress during 
the year, improving the Group’s profitability for 
the fifth consecutive year. Most significantly, we 
have secured significant volumes of additional 
work from our existing customers and added 
new contracts. The benefits of these volume 
improvements will be seen in 2008 as these 
agreements are fully implemented.
In the current financial year we are continuing 
to expand and to develop and train our team in 
order to maintain our competitive advantage. We 
are also increasing our capacity to repair vehicles, 
leveraging efficiencies at our existing sites and 
looking for additional sites where demand makes 
this appropriate. In addition, we continue to 
grow our Network Services division, offering 
insurers and fleet operators a single point 
of contact and enabling us to capture work 
more effectively. 
Our business is by nature driven by unplanned 
events or accidents and as such is ‘non‑cyclical’. 
This gives us a firm foundation on which we can 
capitalise, but equally we also look to ensure that 
we continue to improve operational efficiency 
and that we are well placed to take advantage 
of market opportunities.
Looking ahead, we remain confident of our trading 
prospects as we continue to execute our twin 
track strategy of organic and acquisitive expansion.

Operating results
Operating profit before non‑recurring items rose 
by 15% to £6.6m from £5.8m, with turnover for 
the period marginally increasing from £151.2m 
to £151.9m. Profit before tax after non‑recurring 
items was £6.8m (2006: £2.4m).
During 2007, four businesses were acquired, 
Llandudno (January 2007), Lincoln (March 2007), 
Matlock (October 2007) and Hull (November 2007). 
Between them they contributed turnover of 
£2.1m and a loss of £161,000.
In addition, the Group disposed of and closed five 
sites which had a combined turnover of £2.5m 
and losses of £97,000.
Pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit and 
a defined contribution pension scheme. The defined 
benefit scheme was closed for future accruals 
on 31 July 2006 with active members transferred 
to a new defined contribution section of the scheme. 
Under IAS 19 the deficit in the scheme as at 
31 December 2007 was £10.3m (2006: £20.6m) 
or £7.4m (2006: £14.3m) net of deferred tax. 
The Group has agreed with the trustees to eradicate 
the Scheme Specific Funding deficit by making 
annual special contributions of approximately 
£2.4m for approximately 7.5 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial 
gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the 
greater of assets and liabilities) over the future 
working lifetime of the active membership. A full 
actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme 
was carried out as at 31 December 2005 and was 
updated to 31 December 2007 by a qualified 
independent actuary.
To assist comparisons to be made to other 
businesses that do not adopt the corridor 
approach details are given of the effect on profits 
and assets if IAS 19 (non‑corridor) was applied 
instead. Under IAS 19 (non‑corridor), operating 
profit before non‑recurring items increased by 
14% to £7.6m (2006: £6.7m). Profit before tax 
before non‑recurring items increased by 14% 
to £7.9m (2006: £6.9m). 
Cash flow
The net decrease in cash during the year 
was £1.8m (2006: an increase of £2.8m) 
which produced a net cash balance at 
31 December 2007 of £5.2m. 
The Company continues to invest in new plant 
and equipment and in improvements to its sites. 
The acquisition of new businesses during the year 
accounted for an outflow of £2.4m. Included within 
this amount is £900,000 relating to a property 
purchased and subsequently resold. This amount 
is shown with debtors at the year end as the cash 
was not received until January 2008. The Company 
continues to pay a ‘special’ deficit contribution to 
its pension fund of £2,465,000 (2006: £2,860,000) 
and a dividend of £1.8m was paid in 2007 
(2006: £nil).

The Group has a committed bank facility with 
the Royal Bank of Scotland for £8m until 
31 December 2010.
Tax
The effective tax rate is 26% which is lower 
than the standard rate of tax. The effective rate 
in 2006 was 41% which reflected the majority 
of the flotation costs being disallowed for tax 
purposes. The group has no income tax losses 
available but has capital losses of £4.2m available.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share is 11.3p (2006: 3.1p). 
The 2006 figure was significantly affected by 
non‑recurring items. Excluding non‑recurring 
items underlying earnings per share is 11.3p 
(2006: 9.0p), a growth of 25%. As a result of 
share options being granted on 4 July 2006, 
the basic earnings per share is reduced to 
10.3p (2006: 3.0p).
As mentioned above the Company adopts the 
‘corridor approach’ for the treatment of its 
pension liabilities and as such the actuarial loss 
is recognised in the income statement. To enable 
comparisons to be made to other businesses, 
earnings per share is also shown on an IAS 19 
(non‑corridor) basis. On this basis, earnings per 
share before non‑recurring items increased by 
19% to 12.5p (2006: 10.5p). 
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect 
of the results for the year ended 31 December 2007 
of 3.00p per share making a total of 4.5p for 
the year (2006: 2.6p per share). Subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, this will be paid on 2 June 2008 
to shareholders on the Register at the close of 
business on 9 May 2008. The dividend is covered 
2.6 times by underlying earnings.
Key performance indicators
The Group reviews certain financial and non‑financial 
key performance indicators on a regular basis and 
year‑on‑year comparisons are included within the 
Directors’ Report. Gross profit margin has remained 
consistent which is encouraging. Cycle Times and 
CSI performance are monitored at least monthly, 
and improvements in both measures are indicative 
of an enhanced service to our customers.

The Directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Principal activities and review of the business
As noted in the business review within the Chief Executive’s Report and Finance Director’s Review, the business of the Group is the repair of motor 
vehicles and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2007 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance 
companies to branches where possible. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2008. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors regularly review principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group. These include avoiding the reliance on key customers for work 
provision by diversifying contracts. Operational standards such as PAS 125 and changes to vehicle repair methodology, are being implemented through 
training programmes.
Post balance sheet events 
Since the year end the Group has acquired the trade and assets of bodyshop businesses in Gravesend and Scunthorpe (February 2008). The consideration 
for these businesses was £610,000 paid in cash.
Results and dividends
The Group’s sales revenue amounted to £151,947,000 (2006: £151,192,000) and the profit before taxation amounted to £6,815,000 (2006: £2,370,000). 
Taxation was a charge of £1,744,000 (2006: charge of £978,000) and the net profit for the year was £5,071,000 (2006: £1,392,000). 
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 3.0p per share. Subject to approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, this will be paid on 2 June 2008 to shareholders on the Register at the close of business on 9 May 2008.

of 2.6p per share paid in May 2007 (£1,167,000) and an interim dividend in respect of 2007 of 1.5p per share paid in November 2007 (£673,000).
Non‑current assets

Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Group are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 14.
Corporate governance 
The Board is committed to the highest principles of corporate governance. As a Group quoted on AIM, the Group is not required to comply with 
the requirements of the Combined Code.
The Board consists of three executive and three independent non‑executive Directors who take an active role in Board matters and it meets eight times 
in every year. The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and Group assets.
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, consisting of the Chairman and Jeremy Brade, a Remuneration Committee consisting of the Chairman 
and Jeremy Brade and a Nominations Committee consisting of the Chairman and Lady Judge.
The Audit Committee meets regularly with the external auditors and with the executive Directors to review the interim and final results, key areas of accounting 
treatment and risk and control procedures. The Committee can meet with the external auditors without any of the executive Directors being present.
The Remuneration Committee met in February 2008, but the Nominations Committee has not met since its formation in June 2006.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes and 
abilities and wherever possible the Group continues the employment of, and arranges for reasonable adjustments to the working conditions of, employees 
who become disabled persons while employed by the Group. Disabled employees are treated no differently from any other employees as regards 
training, career development and promotion opportunities. The Group operated this policy throughout the year.
Employee involvement
Effective employee relations are seen as key drivers in moving the Group forward. Consequently human resources, quality, health and safety and training 
functions need to establish good communications with individual sites and are therefore organised on a divisional basis. This structure enables staff to 
obtain the help and guidance they may need and keeps them informed of, and effectively involved in, the development of the Group’s business. Regular 
review meetings are held at local, divisional and Group level to ensure that all employees are kept informed of the Group’s objectives. Progress towards 
those objectives is measured and reported back to individual sites.
New Articles of Association
We are asking shareholders to approve a number of amendments to our Articles of Association (the ‘Current Articles’), through the adoption of new 
articles of association (the ‘New Articles’), primarily to reflect the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’). An explanation of the main 
changes between the New Articles and the Current Articles is included and explained within the notice of meeting. During 2007, new provisions in the 
2006 Act came into force regarding the ways that a company is permitted to communicate with its shareholders. In the future, the Company wishes 
to take advantage of these methods of communication and so the New Articles contain provisions to this effect which will require a resolution of the 
shareholders to implement. For now, the Company will continue to communicate with shareholders in the usual way.

The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall terms

Full details of the authorised and issued share capital of the Group are set out in note 19 to the accounts.
On 19 December 2007 the Group purchased 250,000 of its own shares at a price of 108p per share, the total consideration was £271,351. Subsequent

and 450,000 shares on 25 January 2008, for a total consideration of £520,089, at a price of 115p per share. The three transactions represented 2.6% 
of the authorised share capital. The share buybacks were undertaken in order to enhance earnings for the shareholders.
Summary of key performance indicators
The Directors have monitored the progress of the overall Group/Company strategy and the individual strategic elements by reference to certain financial 
and non‑financial key performance indicators.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors are aware:
 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from other legislation in other jurisdictions.

Report of the Independent Auditor
to the members of Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated and Company 
Statements of Changes in Equity, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements and notes 1 to 27. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted for use by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the 
Chief Executive’s Report and the Finance Director’s Review that is cross referenced from the Business Review Section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report and Finance Director’s Review. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion 
In our opinion:
  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
  the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007;
 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union, has also complied with the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 
and of its profit for the year then ended.

1. Nature of operations
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc and its subsidiaries’ (the ‘Group’) principal activity is the provision of support services to the motor insurance 
industry. Currently, this includes the repair of motor vehicles in the Group’s wholly owned sites and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2007 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance 
companies to branches where possible. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2008.
The following is a list of the principal subsidiary undertakings of which Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc is either directly, or through subsidiary

2. General information 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the EU and as developed and published by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’).
The measurement basis for individual items has been noted in the accounting policies below.
3. Summary of accounting policies
Basis of preparation
IFRS 7 financial instruments has been adopted for the first time. The significant accounting policies that have been used in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are summarised below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis.
It should be noted that accounting estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements including the carrying amount of goodwill 
(note 10) and provisions (note 20). Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those estimates. No significant judgements have been made in the financial statements.
New standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective for accounting periods commencing on 1 January 2008 have been reviewed, 
but none are considered to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Consolidation 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power to control the financial and operating policies, with a view to obtaining benefits. 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company as well as those entities controlled by the Group 
by full consolidation.
In addition, acquired subsidiaries are subject to the application of the purchase method. This involves the revaluation at fair value of all identifiable assets 
and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial 
statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill 
represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statements for their respective 
periods of ownership. Inter‑Company trading is eliminated from these accounts where appropriate. As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, 
an income statement is not presented for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc. Profit before taxation for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc 
(the ‘Company’) was £4,600,843 (2006: £2,001,273).
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised upon the performance of the service once authority has been given by the customer to undertake this work. Intra‑Group sales 
and value added tax are excluded. 
Operating expenses (with the exception of the IAS 19 pension adjustment) are recognised in the income statement upon utilisation of the service. 
Interest income and expenditure are reported on an accruals basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 23 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the Accounts continued
for the year ended 31 December 2007
3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost. 
Buildings, fittings and furniture are carried at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight‑line basis taking into account estimated residual values, which are reviewed each year.
The useful lives of property, plant and equipment can be summarised as follows:
Land    –  Nil 
Buildings     –  5 to 25 years 
Plant and equipment   – 3 to 10 years 
IT equipment   – 2 to 5 years
On adopting IFRS, the Group and Company have taken advantage of the transitional rule that allows previously revalued fixed assets to be deemed 
at cost.
Leases
Payments on operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight‑line basis. Operating leases are those agreements where the risk and rewards 
of ownership are not transferred to the lessee.
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group’s goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash‑generating 
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash‑generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash‑generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group 
at which management controls the related cash flows.
Individual assets or cash‑generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life or those not yet available for use are tested for impairment 
at least annually. All other individual assets or cash‑generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash‑generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted 
cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash‑generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying 
amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash‑generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, 
all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories comprise materials and direct labour. At the balance sheet date inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Inventories are valued using the weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business 
less any applicable selling expenses. 
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting 
period, that are unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which 
they relate, based on the taxable income for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense 
in the income statement.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, 
nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred 
tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can 
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward 
as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be offset 
against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their 
respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is on the annual share option 
is recognised as a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
Most changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement. Only changes in deferred tax 
assets or liabilities that relate to a change in value of assets or liabilities that are charged directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) are charged 
or credited directly to equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term highly liquid investments such as money market instruments and bank 
deposits. Money market instruments are financial assets carried at fair value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised after initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 
as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 24 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the Accounts continued
for the year ended 31 December 2007
3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Equity
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares 
are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
The revaluation reserve comprises gains and losses due to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the income statement.
The capital redemption reserve was created on the acquisition by the Company of its own shares.
Share‑based payments
The Group operates two employee share option schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share options are granted is recognised in the income 
statement on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to vest. In valuing the share options 
the Group has utilised the Black‑Scholes option pricing model for tranche 1 of the options and the Monte Carlo model for tranche 2 of the options with 
the weighted average share price being factored into the model. The expected life of the options has been assumed to be three years for tranche 1 and 
five years for tranche 2 with the options being exercisable between three and ten years. The model assumptions used are included within note 19.
Pension obligations and short term employee benefits
Pensions to employees are provided through a defined benefit plan as well as a defined contribution plan.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on 
one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligation for any benefits from this kind of pension plan remains with the Group, 
even if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been acquired. Plan assets may include assets specifically designated to a long term benefit 
fund as well as qualifying insurance policies.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independent entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions after payment of the fixed contribution.
The asset/liability recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The 
DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are not recognised as an expense unless the total unrecognised gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the obligation and 
related plan assets. The amount exceeding this 10% is charged or credited to profit or loss over the employees’ expected average remaining working 
lives. Actuarial gains and losses within the 10% corridor are disclosed separately. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, 
unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this 
case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period.
The contributions recognised in respect of defined contribution plans are expensed as they fall due. Liabilities and assets may be recognised if 
underpayment or prepayment has occurred and are included in current liabilities or current assets as they are normally of a short term nature.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables liabilities. They are included in balance sheet line items 
‘long term financial liabilities’ and ‘trade and other payables’. 
Financial liabilities are evaluated on a fair value basis, when the Group becomes party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest 
related charges are recognised as an expense in ‘finance cost’ in the income statement, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management 
or investment strategy.
Bank loans are raised for support of long term funding of the Group’s operations. They are recognised at fair values, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to profit or loss on an accrual basis using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, through the income statement, less settlement payments.
Dividend distributions to shareholders are included in ‘other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved by the shareholders’ meeting.
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Other provisions are recognised when present obligations will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and they can 
be estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the presence of a legal or constructive 
commitment that has resulted from past events. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the 
balance sheet date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Any reimbursement expected to be received in the 
course of settlement of the present obligation is recognised, if virtually certain as a separate asset, not exceeding the amount of the related provision. 
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class 
of obligations as a whole. In addition, long term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 25 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the Accounts continued
for the year ended 31 December 2007
3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets continued
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resource as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, or the amount 
to be provided for cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless assumed in the course of a business 
combination. These contingent liabilities are recognised in the course of the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired in the 
business combination. They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a comparable provision as described above and the amount initially 
recognised, less any amortisation.
Probable inflows of economic benefits to the Group that do not yet meet the recognition criteria of an asset are considered contingent assets.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments are valued at cost less any impairment and after deducting any dividends paid out of pre‑acquisition profits.

8. Earnings per share and dividends 
Basic earnings per share
The basic earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £5,071,000 (2006: £1,392,000). 
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for the basic earnings per share amounted to 44,864,001 (2006: 44,872,220). This number 
takes into account the share buyback that occurred on 19 December 2007.
Diluted earnings per share
The diluted earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £5,071,000 (2006: £1,392,000). 
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for the diluted earnings per share amounted to 46,108,171 (2006: 46,974,453) and assumes 
the exercise of all the share options detailed in note 19 since the date they were granted and the average market price of £1.57. This number takes into 
account the share buyback that occurred on 19 December 2007.

Dividends
During 2007, the Company paid dividends of £1,840,000 (2006: £nil) to its equity shareholders. 
These comprised:
– a final dividend in respect of 2006 of 2.6p per share paid in May 2007 (£1,167,000); and
– an interim dividend in respect of 2007 of 1.5p per share paid in November 2007 (£673,000).
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 3.0p per share.

(a)  On acquisition, the value of other intangible assets was considered and no value was attributed. The Directors have considered the value of intangible 
assets and determined that this was immaterial and that the goodwill arising related to expected synergies with the existing business but which 
are not separately recognised under IFRS.
(b) Provisional fair values were placed on all property, plant and equipment at the date of acquisition.
(c) The purchase of the business in Hull included the purchase of a property that was subsequently sold in December 2007.
The result included in the Group accounts in relation to these four acquisitions, following their acquisition was turnover of £2,148,000 and a loss 
of £161,000. 28 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash‑generating units acquired. The recoverable amounts for the cash‑generating units determined 
above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows using a 2.5% 
growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over ten years and discounted using a rate of 5%. A ten year period has been chosen because 
management’s experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent sites have a useful economic life in excess of ten years. Management’s 
key assumptions for these cash‑generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been determined based on past 
experience in this market. The Group is not currently aware of any reasonable possible changes which would necessitate changes in its key assumptions. 
Business of Aquilo Motor Services
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash‑generating units acquired. The recoverable amounts for the cash‑generating units determined 
above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows using a 2.5% 
growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over five years and discounted using a rate of 5%. A five year period has been chosen because management’s 
experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent business have a useful economic life in excess of five years. Management’s key 
assumptions for these cash‑generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been determined based on past 
experience in this market. The Group is not currently aware of any probable changes which would necessitate changes in its key assumptions.
The business of Aquilo Motor Services was acquired from Aquilo plc which went into administration in 2007. As a result certain assets and liabilities 
acquired with the business were reassessed and the goodwill on acquisition was increased by £308,000. The reassessment of previous goodwill relates 
to a fair value adjustment for trade receivables and trade payables.
Businesses acquired in 2007
During 2007, four businesses were acquired, Llandudno (January 07), Lincoln (March 07), Matlock (October 07) and Hull (November 07).The recoverable 
amounts for the cash‑generating units determined above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an 
extrapolation of expected cash flows using a 2.5% growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over ten years and discounted using a rate of 5%. 
A ten year period has been chosen because management’s experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent sites have a useful 
economic life in excess of ten years. Management’s key assumptions for these cash‑generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash 
flows which have been determined based on past experience in this market. The Group is not currently aware of any probable changes which would 
necessitate changes in its key assumptions. 29 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

14. Pension and other employee assets/obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK which offers both pensions in retirement and death 
benefits to members. Since 1 January 2002 the defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members. The assets of the schemes are administered by 
trustees independent of the Group. The Company made contributions of £2,465,000 (2006: £2,860,000) to the defined benefit scheme during the year. 
The defined benefit scheme was closed for future accruals on 31 July 2006 with active members transferred to a new defined contribution section 
of the scheme. In 2005 the Company agreed with the trustees of the pension scheme to make annual contributions of approximately £2.3m 
(increasing annually by the Retail Price Index) with a view to eradicating the Scheme Specific Funding deficit over a period of approximately 7.5 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the greater of assets and liabilities) over the future working 
lifetime of the active membership.
A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 and was updated to 31 December 2007 by a qualified 
independent actuary. 
        2007 2006  2005 
IAS 19       % % %
The major assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal terms):
Rate of increase in salaries       n/a  n/a  3.3
Rate of increase in pensions – accrued pre 5 April 1997      3.0  3.0  3.0
Rate of increase in pensions – accrued post 5 April 1997      3.15  2.85  2.65 
Discount rate       6.1 5.4  5.0
Inflation assumption       3.15 2.85  2.65
The assumptions used in determining the overall expected return of the scheme have been set with reference to yields available on government bonds 
and appropriate risk margins. The pre and post retirement mortality assumptions use the A92 and PA92 tables respectively. 31 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

The basis for identifying impaired receivables is to consider those amounts which are overdue by more than 120 days and for which no cash has been 
received after the year end. Past history has indicated that this policy is reasonable. 33 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

18. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term highly liquid investments such as money market instruments and bank 
deposits. Money market instruments are financial assets carried at fair value. The Company has a committed facility of £8.0m with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc 
until 2010. Any borrowings under this facility are guaranteed by a fixed charge on book debts. Under this facility, the Company has given an unlimited 
guarantee for the borrowings of its trading subsidiaries.

All the above options were issued on 4 July 2006 and no additional share options have been issued since this date.
In total, £240,000 of employee compensation expense has been included in the Consolidated Income Statement for 2007 (2006: £120,000). 
The corresponding credit is taken to shareholders’ funds. No liabilities were recognised due to share‑based transactions.
Each Director has been granted two transfers of options. The first tranche is not subject to any vesting conditions and the second tranche is subject to 
achievement of a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. Under both tranches, vested options can be exercised at any time between the third 
and tenth anniversary of the date of the grant.
The accounting policy for share‑based payments is included within note 3, and the following have been factored into the model:
Exercise prices of £1.11 and £1.165, expected volatility of 25%, dividend yield of 3.00%, equivalent risk free rate of return being the rate of return 
on zero‑coupon Government bonds with a term equal to the expected life assumptions.
The Company’s assumptions regarding the volatility of its shares have been based on a review of market and competitors’ volatility. 34 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

The Group vacated a number of properties over the last six years for which there is an ongoing liability in respect of leases and other costs. The potential 
cost of these onerous contracts has been provided in the accounts. Due consideration has been given to the likelihood of sub‑letting these properties, 
the potential outflows of which will occur in the period to December 2018.

Our Business and Strategy
“The targeted growth 
opportunities will bring 
sustainability to the Group 
through the inclusion 
of intellectual property 
protected processes and 
technology.”
The overall strategy for the Animalcare Group changed to reﬂect the success of 
Animalcare Ltd, the veterinary supplies activity of the Group. The non-proﬁtable, 
underperforming business of the old Ritchey Group has now been disposed of leaving 
only Animalcare Ltd. All the Group’s efforts are now focused in driving this business 
forward.
The growth of Animalcare Ltd was based on strategies designed to build a sustainable 
high performing business in the UK through the development and sale of generic 
veterinary medicines and other complementary products. The success of those 
strategies has now given the Group a platform from which it is now capable of making 
stepwise changes in the rate of development of the business. In addition, the targeted 
growth opportunities, both in businesses and product areas, will bring sustainability 
to the Group through the inclusion of intellectual property protected processes and 
technology.
The strategies we will follow during 2012–13 are:
 ❱ continue our new product development of differentiated generic medicines at the 
current rhythm
 ❱ increase the sales of our current products outside the UK
 —with existing distribution in current markets
 —increased geographic cover with new distribution in new markets particularly 
within the EU and North America
 ❱ selectively strengthen UK Companion Animal Identiﬁcation range of goods and 
services
 ❱ continue to rationalise other product groups
 ❱ accelerate Project Sustain initially in enhanced generics
 ❱ reorganise business leadership and operational management to reﬂect our focus 
and concentration on the pharmaceutical side of the veterinary supplies business
See an example of our strategy in action Page 06
What is a generic veterinary medicine?
To obtain a Marketing Authorisation a licensed generic has to be “essentially 
similar” to the originator product. Pharmaceutical performance in particular 
must be almost identical, i.e. not substantially better or worse than the 
originator product.
Within Animalcare we classify generic veterinary medicines in three broad 
types:
 — undifferentiated generics — these are generics whose pharmaceutical 
action is the same as the originator product and are almost identical 
in all aspects (packaging, composition, dosage size) to the originator 
product
 — differentiated generics — these are generics whose pharmaceutical 
action is the same as the originator product but have one or more 
aspect of packaging, ﬂavouring, coating, tablet size, etc. modiﬁed to 
improved its acceptance by vets, owners or pets
 — enhanced generics — these are generics using well-established 
veterinary medicines but which have been formulated in such a way that 
their pharmaceutical performance is enhanced in use.

Europe.
In a dynamic and diverse market such as

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
This has been a difﬁcult year for Animalcare but I 
believe the measures the Board has taken will see it 
beginning to grow again during the current ﬁnancial 
year. Animalcare is currently made up of three 
product groups, Licensed Veterinary Medicines, 
Companion Animal Identiﬁcation and Animal Welfare 
products that are all sold mainly through veterinary 
practices. Whilst the Licensed Veterinary Medicines 
have continued to grow, albeit slower than 
anticipated, there has been a marked reduction in 
sales of both Identichip and Animal Welfare products 
during the year. Your Board is refocusing the 
management on these two areas, plus the continued 
development of new licensed veterinary products 
and this should return your Company to growth 
during the current year.
Financial trading
Sales during the ﬁnancial year fell by 8.2 per cent 
from £11.8 million to £10.9 million. This resulted 
in a reduction in underlying proﬁt before tax from 
£2.3 million to £1.8 million and fully diluted 
earnings per share from continuing operations fell 
18 per cent from 11.2p to 9.2p. However, your 
Company continues to be strongly cash generative 
and the year-end cash position has grown from 
£1.18 million to £2.31 million which helps improve 
the strength of our balance sheet. The reduction of 
sales was mainly caused by the delay to relaunch 
a replacement “single dose Buprecare ampoule” 
in the veterinary medicine market, a 28 per cent 
fall in sales in our Companion Animal Identiﬁcation 
business, and a 9 per cent reduction in sales in 
Animal Welfare products. To reverse this trend your 
Board promoted Dr Iain Menneer from Marketing 
Director to Managing Director Animalcare Ltd in 
charge of all sales and marketing in the UK. This 
allows Stephen Wildridge, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, to 
concentrate on increasing and delivering our product 
development pipeline and sales of our Licensed 
Veterinary Medicines through our European partners.
Dividend
With the increase in cash and the strong underlying 
cash ﬂow of your business the Company increased 
the interim dividend from 1.0 pence per share to 
1.5 pence per share which was paid on 4
th
 May 
2012. With this in mind the Board proposes to 
maintain the ﬁnal dividend at 3 pence per share. 
This gives a total dividend for the year of 4.5 pence 
per share, an increase of 12.5 per cent over the 
previous ﬁnancial year and is covered 2.1 times 
by earnings. The dividend, which is subject to 
shareholders’ approval at our Annual General 
Meeting, to be held on 6
th
 November 2012, will be 
paid on 16
th
 November 2012 to the shareholders on 
the register on 19
th
 October 2012.
“This has been a difﬁcult year for Animalcare but I believe 
the measures the Board has taken will see it beginning to 
grow again during the current ﬁnancial year.”

The Board
Your Board has been considerably strengthened 
during the year with the appointment to the Board of 
Dr Iain Menneer, Managing Director of Animalcare Ltd 
and also Ray Harding as a Non-Executive Director. 
Until 2010 Ray was an owner and Managing Director 
of Cyton Bioscience Ltd, a leading company in 
multi-service consultancy to both the animal health 
and pharmaceutical industries, and he remains as a 
part-time consultant to it. Chris Brewster also joined 
the Board towards the end of the ﬁnancial year as 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Company Secretary. 
He gained considerable commercial experience as 
Group Accounting Manager at Findus Group. Prior to 
this Chris was a senior manager in the KPMG audit 
department in the Leeds ofﬁce. I would like to thank, 
on behalf of the Board, all our customers, suppliers 
and colleagues who have helped support and develop 
Animalcare during the year.
Prospects
The Board believes with the focus on growing our 
Companion Animal Identiﬁcation business, the 
resumption of supply of Buprecare ampoules, and 
the planned launch of four new licensed veterinary 
products during the ﬁnancial year Animalcare should 
return to growth. 
Your Board is encouraged by current trading for the 
beginning of the ﬁnancial year.

Chief Executive’s Review
Introduction
The Animalcare Group is now fully focused on 
serving the professional veterinary industry through 
its expanding Licensed Veterinary Medicines portfolio 
and highly proﬁtable Companion Animal Identiﬁcation 
range. At a time when temporary supply difﬁculties 
with one key product strongly affected the 
business, our proven strategy of growth through the 
introduction of generic licensed veterinary medicines 
has meant that our performance in this key segment 
has been signiﬁcantly better than the overall market 
(see below).
Our pipeline for new products remained productive 
with our target of four new licensed generic 
veterinary medicines launched in the year being 
surpassed with the introduction of ﬁve new 
products. The remainder of our development 
programme continued on track with other products 
in development meeting their milestones and other 
target products being brought forward into the 
pipeline.
It is clear, however, that the competition in licensed 
generic veterinary medicines will accelerate and 
intensify over the short-term and although we remain 
very well placed to continue to compete and grow 
we have been adapting our strategy to deliver even 
more durable success in the future. Our efforts in 
this regard, referred to as Project Sustain, focus 
on accelerating our development activities beyond 
differentiated generics initially in enhanced generics. 
The work we have been doing during 2011-12 on 
Project Sustain is designed to provide the sustained, 
protected growth of the Animalcare Group. Project 
Sustain will become a more evident and important 
part of the business from here on in.
Business Overview
The Animalcare business was strongly affected by 
the abrupt loss for the whole year of one of our 
key products, Buprecare ampoules. At the same 
time rationalisation of lower margin products and 
a downturn in sales within our Companion Animal 
Identiﬁcation products negatively affected the 
business. Overall revenues were down £0.9m 
(8.2 per cent) and gross proﬁt was down £0.5m 
(8.3 per cent) on last year. Although it will take a little 
longer than we had initially hoped to reintroduce 
Buprecare ampoules we are now signiﬁcantly 
along the way to achieving this in the current 
ﬁnancial year. We have made signiﬁcant progress in 
strengthening our Companion Animal Identiﬁcation 
segment through cost of goods and cost to serve 
reductions and the implementation of improved data 
handling capabilities which lead to increased selling 
opportunities.
It is very encouraging that in a period when the 
overall economic climate has been troubled the 
resilience of the market for licensed veterinary 
medicines in key markets has been notable and 
our growth in the segment has been strong. In the 
UK, which remains the Animalcare Group’s largest 
market (92.2 per cent of revenue and 91.9 per cent 
of GP), excluding Buprecare ampoules, the growth 
in revenue from our Licensed Veterinary Medicines 
was 16.8 per cent. Even when Buprecare ampoules 
are included growth was still 3.3 per cent year on 
year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Revenue from our sales outside the UK were 
1.3 per cent lower than the previous ﬁnancial year, 
affected by the loss of Buprecare ampoules and the 
continued poor market conditions in Spain. Gross 
proﬁt was, however, 29.5 per cent higher as a result 
of increased sales in higher value markets.
It is our target to launch four new licensed generic 
veterinary medicines in course of each ﬁnancial year, 
a rate which is at the forefront for the market. During 
the course of ﬁnancial year 2011–12 we launched a 
total of ﬁve new licensed veterinary medicines:
 Torphosol, a sedative and short-term analgesic 
for use in horses
 Detonervin, a deep sedative and mild analgesic 
for use in horses
 Emdocam, an anti-inﬂammatory for use in 
horses, cattle and pigs
 Tilmodil, an antibacterial for use in cattle and 
sheep
 Buprecare MDV, a multidose vial version of our 
successful severe pain analgesic for cats and 
dogs
In addition, our currently marketed range of 
companion animal licensed generic medicines 
continued to perform well.
Sales revenue from the Companion Animal 
Identiﬁcation products group was £0.9 million 
(27.7 per cent) below last year principally due to the 
one-off effect of ending the low margin distribution 
of Sureﬂap cat ﬂaps (-£0.51m) and the reduced 
sales of Identichip our pet identiﬁcation microchips 
(-£0.25m). Gross proﬁt in the segment was 
£0.38 million (18.8 per cent) lower than last year. 08
Animalcare Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Stock code: ANCR
During the course of the year we took the important 
step of reorganising the senior management team 
to meet the needs of the business now and for the 
future. Chris Brewster joined the Group as Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer and Dr Iain Menneer took over the 
role of Managing Director for Animalcare Ltd with the 
primary responsibility of managing the UK business 
to achieve its short-term operational targets. This 
concentration of the UK business with Iain has 
allowed other members of the senior management 
team to concentrate on another three key areas of 
the business:
 increased penetration of our current products in 
existing markets
 controlled expansion of the geographic reach of 
the business
 driving the development programme, notably 
project Sustain.
Future Developments
In the short-term, licensed generic medicines for 
companion animals in our main target markets 
(UK, France and Germany) will provide the engine 
for growth of the Animalcare Group. This growth 
will be supplemented by better penetration of our 
existing products in markets outside the UK where 
we currently operate. We will improve sales through 
the selective geographic expansion of the markets 
we address.
In early September we launched Vitofyllin in the 
UK and Ireland in a market worth approximately 
£1.5 million per annum. It is a product which ﬁts 
well into our growing portfolio of products to treat 
chronic diseases and conditions of old age, in 
this case a central nervous system stimulant for 
older dogs. Our next two products are in the ﬁnal 
stages of development and have almost completed 
regulatory review. We expect to be able to launch 
both products in the UK in Q3 of the ﬁnancial year. 
A fourth product has just entered regulatory review 
and should be available for launch in Q4 of the 
ﬁnancial year. We are therefore conﬁdent of once 
more achieving our target of the launch of four new 
licensed generic veterinary medicines in ﬁnancial 
year 2012–13.
We have moved two projects to the next phase in 
development and remain conﬁdent that through 
our own product development pipeline and that 
of our development partners this rate of product 
innovation and introduction can be maintained for 
the foreseeable future.
Outlook
In my CEO’s statement last year I commented 
that 2011–12 “may be a difﬁcult year”. It was. 
Although challenging, the difﬁculties were, however, 
uncomplicated market issues which have been 
recognised and addressed or are well in the course 
of resolution. 2012–13 will not be without its 
challenges but the Animalcare Group is well placed 
to deliver a strong performance in the year, in line 
with expectations moving back to the growth levels 
recently experienced. Current trading is in line with 
expectations and comfortably above last year.
The Group has moved away from its previous 
position as an undifferentiated supplier of low 
value animal welfare products into a predominantly 
veterinary pharmaceutical based business. That 
trend must continue and intensify. I believe that 
with the support it needs in terms of product 
development expenditure and leadership evolution 
that we are well positioned to move to the next level 
and provide even higher levels of sustained,  
IP protected growth in the future.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Financial Review
Group Overview — Revenue and Proﬁt
Overall revenue from continuing operations reduced 
by 8.2 per cent to £10.9 million driven principally 
by our Companion Animal Identiﬁcation group 
(-£0.9 million) together with the full year loss of 
Buprecare ampoules (-£0.8 million). This was 
partially offset by the strong performance within 
our Licensed Veterinary Medicines segment which 
beneﬁted from the launch of ﬁve new medicines 
during the year.
Despite the increased competition in licensed 
veterinary medicines, gross margin remained 
consistent with prior year at 54 per cent.
Distribution costs reduced by 10.3 per cent 
compared to 2011, broadly in line with the reduction 
in revenues. Administrative expenses increased by 
8.6 per cent reﬂecting, in particular, investment in 
personnel (including Non-Executive Directors).
Both underlying* operating proﬁt and underlying* 
proﬁt before tax were £2.3 million for the year 
compared to £3.1 million and £3.0 million 
respectively in 2011.
Exceptional and other items
Exceptional and other items in the year comprised 
executive severance costs and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets. Full details are provided 
in note 6.
Finance income and costs
Following the repayment of bank debt on 31
st
 March 
2011, the Group has continued to maintain healthy 
positive cash balances hence has eliminated its 
borrowing costs in full during 2012.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate reduced from 
23 per cent to 17.9 per cent primarily due to the 
current year beneﬁt of prior year research and 
development tax credits.
Earnings per share and dividends
The Group achieved 9.3 pence (2011 — 
11.8 pence) underlying basic earnings per share.
An interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share was paid 
on 4
th
 May 2012 (2011 — 1.0 pence per share). The 
Board proposes the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 
3.0 pence per share (2011 — 3.0 pence per share) 
given the satisfactory cash ﬂow performance of the 
business during 2012, giving a total dividend of  
4.5 pence per share, up 12.5 per cent (2011 —  
4.0 pence per share).
Cash ﬂows
The Group generated £1.1 million (2011 — cash 
outﬂow £0.4 million) cash during the year, resulting 
in a strong net cash position at 30
th
 June 2012 of 
£2.3 million (2011 — £1.2 million). Working capital 
reduced by £0.1 million (2011 — £0.5 million 
increase) in line with the reduced year end sales and 
phasing of strategic inventory purchases.
Income taxes paid were £0.4 million (2011 — 
£0.8 million) the reduction principally reﬂecting the 
decrease in the Group’s taxable proﬁts together with 
the beneﬁt of prior year research and development 
tax credits.
We have increased our investment by 75 per cent 
in new product development of licensed veterinary 
medicines compared to 2011 and will continue this 
trend during the next ﬁnancial year. New product 
development will continue to be funded from 
operational cash ﬂows.
*Underlying results are before the effect of exceptional costs 
and other items disclosed in note 6 to the ﬁnancial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
New product development
A key element of the Group’ s strategy is to expand its portfolio 
of veterinary medicines, the success of which depends on these 
products meeting the required regulatory standards and achieving 
the necessary marketing authorisations. Rejection of applications or 
delays in the regulatory process could have an important impact on 
the Group’ s results. Also there can be no guarantee of the commercial 
success of these products following their launch. The risks of failure, 
rejection or delay are mitigated or reduced by the careful selection of 
development strategies that, although they may increase initial cost or 
time of development, reduce the likelihood of complete unexpected 
failure of a project. At the same time the overall risk of any one project 
failure having a major inﬂuence on the performance of the business is 
reduced by having a product development pipeline that has numerous 
projects within it at various stages of development. Our Governance Our Financials Our Business

Animalcare Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Key customers
The Group derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from a 
number of key customers. In the event that these relationships are 
lost the effect on the Group’s revenue could be signiﬁcant. In the 
UK, however, such effect is likely to be temporary as the supply 
chain would rapidly adjust to take up the slack brought about by 
any catastrophic failure. Equally, as our business develops its scope 
into new markets the key customer base continues to grow.
Key suppliers and contract manufacturers
The Group purchases goods for resale under supply and 
distribution agreements with a number of key suppliers and contract 
manufacturers. Failure of supply under these arrangements could 
result in signiﬁcant loss of Group revenue. We however endeavour 
to have where possible more than one supplier for key elements of 
the range and where that is not possible, different parts of the range 
with different suppliers.
Retention of key employees
The Group has a small senior executive management team whose 
skills, knowledge and experience are key to the success of Group 
strategy. Loss of any of these team members could signiﬁcantly 
affect Group performance.
Financial instruments
The Group’s exposure to and arrangements for the management of 
ﬁnancial risks are described in notes 20 and 22 to the accounts.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to maintain good relationships with its 
suppliers. Suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment which 
are agreed with them in advance and these terms are adhered to. 
The number of days purchases included in trade creditors at 
30
th
 June 2012 was 50 days (2011: 48 days).
Corporate governance
The Directors support the underlying principles of the Combined 
Code, notwithstanding that the Company is not required to comply 
with all of the Code’s recommendations. The Board recognises its 
overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and 
their effective operation and it has sought to comply with those 
provisions of the Code judged appropriate for the current size and 
nature of the Group, being the establishment of an audit committee, 
a remuneration committee and a nominations committee.
Formally constituted audit, remuneration and nominations 
committees, with membership comprising the Company’s three 
Non-Executive Directors, were established on the Group’s 
admission to AIM and are active in the conduct of internal ﬁnancial 
control, executive performance and remuneration and Board 
appointments.
Charitable and Political Donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £166 
(2011 — £178). No political donations were made during the year 
(2011 — £nil).
Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and 
fair consideration. When existing employees become disabled every 
effort is made to provide continuing employment wherever possible.
The Directors recognise the importance of good communications 
with employees and continue to consult and inform them on 
matters affecting them and the performance of the Group. 
Employees are provided with ﬁnancial incentives related to the 
performance of the Group in the form of annual bonuses and 
participation in approved sharesave schemes. 14

Going concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on 
page 12.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness of the 
preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern basis, the 
Directors have considered the current cash position, the availability 
of bank facilities and forecasts of future trading including working 
capital requirements.
As previously noted, the Group continues to be strongly cash 
generative and the year-end cash position has grown from 
£1.18 million to £2.31 million. In addition, the Group has an 
undrawn overdraft facility of £100,000 which is available for general 
corporate and working capital requirements if required. In the 
Directors’ opinion, the Group’s working capital requirements can be 
met from operating cash ﬂow.
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic 
outlook. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current 
committed facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of this annual 
report conﬁrms that:
 — So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 — The Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
KPMG Audit Plc have expressed their willingness to continue 
in ofﬁce as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements for the year ended 30
th
 June 2012
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires 
the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. As required by the AIM Rules of 
the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group 
and parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company 
and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 16

1. General Information
Animalcare Group plc (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and 
is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group comprises Animalcare Group plc and its subsidiaries. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in note 7 and within the Directors’ Report.
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations, with an effective date after the date
of these financial statements. Their adoption, where applicable, is not expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements of the Group.
International Financial Reporting Standards
Applies to periods 
beginning after
IAS 1 Presentation of Items in Other Comprehensive Income (amended) July 2012
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements January 2013

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors under the historical cost 
convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”) and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. They have also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules.
Going concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on pages 12.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness of the preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern basis, the 
Directors have considered the current cash position, the availability of bank facilities and forecasts of future trading including working 
capital requirements.
The Group has an undrawn overdraft facility of £100,000 which is available for general corporate and working capital requirements. At 
30
th
 June 2012 the Group had cash on hand of £2.31 million (30
th
 June 2011 — £1.18 million). In the Directors’ opinion, the Group’s 
working capital requirements can be met from operating cash flow.
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current committed facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. 22

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 30
th
 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Discontinued operations
The livestock businesses were disposed of during the previous financial year and represented a discontinued operation as defined in 
IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and other businesses is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are 
expensed. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
(revised) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified 
as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and 
measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Exceptional and other items
Exceptional items are material items of income or expense which, because of their nature and the expected frequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate disclosure.
Other items relate to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, fair value movements on interest rate hedging and impairment of 
goodwill.
The separate presentation of exceptional and other items enables the users of the accounts to better understand the elements of 
financial performance during the year and hence to better assess trends in that financial performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in comprehensive 
income and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS (1
st
 July 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Intangible Assets
The Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets arise both 
as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations 
from 1
st
 January 2004, and from the purchase of software (that is separable from any associated hardware), and development 
machinery and from research and development (see below).
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows:
Customer relationships 10 years
Brands 15 years
Software Useful life of the software
Research and development Estimated economic life, normally 4–7 years
The useful life of software is currently estimated to be 2–4 years.
Internally generated intangible assets — research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
 — an asset is created that can be identiﬁed (such as software and new processes);
 — it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic beneﬁts; and
 — the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred which is generally when goods 
are delivered.
Income received in relation to long-term service contracts is deferred and subsequently recognised over the life of the relevant 
contracts. Further details are contained in note 23.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying value.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly 
against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the 
Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below). 24

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under 
the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in 
comprehensive income for the year.
Segment Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transaction with any of the Group’s other components. An operating 
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to 
the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to the Chief Executive Officer include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that 
can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly central Group administration costs, interest, taxation, and 
bank loans.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct 
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is 
calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the Statement of Changes in Equity only when an obligation to pay the dividend arises prior to 
the year end.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has 
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
th
 November 2002 that were unvested at 1
st
 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of such equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions (with a corresponding 
movement in equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings and other assets held for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, 
fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Other than for land, which is not depreciated, depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less their estimated residual 
value, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Straight-line
Freehold Buildings 50 years
Leasehold improvements 10 years
Plant and equipment 4 to 7 years
Office furniture and equipment 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation outstanding at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 26

2. Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (continued)
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in comprehensive income when 
there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition.
Investments
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits repayable on demand, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from 
operational and financial activities. The Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, 
derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Hedge accounting is not adopted and therefore the movement on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately as part of 
finance income or finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of comprehensive income. Derivatives not designated into an effective 
hedge relationship are classified as a current asset or current liability. Fair value movements on interest rate hedging are included within 
“exceptional and other items” on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.

3. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below).
Capitalised research & development expenditure
It is the Group’s policy to capitalise development expenditure and to amortise this expenditure over the estimated life of the asset. 
Expenditure incurred to date relates primarily to the following:
 — certain costs associated with preparing regulatory dossiers in support of applications for generic veterinary medicine Marketing 
Authorisations.
The Directors have adjudged these costs to meet the relevant criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”.
Capitalised software expenditure
The Group has historically capitalised software projects and developments. Expenditure on a bespoke web based system, designed 
to facilitate online ordering of its products, is currently capitalised in the Group’s financial statements as the Directors have adjudged it 
to meet the relevant criteria.
The rate of depreciation on capitalised software is set so as to reflect the pattern of usage and the level of pace of change within the 
global information technology market.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the “value in use” and/or the “fair value less costs to 
sell” of the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) to which the non-current asset has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The 
key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling 
prices and direct costs. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable rate to be 
11.3 per cent (2011 — 12 per cent). The Directors’ sensitivity analysis indicates that the headroom in the impairment test of  
11.3 per cent is robust to significant changes in discount factors.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management 
for the next three years, thereafter assuming an estimated growth rate of 1.9 per cent (2011 — 1 per cent). The growth rates for the 
three year period covered by financial budgets and projections prepared by management are based on the current performance of the 
existing product portfolio and the contribution from new products, currently in development, which will be launched in the short term. 
The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Impairment of slow-moving and obsolete inventory
The Group performs an annual stockholding review to determine any slow-moving or obsolete lines and accordingly makes provision 
in its financial statements for writing down or writing off the value of such lines in order to reflect the true value of its stock. 28

The carrying amount of Group goodwill is allocated to the Companion Animal Segment.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for 
the next three years and thereafter assuming an estimated annual growth rate of 1.9 per cent (2011 — 1.0 per cent).
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results. The growth rates for the three 
year period are based on current performance of the existing product portfolio and the contribution from new products currently 
in development which will be launched in the short term. The Directors consider the growth rate to be modest based on historical 
performance. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK 
economy.
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit (“CGU”). In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable pre-tax 
rate to be 11.4 per cent (2011 — 12.1 per cent).
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount 
rate. Based on this sensitivity analysis there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the 
CGU.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months of less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk
The Company’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables. The Company’s credit 
risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful 
receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The allowance for doubtful debts represents the difference between the 
carrying value of the specific trade receivables and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The average credit period on sales of goods is 31 days (2011 — 40 days). No interest has been charged on overdue receivables.

23. Deferred Income
Deferred income arises from certain services sold by the Group’s subsidiary Animalcare Ltd. In return for a single upfront payment, 
Animalcare Ltd commits to a fixed term contract to provide certain database, pet reunification and other support services to 
customers. There is no contractual restriction on the amount of times the customer makes use of the service. At the commencement 
of the contract it is not possible to determine how many times the customer will make use of the services, nor does historical evidence 
provide indications of any future pattern of use. As such, income is recognised evenly over the term of the contract, currently 
eight years.
Movements in the Group’s deferred income liabilities during the current and prior reporting period are as follows:
 
2012

Results
2015 was another year of growth with the Group’s revenue 
increasing by 14% from £248.1m to £281.7m and adjusted 
operating profit increasing by 15% from £87.3m to £100.1m.
The Group achieved growth across all three brands: 
MoneySuperMarket, MoneySavingExpert and 
TravelSupermarket, with MoneySavingExpert performing 
particularly well. Within MoneySuperMarket, revenue in all our 
lines of business grew during the year as customers used our 
services to help them meet their financial needs.
In September, the three-year deferred consideration period in 
connection with the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert 
concluded. We paid deferred consideration in November of 
£20.6m out of a total of up to £27.0m, reflecting the strong 
performance of that business during the three-year period.  
As we previously announced, Martin Lewis remains with 
MoneySavingExpert in a new position of Executive Chairman  
to help it continue to grow and develop.
We continue to maintain a strong financial position with good cash 
generation. Cash generated from operations during the year was 
£96.9m. After paying the deferred consideration of £20.6m in 
connection with the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert, the Group 
ended the year with net cash of £16.7m. 
Dividend
Our continued confidence in the underlying strength and 
growth prospects of our business is reflected in our progressive 
and sustainable dividend policy.
Having reviewed the cash required by the business and the 
performance of the Group, the Company paid an interim 
dividend of 2.55p (2014: 2.31p) per ordinary share on 11 
September 2015. The interim dividend represented an increase 
of 10% on the interim dividend paid in 2014.
During the second half of the year, the business continued to 
grow and generate cash. As a result, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 6.6p (2014: 5.69p) per ordinary share, 
representing an increase of 16% on the final dividend in 2014.
If approved by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, this will bring the total dividend for the year to 9.15p 
(2014: 8.00p) per ordinary share and will be paid on 6 May 2016 
to all shareholders on the register on 1 April 2016.
Our strategic progress
Our three leading brands give us significant strength, breadth and 
diversity, generating growth and increasing the predictability of 
the business. All of our brands are consistent in their ambition to 
‘help every household make the most of their money’.
During the year, we have continued with our significant capital 
investment programme which commenced in 2014 to improve 
our technology, our data capabilities and our customer journeys. 
The investment allows for greater flexibility and scalability across 
our different channels and any future channels. Customers will 
Our brands give us significant 
strength, breadth and diversity,  
and are consistent in their ambition  
to ‘help every household make the

three brands generated growth  
whilst we continued with the  
three-year investment in our 
technology programme.

find it easier to use our websites and will benefit from greater 
personalisation of our services, especially important for our 
customers on smartphones. This investment will help us to 
support additional growth from the business and will further 
differentiate our brands from those of our competitors. 
All of our motor and home insurance customers in 
MoneySuperMarket and all of our travel customers in 
TravelSupermarket now use the new technology platform when 
they visit us. In 2016 we will migrate a number of other channels 
to this new technology platform.
In parallel, we continued to invest significantly in our marketing 
strategy, including the strengthening of our digital marketing 
capability and the continuation of our ‘You’re So 
MoneySuperMarket’ advertising campaign, both of which 
helped to attract visitors to the Group’s websites. 
While no acquisitions were made in 2015, the Group continues to 
review acquisition opportunities against a disciplined set of return 
and risk appetite metrics.
During 2015, our services have attracted greater attention from 
our regulators, in part due to the growing habit exhibited by 
consumers to use price comparison services. In particular, Ofgem 
launched an investigation into price comparison websites in the 
first half of 2015 and the Competition and Markets Authority have 
indicated they will undertake a review of price comparison 
websites during 2016. During 2015 we have sought to enhance our 
relationships with key regulators and we share the vision of 
regulators generally to make products more accessible and 
understandable to consumers.
Governance
Following the formation of the Risk Committee in 2014, the 
identification and management of risk has continued to be a focus 
for us during the year including the approval of a Group-wide Risk 
Appetite Framework and a detailed assessment of the risks 
associated with the Group’s capital investment programme. 
Further information on risk management and the key risk focus 
areas during the year are set out on pages 27 to 31.
During the year, we continued to enhance our approach to 
corporate governance, building on the areas for improvement 
identified during our external Board evaluation in 2014. This 
included the creation of an annual forward-looking agenda for the 
Board and each of the Committees which enables the Board and 
the Committees to better plan their activities over the course of 
each year. As a result, we have built a detailed review of one of the 
Group’s key strategic priorities into each Board agenda; included 
greater focus in Nomination Committee meetings on succession 
planning for the Board and executive management; and enhanced 
the formal Committee evaluation process to enable the 
Committees to appraise more effectively their performance and to 
identify any further areas for improvement. 
More information on our approach to governance is set out in 
my Introduction to Governance, the Corporate Governance 
Report and the reports of each of the Committees on pages 36 
to 71. These reports describe how we have applied the main 
principles of the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) during 2015 and reports upon our compliance 
with the Code’s provisions.
The Board
We have a strong and balanced Board, with diversity of 
experience and technical expertise with which to support the 
strategic and operational direction of the Group. 
During the year Robin Klein, Michael Wemms and Graham Donoghue  
stepped down as Directors. I would like to thank each of them for 
their significant contributions to the Board. In particular I would like 
to thank Graham Donoghue for his commitment and dedication in 
helping to develop the new Group technology platform.
Most significantly, on 31 December, Simon Nixon, our founder and 
first CEO, stepped down from the Board. Simon founded the 
business in 1999 and led the business through its IPO in 2007. Simon 
has been an inspirational figure with his relentless focus on product 
development and customer service. We will miss his insights and 
wish him well as he pursues a number of new opportunities.
Robin Freestone joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director in August 2015 and brings experience of leading global and 
digital businesses to our Group, helping us to shape our strategy and 
future direction as we become a larger and more complex business. 
Robin will succeed Rob Rowley as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
on conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
In 2014, the Board made a commitment to achieving a minimum 
representation of 25% of women on the Board by 2016. I am pleased 
to say we have met this objective and will continue to focus on 
broadening and strengthening the diversity of the Board and the 
Group in the years to come.
Our employees
Our results this year once again reflect the dedication and quality 
of all our employees across the Group. We rely on their skills, 
experience, competence and hard work to drive our business 
forward. Their passion, innovation and commitment to delivering 
the best for our customers are key assets for the Group and critical 
to its future success. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our employees for their significant contribution to the 
performance of the Group.
Outlook
We will continue to invest in technology in line with our three–year 
programme enabling customers to find it easier to use our 
websites, benefit from greater personalisation and save more 
money. Whilst we remain alert to competitor activity, particularly 
in the insurance market, we are confident about our prospects in 
2016. Our brands give us strength, breadth and diversity and are 
consistent in their ambition to ‘help every household make the 
most of their money’, enabling us to continue to build our business 
for the future.

Our Business Model
How we generate value–matching customers with the right provider
We operate through three leading brands, MoneySuperMarket, 
MoneySavingExpert and TravelSupermarket, who each have 
slightly different business models. We set out in this section the 
overarching business model for the Group.
Customers are attracted to our websites because we build brands 
and services that customers want to use to help them make the 
most of their money. This includes our customer journeys that are 
designed to be as helpful as possible, our expert content and 
support, our comparison services and our tools and guides. We 
offer product providers access to significant volumes of informed 
customers who have researched and are ready to take out the 
product they want, enabling providers to target their marketing 
spend. 
We therefore offer a compelling proposition to both our 
customers and to product providers, encouraging more of both to 
utilise the benefits of our brands and services. Whilst we do not 
work with every provider, we try to work with as many providers 
as possible to help our customer make the most of their money.
The diagram below summarises the key drivers behind how the 
Group achieves sustainable growth. It is based on four inter-
linking value drivers–scalability, technology, brand and people. 
Through our focus on these areas, we generate value for our 
customers, providers and shareholders.
Scalability
When creating, developing and maintaining our technology,  
we recognise the importance of scalability. We are in the second 
year of our technology investment programme, designed to 
ensure that our websites and apps are robust, flexible, secure 
and scalable across our different channels to meet the needs of 
our customers and product providers.
Technology
We are committed to technology development which provides 
benefits to both our customers and product providers.  
Our three-year technology programme focuses on three 
areas–developing our data capability, building a new 
technology platform and improving our customer experience 
and journeys. Customers will find it easier to use our services 
and benefit from greater personalisation, especially important 
for customers on a smartphone, helping them to make 
informed choices about what products they wish to take out in 
a straight forward and convenient way. Product providers will 
benefit from increasing numbers of informed customers who 
have researched and are ready to take out a product and from 
efficiencies as a result of our improved back office systems  
and processes.
Brand
Customers have the reassurance of using a family of well-
known and trusted brands and of receiving customer support 
either online or offline through our customer service centre. 
Providers benefit from our brand awareness by enabling them 
to target their marketing spend in a more efficient manner on 
increasing numbers of informed customers who have 
researched and are ready to take out a product.
People
Our people are integral to all that we do. We have hired the 
most talented people we can find across both our Ewloe and 
London offices. We have an outstanding team who are 
responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining, 
supporting and promoting our websites and apps. Our people 
are focused on our ‘Customer First’ programme which means 
making sure we do the right thing for our customers. Our core 
values underpin our ‘Customer First’ culture and help to ensure 
that we build trust and grow our business sustainably.
We operate a simple success-based business model that  
creates value for our customers, providers and shareholders

Customers
We provide our customers with a free, easy to use, online service 
so they can compare a wide range of products in one place and 
make an informed choice when taking out the product most 
suited to their needs. In a few simple steps, customers can use 
any of our trusted brands to help them save money on their 
household bills. Our services enable our customers to compare 
products by price, product features and service.
In addition to our comparison services, we help and support our 
customers to research the product they wish to take out. This 
includes expert content, innovative clubs, news and articles, 
tools, guides, video blogs, webchats and the ability to ask the 
views of other customers in our forums. We also send emails to 
our customers, enabling them to keep up to date with the latest 
deals, offers and best buys on a wide range of products. 
We help customers to find us through TV and radio advertising, 
editorial comment in the press and on television programmes, 
and through search engines. We ensure that our customers can 
access our services wherever they are by using our mobile 
responsive websites.
Providers
Partnering with the Group offers product providers access  
to large volumes of informed customers who, having researched 
and compared the market, are actively looking for a product. This 
means we are able to offer product providers a targeted, flexible, 
efficient and cost effective success-based marketing solution.
Shareholders
We have a simple, success-based revenue model which is  
highly scalable. For the majority of our services, we receive  
a marketing fee from the product provider for customers who 
take out a product through us. Revenue is driven by the number 
of products taken out through us and the fee rates payable to us 
by product providers for each product taken out. Therefore, an 
increase in either the number of products purchased or the  
fee rates will have a positive impact on revenue. 
By delivering value to our customers and product providers,  
we ultimately drive long-term financial value to our shareholders 
through the delivery of consistent revenue and earnings growth 
together with the payment of dividends in accordance with our 
progressive dividend policy.

TravelSupermarket being fully live on our new platform with  
no disruption to customers. This was a major achievement by  
all involved. 
Our growth strategy is simple and therein lies its benefit to  
our Group:
• Best site: Be the easiest way for people to find the right products 
for their needs 
• Earn customer loyalty: Trusted destination brands
• Preferred partner: Be the best way for providers to  
acquire customers
I am pleased to report that we have continued to make good 
progress during the year against our strategy through investment in 
our technology platform, brands and commercial teams.
As price comparison becomes the normal way for millions of people 
to research and shop for their financial products, as would be 
expected, our services have attracted greater attention from the 
regulators. During the year, Ofgem started an investigation in 
connection with energy price comparison sites and the Competition 
and Markets Authority announced they would look at price 
comparison websites during 2016. I am encouraged that the 
overarching theme of our engagement with regulators so far has 
been that we continue to make it easier for new providers to enter 
the markets in which we operate and that this has been, and will 
continue to be, good for consumers as we help them save and grow 
their money.
During 2015 we continued to develop our internal governance, 
launching our ‘Customer First’ programme across the organisation, 
helping our employees make sure we do the right thing for our 
customers and users.
As a Group, we are transparent on both our business model and 
how we make money to users and customers. For example, at 
MoneySuperMarket, we cannot guarantee listing all products and 
Overview
We saved our customers an estimated £1.6bn in 2015, more than 
ever before, and thanks to our broad range of services and the 
power of our three trusted brands, we did it slightly differently than 
planned, delivering revenue of £281.7m up 14% compared to 2014.
For customers, it was the year of taking action against expensive 
standard energy tariffs and sorting out their personal finances with 
both attractive credit card deals and innovative current accounts as 
referred to later in my review. 
Our focus on making it easier for customers to save money was 
reflected in the Group’s net promoter score of 48%, up 10% 
compared to 2014.
Whilst our three brands thrived, our new Group structure was 
focused on delivering the second year of the three-year technology 
re-engineering programme. Our ambition is to transition our 
services onto a single market leading platform, allowing data 
centres to be closed, innovation cycles to accelerate and 
smartphone experience to be better than desktop whilst leveraging 
costs and skills across the Group.
By the close of 2015, the team achieved the major milestone of both 
MoneySuperMarket (motor and home insurance channels) and 
More customers are choosing to share 
their data with us, allowing us to 
develop personalised tools and 
services to better meet their  
individual needs.

providers, however we do try and have a wide range of providers on 
our site to help the majority of our customers make a significant 
saving to that of their current provider.
Our Group
We estimate that our three brands of MoneySuperMarket, 
MoneySavingExpert and TravelSupermarket together have an 
average of 23.6m monthly unique visitors, with many people using 
either two or all three of them during a year.
I reported last year that to deliver our growth strategy, I intended  
to restructure our organisation. This has been successfully 
implemented forming a Group structure united by the common 
purpose of ‘helping every household make the most of their money’.
Each brand is now led by a Managing Director, supported by shared 
Group services of technology, finance, people, user experience and 
data. This allows the business to leverage costs and skills across our 
brands whilst learning more about customer behaviour than would 
ever be possible as standalone businesses. With relevance being 
one key to customer engagement, this is a vital ingredient for our 
future growth.
MoneySuperMarket
MoneySuperMarket had a good year delivering revenue of £250.1m, 
up 14% compared to 2014. 
Insurance had a mixed year with strong growth during the first half 
but declining revenues during the final quarter. Several factors 
contributed to this including increased competitor activity, limited 
ability to innovate our site during its re-platforming and a strategy 
to maintain margin during the final quarter.
Money, on the other hand, had a very successful year.  
Customers were particularly active in switching both credit cards 
and current accounts. Thanks to our technology investment,  
more people used our innovative ‘smart search’ functionality, 
allowing them to search for loans and credit cards that they were 
most likely to be accepted for, not just market leading deals for 
which they might not be eligible. 
Home Services also had a very successful year, demonstrating the 
power of our Group structure and culture. By working together, 
MoneySuperMarket and MoneySavingExpert helped over 500,000 
people switch their energy tariff during the year and make 
significant savings, chiefly through our collective switch initiatives. 
As I outlined earlier, 2016 will see the rollout of our new technology 
platform to our money and energy channels, completing both  
our single platform and single customer view ambition for 
MoneySuperMarket core channels, whilst delivering a single joined 
up experience for our customers no matter what device they 
choose to use, desktop, tablet or smartphone.
MoneySavingExpert
MoneySavingExpert had a great year delivering revenue of £30.7m, 
up 35% compared to 2014, of which £23.7m (2014: £16.8m) related 
to intercompany revenue.
More users signed up to receive the MoneySavingExpert weekly tip 
email, breaking through the 10m subscribers milestone. This is a 
huge endorsement of the great work the editorial team do at 
MoneySavingExpert and confirms that we are truly living the values 
of the editorial code so carefully put in place during the acquisition 
of the business. 
In 2015, MoneySavingExpert’s Cheap Energy Club was particularly 
helpful when combined with the power of the collective switch deals 
negotiated by the Group. The team have been a powerful voice in 
helping encourage people who have never switched before to take 
the initiative and save themselves money by joining others in 
changing energy supplier. 
In September we reached the end of the three-year earn-out period 
following the Group’s acquisition of MoneySavingExpert in 2012, 
paying deferred consideration and employee bonuses of £20.6m. 
The Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Martin Lewis, has stepped up into 
the role of Executive Chairman at MoneySavingExpert.
TravelSupermarket
TravelSupermarket had a good year delivering revenue of  
£24.5m, up 8% compared to 2014. 
We have rebuilt the TravelSupermarket site for customers on our 
new technology platform. The site has a very different look and feel, 
designed for mobile first and packed with great search and filtering 
capability. However, its pioneering feature is ‘My Suitcase’, designed 
to allow people to share flights, holidays and hotels with friends  
and family before clicking through and booking. We believe that  
‘My Suitcase’ will be a valuable tool for holiday planners, increasing 
their engagement with our services whilst allowing us to get to know 
them better. With new additional features planned for 2016 the 
team is focused on creating the best tools for customers to plan and 
book their holidays.
Travel is a very competitive market and therefore we have started 
2016 with a new TV campaign to tell people about our new service 
whilst testing how the new ‘My Suitcase’ tool performs with different 
groups of customers. It should be an exciting year ahead for the 
TravelSupermarket team.
Summary
Whilst delivering good financial results in 2015, we also invested 
£19.6m of capital expenditure to power future growth in the  
years ahead.
Our Insurance and Travel markets appear to be getting tougher 
whilst our Money and Energy markets continue to grow. Providers 
are launching ever more attractive products due to the continued 
environment of low interest rates and falling energy prices. This can 
only be great news for UK households and demonstrates the power 
of our diversified service.
Our new technology platform and Group structure means that we 
can share learnings and insights across our three brands, helping to 
pioneer a better mobile experience for our growing number of 
customers on smartphones. 
More customers are choosing to share their data with us, allowing 
us to develop personalised tools and services to better meet their 
individual needs. As we look to the future, personalised, relevant, 
mobile first services will start becoming reality thanks to our 
investments started back in 2014.
As we head into 2016, the Group is well placed to help more people 
save more money in the year ahead.

We are driven by a  
clear strategy for growth
Strategy
Our strategy is to build our core business of helping customers 
to find the right product. Investing in our technology is key  
to this. Through this investment, we will develop an enhanced 
understanding of our customers and deliver an improved and 
consistent customer experience. Ensuring our services work  
as well on a mobile and tablet device as they do on a desktop, 
our customers are able to access our services wherever and  
whenever they want to. This will allow us to build deeper 
relationships, delivering more value to our customers by 
helping them make the most of their money.
KPIs
As we continue our growth strategy and the investment in our 
technology programme, we need to measure our performance 
against our strategy. Our key performance indicators are set 
out on pages 11 to 13.
Risk management
The management of risk has a key role to play in the 
achievement of our strategy. The relationship between our 
principal risks and our strategy is identified in the Principal 
Risks section of this Report on pages 30 and 31.

Best site
Be the easiest way for people to find  
the right products for their needs
During 2015 we continued the investment in our technology 
programme, spending £19.6m, an increase of £3.5m compared to 
2014. We completed the second year of our three-year programme, 
launching our new platform across the motor and home insurance 
channels at MoneySuperMarket and across TravelSupermarket.
This investment improves the Group’s technology, data capabilities 
and customer journeys, enabling greater personalisation of services 
and improved customer journeys on mobile and tablet devices.  
This will help our customers access our services wherever and 
whenever they want to and regardless of device. Customers can 
access the same platform to pick up their transaction and details to 
complete the same transaction.
The increase of over 1m average unique monthly users in 2015  
to 23.6m reflects the benefits we are delivering to our customers  
as more choose to engage with our brands to make the most of  
their money. 
2016 will see further exciting innovation across the Group. We will  
complete the third year of our technology investment programme 
as we continue to roll out our new technology platform to more 
MoneySuperMarket channels.
This will provide customers with more consistent and improved 
customer journeys and enable us to offer greater personalisation of 
our services, making it easier for customers to find the product most 
suited to their needs.

Our MoneySuperMarket customer account, ‘MyProfile’, allowed more  
than 18m customers to keep their data up to date and to save money  
with us, an increase of nearly 3m customers on the previous year. 
MoneySavingExpert continued their innovation by launching a number  
of energy collective switches and building on their clubs and forums. 
Within TravelSupermarket, we launched ‘My Suitcase’ which allows 
customers to store and share their holiday plans.
These innovative customer tools encourage more customers to use our 
services and share their data with us, allowing the Group to 
increasingly personalise services and make it easier for customers to 
save money with us. We estimate that the savings made by customers 
in 2015 were £1.6bn.
The Group’s focus on improving customer journeys and making it easier 
for customers to make the most of their money was reflected in the 
Group’s net promoter score of 48% in 2015, an increase of 10% 
compared to 2014.
In 2016, we will continue to focus on our customer account capabilities 
to make it even easier for our customers to use their data across more 
of our channels so that they can quickly and easily find the product 
most suited to their needs and to save even more money.

Preferred partner
Be the best way for providers to  
acquire customers
As the only major independent price comparison site, our commercial  
teams focused throughout 2015 on building stronger relationships with  
our providers, with the aim of being their partner of choice. We worked  
hard to understand our providers’ objectives and to identify opportunities  
to help our customers, including market leading exclusive products.  
Providers understand the value we bring them, which is why we continue to 
attract a strong panel of providers to our sites, with the number of providers 
increasing from 723 in 2014 to 877 in 2015.
During 2015, we have shared with providers our improved customer insights 
to help them understand what our customers want and how they can 
improve their products, as well as to target their marketing spend and the 
customers they wish to acquire in a more efficient manner.
We also continued to invest to improve our CRM and search capability, 
helping us and our providers to engage with customers efficiently and to help 
them make an informed choice on the products most suited to their needs. 
This was reflected in the improved marketing margin during 2015 of 68%.
During 2016 we will continue to build our relationships with providers so that 
we can understand their strategic objectives and goals, and how we can help 
them to continue to target their marketing spend more efficiently.
Core values
The strength of our Group is a reflection of the passion, innovation,  
skills and experience of our employees. They play a critical role in the 
performance of the Group, living our core values as one team and always  
making things better for customers, colleagues and providers. We take  
pride in being a profitable and efficient Group that has a clear focus  
on our customers.
Our focus on our customers during 2015 was reflected in a number of  
initiatives including the launch of our ‘Customer First’ programme which is 
about making sure we do the right thing for our customers. The continued 
investment in our technology improves customer journeys and makes it 
easier for our customers to make the most of their money. This focus on  
our customers will continue during 2016 as we complete the third year of our 
technology investment programme.

The place where customers look first  
to save and grow their money. 
Whilst the UK economy is feeling more buoyant, we know that 
consumers still feel the pinch, and could be saving hundreds of 
pounds across different products by changing to a different 
provider. We aim to help consumers by empowering them to 
make an informed choice on the products most suited to their 
needs and to take control of their household finances. We help 
our customers in a number of ways, including through the 
content and tools on our website and through our online chat 
service and dedicated phone lines supporting those channels, 
such as energy comparison, where that extra bit of help can 
make all the difference to a customer’s peace of mind.
Choice
We work with a significant number of providers to give our 
customers access to a wide range of products and 
providers helping them find the product that is most suited 
to their needs. This is why we compare over 50 credit card 
and personal loan providers, over 40 energy providers, 
over 60 home insurance brands and over 140 motor 
insurance brands.
Scale
Our scale helps us work with providers to offer our 
customers many market-leading deals including some  
that are exclusive to MoneySuperMarket and are not 
available elsewhere. 
Improving the customer journey
Our new technology platform was rolled out across home 
and motor insurance in 2015 and will be rolled out to more 
channels in 2016 as we focus on improving our customer 
journeys and ensuring our services work seamlessly across 
mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
MyProfile
We continued to invest in our customer account, MyProfile, 
to enable customers to securely store their data with us 
and then use it to save more money again in the future 
without needing to re-enter their details. This makes it 
easier and quicker for our customers to make the most of 
their money. It also helps us provide a service that is more 
personalised to their needs.
Market trends and opportunities
We have seen a number of trends in the markets in which we 
operate where customers could save money by actively 
managing their household bills including:
• Motor insurance premiums – These have started to rise from 
the first half of 2014. This implies an increase in the average 
saving available from switching and may encourage 
consumers to review their motor insurance and switch 
through a price comparison website.
• Credit cards – Balance transfer periods have continued to 
rise and cards with low fees have become more prevalent as 
providers compete to acquire customers. As the quality of 
credit cards improves, consumers are more likely to compare 
products and switch to a better credit card through 
MoneySuperMarket.
• Energy bills – The cost of fuel has been declining since 2014, 
but this saving is commonly only given to customers who 
take out new tariffs, at the expense of those who stay on 
standard deals. This means that the average customer could 
save a significant amount by switching. MoneySuperMarket 
is one of the leading energy comparison sites and also offers 
collective switches for consumers. MoneySuperMarket is 
therefore well placed to benefit from consumers seeking to 
reduce their energy costs and switch their energy provider. Strategic Report

• Political and regulatory focus – There has been increased 
political and regulatory focus on the costs of energy for 
consumers and the level of competition in the energy 
marketplace. This increased focus on energy costs may 
lead to increasing consumer awareness of the costs of 
energy and the benefits of switching their energy 
provider through MoneySuperMarket.
Our future
During 2016, we will:
• continue our technology investment programme to 
improve our customer journeys and ensure our  
services work seamlessly across mobile, tablet and

• offer more personalised services in a smartphone world;
• invest further in our CRM and organic search capability 
to help us personalise and grow our customer 
relationships; and
• further strengthen our relationships with our providers 
to help offer our customers a wider choice of products 
and services.

Continually innovating. During 2015 we continued to build

in 2014. We ran our most successful collective energy switch 
during 2015, switching over 90,000 customers to a market-

Market trends and opportunities
We have seen a number of trends in the markets in which we 
operate where consumers could save money by actively 
managing their household bills including:
• Financial services – There is increasing competition among 
financial services providers for consumers who want credit 
products such as loans and credit cards. Balance transfer 
periods for credit cards have continued to rise and cards with 
low fees have become more prevalent as providers compete 
to acquire consumers. This increase in the quality of products 
enables MoneySavingExpert to provide expert editorial 
comment and engage with consumers on the best loans and 
credit cards available in the market.
• Energy – The cost of fuel has been declining since 2014,  
but this saving is commonly only given to consumers who 
take out new tariffs, at the expense of those who stay on 
standard deals. MoneySavingExpert provides collective 
energy switches for consumers, enabling them to switch to 
market-leading tariffs. MoneySavingExpert’s Cheap Energy 
Club, which alerts consumers if energy tariffs change and 
savings can be made, helps to ensure it is well placed to 
benefit from consumers seeking to reduce their energy costs.
• Political and regulatory focus – There has been increased 
political and regulatory focus on the costs of energy for 
consumers and the level of competition in the energy 
marketplace. This increased focus on energy costs may lead 
to increasing consumer awareness of the costs of energy  
and the benefits of switching their energy provider and,  
as outlined above, MoneySavingExpert is well placed to 
benefit from them seeking to reduce their energy costs and 
switch their energy provider.
Our future
In 2016, we will:
• continue our strategy of educating and fighting for the 
consumer. Campaigning will continue to be at the heart 
of what MoneySavingExpert does;
• develop and enhance our clubs and tools including our 
eligibility checker to help cut consumers’ bills, and
• continue to develop and enhance our site, tools and 
guides so that they are easier to use on a mobile or 
tablet device.

Getting more for less. Holidays and weekend  
breaks are precious. We recognise this and focus 
our energy on helping our customers get more 
holiday for their money.
Our customers love the breadth of choice that the world 
of online travel offers but the process of navigating it to 
find their ideal holiday at the best price can be frustrating. 
We aggregate travel options and prices from hundreds of 
providers across package holidays, hotels, flights and car 
hire, so customers can be sure that they are searching a 
wide range of products as they plan their holidays. We 
also offer a wide range of travel extras, such as travel 
insurance and airport parking. 
Useful tools and services
We have an ongoing programme of investment in 
technology that will make it easier for our customers to 
navigate this breadth of choice, and compare holidays on 
the things that matter most to them. By introducing new 
free-to-use tools such as ‘My Suitcase’, we make it 
straightforward for our customers to store a range of 
holiday options in one place and then share and collaborate 
with other travellers. We also make it easy to stay up to date 
with any price fluctuations through our price alerts 
functionality which enables customers to keep track of 
changing prices.
My Suitcase
‘My Suitcase’ creates a differentiated holiday planning tool, 
which allows customers to save, compare and share their 
holiday plans before booking. It increases engagement 
throughout the holiday research and booking process and 
allows us to learn more about our customers, which will 
help us to offer more relevant and personalised travel 
planning services in the future.
Improving the customer journey
The technology and website re-platforming project delivered 
for TravelSupermarket in 2015 has been designed ‘mobile first’ 
so that customers will be able to use our site across multiple 
devices – desktop, mobile and tablet – throughout the process 
of researching and booking a holiday. This will help our 
customers access our services whenever and wherever they 
want to.
Market trends and opportunities
Consumers with tight household budgets are looking for the 
best deal for their holiday. They are looking to compare the 
costs of the individual holiday components (including flights, 
hotels and car hire) to find the best deal for them. 
TravelSupermarket continues to focus on building leading 
comparison services for consumers to help them find the best 
deal for their holiday and to benefit from this increasing 
consumer demand to get more holiday for their money.  Strategic Report

Financial Review
During 2015 the Group continued to 
grow across all business areas. The 
strategy of offering customers a 
diverse range of products has meant 
the Group continued to deliver strong 
revenue growth of 14%.
The Group traded strongly in the year with revenue increasing 
14% to £281.7m and net profit after tax of £63.4m (2014: 
£52.8m), up 20%. The Group invested £19.6m in its technology 
as part of a three-year capital investment programme.
When reviewing performance, the Directors use a number of 
adjusted measures, including adjusted operating profit which 
increased by 15% to £100.1m (£2014: £87.3m). This is reconciled 
on the opposite page.
In 2015 the Group continued to grow across all business areas. The 
strategy of offering customers a diversified range of products has 
meant the Group continued to deliver strong revenue growth of 
14%. Growth was particularly strong in the Money and Home 
Services businesses, while Insurance growth was lower, as a result 
of strong second half comparatives in the previous year and 
tougher competition. 
Revenue in MoneySavingExpert.com was 34% up on last year 
(before eliminating intra-group revenues). Growth came from 
credit cards, current accounts and utilities, the last of which 
again benefited from the success of Cheap Energy Club, 
launched in 2013, and popular collective switches. 
MoneySavingExpert.com contributed £21.4m to Group adjusted 
operating profit (2014: £15.1m).
TravelSupermarket.com grew its revenue for the full year by 
8% and launched the new technology platform with innovative 
tools to enhance flexibility and the usability of the site 
for customers.

The Group remains committed to its technology development 
and invested £19.6m in 2015. This investment, as part of a 
three-year programme, focuses on three areas – developing our 
data capability, building a new aggregation engine, and 
upgrading our customer experience and journey. The investment 
allows for greater flexibility and scalability across our different 
channels and any future channels. Customers will benefit from 
better connectivity across channels and are increasingly able to 
use different devices to conduct the same transaction 
seamlessly. The Group believes this investment allows it to 
deliver services more effectively to customers through improved 
personalisation and better experience on mobile devices.
Notes
Basis of preparation
The results show the trading results for the years ended 31 December 2015 
and 2014 respectively. The following adjustments have been made in arriving 
at adjusted operating profit:
1 Amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets 
 The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the 
Company prior to Listing gave rise to £207.2m of intangible assets. These will 
be written off over a period of 3–10 years with a charge of £13.2m expensed 
in 2015 (2014: £17.8m). The acquisition of the trade and certain assets of 
MoneySavingExpert.com and a sole trader business from Martin Lewis 
(together MSE) on 21 September 2012 by the Group gave rise to £12.9m of 
intangible assets. These will be written off over a period of 3–10 years with a 
charge of £1.6m included within 2015 (2014: £1.7m). 
2 Contingent payable in relation to the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert 
 The Group has recognised an administrative expense relating to deferred 
remuneration which is linked to continued employment in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2015 of £4.8m (2014: £3.9m).
Reference is made below to adjusted cost base and adjusted distribution and 
administration expenses. These measures represent costs charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, less intangible 
amortisation relating to acquisitions, costs recognised in respect of the 
contingent payable in relation to the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert and 
corporate finance fees.
Group gross margins increased from 78.9% to 80.0%, largely as 
a result of increased volumes of traffic on channels other than 
online paid search. The proportion of direct to site revenues 
increased from 79% in 2014 to 84% in 2015. Paid search 
represented 15% of revenue in the year (2014: 17%).
Distribution costs were broadly in line with last year, with the 
Group continuing the successful ‘You’re So MoneySuperMarket’ 
campaign on television supported by radio and print.
Adjusted administrative costs increased by 23% from £73.9m to 
£91.1m in 2015. Adjusted staff costs (including contract resource) 
were 22% higher at £51m, largely because of increased headcount 
levels. Share-based payment charges were also higher as a result 
of the increased share price. Other administrative costs increased 
by £8m mainly as a result of increased technology amortisation 
costs, together with increased premises, IT and professional costs.
Adjusted operating profit margins remained broadly stable at 
35.5% (2014: 35.2%).
Group KPIs
The Directors use key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the 
performance of the business against the Group’s strategy. Our 
strategy is to build on our core business of helping customers to 
find the right product by investing in our technology, customer 
data and tools. This enables us to build deeper relationships, and 
deliver more value to both customers and providers. The three 
strategic priorities are: be the best site; earn customer loyalty; and 
be the preferred partner for our providers. The KPI’s measure our 
progress against these priorities. 22 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Best site: Be the easiest way for people to find the right products for their needs
During the year we invested £19.6m in our technology and delivered improvements to the customer journey. We introduced our 
new platform across the largest channels at MoneySuperMarket and TravelSupermarket, launched the MoreMoney App and 
launched ’My Suitcase’ on the new TravelSupermarket site. This enhances the customer experience by making transactions more 
intuitive and joined up across the business. The 5% increase in average monthly unique visitors to nearly 24 million shows the 
improved usability as well as success in offering great ways to save money.
Earn customer loyalty: Trusted destination brands
We added nearly 3 million more customers to ‘MyProfile’ which allows users to keep their details up to date. This helps us  
personalise services more and makes it easier for customers to save money. We estimate that in 2015 customer savings increased 
12% to £1.6bn.
More and more customers want to use our services via multiple devices and so we will continue to make sure they work just as  
well on mobiles and tablets. Already this year customers can, regardless of device, access the same platform and pick up their 
transaction and details where they left off. Our work earning customer loyalty is demonstrated by a 10% improvement in our  
net promoter score (48%).
Preferred partner: Be the best way for providers to acquire customers
Our business can only thrive by adding value to our providers. We do this by making improvements to our CRM capability and other 
marketing to help providers reach the right customers effectively. We use our data tools, analytics and position as the only major 
independent price comparison website to develop relationships with providers and secure market leading exclusive products for 
customers. Providers understand the value we bring which is why we continue to attract a strong panel of providers on our sites.

Trading performance
The Group operates across a number of businesses and markets. These are discussed below:
1 In the above table revenues in MoneySuperMarket.com arising from traffic from MoneySavingExpert.com have been shown in both MoneySuperMarket.com 
and MoneySavingExpert.com to present the revenues from MoneySuperMarket.com on a consistent basis and to show the contribution of the 
MoneySavingExpert.com business to the Group. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated as shown above.
Money
The Money vertical offers customers the ability to search for and compare products including credit cards, current accounts, 
mortgages, loans, debt solutions, savings accounts and business finance. It also includes elements of the Group’s leads business. 
Revenue in the money vertical increased by 23% from £58.9m to £72.4m.
Revenue growth was particularly strong in current accounts, as a result of more switching. Revenue from credit related products, 
such as secured and unsecured loans, credit cards and mortgages were ahead of prior year.
Trading improved in the second half of the year relative to the first half - the first half rose 20%, while the second half was up  
26% on 2014 comparatives, led by strong growth in credit card, current accounts and loans, all helped by customer  
journey improvements. 
The Government’s ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme, which means financial institutions can borrow from the Bank of England at 
attractive rates, continued to mean that few attractive savings products are on the market. The Government announced on 
30 November that the scheme was to be extended for a further period to 31 January 2018.
Insurance
The Insurance vertical offers customers the ability to search for and compare insurance products including breakdown, dental, 
home, life, medical, motor, pet and travel insurance. Revenue in the Insurance vertical increased 2% from £138.0m to £140.2m. 
After a first half in which revenues rose 8%, the second half, with strong 2014 comparatives, saw an overall decline of 5%. Motor 
and home insurance revenues were impacted by higher competitor marketing spend. 
Towards the end of the year, the motor and home insurance channels went live on the new technology platform, improving mobile 
performance and allowing the Group to make improvements to customer journeys through 2016.Travel insurance showed good 
annual growth, benefiting from improvements to the site and life insurance continued to grow strongly following the redesign of 
the customer journey in 2015.
An additional £3m – £5m online and offline marketing spend is planned during 2016.

Home Services
The Home Services vertical offers customers the ability to 
search for and compare products such as broadband, mobile 
phones, vouchers, shopping and utilities. Revenue in the Home 
Services vertical increased by 68% from £22.4m to £37.5m.
Utility switching makes up the majority of revenues in Home 
Services and this continued to benefit from collective switches, 
allowing customers to apply for market-leading tariffs available 
exclusively through the Group, together with the continued 
success of Cheap Energy Club which was launched by 
MoneySavingExpert.com in 2013. This allows householders to 
register for alerts when savings available against their current 
tariff exceed a predetermined amount set by the consumer.
TravelSupermarket.com
TravelSupermarket.com offers customers the ability to search 
for and compare car hire, flights, hotels and package holidays, 
amongst other things. Revenue increased by 8% from £22.6m  
to £24.5m.
In the fourth quarter, TravelSupermarket went live on its new 
website, offering an enhanced customer offering and innovative 
technology for planning and booking travel. 
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
MoneySavingExpert is one of the UK’s biggest consumer finance 
websites and is dedicated to cutting consumers costs and 
fighting their corner by means of journalism, great tools and a 
large community. 
MoneySavingExpert.com generated revenue of £30.7m (2014: 
£22.8m), of which £23.7m (2014: £16.8m) related to revenues also 
recognised within MoneySuperMarket.com, generated from 
traffic referred to it by MoneySavingExpert. It contributed 
£21.4m (2014: £15.1m) to Group adjusted operating profit.
Trading trends have been consistent with those seen by 
MoneySuperMarket.com with good growth in revenue from 
borrowing and banking. Utilities revenue benefitted from Cheap 
Energy Club and collective switches.
In September, the earnout period following the purchase in 
2012 of the trade and certain assets of MoneySavingExpert.com 
and a sole trader business from Martin Lewis concluded, with a 
final payment of £20.6m in November compared to a potential 
maximum of £27.0m. The Group recognised in administrative 
expenses a charge of £4.8m (2014: £3.9m) in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of deferred 
remuneration linked to this.
Financial Review
continued
Cash balance and dividend
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had net cash of £16.7m 
(2014: £13.1m).
In December 2015, the Group secured a new three-year 
revolving credit facility of £100m in committed funds provided 
in equal parts by Lloyds Bank PLC and Barclays Bank PLC. The 
Group also has an accordion option to apply to the banks for up 
to an additional £100m of committed funds during the first two 
years of the facility. This replaced the previous facility provided 
by Lloyds. The facility was unused at the year end.
Having reviewed the performance of the Group and the cash 
required by the business, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend, subject to shareholder approval, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2015 of 6.6p per ordinary share.
Together with the interim dividend of 2.55p per ordinary share 
paid on 11 September 2015, this gives a total dividend for the 
year of 9.15p per ordinary share (2014: 8.00p).
The Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy, with 
on-going monitoring of the appropriate capital structure.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 31 March 2016, 
with a record date of 1 April 2016 and a payment date of 6 May 
2016. Shareholders will have the opportunity to elect to reinvest 
their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the 
Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Tax
The Group tax charge of £16.4m in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income represents an effective tax rate of 
20.5% (2014: 19.9% as this included the non-taxable profit on 
disposal of an associate, HD Decisions Limited). This is broadly 
in line with the prevailing rate of 20.25% (2014: 21.5%).
In future, and once the statutory rate of tax has settled, the 
Group expects the underlying effective rate of tax to 
approximate to the standard UK corporation tax rate.
Earnings per ordinary share
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the year ended  
31 December 2015 was 11.6p (2014: 9.7p). Adjusted basic earnings 
per ordinary share increased from 12.3p to 14.5p per share.  
The adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on profit before 
tax after adding back intangible amortisation related to 
acquisitions, costs related to the contingent consideration payable 
for MoneySavingExpert.com and the profit on disposal of HD 
Decisions Limited in the prior year. A tax rate of 20.25% (2014: 
21.5%) has been applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 25

Key contractual arrangements
Moneysupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, 
is party to contracts and other arrangements which the 
Directors judge are essential to the Group’s business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon its 
ability to attract customers to its website either directly or 
through paid search or portal partners, and revenue generated 
from commercial arrangements with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers to  
its website directly. The Group has contracts with a number of 
media agencies to acquire advertising inventory from 
commercial television companies. The Group typically has a 
commitment of between 6 and 10 week’s expenditure at any 
one time. Television and other offline advertising costs 
represent 75% (2014: 83%) of distribution costs.
The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via paid 
search. Although there are a number of search engines that 
operate in the UK, Google is the dominant search engine and 
accounts for the majority of the Group’s spend in this area. The 
Group has no forward commitment to search engines and 
manages its spend on a real time basis.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are 
based either on a cost per click basis or a cost per application 
basis or a hybrid of the two. It also has a number of commercial 
arrangements based on the number of page impressions 
served in the case of banner advertising. The Group does not 
consider it has any material contracts with providers in any one 
channel. The Group does, however, frequently deal with 
providers across a range of different channels managed under 
different contracts, often to different parts of the same 
organisation, and occasionally through third party media 
agencies. At this consolidated channel level, the largest 
individual provider represented approximately 3% (2014: 4%)  
of Group revenue in 2015.
Viability statement
As required by Provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a three-year period to December 
2018. In making this assessment the Directors took account of 
the Business Model and Principal Risks set out on pages 6 to 7 
and 30 to 31 of the Strategic Report.
Business Model
The Group has a simple business model – matching customers to 
the right providers. It uses online services to help customers to 
compare a wide range of products in one place and make an 
informed choice when taking out the product most suited to their 
needs. For our providers, it offers an efficient and cost-effective 
way to reach a large volume of informed customers who are 
actively looking for a product. For the majority of our services,  
we receive a success-based marketing fee from the providers.  
This business model operates through the following key principles:
• the Group relies on customer transactions for its revenues 
and does not have long-term contracted revenue streams;
• customers will continue to see value in shopping around for 
products and services and will aim to save money by doing 
so; and
• providers will continue to have strategies of new customer 
acquisition and will develop products and services to fulfil 
that strategy.
The Group has three strategic priorities – to be the best site,  
earn customer loyalty and be the preferred partner for our 
providers. The Board has set KPIs to monitor the delivery of 
these strategic priorities.
The Strategic Report sets out the Group’s performance on the 
main KPIs. The Board monitors and reviews progress against 
three time horizons–quarterly to review and reforecast 
performance against the Annual Plan and Budget; annually to 
establish a clear Annual Plan and Budget that will deliver against 
the Strategic Plan; and a three-year Strategic Plan re-assessed 
annually, to determine the strategy of the Group.
The Board believes that a three-year cycle is the right time period 
to plan the business as this links to the expected lifecycle of the 
Group’s technology and reflects the frequent changes in the way 
that consumers choose to use technology. Therefore, the Board 
is using a three-year period to make this viability assessment. 26 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Financial Review
continued
Risk Management
The Board has identified the Group’s Principal Risks around 
delivering these strategic priorities, which represent a risk or 
combination of risks in severe but reasonable scenarios that 
can seriously affect the future prospects or reputation of the 
Group through threatening its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. For best site, the principal 
risks are competition and changes in consumer behaviour; for 
earning customer loyalty, they are brand strength, product 
offering and consumer trust; and for being the preferred 
partner, the principal risk is ongoing relevance to partners.
In addition, the Directors believe that the Group faces risks around 
regulation and economic uncertainty especially as that may 
influence the availability of attractive products for customers.
The Board manages risks across the Group through a formal 
risk identification and management framework, designed to 
ensure that risks are properly identified, prioritised, evaluated 
and mitigated to the extent possible. Key aspects of this 
framework include:
• a Risk Appetite Statement expressing the amount and type 
of risk the Board is willing to accept in order to achieve the 
Group’s strategic objectives;
• regular assessments of current and emerging risks being 
faced by the Group including internal control effectiveness 
and mitigating actions;
• risk metrics and thresholds which are monitored as potential 
indicators of risk;
• scenario planning based on the Principal Risks; and
• oversight from the Risk and Compliance and Internal  
Audit functions.
Viability assessment
In making its assessment of viability, the Board has considered the 
resilience of the Group using scenario-planning based on the 
Principal Risks to test the Group’s planned earnings, cash flows 
and viability over the three-year period. Using its judgement on 
the likelihood of the Principal Risks and the probability of them 
being interrelated, the Board assessed the risks separately and in 
certain combinations of stress testing scenarios. In arriving at its 
conclusion, the Board is making the assumption that the key 
aspects of customer and provider behaviour set out above which 
underpin the business model will continue. It is also assuming that 
customers and providers will continue to want to transact online.
Based on the Company’s current position and Principal Risks, 
together with the results of this robust assessment and the 
Company’s ongoing risk management processes, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period of their assessment.
Going concern
Having reassessed the Principal Risks, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 
12 months from the date of this Report. Accordingly, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Financial Statements. Strategic Report

Risk Management
How we mitigate risk
Risk management approach
In common with many businesses, the Group faces risk in all 
areas of activity. The Group seeks to understand its risks and 
manage them appropriately. Effective risk management is vital 
in enabling the Group to achieve its strategic objectives and to 
secure the business for the long term, whilst ensuring the 
desired outcomes for consumers. Risk management is a key 
element of the Group’s decision-making processes, and 
alongside its governance structure and system of internal 
control, gives the Board assurance that risks are being 
appropriately identified and managed, in line with risk appetite. 
Governance and oversight
A governance and oversight structure is in place, with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility, accountability and delegation  
of authority. 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the overall effectiveness 
of risk management across the business, supported by the Risk 
Committee. The Board delegates day to day responsibility to 
executive management. Executive management owns the 
Group risks, is responsible for ensuring that the business 
effectively manages risk and takes appropriate and timely 
action where issues are identified. The Risk Committee 
oversees executive management in its management of risks.

continued
In addition, the Audit Committee performs an annual assessment of the risk management and internal control framework, 
covering financial, operational and compliance controls including the:
• assessment of the risk management framework for identifying and monitoring risks, with consideration of the integration with 
strategic and business planning processes. This is supported by independent reporting on risk management and internal 
controls by the Internal Audit function or independent third parties, including the external auditor;
• assessment of the extent, frequency and quality of risk management and internal control reporting;
• review of the resolution of issues arising from internal control failings or weaknesses; and
• review of the effectiveness of the financial reporting processes.
The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board on effectiveness which the Board considers, together with reports 
from the Risk Committee, in forming its own view on the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 29

Risk management framework
During 2015, the Group has made further enhancements to the 
risk management framework and internal control environment 
and has continued to embed them within the business to 
increase understanding and overall effectiveness. 
Risk Appetite
‘Risk Appetite’ defines the level and type of risk the Group is 
able and willing to accept in line with its strategic objectives. 
The Group’s risk appetite influences the business culture and 
operating decisions, and is reflected in the way risk is managed. 
The Group Risk Appetite Statement is reviewed annually, in line 
with the strategic direction of the Group, recent experience and 
the regulatory environment, and is subject to Board approval.
Risk identification and assessment
The Group adopts formal risk identification and management 
processes which are designed to ensure that risks are properly 
identified and evaluated, in line with risk appetite. Robust risk 
and control assessments are carried out at least quarterly 
across all areas of the business, in order to understand the 
strength and performance of the controls in place, and 
potential gaps and weaknesses. 
Management reporting
Timely and accurate management information is provided to 
the right people to support management decisions and manage 
risk effectively within the Group.
Reporting enables the business to have clear visibility of the 
most relevant risks; to identify areas of concern and/or priority; 
to have access to detailed information to enable root cause 
analysis and underlying trends; and to identify, escalate and 
potentially to mitigate the impact of new operational risk 
concerns in a timely manner.
Where risk exposures are identified as being outside appetite, 
this is escalated and reported to the Risk Committee, alongside 
clear action plans to bring the risk within tolerance, with 
appropriate timescales. The type and extent of any mitigating 
actions will be determined by the level and nature of the risk 
and the Group’s risk appetite.
Future developments
To support the risk management framework, we are enhancing 
our suite of risk management policies, which will set the 
requirements and standards for all areas of risk, in line with the 
risk appetite, and will inform the processes and procedures the 
Group will be measured against. We will also continue to 
develop our management information, key risk indicators and 
assurance processes over internal controls.
We continue to embed a risk culture where risk management is 
part of everyday business decision making and is understood 
by our wider business, to ensure all personnel understand the 
risks faced by the business, how risk is managed, and the part 
they play. 30 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Employees
Moneysupermarket Group wants to be a great place to work. 
Passion, innovation and performance are key assets for the 
Group and its future success. The Group has clear priorities for 
how it:
• engages with its employees, recognising the different needs 
they have;
• creates sustainable employment opportunities that attract a 
talented and diverse range of new people into all levels of 
the business;
• invests in the future to ensure each individual can perform 
to the best of their ability; and
• ensures it is constantly seeking to do the right things, 
particularly in how people are treated throughout the Group.
The Group actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation. It places considerable emphasis on keeping its 
employees informed of the Group’s activities via formal 
business performance updates, regular update briefings, 
regular team meetings, the Group’s intranet site (which enables 
easy access to the latest Group information as well as Group 
policies), and the circulation to employees of relevant 
information including corporate announcements. This helps to 
achieve a common awareness amongst employees of the 
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the 
Group.

and that the Group can take action based on employee 
feedback. 76% of staff completed the 2015 survey with 88%  
of those respondents confirming they were committed to the 
Group’s goals and 84% of respondents stating they would 
recommend the Group as a great place to work.
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities policy.  
The Group aims to ensure that no employee is discriminated 
against, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of colour, race, 
ethnic and national origins, sexual orientation or gender, 
marital status, disability, religion or belief, being part time or  
on the grounds of age.
The Group offers a range of benefits which help employees 
share in the success of the Group. These include both an 
employee Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Scheme.  
The Group’s full range of benefits reflects the differing needs 
and interests of its employees. Particular focus is given to 
contributing towards employees’ wellbeing. Employees have  
the opportunity to buy additional holidays, medical cover,  
gym memberships, as well as benefitting from discounts on 
products and services for the home and family life.  
Recognising that employees can require advice and support  
for a range of personal and professional reasons, a free 
comprehensive employee assistance programme is also 
available. The Group also has a wide variety of flexible

a number of students. In doing so, the Group strives to make 
work placements positive, challenging and relevant to 
participants’ current studies and their future job prospects.
Business ethics
Behaving ethically is an essential part of working for our Group. 
It is fundamental to how we do business and is vitally 
important to the reputation and success of our Group. We have 
a code of conduct which applies to all employees. Our three 
principles of ethical business conduct are:
• we are honest, transparent and trustworthy in all our 
dealings both within the Group and in all our external 
business relationships;
• we respect the privacy of individuals and other 
organisations with whom we work; and
• we investigate reports of potential breaches of the code  
of conduct.

policies which incorporate the Group’s key principles and 
standards governing business conduct towards our key 
stakeholder groups. We believe we should treat all of these 
groups with honesty and integrity. 34 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Communities and charities
The Group seeks to make a positive difference by being an active 
contributor to the communities that it operates within. The 
Group’s .Community initiative was launched in 2008 and has 
continued to develop during 2015. The initiative is focused on 
providing support to charities and community groups located 
within a few miles of the Group’s office in Ewloe, so support is 
targeted primarily in Flintshire and Cheshire. 
A volunteer group of employees meets regularly to review 
requests for donations and to allocate funds according to agreed 
donation guidelines. Employees are also active in researching and 
seeking out local good causes that the Group can help support. 
The initiative has been effective at harnessing the energy and 
enthusiasm of the Group’s employees to benefit the communities 
within which it operates.
In 2015 the Group made £6,000 per quarter available for the  
.Community initiative. This funding has been channelled via the 
Charities Aid Foundation, enabling the Group to make gross 
donations to registered charities.
Over the course of the year the Group has supported over 30 
charities and community groups including:
• Barnado’s/Flintshire Young Carers 
• Flintshire Deaf Children’s Society
• Ty Nos Homeless Shelter 
• Deeside North Wales Crusaders RL Wheelchair & Disability

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
This section includes our mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. The methodology used to 
calculate our emissions is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Standard. Emissions reported correspond with our financial year. 
We have included emissions from both our owned and leased 
assets for which we are responsible. Emissions are predominantly 
from gas combustion and electricity use at our offices and data 
centres. We have reported on all material emission sources which 
we deem ourselves to be responsible for. Emission factors are 
from UK government conversion factor guidance current for the 
year reported.
In order to express our annual emissions in relation to a 
quantifiable factor associated with our activities, we have used 
revenue as our intensity ratio as this is a relevant indication of 
our growth and is aligned with our business strategy.

In addition to the .Community initiative, the Group and its 
employees continue to select and support a Charity of the Year 
on an annual basis.
The 2015 Charity of the Year was the National Autistic Society. 
The charity provides help and support to those affected by 
autism. Over the course of the year the Group’s employees 
raised £48,660 for the National Autistic Society with the Group 
also donating £9,129 bringing the total donated to the National 
Autistic Society during the year to £57,789.
In addition to this, in September 2015, MoneySavingExpert 
donated 50p per new recipient of its weekly email to the Red 
Cross to assist with the Europe Refugee Crisis, which was 
rounded up to a total donation of £6,000. MoneySavingExpert 
has also continued to donate to The MoneySavingExpert 
Charity, which is a grant giving charity dedicated to improving 
information and education about debt, money and consumer 
issues with £60,000 donated in 2015.
The National Autistic Society will continue to be our Charity of 
the Year in 2016.
The Group launched a volunteering scheme in October 2011 
through which the Group supports a total of 60 volunteering 
days per year to help those who are less fortunate, and thereby 
make a valuable contribution to our local community. During the 
year employees volunteered in a diverse range of activities and 
also took part in the sponsored ‘Four Highest Peaks in North 
Africa Challenge’.
Environment
The Group is committed to reducing energy and raw material 
usage to support environmental and financial performance and 
has implemented the following initiatives to support this aim:
• the installation of solar panels at the Group’s Ewloe office 
resulting in energy savings of approximately 40,561 kwh 
during 2015;
• the continued replacement of energy efficient bulbs with 
higher efficiency LEDs;
• changes to our air conditioning and ventilation timings to 
minimise unnecessary usage; 
• the replacement of our water boilers with industry-leading 
ECO boilers to help minimise electrical usage; and 
• the recycling, via one of our suppliers, of waste oil from our 
on-site catering into useful products such as biofuels. 
The Group estimates that during 2015 it recycled on average 
over 70% of its commercial waste.

Key areas of focus in 2015:
 u We devoted more time to planning and 
reviewing the content of the Annual Report, 
ensuring it is fair, balanced and understandable 
and in line with best governance practice;
 u We introduced and reviewed an annual rolling 
agenda for the Board and each of the 
Committees, with focus on ‘deep-dives’ to cover a 
specific strategic priority at each meeting. This 
included deep-dives into each of 
MoneySuperMarket, MoneySavingExpert and 
TravelSupermarket, key risks and controls, 
technology and innovation, people and culture, 
diversity and talent management.
 u We continued to enhance our effectiveness by:
 w introducing a greater focus on investment 
appraisal and post-investment reviews; 
 w refining our KPIs to link directly to our three 
strategic priorities (best site, earn customer 
loyalty and preferred partner); and
 w introducing Committee effectiveness reviews to 
identify how to improve the effectiveness of each 
of our Committees.
Leadership
We have a strong and balanced Board, with a range of 
complementary skills to support the strategic and operational 
direction of the Group. As I reported last year, we appointed 
Andrew Fisher and Genevieve Shore as Independent Non-
Executive Directors in 2014, which was followed by Michael 
Wemms and Robin Klein, both Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, stepping down from the Board following the Annual 
General Meeting in April 2015. We have since further 
strengthened the skills and experience of the Board with the 
appointment of Robin Freestone in August 2015 as an additional 
Independent Non-Executive Director. Robin brings experience 
of leading global and digital businesses and will provide 
valuable challenge and insight to the Board’s deliberations. 
In October 2015, Graham Donoghue, Chief Product Officer, 
stepped down from the Board and left the Company in 
December 2015 after a period of handover with his successor.
On 31 December 2015, Simon Nixon, our founder and first CEO, 
stepped down from the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
On conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting, Rob Rowley 
will step down as chairman of the Audit Committee and will be 
succeeded by Robin Freestone from that date. Rob will remain a 
member of the Audit Committee, Risk Committee and 
Nomination Committee and will continue in his role as Senior 
Independent Director.
The membership of the Board Committees were reviewed 
during 2015 to ensure the Committees continue to operate 
effectively and have the skills required to support the increasing 
complexity of the Group. The current membership of each of 
the Committees is set out in each of the Committee reports on 
pages 47, 54, 56 and 71. Sally James, Chairman of the Risk 
Committee, is a member of each of the Committees to ensure 
that risk is appropriately considered in each Committee.
Succession planning and diversity
We recognise that in order to maintain an effective and diverse 
Board, it is essential to plan for the future and to ensure the right 
individuals are appointed to the Board from a diverse pool of 
talent. We consider our Board to be diverse in terms of the 
background, skills and experience which each individual brings to 
the Board.
All future appointments will continue to be based on merit. 
More detail on the work of the Nomination Committee and on 
our diversity policy can be found in our Nomination Committee 
Report on pages 54 to 55. Details of the proportion of women 
on the Board, in senior leadership positions and within the 
whole organisation can be found on page 33 of the Corporate 
Responsibility Report. 
Board effectiveness
Following our external Board evaluation in 2014, during 2015 we 
conducted an internal evaluation of the Board, the Committees 
and each of the Directors. The evaluation process involved the 
completion of questionnaires and interviews by the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director, followed by a round table 
Board discussion, including a review of progress against actions 
from the 2014 evaluation. More information on the process and 
the key action areas can be found on page 43.
Ethics and governance
There is a strong relationship between ethics and good 
governance. We remain committed to operating ethically, 
demonstrating integrity and acting responsibly in our 
undertakings with our customers, our shareholders and our 
wider stakeholders. Further information on ethics and social 
responsibility is contained in our Corporate Responsibility 
Report on pages 32 to 35.
Board operation
We continue to operate a clear line of distinction between 
management, led by Peter Plumb, Chief Executive Officer, who is 
responsible for the day to day running of the business, and the 
Board, acting under my leadership, which provides constructive 
challenge to management ensuring an open culture of debate that 
creates and preserves value for our shareholders.
During 2016 and beyond, I will ensure that the Board continues 
to operate in a constructive and open manner, with honesty 
and integrity as its core principles.

The role of the Board
We are responsible for the long-term success of

In setting and monitoring strategy, we have regard to the 
impact that those decisions will have on the Group’s obligations 
to various stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, our 
regulators and the wider community.
While the Board is not managing the day-to-day operations  
of the Group, key decisions and matters are reserved for 
approval of the Board and are set out in our terms of reference. 
These include the setting of, and changes to, Group strategy, 
approval of major acquisitions or disposals, determination of 
interim dividends and recommendation of final dividends, 
approval of budget and financial results, and carrying out an 
annual review of the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control systems.

The Non-Executive Directors
Each Non-Executive Director is responsible for:
• bringing experience and independent judgement to the 
Board; and
• constructively challenging and helping develop proposals  
on strategy.
The Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is an Independent  
Non-Executive Director who is responsible for:
• meeting with the Company’s shareholders and 
representative bodies when requested and, if necessary, 
discussing matters with them where it would be 
inappropriate for those discussions to take place with  
either the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer; and
• acting as a sounding board for the Chairman and as an 
intermediary for the other Directors when necessary.
Rob Rowley is our Senior Independent Director. He took over 
from Michael Wemms on 30 April 2015 when Michael Wemms 
stepped down from the Board. 
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for:
• managing the provision of timely, accurate and considered 
information to the Board;
• recommending corporate governance policies and practices 
to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;
• implementing and communicating corporate governance 
policies across the Group; and
• advising the Board and its Committees on corporate 
governance and compliance within the Group and 
appropriate procedures for the management of their 
meetings and duties.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the whole Board. All Directors are able to consult 
with the Company Secretary, who is also secretary to all of the 
Board Committees. There is also a formal documented 
procedure by which any Director may take independent 
professional advice relating to the performance of any aspects 
of their duties at the Company’s expense, which can be 
facilitated by the Company Secretary.
Board meetings
I set the Board agendas following consultation with the Chief 
Executive Officer and with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary. This year we adopted an annual programme of items 
for discussion and this is kept under review by the Board to 
ensure that all key issues are considered at the appropriate time 
and the Board is able to respond to any emerging matters that 
require Board consideration. In 2015 we held nine Board 
meetings. At each meeting we now hold a ‘deep-dive’ into 
specific aspects of the business. The principal areas of focus for 
the Board in 2015 are listed in the section on the right.
In 2015, we:

The Board splits its meetings between its Ewloe and London 
offices. Board members have the opportunity to meet and 
interact with employees at various times during the year. This 
year we held a product showcase in which the Board and senior 
leadership team were invited to sit with employees leading 
innovative projects in order to gain a deeper understanding of 
those projects. Board members also took the opportunity to 
listen to employee calls with customers in order to better 
understand the issues being raised by our customers and how 
employees deal with those issues. Additionally, I meet from 
time to time with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present.
*  Robin Klein and Michael Wemms retired from the Board on 30 April 2015. 
Robin Freestone was appointed a Director on 1 August 2015.  
Graham Donoghue resigned on 8 October 2015. Simon Nixon resigned  
on 31 December 2015.
Ad hoc conference calls and Committee meetings were also 
convened to deal with specific matters which required attention 
between scheduled meetings.
Board Committees
We delegate certain Board responsibilities to our Board 
Committees which play an important governance role through 
the work they carry out. Briefing papers are prepared and 
circulated to the Committee members in advance of each 
meeting. The Committee chairmen report formally to the Board 
on Committee activities at the subsequent Board meeting. 
The Committees may obtain external professional advice at the 
Company’s expense if deemed necessary.

Relationship Agreement
The Company and Simon Nixon, our first CEO and formerly our 
single largest shareholder, entered into a relationship 
agreement on 11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship 
between them (Relationship Agreement). The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement was to ensure that the Company 
was capable of carrying out its business independently of 
Simon Nixon, and that transactions and relationships with 
Simon Nixon were at arm’s length and on normal commercial 
terms. The Relationship Agreement terminated in May 2015 
upon the sale of shares by Simon Nixon which resulted in him 
holding less than 15% of the ordinary shares in the Company. 
Effectiveness
The composition of our Board is kept under review by the 
Nomination Committee to ensure that it retains the necessary 
skills, knowledge and experience to meet the needs of the 
business. Details of the skills and experience of individual 
Directors are set out on pages 38 to 39.
Following the appointment of Andrew Fisher and Genevieve 
Shore in August 2014 and September 2014 respectively, Michael 
Wemms and Robin Klein retired from the Board on conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2015. Robin 
Freestone was appointed as an additional Independent 
Non-Executive Director in August 2015 and will assume the 
chairmanship of the Audit Committee when Rob Rowley steps 
down as chairman of the Audit Committee at the conclusion of 
the 2016 Annual General Meeting. After seven years with the 
Group, Graham Donoghue, Chief Product Officer, stepped down 
from the Board in October 2015, leaving the Group in December 
2015 after a period of handover to his successor.
On 31 December 2015 Simon Nixon, our founder and first CEO, 
stepped down from the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
The Nomination Committee reviewed the composition of the 
Board in 2015 and recommended that the Board currently had 
the right balance of skills, knowledge and experience to meet 
the needs of the business but is mindful of the need for 
refreshing of the Board. 
Induction of a new Director
On appointment, each Director receives a tailored induction to 
suit the individual’s background and experience. Robin 
Freestone’s induction included:
• an induction pack including details of Board meetings and 
procedures, recent analyst and broker reports, recent Board 
and Committee minutes, matters reserved to the Board, a 
briefing on Director’s duties and responsibilities in addition 
to other key policies and procedures in support of the 
Company’s business practice;
• individual meetings with the Executive Directors, senior 
management and the Company Secretary;
• business-related presentations from senior management; 
and
• attending the two-day off-site strategy meeting which helped 
him gain an understanding of the Group’s strategy, its 
management team and its services.

Training and information
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s business, the 
markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive and 
regulatory environment through presentations and briefings to 
the Board from Executive Directors and senior management. 
As part of the annual individual performance evaluation I 
discuss training and development requirements with each 
Director. The Company Secretary maintains a record of 
individual Director’s training as well as reviewing the suitability 
of external courses so that any needs identified through the 
formal evaluation or during the year can be addressed. 
Directors received briefings from the Company Secretary on 
governance and compliance areas including the new reporting 
requirements under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the 
FRC’s Practice Aid on Audit Quality. 
To ensure that Directors are able to fully acquaint themselves 
with current trading and matters requiring discussions and 
decisions, comprehensive Board papers and Committee papers 
are circulated electronically approximately one week prior to 
scheduled meetings. 
Directors, may, in the furtherance of their duties, take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers that I was independent on appointment as 
Chairman and considers Rob Rowley, Andrew Fisher, Genevieve 
Shore, Sally James and Robin Freestone to be independent, being 
independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. 
Conflicts of interest
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s articles 
of association enable Directors to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest. The Company has a formal procedure for notification 
and authorisation to be sought prior to appointment of any new 
Director or prior to a new conflict arising. This procedure enables 
non-conflicted Directors to impose limits or conditions when 
giving or reviewing authorisation and requires the Board to 
review the register of Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad 
hoc basis when necessary. The Board has complied with this 
procedure during the year. 
Performance evaluation

Internal review
Following the external evaluation conducted in 2014 by SCT 
Consultants Ltd, we undertook an internal evaluation in 2015. 
This involved the completion of questionnaires by individual 
Directors and interviews by me and the Senior Independent
Director respectively with the results being analysed and 
presented for discussion at a Board meeting. The Board then 
agreed the key actions. The Board also reviewed its progress 
against actions identified in the external 2014 Board evaluation: 
2014 evaluation actions update
The following actions were identified following the external 
evaluation conducted in 2014:
• Annual agendas – we introduced and reviewed an annual 
rolling agenda for the Board and each of the Committees, 
with focus on ‘deep-dives’ to cover strategic priorities and 
the ongoing investment programme.
• Succession planning – the Board, in conjunction with the 
Chief People Officer, has held a ‘deep-dive’ into people and 
culture, diversity and talent management. In order to 
increase senior leaders’ exposure to the Board, members of 
the senior leadership team often present ‘deep-dives’ 
relating to their part of the business. In addition, the 
succession of each member of executive management 
(including the Executive Directors) is now discussed at 
Nomination Committee meetings throughout the year.
• Strategy – the Board introduced a formal procedure for 
conducting post-implementation investment appraisal reviews 
and conducted several reviews during the year including the 
investments in life, pet and travel insurance. This coincided with 
the investment programme commenced in 2014.
• Performance – the Board revised the key Group KPIs and 
introduced new ones (including non-financial metrics) to 
better reflect our strategic focus with more prominence and 
explanatory narrative being given in reports to the Board. A 
summary of the key Group KPIs is set out on pages 11 to 13.
2015 evaluation actions
The Directors’ many positive responses indicated their widely 
held view that ongoing improvements have been made since 
the external evaluation in 2014. In particular, members 
considered there was open and transparent debate with 
constructive challenge and even contribution from all members 
of the Board. The Board receives comprehensive reports to 
enable it to monitor performance, consider risks and controls 
and take key decisions. Some of the development areas that will 
be actioned in 2016 are a continuing focus on:
• Talent strategy - ensuring there is an effective talent strategy 
for managing the pipeline of top talent to run the business.
• Strategy - ensuring that we continue to monitor the 
competitive environment, consider provider needs and 
review new opportunities for growth.
• Customers - ensuring that we continue to focus on how we 
can help to meet customer needs.
Director evaluation
I appraise each of the Directors individually in the form of 
interviews, taking account of feedback received as part of the 
Board evaluation process. I can confirm that each Director 
continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and 
devotes sufficient time to the role. My evaluation was 
undertaken by the Senior Independent Director, taking into 
account the views of the other Directors. Biographies of the 
Board are set out on pages 38 and 39 which includes my 
significant commitments. The Board is satisfied that these 
appointments do not conflict with my ability to carry out my 
duties and responsibilities effectively for the Group. 44 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Committee evaluation
In addition to the Audit Committee evaluating its own 
performance, we conducted formal evaluations of each of the 
other Committees for the first time in 2015. This involved 
completion of questionnaires by members of each Committee, 
senior management who interact with each Committee, and, 
where relevant, professional advisers to each Committee, followed 
by discussion at a Committee meeting. Summaries of these 
evaluations can be found in the relevant Committee report.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board’s aim is to present an Annual Report to shareholders, 
which, taken as a whole, is a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. The Board has ensured that processes are 
in place to achieve this and more information on the processes 
can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 47 to 53. 
A statement of Directors’ responsibilities and the auditor’s 
responsibilities in relation to the Annual Report are set out on 
pages 75 and 79 respectively. The Directors’ opinion that the 
Company’s business is a going concern is set out on page 26.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for setting the risk appetite 
of the Group, maintaining the Group’s risk management and 
internal control system and reviewing the system’s 
effectiveness. We have an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the Group 
which has been in place for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report. The Risk Committee and 
the Audit Committee assist us in discharging these duties.
We regularly review and update our internal control and risk 
management processes. In light of the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in 2014 and the related FRC 
guidance on risk management and internal control, we have 
reviewed our processes. A summary of actions we have taken in 
2015 is set out in the Risk Committee Report on pages 56 to 58.
 
Risk management
A description of the process for managing risk together with a 
description of the Principal Risks and strategies to mitigate 
those risks, is provided on pages 27 to 31.
Internal control
The main features of the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls in respect of financial reporting and the preparation of 
accounts are:
• a comprehensive annual business planning and budgeting 
process, requiring Board approval, through which risks are 
identified and appraised;
• a comprehensive financial reporting system, regularly 
enhanced, within which actual and forecast results are 
compared with approved budgets and the previous year’s 
figures on a monthly basis and reviewed by the Board;
• Group policies relating to the maintenance of accounting 
records, transaction reporting and key financial control 
procedures;
• an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an 
appropriate level of approval for all capital expenditure and 
other capitalised costs;
• monthly finance team meetings which include reviews of 
internal financial reporting issues and financial control 
monitoring; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting 
employees. 
Other controls in place to manage our business in accordance 
with our Risk Appetite Framework include:
• an annual two-day strategy meeting to discuss and approve 
the Group’s strategic direction, plans and objectives and the 
risks to achieving them;
• a schedule of matters reserved for approval by the Board  
to ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, organisational, compliance and capital  
investment issues;
• an organisational governance structure with clearly  
defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority;
• formal risk and control policies and supporting  
procedures manuals;
• regular reviews of the Principal Risks facing the Group to 
ensure they are being identified, evaluated and  
appropriately managed;
• a process for regular assessment of key controls across  
the Group;
• a Risk and Compliance function responsible for overseeing 
the implementation of the risk management framework;
• an Internal Audit function providing assurance over key risks, 
processes and controls; and
• a whistleblowing hotline which employees can use to report 
any instances of suspected wrongdoing.
Our internal control effectiveness is assessed through the 
performance of regular checks, which in 2015 included the 
following areas:
• review and testing of the Group’s financial reporting 
processes;
• completion of the Group’s internal audit plan;
• performing compliance monitoring activities including 
financial promotion reviews and call listening;
• assessment of the identification and management of risks 
connected to the Group’s capital investment programme; 
• assessment of the Group’s processes for identifying and 
mitigating potential conflicts of interest; 
• assessment of the identification and management of 
technology risks across the Group, including data security; 
and
• monitoring the completion of the Group’s mandatory 
‘Customer First’ training for all employees.
Risk review & assessment
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify 
and manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the 
effects of the risk of failing to achieve the Group’s objectives. 
They are not designed to eliminate such risk, but the Group 
seeks to understand its Principal Risks and manage them 
appropriately.

Governance
The Group’s risk register is a key element in our risk 
management framework and is used in the assessment and 
reporting of risks being managed by the Group. The senior 
management team and external consultants attended 
workshops during 2015, during which the risk register was 
enhanced. The risk register is managed by the Risk and 
Compliance function and is reviewed on a regular basis by the 
Risk Committee.
Each risk is owned by a member of executive management who 
is responsible for the ongoing assessment of risk and the 
delivery of mitigating actions. Robust risk and control 
assessments are carried out at least quarterly across all areas 
of the business, in order to understand the strength and 
performance of the controls in place, and potential gaps and 
weaknesses. Internal Audit and Risk and Compliance monitoring 
findings are also taken into account when assessing risks.
The Risk and Compliance function provides challenge to 
executives in their assessment and management of risks with 
particular focus on the actions being taken to reduce risk. The 
senior management team meets on a monthly basis to ensure 
risk management is integrated within strategic and business 
planning processes. Reporting to the Risk Committee enables 
the Directors to have clear visibility of the most relevant risks; 
identify areas of concern and/or priority; have access to 
detailed information to enable root cause analysis and 
underlying trends; and identify, escalate, and potentially 
mitigate the impact of new risks in a timely manner. Twice a 
year the Board reviews the Group’s key risks and the Group Risk 
Appetite Statement and Framework.
Process for review of effectiveness
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems. The steps it takes in relation to the review are set out 
on pages 28 and 52. The Audit Committee makes a 
recommendation to the Board on effectiveness which the Board 
considers, together with reports from the Risk Committee, in 
forming its own view on the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems.
During 2015, the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems. We 
confirm that the processes outlined above and on pages 27 to 
29 and 52, other than those enhancements introduced during 
the year, have been in place for the year under review up to the 
date of approval of this Annual Report and that these processes, 
together with the enhancements introduced during the year, 
accord with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting (September 2014 version). We 
also confirm that no significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified in relation to the review. The Board has carried out a 
robust assessment of the Principal Risks facing the Group,

performance, solvency or liquidity and these, together with how 
they are managed or mitigated, are set out on pages 30 to 31.
Shareholder engagement
Major shareholders
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with 
major institutional shareholders and other stakeholders. Senior 
executives, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer regularly meet with analysts and institutional 
shareholders to keep them informed of significant 
developments and to develop an understanding of their views 
which are discussed with the Board. In addition, all Directors 
receive formal reports and briefings during the year about the 
Company’s investor relations programme and receive detailed 
feedback obtained by the Company’s brokers after meetings, 
direct contact and other means, through which they are able to 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders. 
External analysts’ reports on the Group are also circulated to 
Directors.
Andrew Fisher, in his capacity as Remuneration Committee 
chairman, also engages in discussion with shareholders on 
significant matters relating to executive remuneration.
Formal presentations are given to analysts and shareholders 
covering the full-year and half-year results and the Company 
seeks to maintain a dialogue with various bodies which monitor 
the Company’s governance policies and procedures. The 
Company Secretary generally deals with questions from 
individual shareholders.
Communications with shareholders
The results and results presentations, together with all 
information reported to the market via the regulatory 
information service, press releases and other shareholder 
information, are published on the investor relations section of 
the Group’s website at http://corporate.moneysupermarket.com 
to be viewed and accessed by all shareholders.
Our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns for which contact through 
the normal channels of me, the Chief Executive Officer or the 
Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve or for which such 
contact is inappropriate.
Annual General Meeting
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The chairs of the 
Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees will be 
available to answer questions at that meeting. Shareholders 
may also contact me, the Chief Executive Officer or, if more 
appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to 
raise any issue with one or all of the Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company.
The Company prepares separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue to be voted upon at Annual General 
Meetings. The result of the vote on each resolution is published 
on the Group’s website after the Annual General Meeting and 
will be announced via the regulatory information service. At the 
2015 AGM, shareholders representing 82.51% of the Company’s 
issued share capital returned their proxy votes. 46 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Audit Committee Report 
continued
After each meeting, I report to the Board on the main issues 
that we discussed.
The members of the Audit Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Financial Statements and reports
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
appropriateness of the Group’s half-year reporting and annual 
Financial Statements. We do this by considering, among other 
things, the accounting policies and practices adopted by the 
Group; the correct application of applicable reporting standards 
and compliance with broader governance requirements; the 
approach taken by management to report the key judgemental 
areas of reporting and the comments of the external auditor on 
management’s chosen approach.
I
Significant issues
We identified the issues on page 49 as significant in the context 
of the 2015 Financial Statements. We consider these areas to be 
significant taking into account the level of materiality and 
degree of judgement exercised by management. We discussed 
the issues in detail to ensure that the approaches taken were 
appropriate. This included reviewing presentations and reports 
from both management and the external auditor.
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed the 31 December 2014 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements and the half-year 
statement to 30 June 2015, together with reports 
from the external auditors;
 u reviewed the trading updates issued in April 
2015 and November 2015;
 u examined key points of disclosure and 
presentation to ensure adequacy, clarity and 
completeness of the Financial Statements; and 
 u reviewed documentation prepared to support 
the enhanced going concern and viability 
statements given on pages 25 to 26.
Role
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to ensure the 
integrity of the financial reporting and audit processes and 
monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and 
risk management systems. This includes:
• monitoring the integrity of the Financial Statements of the 
Company, any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance and any significant issues 
and judgements contained in them;
• reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the material 
financial reporting judgements contained in them; 
• advising the Board on whether the Committee believes this 
Annual Report and the Financial Statements contained 
within it, when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business 
activities and financial performance;
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the 
audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK 
professional regulatory requirements; 
• developing and implementing a policy on the level and 
amount of external auditor non-audit services; 
• advising the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor and the remuneration and 
terms of engagement of the external auditor;
• monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems, including whistleblowing and 
fraud prevention procedures;
• reviewing the scope, activities and results of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function;
• reviewing the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, carrying 
out an annual performance evaluation exercise and noting 
the satisfactory operation of the Committee; and
• reporting to the Board how it has discharged its 
responsibilities.
Written terms of reference that outline the Committee’s 
authority and responsibilities are published on the investor 
relations section of the Group’s website at 
http://corporate.moneysupermarket.com and are available in 
hard copy form from the Company Secretary. We review our 
terms of reference annually. The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference include all matters required by Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 7.1 and the Code.
Committee meetings
We met four times in 2015 and the attendance of our members 
is shown in the table on page 47. In order to maintain effective 
communication between all relevant parties, we invited the 
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and Company Secretary, together with appropriate 
members of the management team with responsibility for risk 
and internal control, and the external auditor, to meetings as 
necessary. We set time aside periodically to seek the views of 
the external auditor, in the absence of management. The 
external auditor has direct access to me to raise any concerns 
outside formal Committee meetings. The Committee also meets 
separately with the Head of Internal Audit during the year. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 49

Strategic Report

Issue Committee review
Revenue
As more fully described on pages 85 and 97 
the majority of the Group’s revenue is derived 
from success-based commercial deals which 
compensate the Group for each product sold 
by a provider to a customer referred to it by 
the Group. The Group recognises this revenue 
at the point at which a customer leaves one of 
the Group’s websites, based on the number 
expected to click through and purchase a 
product from a provider site.
We reviewed and assessed management’s key controls in relation to the 
recording of revenue which include: 
(a) a completeness check which is performed by reconciling all ‘click’ 
activity on the website and ensuring that an invoice has been raised, 
or revenue has been accrued, where appropriate; 
(b) a review to compare accrued revenue at the end of the previous 
month and actual revenue invoiced during the following month, with 
significant differences investigated to provide evidence that revenues 
are correctly stated; 
(c) a programme of revenue assurance by the Group’s Internal Audit 
function.
This helps provide us with assurance that revenues are correctly stated by 
reviewing provider systems and controls to ensure that sales made by 
providers resulting from referrals made by the Group have been correctly 
identified and allocated in the provider systems. In addition management 
regularly reviews the quantum and aging of any accrued revenue balances. 
The assessment of the Group’s information system which records the clicks, 
together with the reconciliation of revenue to cash receipts, therefore form a 
key part of the audit. The results of KPMG’s testing are included in their first 
half and full-year reports prepared for the Committee and reviewed in detail 
and discussed with KPMG.
Capitalisation of software and 
development costs
As more fully described on pages 94 to 96 of 
the Group’s Financial Statements the Group 
holds intangible asset balances arising from 
the capitalisation of certain software and 
development costs principally relating to 
developments in the Group’s front end 
platforms and back office data warehouse. 
The judgements in relation to software and development assets largely 
relate to the future economic benefits associated with the assets and that 
capitalisation is in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. We 
addressed these matters through examining investment appraisals on key IT 
projects received from management outlining the basis for the key 
assumptions used and were comfortable with management’s justification. 
We gain comfort that business plans in relation to the capitalised assets 
have received Board approval. This is also a significant risk area for the audit, 
and therefore KPMG provide to the Committee their comments on the 
approach taken by management. During the year ended 31 December 2015 
the Committee critically reviewed the analysis performed on the 
capitalisation of software and development costs and agreed that the 
projected future cash flows from these assets supports their carrying 
values.
Contingent remuneration
The Group acquired the business and assets 
of MoneySavingExpert and a sole trader 
business from Martin Lewis in September 
2012. As described more fully in note 3 to the 
Group’s Financial Statements on page 89, the 
remuneration was contingent upon various 
non-financial performance criteria together 
with a discretionary element and the 
continuing employment for a period of three 
years by Martin Lewis. 
The judgement involved in estimating the benefit payable relates to several 
aspects of MoneySavingExpert’s performance. We reviewed the accounting 
valuations of the contingent remuneration and, in light of the performance 
to date and anticipated future performance reported by management, 
agreed that the amount recorded in the Interim financial statements at June 
2015 was appropriate. In addition, since this was an area of significant audit 
risk, we ensured that KPMG detailed their views on the judgements which 
management have made in their report to the Committee. As the contingent 
remuneration crystallised in September 2015 and was paid in November 
2015, this was no longer an issue at 31 December 2015. 50 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
We also reviewed and considered the following areas due to their materiality and the application of judgement. However, we 
considered them to be stable in nature and therefore did not classify them as significant issues in the context of the 2015 Financial 
Statements.
Issue Committee review
Intangible assets impairment testing We reviewed the judgements, assumptions and estimates made by 
management in preparing the impairment review to ensure that they were 
appropriate. We also obtained the external auditors’ views on the 
appropriateness of the approach and conclusions. The results of this review 
were that we were satisfied with the conclusions reached.
Share-based payment charges We reviewed the judgements, assumptions and estimates made by 
management to ensure that they were appropriate. We also obtained the 
external auditors’ assessment of the calculations. The results of this review 
were that we were satisfied with the conclusions reached.
Enhanced going concern and viability 
statements
During the year we reviewed management’s plans and progress in order that 
the Committee could derive appropriate assurance that sufficient rigour was 
built into the assessment. In assessing the validity of the statements detailed 
on pages 25 to 26, we reviewed the work undertaken to assess the Group’s 
resilience to the Principal Risks under various scenarios.
Fair, balanced and understandable Report 
and Accounts
One of the key governance requirements is for the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. Ensuring this 
standard is met requires continuous assessment of the financial 
reporting issues affecting the Group in addition to the focused 
exercises which take place during the production of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. These focused exercises can be 
summarised as follows:
• a qualitative review of disclosures and a review of internal 
consistency throughout the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements;
• a review by the Committee of all material matters, as reported 
elsewhere in this Annual Report and Financial Statements;
• a risk comparison review, which assesses the consistency of 
the presentation of risks and significant judgements 
throughout the main areas of risk disclosure in this Annual 
Report and Financial Statements;
• a review of the balance of good and bad news;
• ensuring it correctly reflects:
 – the Group’s position and performance as described on 
pages 20 to 24;
 – the Group’s business model, as described on pages 6 to 7;
 – the Group’s strategy, as described on pages 10 to 13.
The Directors’ statement on a fair, balanced and understandable 
Annual Report and Financial Statements is set out on page 75. 
External auditor
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board in relation to the appointment of the external auditor. 
We also approve the terms of engagement and fees of the 
external auditor, ensuring they have appropriate audit plans in 
place and that an appropriate relationship is maintained 
between the Group and the external auditor.
Independence & non-audit services
We have policies and procedures in place in relation to the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor which are 
reviewed regularly. This ensures that the Group benefits in a 
cost-effective manner from the cumulative knowledge and 
experience of its auditor whilst also ensuring that the auditor 
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed, considered and agreed the scope and 
methodology of the audit work to be undertaken 
by the external auditor;
 u evaluated the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor, having regard to (a) a 
report from the external auditor describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage 
conflicts of interest; (b) the extent and nature of 
non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor; and (c) considering the tenure of the 
audit partner, who is required to rotate every 
five years in line with ethical standards. The 
audit partner rotated with effect from April 
2015;
 u agreed the terms of engagement and fees to be 
paid to the external auditor for the audit of the 
2015 Financial Statements; 
 u reviewed recommendations made by the 
external auditor in their management letters 
and the adequacy of management’s response; 
and
 u reviewed the timing of a tender exercise in 
relation to the appointment of the external 
auditor.

maintains the necessary degree of independence and objectivity. 
The external auditor is not permitted to perform any work which 
they may later be required to audit or which might affect their 
objectivity and independence or create a conflict of interest. Key 
points from our internal procedure for approval of work given to 
the external auditor are:
• no non-audit work may be placed with the external auditor 
without the specific approval of the Chief Financial Officer;
• specific approval is required in advance from me as well as the 
Chief Financial Officer for any non-audit work to be 
undertaken by the external auditor in excess of £50,000; 
• the non-audit fees are reported regularly to the Committee;
• valuation services, appraisals or fairness opinions are 
prohibited; and
• outsourcing of internal audit services, management functions, 
recruitment services and legal services is prohibited.
During the year the value of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor amounted to £0.18m (2014: £0.14m). Non-audit 
services amounted to 86% of the value of the audit. New EU 
legislation on permitted non-audit services will come into effect 
from 17 June 2016 which introduces a permitted non-audit 
services fee cap of 70% of the average audit fee over a 
consecutive three-year period. This cap will come into effect for 
the Group in the financial year ending 31 December 2020. A 
significant proportion of non-audit services relates to the 
following:
• reviewing the Group’s half-year reporting; 
• the provision of tax compliance services in relation to direct 
taxation; 
• the provision of advice in relation to the preparation and 
submission of claims for research and development (R&D) 
relief; and 
• the provision of regulatory advice in relation to 
documentation and control. 
The assurance provided by the external auditor on the items 
above is considered by the Group as strictly necessary in the 
interests of the Group. The level of non-audit services offered 
reflects the auditor’s knowledge and understanding of the 
Group. The Group has also continued with the appointment of 
other accountancy firms to provide certain non-audit services to 
the Group in connection with tax, systems and regulatory advice 
and anticipates that this will continue in 2016.
The provision of tax advisory services, due diligence and 
regulatory advice is permitted with the Committee’s prior 
approval in line with the approval limits set out above. The 
external auditor was not engaged during the year to provide any 
services which may have given rise to a conflict of interest. The 
Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit and 
non-audit fees are not material relative to the income of the 
external auditor as a whole and therefore that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor was not compromised.
Effectiveness and re-appointment
We considered the quality and effectiveness of the external audit 
process, in light of the FRC’s Practice Aid for Audit Committees 
(May 2015). The assessment of effectiveness was completed as 
part of an ongoing process of review throughout the year with 
the Audit Committee seeking assurances and understanding of 
the auditor’s approach to the audit. At the planning meetings for 
the half-year review and year-end audit, the external auditor was 
required to explain significant risks to audit quality by reference 
to the Company’s specific circumstances and changes in the risks 
and reasons for those changes. We explored the auditor’s 
understanding of our business and industry knowledge which 
informed their approach to identifying risks. We reviewed the 
Audit Quality Review team of the FRC’s report of KPMG and 
discussed the actions taken by KPMG in light of the 
recommendations, including the requirement to take further 
action to ensure there is appropriate evidence of involvement by 
the engagement quality control reviewer on all audits. We 
worked with KPMG to understand their judgements about 
materiality. We looked at the way they communicated key 
accounting and audit judgements. This approach was 
supplemented by members of the Committee and senior 
members of the Finance team who regularly interact with the 
external auditor completing a detailed questionnaire (which 
included consideration of the audit partner, the approach, 
communication, independence, objectivity, and reporting). The 
results of the questionnaire were then reported to and discussed 
by the Committee with the Committee gaining an understanding 
from respondents of why respondents considered the audit team 
exhibited the qualities included in the responses. We also 
assessed the cost effectiveness and value for money aspect of 
the audit. We reported our findings to the Board as part of our 
recommendation.
We held private meetings with the external auditor as necessary 
after Committee meetings to review key issues within their 
sphere of interest and responsibility.
KPMG have acted as the auditor to the Group since 2004 and 
were appointed as the auditor to the Company on its flotation in 
2007. The lead audit partner rotates every five years to ensure 
independence. The KPMG audit partner was rotated on 30 April 
2015 in accordance with the FRC’s Ethics Standard 3 (Revised).We 
considered the length of KPMG’s tenure and the results of the 
detailed questionnaire when assessing their continued 
effectiveness, independence and re-appointment. Mindful of the 
increasing regulatory focus on audit tendering in the UK and EU, 
we have been keeping under review the appropriate timing for 
conducting a formal tender exercise. During 2016, we 
recommended, and the Board accepted, a proposal to put the 
audit contract out to competitive tender in 2016, in relation to the 
audit for the Group for the year ending 31 December 2017. This 
will ensure the external audit contract is tendered within the 10 
years prescribed by EU and UK legislation and the Code’s 
recommendation. We confirm we have complied with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
We continue to remain satisfied with the work of KPMG and that 
they continue to remain independent and objective. In 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & 
Ireland) 260 and Ethical Standard 1 issued by the Accounting 
Practices Board, and as a matter of best practice, the external 
auditor has confirmed its independence as auditor of the 
Company, in a letter addressed to the Directors. We have 
recommended to the Board that a resolution is put to 
shareholders recommending the re-appointment of KPMG as the 
external auditor together with their terms of engagement and 
remuneration at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.  52 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Internal control
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems. Through monitoring the effectiveness of 
its internal controls and risk management, the Committee is 
able to maintain a good understanding of business 
performance, key judgemental areas and management’s 
decision-making processes.
We consider the adequacy of management’s response  
to matters raised and the implementation of  
recommendations made. 
The Board’s statement on internal control and risk  
management can be found on pages 44 to 45.
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed the framework and effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls;
 u received regular updates from management on 
internal control improvements and requested 
that KPMG reported on progress as part of their 
half-year review work;
 u reviewed external consultant’s reports on back 
office systems and processes;
 u monitored and reviewed management’s 
progress on improvements to back office 
systems and processes, including the payroll 
system; 
 u reviewed comprehensive reports from the 
external auditor, KPMG, of the results of their 
controls testing as part of the external audit; 
 u reported to the Board on our evaluation of the 
operation of the Group’s internal control and 
risk management system, informed by reports 
from Internal Audit and KPMG; and
 u received a report from KPMG regarding cyber 
security and requested future regular updates 
from management to provide comfort that 
management continues to treat this as a key 
risk area.
Internal Audit
The Group has an Internal Audit function which reviews 
financial, operational and regulatory matters.
Whistleblowing
The Group has a whistleblowing process which enables 
employees of the Group to raise, in confidence, concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial reporting, other operational 
matters or inappropriate personal behaviours in the work place.
In 2015, we:
 u continued to oversee investment in the Internal 
Audit function, recognising that regulation in 
particular, as price comparison continues to 
become an ever more important part of the 
distribution chain of financial services, will 
become more important;
 u reviewed the rolling twelve-month Internal 
Audit plan which defines the scope of work the 
Internal Audit function will undertake;
 u reviewed results from audits performed 
including any unsatisfactory audit findings and 
related action plans;
 u reviewed open audit actions, together with 
monitoring progress against the actions;
 u reviewed how the Internal Audit function could 
best support the Risk Committee and Audit 
Committee; 
 u reviewed the assurance map to ensure there is 
clear, comprehensive risk and assurance 
coverage; and
 u met with the head of Internal Audit.
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed the controls in place to mitigate 
against fraud risks;
 u decided to outsource the whistleblowing hotline 
and appointed an external provider to facilitate 
reporting by employees via confidential hotline, 
email and internet; and
 u reviewed reports from the Company Secretary 
and Group General Counsel on whistleblowing 
incidents and their outcomes at each meeting. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 53

Audit Committee effectiveness
In 2015 we carried out our evaluation of Audit Committee 
effectiveness with Directors serving on the Committee and 
members of the finance and executive management teams 
completing a questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on 
areas such as composition, how the committee operates, 
professional development of members, oversight of financial 
reporting, oversight of risk management and internal control 
and oversight of internal and external audit. The responses 
were then discussed at a Committee meeting.
Some of the development areas that will be actioned in 2016 
include:
• a continued focus on the automation of controls;
• a continued focus on the effectiveness of risk mitigation 
controls; and
• further enhancements to our internal control and internal 
audit capability.
Training
The Audit Committee receives or reviews guidance as 
appropriate during the year. 
Overview of Committee activities for 2016
Internal control will continue to be our priority for 2016 with 
oversight of the implementation of additional assurance

Nomination Committee 
Report
‘In 2015 we continued to review the 
composition of the Board and I am 
delighted to have strengthened the 
Board further with the appointment 
of Robin Freestone.’
The Nomination Committee plays a 
key role in reviewing the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and its 
Committees; taking into account skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity, 
and making recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes.

Governance
The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board. When the need to appoint a Director is identified, we 
prepare a candidate profile indicating the skills, knowledge and 
experience required, taking into account the Board’s existing 
composition. We engage external executive search consultants 
and we interview suitable candidates who are proposed by 
either existing Board members or by the external executive 
search consultants.
We give careful consideration to ensure proposed appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the role and that the balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained.
When the Nomination Committee has identified a suitable 
candidate, I will make a recommendation to the Board with the 
Board making the final decision.
Committee meetings
We met on three occasions during the year. Details of the 
attendance at Nomination Committee meetings are set out on 
the previous page.
We invited the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief People Officer 
and the Company Secretary to attend meetings of the 
Nomination Committee. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Nomination Committee.
We followed the procedure outlined above for the appointment 
of Robin Freestone, engaging Russell Reynolds as the external 
executive search consultants. Russell Reynolds has no other 
connection with the Company. We considered a wide and 
diverse range of candidates and, having confirmed his 
independence, the Board was unanimous in its decision to 
appoint Robin Freestone. 
Robin brings experience of leading global and digital businesses 
and will provide valuable challenge and insight to the Board’s 
deliberations.
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed the composition of the Board, including 
the balance of skills, knowledge and experience;
 u reviewed succession plans for the Board and 
executive management;
 u considered and recommended the appointment 
of Robin Freestone as an Independent Non-
Executive Director and his membership of each 
of the Committees;
 u considered Graham Donoghue and Simon Nixon 
stepping down from the Board;
 u considered and recommended to the Board the 
re-election of all Directors at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting; and
 u reviewed the register of Directors’ conflicts  
of interest.
The members of the Nomination Committee can, where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Written terms of reference that outline the Committee’s 
authority and responsibility are published on the investor 
relations section of the Group’s website at 
http://corporate.moneysupermarket.com and are available in 
hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary. We 
review our terms of reference annually.
Boardroom diversity
The Board’s Statement on Diversity is as follows:
‘The Board of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC welcomed 
the publication in February 2011 of the Davies Review on 
Women on Boards. Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC is 
committed to ensuring that any Board vacancies arising are 
filled by the most qualified candidates and recognises the 
value and importance of diversity in the composition of the 
Board. When Board positions become available, the Company 
will remain focused on ensuring that a diverse range of 
candidates are considered whilst ensuring that appointments 
continue to be based on merit, measured against objective 
criteria and the skills and experience the individual offers. The 
Board has targeted a minimum female representation on the 
Board of 25% by 2016.’
As at the date of this report, the Board had a total of eight 
Directors. The skill set of the Non-Executive Directors 
includes financial, economic, banking, digital, technology, 
communications and consumer expertise. I am pleased to 
report that 25% of the Board are female and we have 
achieved our targeted minimum female representation of 
25% by 2016.
Nomination Committee effectiveness
In 2015 we carried out a separate evaluation of Nomination 
Committee effectiveness by questionnaire. The questionnaire 
focused on areas such as composition, how the Committee 
operates, its responsibilities, knowledge and experience of 
members. The responses were discussed at a Committee 
meeting. Some of the development areas that will be actioned 
in 2016 include:
• further enhancements to the forward rolling agenda on 
succession planning and talent management; and
• greater focus in meetings on diversity.
The Board, based on the evaluation exercise, concluded that 
the Committee was considered to be effective in fulfilling its 
role throughout 2015.

terms of reference annually. 
Committee meetings
We met six times in 2015 and the attendance of our members is 
shown in the table on the previous page. We invited the 
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Company Secretary, together with 
appropriate members of the management team with 
responsibility for management of key risks, and the external 
auditor, to meetings as necessary. The Committee also meets 
separately with the Chief Risk Officer at least once a year.
After each meeting, I report to the Board on the main issues 
that we discussed.
The members of the Risk Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Principal activities in 2015
The Committee has an annual schedule of work, developed 
from its terms of reference, with standing items that it 
considers at each meeting in addition to any specific matters 
upon which the Committee has decided to focus. This schedule 
of work is expected to evolve to reflect the Group’s strategy and 
changes to the economic and regulatory environment in which 
the Group operates. The Risk Committee receives regular 
reports from members of executive management, the Chief 
Risk Officer, Internal Audit and the Group General Counsel.
In 2015, we:
 u enhanced and approved the Group Risk 
Appetite Statement and Framework with 
specific consideration given to the risk 
management and internal control 
requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code;
 u created and approved a more detailed risk 
register which incorporates a wider range of 
risks in addition to financial risks;
 u introduced and reviewed an annual rolling 
agenda;
 u refined the structure of responsibilities for 
risk within the various functions, including 
our Internal Audit function and Risk and 
Compliance function;

and mitigating potential conflicts of interest; 
and
 u assessed the identification and management 
of technology risks across the Group, 
including data security. 58 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risk and Compliance
The Group has a Risk and Compliance function, headed by the 
Chief Risk Officer, which reviews the Group’s standards and values 
together with regulatory matters in relation to the various bodies 
that regulate a number of the areas within which the Group 
operates. These include the FCA, the Information Commissioners 
Office and Ofgem which operates a voluntary code relating to 
energy price comparison to which the Group subscribes. 
Risk Committee effectiveness
In 2015, we carried out our annual evaluation of Risk Committee 
effectiveness by questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on 
areas such as composition, how the Committee operates, 
professional development of members and oversight of risk 
management. The responses were then discussed at a 
Committee meeting. Some of the development areas that will 
be actioned in 2016 include:
• further enhancements to management information relating 
to the reporting of key risks;
• succession planning within the Risk and Compliance 
function; and
• further enhancements to the forward rolling agenda  
on key risks.
The Board, based on the evaluation exercise, concluded that the 
Committee was considered to be effective in fulfilling its role 
throughout 2015.
In 2015, we:
 u reviewed and approved the Risk and Compliance 
plan which defines the scope of the work that 
the function will undertake with regard to 
compliance monitoring and assurance activities 
across the Group;
 u considered the updates against the Risk and 
Compliance plan and the results of the work 
performed since the previous meeting and 
management’s response; and 
 u reviewed the resources of the Risk and 
Compliance function and recruited  
additional resource.
Overview of Committee activities for 2016
The management of operational and conduct risks will continue 
to be our priority for 2016. We will continue to monitor the 
embedding of risk management processes into key business 
activities and will support the continued investment in Risk  
and Compliance. We will continue to develop and refine 
management information and reporting. We will also be 
arranging for an external consultant to undertake an 
independent review of our risk management and compliance 
processes during 2016.
The Group recognises that regulation in general, and in 
particular the activities of the FCA, Ofgem and CMA will 
continue to be a feature of the price comparison market. The 
Group has invested, and will continue to invest, in additional 
skills and resources in this area in 2016.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2015.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has continued to 
focus on ensuring that our policies and procedures balance the 
incentives for our Executives to create long-term value for our 
shareholders with a commitment to effective risk management. 
During the year, we consulted with our investors over the 
amendments to the performance measures in our incentive 
plans. We received strong support for these changes, with a 
vote of over 96% approval for the Remuneration Policy at the 
2015 AGM.
Pay for performance in 2015
Our reward philosophy remains unchanged. We believe in a 
simple and transparent framework which rewards our 
Executives based on the financial and strategic performance of 
the business, the value created for our shareholders, and their 
individual performance. During 2015, the variable elements of 
executive remuneration were focused on simple and 
transparent measures of revenue growth, adjusted operating 
profit growth, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth, total 
shareholder return and key strategic objectives. 
Our bonus and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards in respect 
of 2015 performance were based on challenging targets, as 
disclosed on pages 66 and 67.
2015 has been another strong year for the Group with revenue 
increasing by 14% to £281.7m and adjusted operating profit 
increasing by 15% to £100.1m. Our Executive team has continued 
to focus on the execution of our growth strategies, performing 
well against their stretching individual performance targets. As a 
result, the Committee determined that they would receive a bonus 
for their performance of between 106% and 175% of their basic 
salary (which represents between 71% and 95% of the maximum).
Directors’ Remuneration 
Report
‘We believe in a simple and transparent 
framework which rewards our 
Executives based on financial and 
strategic performance of the business, 
the value created for our shareholders, 
and their individual performance.’
The Remuneration Committee’s key 
responsibility is to determine the 
Remuneration Policy to ensure it 
promotes the long-term success of  
the Group.
Andrew Fisher
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 60 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Our 2013 LTIP award, which was based on a combination of 
compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA and comparative 
total shareholder return, will vest at 127% (85% of the maximum) 
in March 2016, reflecting the achievements of the Executives over 
the three years since the award was made. Our growth in total 
shareholder return of 149.4% was above upper quartile against the 
FTSE 250 and we achieved 13.7% compound annual growth in 
adjusted EBITDA over the performance period.
Key changes to our remuneration arrangements 
during 2015
As explained in last year’s Report, we made the following 
changes to our executive remuneration framework during  
the year:
• the introduction of malus and clawback provisions into the 
annual bonus and LTIP arrangements; 
• a change to the annual bonus performance measures from 
adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit to better align 
our annual bonus with our business strategy; 
• a change to the LTIP performance measures from growth in 
adjusted EBITDA to growth in adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) to better align our long-term incentives with the 
creation of shareholder value; and 
• a higher threshold for the target range for the EPS measure 
of 7%–17% compound annual growth. 
Approach to remuneration in 2016
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the executive 
remuneration framework to ensure it promotes the long-term 
success of the Company and continues to support the delivery of the 
Company’s strategy, sustainable growth and shareholder returns.
Following the changes made in 2015, we are not proposing to 
make any changes to our executive remuneration for 2016 other 
than annual base salary increases for Executive Directors of 2% 
for the Chief Executive Officer and 3.5% for the Chief Financial 
Officer, generally in line with the average employee increase 
across the Group of approximately 2%. The increase for 
Matthew Price is marginally above the general increase, 
reflecting both his development in the role and performance 
during the year, in line with our Remuneration Policy.  
The Committee believes it is important that the market 
competitiveness of the Executive Directors’ overall reward 
package should be maintained.
There will be no change to the maximum bonus or LTIP award 
levels in 2016.
The adjusted earnings per share target range for the 2016 LTIP 
award will remain 7% to 17% per annum.
Board changes
In October 2015, Graham Donoghue stepped down as an 
Executive Director but remained with the Company until the 
end of the year to hand over to his successor. The Committee 
agreed his leaving arrangements in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy. He received a payment of £285,600 in 
respect of 12 months of his unworked notice period. In 
recognition of his contribution to the Group, the Committee 
determined that he would be treated as a good leaver for the 
purposes of his unvested 2013 LTIP award.  
His 2013 LTIP will vest on the normal vesting date, reduced 
pro-rata for the time served and based on the achievement of 
the performance conditions. His 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards 
lapsed in full. He will receive a bonus payment for the 2015 
financial year.
Alignment with shareholders
We are mindful of our shareholders’ interests and are keen to 
ensure a demonstrable link between reward and value creation. 
The introduction of malus and clawback arrangements into our 
annual bonus and LTIPs for awards made in 2015 and beyond 
together with the existing shareholding guidelines all foster an 
ongoing commitment to the business from our Executives and 
continued alignment of shareholder and Executive objectives. 
In reviewing the framework this year, the Committee also 
considered the time horizons in the incentive framework in the 
context of the stated views of some investors. The Committee 
concluded that the current vesting horizons remain  
appropriate for the Group in the context of our business  
model, talent markets, shareholding requirements, and their 
current shareholdings. 
However the Committee recognises that the overall framework 
has not been comprehensively reviewed for a number of years, 
over which time the business has seen significant changes in 
financial size, scope of operations, and strategic direction.  
We are also seeing unprecedented levels of competition in 
digital talent markets. Furthermore, our existing Long Term 
Incentive Plan is due to expire in 2017 and therefore a new plan 
will need to be submitted for shareholder approval at the  
2017 AGM. 
As a result, the Committee has decided to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the framework during 2016 with a 
view to implementing any changes from 2017 onwards.  
Our objective will be to ensure that the framework continues to 
be right for the business and strategy, whilst at the same time 
being appropriately updated for developments in best practice. 
We remain committed to an open and ongoing dialogue with 
our shareholders on the issue of executive remuneration and 
the Committee welcomes the feedback we receive. 
We are pleased with the support we have received in the past 
from shareholders, with over 99% support for last year’s  
Annual Remuneration Report and over 96% approval for our 
Remuneration Policy last year. We look forward to receiving 
your continued support at the forthcoming AGM.

Notes
(1) A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2016 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64. 
(2) The following differences exist between the Company’s policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of 
employees generally: 
• A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain 
senior executives. 
• Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise a car allowance where required for the role or to meet market norms. 
• Participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers. Other employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s share plans, details of which are provided on page 62. 
• A lower level of pension rate applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives. 
 In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of roles. They also 
reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
(3) The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be 
appropriately challenging and aligned to the Group’s strategy and the creation of shareholder value. 
(4) The adjusted earnings per share and comparative total shareholder return performance conditions applicable to the LTIP (further details of which are provided on 
page 64) were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the creation of 
shareholder value. 
(5) The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans. 
(6) All employee share plans do not operate performance conditions. 
(7) The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the 
policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not 
in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
(8) The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval. 64 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Annual Report on Remuneration
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the year ending 31 December 2016
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied during the year ending 31 December 2016 is set out below.
Base salary
The Remuneration Committee has determined that base salaries for the Executive Directors will increase as follows with effect 
from 1 January 2016:
The Group’s employees are, in general, receiving salary increases averaging approximately 2%. The increase for Matthew Price is 
marginally above the general increase, reflecting his performance and increased experience in the CFO role during the year in line 
with our Remuneration Policy.
Pension arrangements
The Company will continue to provide pension contributions of 20% of base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors. Where 
the pension contributions exceed the limits set by HMRC, the Group will continue to provide benefits through the provision of 
salary supplements.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2016 will remain at 185% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 165% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. Awards are determined based on a combination of Group financial 
performance and individual performance, directly aligned to our KPIs and strategic objectives, as follows:
Maximum bonus will only be payable when performance has significantly exceeded expectations. The Committee believes that the 
underlying targets are currently commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed at this stage. To the extent they are no longer 
commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in next year’s report.
Long-term incentives
The LTIP award levels in 2016 will remain at 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 165% of base salary for the Chief 
Financial Officer.
The extent to which 2016 LTIP awards will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions as follows:
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.

Notes
(1) Taxable benefits
Benefits for the Executive Directors incorporate all benefits and expense allowances arising from employment which relate to the 
provision of a car allowance. 
(2) Pension
Pension payments reflect defined contributions and/or salary supplement arrangements where the pension contributions exceed 
the limits set by HMRC.
(3) Annual bonus payments
Maximum bonus entitlements for the year ended 31 December 2015 as a percentage of base salary were 185% for Peter Plumb, 
165% for Matthew Price and 150% for Graham Donoghue for the achievement of stretching targets for growth in revenue and 
adjusted operating profit as well as specific personal objectives. The performance targets, weightings, and actual performance 
against those targets, are set out below:
As shown above, the bonus calculation for Graham Donoghue included a 60% (of salary) element based on MoneySuperMarket revenue 
and operating profit targets. The Committee determined that performance was above target and that this element should pay out at 
77% of the maximum. The Board considers that further detail on the underlying MoneySuperMarket targets and performance is 
commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed.
The personal targets were set individually for each Executive Director based on the key areas of strategic focus for the year in their 
area of responsibility. As part of the personal targets, the Directors are also assessed on how performance has been delivered 
having regard to the values of the Group. The Committee assessed the personal targets and determined that they should pay out 
as set out in the table above. Detail on the underlying targets is commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed, however, the 
following table highlights key areas of focus for the personal targets of each Director:
The figure in the remuneration table on page 65 reflects the bonus payable for the period that Graham Donoghue was a Director.

4) Vesting of LTIP awards
The LTIP award made on 20 March 2013 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2015. The performance targets 
for this award, and actual performance against those targets, was as follows:
Vesting is determined by a set formula between threshold and maximum for the adjusted EBITDA element and on a straight-line 
basis between threshold and maximum for the comparative total shareholder return element. The award made in 2013 was 
calibrated as a number of shares with a maximum vesting of 150% of that number. 
The value attributed to vested shares under Long-term incentives in the remuneration table for 2015 includes amounts relating to 
dividend equivalents payable on vested LTIP awards over the three-year period ended 20 March 2016.
The value attributed to vested shares under Long-term incentives in the remuneration table for 2015 is an estimate based on the 
average share price during the three months ended 31 December 2015 (£3.30). The 2014 value of the vested shares in the 
remuneration table has been updated from last year’s value to represent the actual value received on the date of vesting.
5) Additional Information
After resigning from the Board on 8 October 2015, Graham Donoghue continued to work as an employee until 31 December 2015 
to hand over to his successor and during such time continued to receive salary and benefits pursuant to, and in line with, his 
service agreement, including the balance of his bonus for the period from 8 October 2015 to 31 December 2015.

Outstanding share awards
The table below sets out details of outstanding share awards held by the Executive Directors.
(1) Awards of nil cost options made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 vest by reference to an EBITDA performance condition (70% of the award) and a comparative TSR 
performance condition (30% of the award). 30% of the maximum vests for threshold performance. 
(2) Details of the performance conditions relating to the awards of nil cost options made in 2015 are set out at the top of the page. 
(3) Long-term Incentive Plan awards made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were calibrated as a number of shares with a maximum vesting of 150% of that number. The figures 
shown above represent the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full. 
(4) As a result of the Remuneration Committee exercising its discretion to treat Graham Donoghue as a good leaver for the award made on 20 March 2013, a pro rata 
amount of this award (181,527 shares) will continue to vest on its normal vesting date subject to scheme performance conditions with the balance of the 22,003 
lapsing. The unvested LTIPs for Graham Donoghue relating to the awards made on 3 April 2014 and 30 April 2015 lapsed in their entirety following his resignation 
from the Company.

Paul Doughty resigned as a Director on 23 April 2014. As a result of the Remuneration Committee exercising its discretion to treat 
Paul Doughty as a good leaver for the 2012 LTIP award, the maximum number of shares in his award was reduced pro rata on 
cessation from 346,253 to 278,925 shares. Based on the achievement of the performance conditions, 273,263 shares vested on 22 
June 2015.
Payments for loss of office (audited)
A payment of salary in lieu of notice was paid to Graham Donoghue totalling £285,600 for a period of 12 months after he ceased to 
be an employee on 31 December 2015 to reflect the unexpired period of his notice period.
Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
Executive Directors are required to hold shares in the Company worth 100% of base salary and must retain 50% of the net of tax 
value of any vested LTIP shares until the guideline is met. The shareholding as a percentage is based on the average share price 
during December 2015 of £3.41.
In the period from 31 December 2015 to the date of this Report, there has been no change in the Directors’ interests in shares in 
the Company.
Performance graph and table (unaudited)
The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company over the last seven financial years relative to 
the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The Remuneration Committee considers the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
Investment Trusts) to be an appropriate index for total shareholder return and comparison disclosure as it represents a broad 
equity market index in which the Company is a constituent member.
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2015, of £100 invested in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC on 31 December 2008

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Director’s remuneration
The Remuneration Committee comprises four Independent Non-Executive Directors, Andrew Fisher (Chairman), Robin Freestone, 
Sally James and Genevieve Shore. Biographies of the members of the Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 38 and 39.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
People Officer and Company Secretary may attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee, except when their own 
remuneration is under consideration. No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The members of the Remuneration Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Remuneration Committee’s duties include:
• determining the policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and executive management;
• determining the remuneration package of the Chairman, Executive Directors and executive management, including, where 
appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and pension arrangements within the terms of the agreed framework and policy; and 
• determining awards under the Company’s long-term incentive schemes.

The Remuneration Committee met on seven occasions during the year. Details of the attendance at Remuneration Committee 
meetings are as set out below: 
(1) Robin Freestone was appointed to the Committee on 1 August 2015.
(2) Michael Wemms retired from the Committee on 30 April 2015.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are published on the investor relations section of the Group’s website at 
http://corporate.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee and the Company received advice from Deloitte LLP, who are independent 
remuneration consultants, in connection with remuneration matters including the Group’s performance related remuneration 
policy. Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to that group’s voluntary code of 
practice for remuneration consultants in the UK. Deloitte LLP has no other connection or relationship with the Group. During 2015, 
Deloitte LLP also provided services to the Group in respect of corporate tax and VAT advice, operational audit advisory work, HR 
consultancy and corporate finance due diligence work.
The fees paid to Deloitte LLP for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration over the financial year under review was £76,900.
Outside appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept outside appointments on external boards so long as these are not deemed to interfere 
with the business of the Group. In the year ended 31 December 2015 Peter Plumb received £31,000 (2014: nil) as a non-executive 
director of Co-operative Group Limited.
Remuneration Committee effectiveness
In 2015 we carried out a separate evaluation of Remuneration Committee effectiveness by questionnaire. The questionnaire 
focused on areas such as composition, how the Committee operates, its responsibilities and knowledge and experience of 
members as well as the advice and support it receives from its remuneration consultants. The responses were discussed at a 
Committee meeting. Some of the development areas that will be actioned in 2016 include:
• further enhancements to papers submitted to the Committee; and
• further enhancements to the process for setting bonus objectives. 
The Board, based on the evaluation exercise, concluded that the Committee was considered to be effective in fulfilling its role 
throughout 2015.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will be held 
at The Chester Grosvenor Hotel, Eastgate, Chester CH1 1LT on 
Wednesday 20 April 2016 at 11.00am. The notice convening the 
meeting, with details of the business to be transacted at the 
meeting and explanatory notes is set out in a separate AGM 
circular which has been sent to all shareholders at the same 
time as this Report.
Dividend
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 6.6p (2014: 5.69p) 
per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2015. If approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, this 
will be paid on 6 May 2016 to shareholders on the register at 
close of business on 1 April 2016. The final dividend, together 
with the interim dividend of 2.55p per ordinary share paid in 
September 2015, gives a total dividend for the year of 9.15p 
(2014: 8.0p) per ordinary share.
Issued share capital and control
As at 31 December 2015, the issued share capital of the 
Company was £109,503 comprising 547,512,622 ordinary  
shares of 0.02p each. Full details of the share capital of the 
Company and changes to share capital during the year are set 
out in note 16 to the Group Financial Statements on page 99.  
The information in note 16 is incorporated by reference and 
forms part of this Directors’ Report.
At the 2015 AGM, shareholders authorised the Directors to  
allot up to 363,220,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company. Directors will seek authority from shareholders  
at the forthcoming AGM to allot up to 364,640,000  
ordinary shares.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
when declared, to receive the Company’s Annual Report, to 
attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, to 
appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 73

Governance
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every 
holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy, and 
entitled to vote, has one vote and, on a poll, every holder of 
ordinary shares present in person or by proxy, and entitled to 
vote, has one vote for every ordinary share held. Electronic and 
paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must be 
received not later than 48 hours before the meeting. A holder of 
ordinary shares can lose the entitlement to vote and the right to 
receive dividends where that holder fails to comply with a 
disclosure notice issued under section 793 of the Companies 
Act 2006. There are no issued shares in the Company with 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan which entitles all 
employees to purchase ordinary shares in the Company using 
money deducted from their pre-tax salary. Plan shares are held 
in trust for participants by Capita IRG Trustees Limited 
(Trustee). Voting rights are exercised by the Trustee in 
accordance with participants’ instructions. If a participant does 
not submit an instruction to the Trustee, no vote is registered. 
In addition, the Trustee does not vote on any unawarded or 
forfeit shares held under the Plan as surplus assets. As at the 
date of this report, the Trustee held 0.03% of the issued 
ordinary share capital in the Company.
The Company operates a Long Term Incentive Plan and shares 
are held by the trustees, Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited 
(Appleby), pending vesting of the shares awarded under the 
Plan. Appleby does not vote on any shares held in trust. As at 
the date of this Report, Appleby held 0.26% of the issued 
ordinary share capital in the Company.
Full details of the rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s share capital are contained in the Articles of 
Association. The Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. No 
amendments are proposed to be made to the existing Articles 
of Association at the forthcoming AGM.
The Relationship Agreement between the Company and Simon 
Nixon, details of which are set out on page 42 terminated in May 
2015 upon the sale of shares by Simon Nixon which resulted in 
him holding less than 15% of the ordinary shares in the 
Company.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control 
subject to satisfaction of any performance conditions at that 
time. Save in respect of provisions of the Company’s share 
schemes, there are no agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees providing compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover 
bid.
The Company has entered into one significant agreement which 
would be terminable upon a change of control; the credit facility 
agreement entered into with Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds 
Bank PLC in December 2015.
Restrictions on the transfer of securities
Whilst the Board has the power under the Articles of 
Association to refuse to register a transfer of shares, there are 
no restrictions on the transfer of shares other than:
• certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by 
laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
• pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain Directors, officers and employees 
of the Group require the approval of the Company to deal in 
ordinary shares of the Company.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities and/or voting rights.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Company was authorised at the 2015 AGM to purchase up 
to 54,538,266 of its own shares in the market. No shares were 
purchased under this authority in 2015. Directors will seek 
authority from shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for the 
Company to purchase, in the market, up to 54,752,150 shares. 
The Directors will only use this power after careful 
consideration, taking into account the financial resources of the 
Company, the Company’s share price and future funding 
opportunities. The Directors will only purchase such shares 
after taking into account the effects on earnings per share and 
the interests of shareholders generally.

Corporate Governance Code (Code).
The Executive Directors serve under rolling contracts that are

Copies of service contracts and letters of appointment are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office

in any contract of significance to the Group’s business.
Directors’ powers
The Board of Directors may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the 
Company’s Articles of Association and any directions given by 
the Company in general meeting.
Directors’ indemnities
During the financial year ended 31 December 2015 and up to 
the date of this Directors’ Report, the Company has maintained 
appropriate liability insurance for its Directors and officers.
The Company has granted indemnities to each of its Directors 
and the Company Secretary to the extent permitted by law and 
its Articles of Association. These indemnities were in force 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2015 and remain in 
force as at the date of this Report in relation to certain losses 
and liabilities which the Directors or Company Secretary may 
incur in the course of acting as Directors, Company Secretary or 
employees of the Company or of any associated company.
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and uses a number of ways to engage with 
employees on matters that impact them and the performance 
of the Group. These include formal business performance 
updates by members of executive management for all 
employees, regular update briefings for all employees, regular 
team meetings, the Group’s intranet site which enables easy 
access to the latest Group information as well as Group policies, 
and the circulation to employees of results announcements and 
other corporate announcements. This also helps to achieve a 
common awareness amongst employees of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the performance of the Group.
A robust employee engagement survey process is also in place 
to ensure that employees are given a voice in the organisation 
and that the Group can take action based on employee 
feedback. All employees are able to participate in the 
Company’s Share Incentive Plan and Save As You Earn Scheme 
which gives employees the opportunity to purchase ordinary 
shares in the Company. This helps to encourage employee 
interest in the performance of the Group.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
all employees without discrimination and applies fair and 
equitable employment policies which seek to promote entry 
into and progression within the Group. Appointments are 
determined solely by application of job criteria, personal ability, 
behaviour and competency.
Disabled persons
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for 
vacancies, with due regard to their skills and abilities. 
Procedures ensure that disabled employees are fairly treated in 
respect of training and career development. For those 
employees becoming disabled during the course of their 
employment, the Group is supportive so as to provide an 
opportunity for them to remain with the Group, wherever 
reasonably practicable.
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are deemed 
to be effective and in accordance with their intended aims.

research and development expenditure is predominantly 
associated with computer and internet software systems. 
Successfully developed software is used to develop new 
products and to improve and extend the functionality and 
scope of the Group’s operations.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS102-The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Company Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 38 and 39 confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which comprises the Directors’ 
Report and the Strategic Report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties that they face. 
In addition, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Auditor and disclosure of information
The Directors who held office at the date of this Report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
each such Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of 
any relevant audit information, and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
KPMG LLP have indicated their willingness to accept re-
appointment as auditors of the Company. A resolution 
proposing their re-appointment is contained in the notice of the 
forthcoming AGM and will be proposed to shareholders at that 
meeting. 76 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit:
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on 
pages 80 to 110. In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Financial Statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Capitalised software and development costs: £28.1 million (2014: £15.9 million)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 86 (accounting policy) and pages 94 to 96 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group has incurred significant software and development project costs in the year in respect of Project Reset, a 
significant technology infrastructure programme and TSM 9.0, TravelSuperMarket’s technology and website replatform project.  
These costs are capitalised to the extent that future economic benefits are expected to be generated by the projects to which they 
relate. This requires judgement as to whether the projects will be completed successfully and whether sufficient revenue and 
profitability will be generated to recover the costs capitalised. The Directors make this assessment using a return on investment 
calculation.  The key inputs in that calculation, specifically revenue growth, ability to cross sell products, and timing and amount  
of capital expenditure, all require significant estimation and judgement. The Directors also apply judgement, as to whether the 
software and development costs incurred are technically feasible. Given the significant value and judgemental nature of the 
classification of software and development assets, this is considered to be an area of significant audit risk.
Our response – Our audit procedures included detailed testing of the inputs into the Group’s return on investment calculations.   
We assessed the historical accuracy of the Directors’ forecasting and conducted interviews with key operational personnel to 
obtain a breadth of different views about project progress, corroborating their comments to internal performance reporting where 
applicable. For the key inputs we critically assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions with reference to internal data from 
Project and Infrastructure leads; Board approved capital spending forecasts; and knowledge gained performing our other audit 
procedures. We challenged management’s assessment of the technical feasibility of the projects based on our discussions with key 
project leads and reviews of detailed business cases, submitted prior to costs being incurred, outlining the proposed features and 
expected completion dates. We assessed whether costs had been appropriately capitalised, by reference to the recognition criteria 
of the applicable accounting standards; IAS38 and SIC 32. We agreed a sample of external costs capitalised to external invoices in 
respect of significant projects for a statistically selected sample. We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the judgements made by management that economic benefit will be derived from the projects.
Revenue: £281.7 million (2014: £248.1 million)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 85 (accounting policy) and page 97 (financial disclosures).
 
The risk – Revenue is recognised predominately from internet lead generation (click based revenues). Revenue accruals are made 
based on an estimation of the likely number of successful conversions. Revenue recognition, including the existence and accuracy 
of revenue, is considered to be a significant audit risk because of the inherent complexities of the click recording system and the 
judgements made to estimate unbilled revenue at the period end.
 
Our response – Our audit procedures included assessing the general IT control environment for the systems used to determine 
click-based revenue.  We documented the systems put in place by management and made our own assessment of the effectiveness 
of their design.  We also performed walk through tests to assess whether the controls were operating as designed. Our own IT 
specialists re-performed click-throughs in the live environment to assess whether the system was recording clicks in the correct 
period, and whether the number of clicks on which the Group based its revenue accrual estimate were derived from a system that 
is operating effectively. 
We selected a statistical sample of revenue accruals at 31 October 2015 and agreed these to confirmatory evidence, including cash 
receipts and confirmations of successful applications from the end providers.  This allowed us to make an assessment of the 
accuracy of the revenue accrual in the period to 31 October 2015. We performed ageing analysis and analytical procedures, based 
on revenue trends, to assess the movements in the accrual to 31 December 2015.  78 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the Members of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Only
We agreed total revenue recognised to cash receipts received in the year, with reference to the movement of trade receivables  
and revenue accruals, allowing us to assess the existence and completeness of the revenue recognised in the year ended  
31 December 2015. 
We analysed movements in revenue at an operating segment level based on changes in visitor numbers and transactions, 
challenging management’s explanation of any unusual trends with reference to supporting evidence.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of click-based revenue recognition.
MoneySavingExpert.com contingent remuneration payable: Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Accrual £nil 
(2014: £15.3 million), Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income charge £5.2 million, of which £0.4 million 
relates to interest unwind (2014: £4.2 million, of which £0.3 million relates to interest unwind)
As a result of Moneysupermarket.com paying its final settlement of the MoneySavingExpert.com contingent remuneration, there is 
no longer any estimation uncertainty over the liability and therefore it is no longer assessed as one of the risks that has the 
greatest effect on our audit and is not separately identified in our report this year.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole was set at £4.0 million (2014: £5.0 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax, normalised to exclude MoneySavingExpert.com contingent remuneration 
costs. Materiality represents 4.7% of normalised Group profit before tax a reduction on 2014 consistent with industry consensus 
levels (2014: 7.5%). 
 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.2 million, in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
 
The Group consists of nine components, which are all audited by the Group audit team at the Group site. 98% of the Group 
revenues are generated from the main trading component, Moneysupermarket.com Limited. Moneysupermarket.com Limited’s 
component materiality is £3.6 million. We audit the remaining components to materialities ranging from £0.1 million to £3.5 million. 
The Group audit scope covers 100% of Group revenues, 100% of Group profit before taxation, and 100% of total Group assets.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements.
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ Viability Statement on pages 25 and 26, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 2018; or
• the disclosures in note 2 of the Financial Statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement 
that they consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 79

Other reserves
The other reserves balance represents the merger and revaluation reserves generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com 
Financial Group Limited by the Company, as discussed below, and a capital redemption reserve for £19,000 arising from the 
acquisition of 95,294,118 deferred shares of 0.02p by the Company from Simon Nixon.
Upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, a merger reserve of £60,750,000 for 15% of the fair value 
of assets acquired, a merger reserve of £16,923,000 for 45% of the book value transferred from a company under common control, 
and a revaluation reserve of £65,345,000 representing 45% of the fair value of the intangible assets transferred from a company 
under common control, were recognised. Amounts were transferred from these reserves to retained earnings as the goodwill and 
other intangibles balances which relate to this acquisition were impaired and amortised.
Reserve for own shares
The reserve for the Company’s own ordinary shares comprises the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares held by the Group 
through employee trusts. At 31 December 2015, the Group held 425,225 ordinary shares at a cost of 0.02p per share through a 
Share Incentive Plan trust for the benefit of the Group’s employees.
The Group also held 1,214,301 shares through an Employee Benefit Trust acquired during the year at a cost of 317.34p per share for 
the benefit of employees participating in the various Long Term Incentive Plan schemes.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

1. Corporate information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (Company), a company incorporated in England,  
and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2015, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 29 February 2016. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs). The Company has elected  
to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 102 - The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland; these are presented on pages 104 to 110.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements 
represent the year ended 31 December 2014. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors 
deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position, continued growth and forecast profitability.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies 
that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, 
are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes:
• Note 3 contingent consideration and remuneration on acquisitions
• Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including the capitalisation of software and development costs
• Note 13 revenue recognition
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has power over the investee, exposure or rights to 
variable returns and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Accounting for business combinations
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. The 
change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are 
exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus 
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in profit or loss.

Financial Statements Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 85

Strategic Report  
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent amount payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent amount is classified as equity, it 
is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
amount are recognised in profit or loss. Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it shall be treated as a 
cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010
For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection 
with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007. These comprised the 
incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share 
exchange of Simon Nixon’s 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of 
all other shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited from third parties. The acquisition of Simon Nixon’s shares was 
between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction. The 
acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded 
that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. As a result the 
Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than 
fair value at the date of the acquisition. The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited 
was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination 
achieved in stages. This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third 
parties being recognised.
Revenue
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising 
through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that 
the lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer. 
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Cost of Sales
The Group recognises associated costs of internet lead generation in the period that the lead is generated. Costs in respect of 
cashback payments to customers are included in cost of sales.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until 
brought into use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment) 3 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 years
Office equipment 5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date. 86 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at 
least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All 
the Group’s intangible assets (other than goodwill) have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life, is 
reviewed at least at each financial year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships 7 years
Non-compete agreement 4 years
Customer lists 3 years
Technology 3 years
Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and 
services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer 
relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately. Relationships 
with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and 
enhance the reputation of the brand. Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and 
unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value 
less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the 
criteria outlined in IAS 38. Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 87

General

Strategic Report  
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair values of the 
share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes 
model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as 
an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs
The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media. Costs associated with the production of adverts are 
recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group 
in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying. The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an 
expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it 
accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise of interest charged on borrowings, and the unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration. 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. The effective interest rate method is 
then used for subsequent re-measurement of borrowings at amortised cost. The unwind of the discount on contingent 
remuneration is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an interest expense.
Operating leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the relevant lease.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in 
equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 88 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which are 
acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 as a government grant. The credit is recognised 
once a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.
Reserve for own shares 
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans. In connection with these, shares in the Company 
are held by an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). The assets and liabilities of the EBT are required to be consolidated within these 
accounts as it is deemed to be under de facto control of the Group. The assets of the EBT mainly comprise MoneySuperMarket.com 
Group PLC shares, which are shown as a deduction from total equity at cost.
Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and 
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. 
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves (where applicable), as well as 
unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by, where possible, depositing them 
with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk. During the year, the Group made a net repayment of £30m on its 
previous credit facility before entering into a new financing arrangement. The Group was subject to externally imposed quarterly 
covenants on the previous facility during the period based on EBITDA, interest and net debt. During the year and prior to the 
facility being replaced, none of these covenants were breached.
In December 2015, the Group secured a new three-year revolving credit facility for an amount of £100m in committed funds 
provided in equal parts by Lloyds Bank PLC and Barclays Bank PLC with half-yearly covenant testing based on adjusted leverage 
and interest cover ratios. The Group also has an accordion option to apply to the banks for up to an additional £100m of committed 
funds during the first two years of the facility.
This replaced the previous facility provided by Lloyds. The Group has no amounts drawn down from the facility at  
31 December 2015. 
Management of capital focuses around the Group’s ability to generate cash from its operations. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for 
reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period
The Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the 
Group’s results:
• IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’
• IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’
• IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
• IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’
• IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’
• IAS 40 ‘Investment property’
Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and 
therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group. These are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s accounts 
when adopted, except where stated. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 89

IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (2010) – On 28 October 2010, the IASB published a revised version of IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. 
The revised standard retains the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets that were published in 
November 2009 but adds guidance on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. As part of its restructuring of IFRS 
9, the IASB also copied the guidance on derecognition of financial instruments and related implementation guidance from IAS 39 
‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement to IFRS 9’. On 19 November 2011, the IASB issued ‘Mandatory effective date

3. Acquisitions
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
On 21 September 2012, the Group acquired certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis and his company MoneySavingExpert.com. 
Additional amounts of up to £27.0m became payable on the third anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. The amount 
payable depended in part upon the achievement of a number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase 
agreement and was, in part, at the discretion of the Company’s Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration 
as their payment was linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services 
have been provided (the earnout period) as an employment expense. Management estimated the benefit payable by assessing, 
amongst other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase 
agreement. Measurement was inherently subjective due to the nature of the earnout variables and the length and timing of the 
earnout period. During the year £4.8m (2014: £3.9m) has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as an employment expense, and £0.4m (2014: £0.3m) has been recognised as an expense within net finance costs, being the 
unwinding of the discount rate applied. The final payment of £20.6m was paid in November 2015.
OnTrees
On 14 March 2014, the Group acquired the trade and assets of OnTrees for consideration of £1.5m paid in cash. Accordingly £1.5m 
of goodwill has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in relation to the acquisition. OnTrees is a bank 
account and credit card aggregation service provider. 90 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

4. Segmental information
Business segments
In applying IFRS 8 – Operating segments, the Group has disclosed five reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel,  
Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.com. Money, Insurance and Home Services operate under the brand name 
MoneySuperMarket.com, and Travel under the brand name TravelSupermarket.com, however, all four segments are reported 
separately. MoneySavingExpert.com is disclosed as a separate operating segment, with revenue generated by Financial Services 
Net Limited and the shopping and vouchers channel reported within ‘Other’. This disclosure correlates with the information which 
is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment. The Group’s 
costs, finance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, 
with the exception of MoneySavingExpert.com, and therefore have not been allocated between all segments in the analysis below. 
All of the Group revenue of £281.7m (2014: £248.1m) reported in 2015 was generated in the UK.

Reconciliation of the effective tax rate
The tax charge for the year is higher (2014: lower) than the effective standard rate of corporation tax in the UK in 2015 of 20.25%

Reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were 
substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) 
were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly and reduces 
the deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2015 which have been calculated based on the applicable tax rate for the period that the 
timing difference is likely to reverse.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The Company’s own shares held by 
employee trusts are excluded when calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the following basis:
2015 2014
Profit after taxation attributable to ordinary equity holders (£’000) 63,434 52,818
Basic weighted average ordinary shares in issue (millions) 546.3 544.4

As highlighted in Note 2, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the recognition of costs incurred in developing technology 
related intangible assets. This is due to the asset recognition criteria being predicated on future economic benefit flowing to that 
asset. Management are confident however that any spend capitalised satisfies the criteria of IAS38 - Intangible Assets and, where 
relevant, SIC-32 Intangible Assets - Web Site Costs. On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to 
assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 95

General

Strategic Report  
12. Intangible assets continued
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the 
intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation was used as the initial carrying 
value for these assets. Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying 
value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group. At 31 December 2015 the market capitalisation 
exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% 
(2014: more than 100%).
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units (CGU) that represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an 
operating segment as defined by IFRS 8. These CGUs are the five operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and 
MoneySavingExpert.com. The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level. For the original four segments, the goodwill 
was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with £30.7m 
allocated to Insurance, £15.5m to Money, £6.6m to Travel and £2.2m to Home Services. The balances at 31 December 2015 are in 
line with those at 1 January 2009. Goodwill impairment testing for MoneySavingExpert.com has been considered separately from 
the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the 
forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions:
• Cash flows for years 1-3 for each CGU represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2015, and 
are based upon the Group’s approved three year strategic plan incorporating cost of sales, advertising and an allocation of 
overhead costs. The main assumptions underlying the plan relate to visitor volumes, source of visitors, revenue per transaction/
visitor and marketing spend, which incorporate past experience. The forecast assumes continued growth during the course of 
the next three years, driven by new media campaigns, exploitation of the Group’s data asset and further investments made 
during 2015 in the core technology underpinning the Group’s key channels. 
• Cash flows after three years assume no growth. 
• Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations. 
• A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% (2014: 13.5%) has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services 
segments. 
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macro-economic 
environment.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home 
Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% (2014: 100%), and as such, no impairment was identified. No 
reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services 
operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental 
level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and 
consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment. Therefore the cash flows estimated for these segments include all of 
the Group’s forecast revenues and an allocation of the Group’s forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous 
years. In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including 
goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows, which has been calculated with a 
set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets exceeds their carrying value by £709m  
(2014: £656m), and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an 
impairment (2014: same). 96 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements continued
12. Intangible assets continued
Impairment review of MoneySavingExpert.com and OnTrees
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows using the following key 
assumptions:
• Cash flows for the first three years represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2015, and are 
based upon the Group’s approved three year strategic plan. The main assumptions underlying the plan relate to visitor 
numbers, the amount of revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business. The forecast 
assumes an improvement over the next three years, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation. 
• Cash flows after three years assume no growth. 
• Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model. 
• A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% (2014: 16.2%) has been used in the forecast. 
As it is intended for OnTrees to be integrated with MoneySavingExpert.com, the carrying value of goodwill associated with the 
acquisition has been included in the impairment review of this vertical.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by £80.6m (2014: £51m), 
and as such, no impairment was identified. The discount rate would need to increase to 33% (2014: 28%) with all other assumptions 
held constant, to give a value in use of MoneySavingExpert.com’s assets equal to the carrying value. Similarly, a decrease in the 
annual cash flows of £12.9m (2014: £9.0m) with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use equal to the 
carrying value.
Impairment testing of technology related intangible assets
Technology related intangible assets in use by the Group are tested for impairment if there is an indication that the asset may be 
impaired. The Group also conducts annual impairment testing of significant technology related intangible assets under 
development and not yet available for use.
The Group is currently undertaking Project Reset, a significant investment in technology infrastructure to resolve a number of 
issues with legacy systems and to provide a market-leading, cloud enabled technology stack. A supporting element to this project is 
the development of an Electronic Data Warehouse (‘EDW’) to act as a data repository and drive improvements in understanding the 
business and enriching the customer experience.
As the EDW is not yet available for use management have conducted impairment testing as at 31 December 2015. The EDW is 
designed to perform synergistically with Project Reset as part of the technology stack and management have therefore performed 
an investment appraisal on a combination of both projects, although Project Reset is already being amortised by the Group.
The recoverable amount has been based on the present value of future cashflows using the following key assumptions:
• Cash flows over the three year useful economic life of the asset represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as 
at 31 December 2015, and are based upon the Group’s approved budget for 2016 – 2018. 
• The main assumptions underlying the cashflows relate to improvements in conversion and cross buying and changes in costs 
for data hosting facilities and service maintenance contracts and will be driven by exploitation of the Group’s data asset and 
further investments made during 2016 in the final year of the capital investment programme. The cashflows are flexed to 
account for unexpected delays. No impact of the reduction in existing cashflows due to obsolescence of legacy systems if the 
Projects had not taken place is included due to the difficulty in quantifying and attributing this value. 
• Cash flows into perpetuity have not been incorporated into the calculation for prudence, however the asset is expected to 
generate economic benefit for the Group significantly past 2018.
• A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% has been used in the forecast, consistent with the Goodwill impairment testing performed at a 
Group and CGU level.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by £1.0m, and as such,  
no impairment was identified. The value in use calculations have taken into account both prudent assumptions and useful lives and 
exclude cashflows which although difficult to quantify would likely be significant and still no impairment exists.  It is on this basis, 
that management do not consider an impairment to exist at 31 December 2015. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 97

All receivables fall due within one year.
As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, there is an element of subjectivity in 
calculating a revenue accrual as a result of estimating the number of successful applications on the provider’s website in the period 
between the last date of billing and the latest provider data being made available. This revenue accrual can typically represent 
approximately one month’s revenue. The accrued revenue is estimated by considering the volume of clicks that have passed from 
the Group’s websites through to provider websites in the period, the historic conversion of such clicks into completed product 
purchases, and contracted revenue per transaction. From historical experience and post year end confirmation, the Group expects 
any differences between the amounts accrued at year end and those amounts subsequently billed to be not materially different.
At 31 December 2015, trade receivables are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts of £188,000 (2014: £213,000), which 
represents a judgement made by management of which receivables balances are unlikely to be recovered taking into consideration 
the ageing of the debt, evidence of poor payment history or financial position of a particular debtor.

The Group made a net repayment of £30m on its previous bank facility in the year (see note 17). In December 2015, the Group 
secured a new three-year revolving credit facility for an amount of £100m in committed funds provided in equal parts by Lloyds 
Bank Plc and Barclays Bank Plc plus an accordion option to apply to the banks for up to an additional £100m of funds during the 
first two years of the facility. This replaced the previous facility provided by Lloyds. The Group had no amounts drawn down from 
the facility at 31 December 2015. The balance of the up front arrangement fee, totalling £0.5m, is held within prepayments.

As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, an accrual for the cost of sales, such as 
partner revenue share agreements, relating to the revenue accrued at the year end date (see note 13) is included within trade payables.
Contingent remuneration relates to additional amounts of up to £27.0m which became payable on the third anniversary of the 
completion of the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com. The amount payable depended in part upon the achievement of a 
number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement and at the discretion of the Company’s 
Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separately to the business combination as remuneration 
as their payment was linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services 
have been provided (the earnout period) as an employment expense. Management estimated the benefit payable by assessing, 
amongst other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase 
agreement. During the year £4.8m (2014: £3.9m) has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an 
employment expense, and £0.4m (2014: £0.3m) has been recognised as an expense within net finance costs, being the unwinding 
of the discount rate applied. The final payment of £20.6m was paid in November 2015.

Deferred tax liability at 31 December 7,627 7,754
The above deferred tax liability relating to the Goodwill of MoneySavingExpert.com is due to the amortisation of this balance  
within the individual accounts of the Company which are prepared under a different accounting framework. The recognition of a 
deferred tax liability within these consolidated accounts is to reflect the tax benefit already claimed by the Group on the Goodwill 
balance shown. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 99

Deferred tax liabilities arose from the creation of the intangible assets upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited by the Company, and the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com. Deferred tax assets arise on share option schemes 
based on the expected tax deduction on vesting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the applicable tax rate 
enacted at the balance sheet date of 19%.

The Group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan under which conditional nil cost awards of ordinary shares in the Company have 
been made to certain Directors and employees of the Group, and an HMRC approved Save As You Earn scheme (Sharesave) eligible 
to all employees (see note 18).
17. Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows movements 
in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax profit of £167,000 (2014: 
£99,000) based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 2015. At the balance sheet date, £16.7m 
was invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most invested with any one bank.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties as a means of mitigating risk of financial loss 
from default. The Group’s exposure is continuously monitored by the credit control team and finance management.
Of the top 75% of the Group’s providers by revenue, approximately 50% (2014: 50%) of these are UK quoted companies with the 
remainder being a mixture of larger UK independent companies and overseas owned or quoted companies. At the balance sheet 
date, the five largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted for 12% (2014: 15%) of the total trade receivables balance of 
£27,963,000 (2014: £27,526,000) and the largest individual balance was £1,865,344 (2014: £2,160,876).
Fair values
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially 
different from their carrying value. The valuation method for the Group’s financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost. There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows. Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risks, are set 
out below:

During the year, a net repayment of £30m was made against the facility with Lloyds Bank Plc that had a maturity date of 30 
September 2016.
In December 2015, the Group secured a new three-year revolving credit facility for an amount of £100m in committed funds 
provided in equal parts by Lloyds Bank Plc and Barclays Bank Plc. This replaced the previously facility provided by Lloyds.
Interest would be payable on the new facility at a rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate based on the adjusted leverage of 
the Group. 
The Group also has an accordion option to apply to the banks for up to an additional £100m of committed funds during the first 
two years of the facility.  Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 101

Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 per ordinary share to each eligible employee free 
of charge. If an employee left within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares were forfeit; between one and two years of 
listing, 50% were forfeit; between two and three years of listing, 20% were forfeit; and after three years of listing, none were forfeit. 
948,184 shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan scheme in 2007. On 31 July 2010 eligible employees became entitled to 
receive their allocation of free shares. 17,190 (2014: 33,225) shares have been withdrawn from the trust by employees during the 
period and a further 45,037 remain held in trust (2014: 62,227).

total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of the Company relative to a comparator group of defined companies.
1 The figures for the awards made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 are the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full, representing 150% of the actual 
awards made. The figures for the 2015 awards are equal to the awards made as the options vest at a maximum of 100%.
Sharesave scheme
During 2012, the Group established an HMRC approved scheme available to all employees. The scheme allows employees to save 
an amount of their net pay into a savings account each month, and at the end of the three-year period, choose to either receive 
back their savings or use them to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a discounted exercise prise. The exercise price for the 
2012 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 107.6p per share. On 2 November 2015 the options become exercisable, enabling participants 
to buy shares at the exercise price of 107.6p. The market price of a share on 2 November 2015 was 335.5p.
During 2013, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the schemes 
established in 2012. The exercise price for the 2013 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 137.5p per share.
During 2014, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the schemes 
established in 2012 and 2013. The exercise price for the 2014 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 149.5p per share.
During 2015, the Group established a further HMRC approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the schemes 
established in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The exercise price for the 2015 Sharesave scheme was fixed at 264.0p per share. 102 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (the Company) is a company limited by shares and incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) as issued in August 2014.  The presentation currency of these Financial 
Statements is sterling.  All amounts in the Financial Statements have been rounded to the nearest £1,000. These Financial 
Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit/loss 
after tax for the Company was £197,112,000 (2014: loss of £10,468,000) which included dividends received of £200,000,000 (2014: 
£Nil ).
In the transition to FRS 102 from old UK GAAP, the Company has made no measurement and recognition adjustments. 
FRS 102 grants certain first-time adoption exemptions from the full requirements of FRS 102.  The following exemptions have been 
taken in these Financial Statements:
• Business combinations – Business combinations that took place prior to transition date have not been restated.
The Company is the ultimate Parent undertaking of the Group and also prepares Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU and are available to the public and may be obtained from MoneySuperMarket House, St. David’s Park, Ewloe, Flintshire, CH5 
3UZ. In these Financial Statements, the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity for the purposes of this FRS and has 
applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures: 
• Cash Flow Statement and related notes; and
• Key Management Personnel compensation. 
As the Consolidated Financial Statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under 
FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• Certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 Share Based Payments; and,
• The disclosures required by FRS 102.11 Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues in respect of 
financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Financial Statements. 
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting 
principles that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements 
made, are described in more detail in the accompanying notes:
• Note 4 – Contingent consideration and remuneration
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 107

1. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of trade and assets, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given 
over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The amounts are capitalised and written off on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic life, which is five years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the date of acquisition. Where this can be 
measured reliably after initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. All of the Company’s intangible assets have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such 
they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer lists 3 years
For accounting purposes, customer lists have been identified separately. Customer lists allow the Company to undertake targeted 
marketing activities.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore 
reflected in the Company Financial Statements.  In particular, the trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited 
and credited directly to equity.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the 
awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards 
were made. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest. Subsidiaries 
are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees. The fair value of the 
recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements. Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent 
differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax 
charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred 
tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

On 21 September 2012, the Company purchased trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis for an initial consideration of £64.5m.

the Company. In addition, a contingent amount of up to £27.0m, payable in part against the achievement of certain non-financial 
metrics and in part at the discretion of the Company Board.

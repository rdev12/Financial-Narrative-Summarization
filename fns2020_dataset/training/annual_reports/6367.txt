Chairman’s statement
Putting strong foundations 
in place
John Connolly
Chairman
“ This is my second chairman’s statement in a G4S 
annual report and it is fair to say that it marks the 
completion of a year no less challenging than my 
fi rst. 2013 was a year during which the group 
underwent a great deal of change, at both board 
and senior management level, and also in some 
of the ways we conduct our business.”

A YEAR OF CHANGE
2013 was always going to be a year of change. Some board changes 
involving executive and non-executive directors had been planned 
and the foundations for those changes had been laid in 2012. 
Nick Buckles, who had been chief executive of the group since 2005, 
stepped down as CEO in May. He was succeeded by Ashley Almanza, 
a high quality, respected executive with extensive international business 
experience, who became group CEO  on 1 June 2013. Mr Almanza had 
joined the group earlier in the year as CFO following the retirement of 
Trevor Dighton from that role.
In May, the UK Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”) announced concerns in 
relation to billing practices on our electronic monitoring contracts in 
England and Wales and commenced a review of all MoJ contracts held 
by G4S. At the same time, the Cabinet Offi ce initiated a review of all 
our major UK Government contracts – the Cross Government Review. 
In response to the concerns raised by the MoJ, we appointed an 
independent law fi rm and external accountants to look into the matter 
on behalf of the board. We also co-operated with the MoJ and Cabinet 
Offi ce reviews. Both the MoJ review and the Cabinet Offi ce review 
have now been completed and we reached settlement of claims raised 
in relation to electronic monitoring and two other contracts in England. Strategic report
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 3 
The UK Government is one of the group’s largest customers and so 
repairing the relationship and rebuilding our reputation, particularly in 
the UK market, has rightly been at the forefront of the work of the 
executive team and of the board. This will take time and forms part 
of a wider transformation plan launched by the group CEO, which 
includes organisational and process changes designed to strengthen 
customer focus, governance and contract management and control. 
This transformation process is something which the UK Government 
has been keen to see, but it is important to stress that it is something 
which was already in progress and not just in the UK. 
SO WHAT CHANGED IN 2013?
We welcomed fi ve new members to the board during the year. 
Three of them are non-executive directors: Adam Crozier and Paul 
Spence, who joined the board in January, and Tim Weller, who joined 
in April; whilst Bo Lerenius and Lord Condon retired from the board 
in June. There were also changes to the executive board members. In 
addition to Nick Buckles' departure in May, Trevor Dighton stood down 
as CFO at the end of April and left the board in June. Ashley Almanza 
joined on 1 May as CFO before taking on the role of chief executive 
offi cer from 1 June. Himanshu Raja was appointed CFO in October. 
In a fairly short space of time the make-up of the board has changed 
signifi cantly, so it has been important to ensure that it retains the right 
combination of knowledge of the group as well as expertise which is 
relevant to the business. I believe we have a board which is diverse in 
composition and well suited to the task; covering a broad spectrum in 
terms of professional background, experience, nationality and gender.
As announced previously, we undertook a thorough review of the 
group’s risk management function and systems in the fi rst half of 2013. 
The Risk Committee reviewed the fi ndings of the review, and 
implemented a number of recommendations. The Risk Committee 
was constituted as a full board committee in 2013 to strengthen 
support to the board in discharging its responsibilities regarding the 
maintenance of a framework of effective controls to enable risk to be 
assessed and managed. The review process also led to important 
changes to the risk function and the implementation of a new risk 
management framework described in more detail on pages 36 to 41 
of the Strategic Report. In addition, the Risk Committee reviews and 
reports to the board on the risk aspects of major developments that 
affect the group and major contracts which the group enters into. 
As reported in the CEO’s review, we have embarked upon a group-
wide transformation responding to the signifi cant issues identifi ed over 
the last 18 months as the new executive team set the business on 
track for future profi table growth. This plan has embraced a bottom 
up business and strategy review bringing in a wide range of new 
senior executives in key roles, restructuring a number of businesses, 
a portfolio review of the group’s businesses and a comprehensive 
review of fi nancials and fi nancial disciplines. Importantly the board 
approved management’s extensive proposals for new processes 
and disciplines emphasising our key values around customer focus 
and integrity. This part of the transformation along with the above 
mentioned emphasis on risk management will contribute to meeting 
the requirements of our key UK customer, UK Government, around 
corporate renewal.
We have taken on board the lessons we have learned from the 
challenges of 2013 and a great deal of effort continues to be focused 
on ensuring that we have the right people and the appropriate 
systems and processes in place to ensure the group’s long-term success. 
I believe we are on the right track.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
The group operates in many parts of the world and continues to 
provide critical services to thousands of customers to the highest 
standards. This underlying strength of the business was refl ected in 
the company’s performance for 2013. Underlying revenue growth of 
5.8% was underpinned by 16% growth in emerging markets. 
Cash generated by continuing operations increased by 36%. 
T o strengthen the group's fi nancial position, we raised approximately 
£343 million net via a placing of new shares in August. T ogether with a 
disposals programme which has, to date, generated £124 million, and 
a strong focus on cash fl ow management, this will enable us to reduce 
our debt and to invest in sustainable, profi table growth.
We have a clear strategic plan and the board believes that the 
business has signifi cant growth opportunities and positive prospects. 
The directors therefore propose a fi nal dividend of 5.54p (DKK 0.4954) 
per share, payable on 13 June 2014. With an interim dividend of 3.42p 
(DKK 0.2972) per share paid on 18 October 2013, the total dividend 
for the year will amount to 8.96p per share, the same as for 2012.
On behalf of the board I would like to thank the 618,000 employees 
who make up the group for their hard work and dedication in 2013 
and their focus on doing what they do well. It is with confi dence that 
I look forward to capturing the value in 2014 of all the groundwork 
that has been done in 2013.

Chief Executive Offi cer’s review
Focused on sustainable, 
profi table growth
Ashley Almanza
Group Chief Executive Offi cer
A YEAR OF CHANGE
I was delighted to join G4S in May 2013 and to take up the role of 
group CEO in June. In my fi rst few months, I travelled around the group, 
meeting senior managers and colleagues working in different regions 
and at many levels in our organisation and I also had the opportunity 
to visit some of our operations and customers. This confi rmed my view 
that G4S has considerable unrealised potential.
In order to address that potential in a focused and disciplined way, 
we conducted a strategy and business review, evaluating our position 
and prospects in each of our key markets around the world. While the 
review confi rmed the strength of our global market positions, it also 
identifi ed the need for wide ranging changes which, over time, we 
expect to transform the group’s ability to deliver sustainable, 
profi table growth.
“ This has been an extremely challenging year for G4S. 
We have taken clear action to address long-standing 
issues and have introduced wide-ranging changes 
to strengthen our business. We can now look to the 
future with increasing confi dence, focusing on the 
growing demand for G4S services that underpins 
our plans to deliver sustainable, profi table growth.” Strategic report
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 5 
GROUP STRATEGY
G4S is the world’s leading global, integrated security company, 
specialising in the provision of security products, services and solutions 
to customers across six continents.
Our strategy is market led – everything begins with the customer. 
We seek to understand our customers’ strategic and commercial 
objectives and from there we design and deliver solutions which 
support those objectives. Our aim is simple and clear; it is to create 
sustainable shareholder value through the consistent delivery of 
excellence in three areas: customer service, operational performance 
and fi nancial management.
As noted above, the strategic review we conducted in 2013 identifi ed 
the need for wide-ranging changes which we have captured in the 
form of a number of strategic priorities. I’m pleased to report that 
progress has been made in each of these areas:
Strategic focus and portfolio management
At the start of the year we were operating in more than 125 countries 
with several lines of business in each country. By assessing the strategic 
fi t, performance and prospects of each of these businesses, we 
identifi ed 35 businesses which required action to be taken to realise full 
value for shareholders, through turn-around, restructuring or disposal. 
As a result, we are actively managing the group’s portfolio, divesting a 
number of non-core businesses, and have generated cash proceeds of 
£124 million to date. Our work in this area continues and, subject to 
value accretive terms being achieved, we may make further disposals.
Organic investment
Our review concluded that we were under-investing in organic 
growth and technology and innovation. The group is now investing an 
additional £15 to £20 million in 2014 to strengthen sales and business 
development capability and to extend our technology and innovation 
across the group – both important catalysts for future growth.
Balance sheet fl exibility
Given the scale and quality of our organic growth opportunity and the 
level of net debt at the start of the year, we raised £343 million through 
the successful placing of 140.9 million new shares. 
Capital discipline and Risk management
The group’s capital allocation and contract review processes have been 
strengthened to ensure that all investment opportunities compete for 
capital in a single ‘pool’ and are evaluated against a stringent set of 
economic and risk criteria.
People
Our review identifi ed the need to strengthen our resource and 
capability in a number of key areas of the business. Over the past nine 
months, we have signifi cantly strengthened our senior management, 
with 28 new appointments to the global leadership team. 
Group values
Our group values underpin the reputation and long-term value of the 
group. We have updated and reinforced awareness and understanding 
of our group values to ensure that we conduct our business to the 
highest standards. We are enhancing health and safety across the group 
by standardising safety management systems and embedding health and 
safety objectives in individual performance contracts. 
Competitive strengths
Our review concluded that our competitive position needed to be 
strengthened in a number of key markets. During the second half of 
the year we established major restructuring programmes, with detailed 
plans to invest £68 million over 2013 and 2014 and these are now 
being implemented. We expect the economic, fi nancial and 
performance benefi ts to be realised over the next 12 to 36 months.
Cost leadership
We recognised the growing importance of cost leadership and 
following systematic benchmarking we established a number of 
effi ciency programmes. These include focus on direct labour effi ciency, 
organisational effi ciency, vehicle route planning and telematics, IT 
standardisation, procurement and shared services.
Performance management
We re-defi ned our performance measures and incentives, putting in 
place measures and performance management processes which focus 
on customers’ needs, sustainable profi t and cash fl ow. I believe this 
provides clear and strong alignment between management priorities 
and shareholder value.
While we still have much to do, I have been enormously encouraged by 
the positive engagement from colleagues across the group who have 
embraced these changes and demonstrated extraordinary commitment 
to our customers and to G4S. I’m grateful for their skill and dedication, 
which remain critical to our success.

on the safety of our colleagues and those around us. This is 
supported by a number of key safety initiatives and campaigns 
designed to increase awareness of health and safety matters, 
learn from best practice and prevent health and safety incidents.
See pages 44 and 45 for further information on health and 
safety initiatives. 6 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Demand for our services remained strong in 2013, particularly in 
emerging markets where our revenue rose by 16%.
Underlying profi t before interest, tax and amortisation (PBITA) was 
£442 million and cash generated by operations increased by 36% to 
£460 million, primarily refl ecting improved working capital management 
which is described in more detail in the chief fi nancial offi cer’s review. 
Our emerging market businesses in Africa, Latin America, Asia and the 
Middle East, converted strong revenue growth into very strong profi t 
progression and underlying PBITA from these businesses rose by 25% 
to £216 million.
Our developed market businesses posted PBITA of £270 million as 
our businesses in Europe, UK and Ireland suffered from a weak trading 
environment, unsatisfactory service delivery in some areas and an 
uncompetitive cost structure. In the US, our sales in technology and 
secure solutions were adversely impacted by cuts in Federal 
government spending. We have established restructuring programmes 
in all of these businesses and, as previously mentioned, made a provision 
for £68 million to cover the cost of these programmes.
Having performed an extensive review of our UK Government 
contracts we were pleased to conclude a settlement agreement with 
the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). Under this agreement we will refund 
approximately £96 million for amounts overbilled on three contracts 
and will compensate the UK tax payer for £12.5 million costs incurred 
by the UK Government. We believe that the settlement, together with 
other actions we are taking, will help us to maintain our position as 
a strategic supplier to the UK Government. 
During the year, we conducted a comprehensive fi nancial review of 
our assets and liabilities and major contracts. These reviews, together 
with the MoJ settlement and our restructuring programmes, resulted 
in a £386 million charge to profi ts during 2013. This contributed to 
a net loss of 24.9 pence per share and to a reduction in the book 
value of the group's net assets from £1,231 million to £919 million. 
Having completed these reviews, we now have a solid baseline against 
which we can measure our progress.
The resulting total PBITA for the year was £56 million (2012: 
£364 million). Underlying EPS was 14.7p against 15.8p in 2012 and 
total loss per share was 24.9p, compared with earnings per share of 
2.9p in 2012. 
The group’s share placing, cash proceeds from portfolio disposals and 
improved operating cash fl ow all helped to offset investment and other 
demands on our cash fl ow and we ended the year with net debt of 
£1.5 billion compared with £1.8 billion at the start of the year.
HEAL TH AND SAFETY
During 2013, fi fty-fi ve colleagues lost their lives in the line of duty, 
principally as a result of attacks by third parties and road traffi c 
accidents. Their loss is deeply felt by their families and their colleagues 
and is a matter of great concern for everyone at G4S. This has caused 
us to re-double our efforts to mitigate the risks faced each day by 
many of our colleagues. The Group Executive team is leading a 
programme to strengthen safety leadership and safety practices 
across the group, including:
 – Critical country reviews: conducting detailed assessments and 
developing mitigation plans in those countries and operations 
where we have identifi ed the greatest risks. 
 – Establishing a new group wide standard for health and safety 
management systems.
 – Health and safety resource: We made a number of new 
appointments across the group and at the beginning of 2014 we 
had 110 dedicated health and safety professionals, assisting us to 
reduce health and safety risks.
 – Safety leadership training and awareness is now mandatory for all 
senior managers. In addition, each member of the Group Executive 
team (and each of their teams) has specifi c health and safety 
performance objectives in 2014.
 – In support of our health and safety programme, we have established 
a new group value called Safety First.
We work in an inherently hazardous industry and health and safety is 
an enduring priority for me and my management team. Our deepest 
desire is to see every employee return to his or her family unharmed 
at the end of each day and we will always remain committed to 
that objective.

GROUP V ALUES
We updated and strengthened our group values, particularly in light of 
events surrounding our electronic monitoring contracts with the UK 
Ministry of Justice which are being investigated by the Serious Fraud 
Offi ce (SFO). We commissioned an independent review of these 
contracts by a global law fi rm which has found no evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing. We have also cooperated with the SFO to support its 
work. With strong sponsorship from the Group Executive team, 
we are rolling out a programme in 2014 which is designed to 
strengthen understanding of, and compliance with, our group values. 
This programme addresses the values described opposite and includes 
training for senior managers and specifi c objectives in their 2014 
performance contracts.
We developed and launched a new human rights policy and guidance 
for managers in 2013. Given the services we provide and the 
sometimes challenging environments in which we work, this was 
a signifi cant priority for the Group Executive. 
Every two years, we conduct a group-wide management and employee 
survey. Feedback from our workforce is an important element of our 
management process and in 2013, 384,000 colleagues responded to 
our global employee survey, providing us with a rich source of 
information about the business and our people which we are able to 
use in developing our plans and employee engagement programmes.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the group is positive. There is strong demand for G4S’ 
services across the world, particularly in emerging markets, and we 
have a clear and focused strategy to address this demand. 
We have taken clear action to address long-standing issues and have 
introduced wide-ranging changes to strengthen our business. We can 
now look to the future with increasing confi dence, focusing on the 
growing demand for G4S’ services that underpins our plans to deliver 
sustainable, profi table growth. That confi dence is refl ected in the board’s 
recommendation to maintain the dividend.

MARKET AND STRA TEGY
Care & justice services delivers more than 
10% of secure solutions revenue. While the 
care & justice services market is concentrated 
primarily in the UK, US, Australia and 
New Zealand, we see a number of countries 
exploring the possibility of outsourcing these 
services to the private sector.
The market structure is typically 
consolidated on the supply side with 
a small number of providers. Larger 
companies are usually better equipped 
to deliver such highly specialised 
services.

Leveraging our capabilities 
worldwide
We have a truly global business with established market 
positions in developed markets and strong positions in rapidly 
growing emerging markets. Our emerging markets businesses 
account for 37% of group sales today and this proportion is 
expected to increase in the future. Overall, we believe that the 
scale and quality of the global market opportunity supports 
organic growth potential of around 5% to 8% per annum for 
the foreseeable future.
We invest in developing security services in sectors where 
security and safety are strategically important to customers – 
such as ports, mining, oil and gas and aviation. Through our 
investment in these sectors we have seen combined revenues 
increase over 23% during the year and these have more 
than doubled since 2009 to over £1 billion in 2013. We are 
now working to further embed this sector expertise

Looking at the materiality of contribution (growth, PBITA, 
cash generation and turnaround potential), we identifi ed 35 
businesses which required action to be taken to realise full value 
for shareholders through turn around, restructuring or disposal. 
We have made good progress, selling or closing six businesses 
and restructuring three during 2013 and early 2014. In the 
process, together with the sale of the Canada cash solutions 
and Colombia secure archiving businesses we generated net 
proceeds of £124 million. We expect further progress will 
be made in 2014 with the remaining businesses which are 
under review. 
By actively managing our business portfolio, we can ensure that 
we maintain our strategic focus – deploying our capital and best 
people to the best opportunities (see CEO review page 4).
We are also strengthening the link between performance and 
reward (see Directors' remuneration report pages 64 to 72). 
The group’s budget is set in the context of the longer-term 
business plan which supports our strategy. From December 
2013, each of our senior managers across the group has a

In Africa revenues grew 12% and organic growth was 7%. PBITA 
increased 30%, benefi ting from overhead effi ciency and restructuring 
programmes.
The acquisition of Deposita in January 2013 and the addition of 
CASH360™ devices and ATM engineering services to our cash 
solutions business in South Africa have enabled us to sell 
comprehensive end-to-end solutions in that market. We are now 
positioned as the market leading cash solutions business in South Africa 
and are able to deploy this capability into African and other markets.
Across the region, new contracts won include the Port of Tangiers in 
Morocco, Anglogold in Ghana, Tenke Mining in DRC, a FM contract 
with Rio Tinto and a secure solutions contract with the United Nations 
in Southern Sudan.
The group has strong market positions across Africa and a healthy 
product portfolio to support sales in 2014, especially in the areas 
of cash management, manned security and technology solutions. 
The bidding pipeline in Africa is diverse and includes sectors such as 
fi nancial services, mining, embassies and other government agencies, 
with increasing numbers of both multi-country and larger scale bids. 
The region is continuing its restructuring programme into other parts 
of Africa in 2014 and is recruiting additional talent to ensure the region 
has the capacity to address the market opportunities.

Revenue growth in Asia Middle East was very strong at 18% and PBITA 
increased 24%, refl ecting a greater contribution from our care & justice 
services businesses in Australia and New Zealand, improved profi tability 
in our risk services businesses in Iraq and Afghanistan and a strong 
profi t improvement across the Middle East.
Revenue growth accelerated in the second-half of the year due partly 
to a step-up in service volumes at the Manus Island processing centre. 
Following the Australian elections held in September 2013 and the 
change in government, we were advised that the Manus Island contract 
would end in March 2014. We won demining and risk management 
contracts to service a number of international oil companies in Iraq 
and won or started a number of secure solutions contracts in the 
UAE for key customers including the Abu Dhabi Education Council, 
Etisalat, Formula 1, the Road Transport Authority and Dubai airport.
We began investing in our technology sales and delivery capability in 
the Middle East so that we are able to deploy our proven products 
and expertise in delivering comprehensive electronic security solutions 
to clients. Our business in Saudi Arabia won important contracts in 
the banking, ports and real estate sectors. Across the region we are 
systematically reviewing organisational structures and business 
processes. This review is well advanced in India, the largest country 
in the region, and is enabling us to streamline operations, reduce 
layers of management and overhead and to invest in sales and 
operational capability.

23% despite economic challenges in the region, including a slow down 
in economic growth in Brazil, with a rigorous price increase programme 
to mitigate infl ation and government mandated wage increases. 
Following the appointment of a new Regional President, Martin Alvarez, 
in October 2013 we have continued to build management capacity 
across the region.
Organic revenue growth was 11% with a number of contract wins 
in the ports, car manufacturing, transportation, fi nancial services,

Our European management team has recently been strengthened 
with the appointment of Graham Levinsohn as Regional CEO, with 
effect from November 2013.
In Europe revenue declined by 1.6% driven by challenging market 
conditions primarily in secure solutions in the Netherlands and in 
Eastern Europe, with growth in Western Europe secure solutions 
and cash solutions offset by declines in most Eastern European markets. 
PBITA was 15% lower, adversely impacted by wage infl ation and by 
the closure of 23 prisons and other cost reductions by the Ministry of 
Justice in the Netherlands. During 2014 we will be seeking to improve 
alignment between salary and price increases in Eastern Europe.
In the fourth quarter, we accelerated our restructuring programme to 
reduce our cost structure and strengthen our competitive positions in 
a number of key markets. The programme includes the rationalisation 
of management and back-offi ce structures and over the course of 2013 
and 2014 we plan to invest £23 million in the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Greece, Finland and other countries.
The region has early revenue momentum into 2014, with new contract 
wins and solid customer retention. Secure solutions contract wins 
include contracts for Charleroi airport in Belgium and Google in 
Finland, partly offsetting the loss of a Finnish retail customer. In January 
2014, we renewed a nine year cash solutions contract with the 
Dutch Railways.
In care & justice services, our pipeline is strong and our Austrian 
business began a £5 million per annum immigration contract for 
15 years in December 2013. We also won an electronic monitoring 
contract in Bulgaria and an Agip-Shell security contract in Kazakhstan.
Our cash solutions businesses in Europe performed well overall. 
A strong performance was achieved in Belgium and in the Netherlands 
including a number of new retail contracts and CASH360™ gains 
offset by contract losses in the fi rst-half of the year in Finland and the 
Baltics. G4S cash solutions supported the smooth introduction of the 
Euro in Latvia towards the end of the year. In January 2014, G4S won 
the majority of Geldservice Nederland’s (GSN) cash solutions business 
in the Netherlands for fi ve years, valued at c€50m per annum. GSN 
serves the major banks in the Netherlands and is their provider of 
cash counting, handling and logistics, including the maintenance of 
cash devices.
Revenues for the security systems business, which accounts for 
around 20% of European secure solutions revenues, remained broadly 
in line with 2012. Systems contract wins include a maintenance 
contract for the European parliament in Luxembourg and a major 
systems contract with Lego in Hungary. The region has an increased 
focus on security and cash solutions technology, with the aim of 
deploying our proven technology solutions from elsewhere in the 
group into key European markets.
The region made good progress on its portfolio review, selling its 
Slovakian cash solutions business in 2013. The sale of our Norway 
business for £29 million was also agreed in 2013 and completed in 
January 2014.
We have a diverse European contract pipeline with areas such as 
ports, aviation, transportation and healthcare being particularly strong. 
Our investment in sales and business development capability is 
designed to sustain and strengthen this pipeline over time. 32 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Revenues in the North America region grew 0.4% and organic growth 
overall was broadly unchanged with 2% growth in US commercial 
security and 10% growth in youth services offset by US Federal 
sequestration reducing new and additional federal government work 
in secure solutions and in the G4S Technology business.
Against a background of uncertain US Government spending, 
commercial contract wins remain robust with major contract awards 
from Amazon, Bank of New Y ork, Simon Malls, Navistar, Liberty Mutual, 
MetLife, Georgia Pacifi c, the Millstone (Dominion) nuclear power 
plant in the US and more recently T oronto Hydro, Imperial Oil, and 
PTI in Canada.
PBITA for the region was 18% lower, impacted by sales mix, with lower 
revenues in the technology businesses (Federal spending impact) and 
reduced border patrol volumes. Results in 2012 also benefi ted from 
one-off protest protection work for banks. Our US technology business 
has been restructured to increase sales in the commercial sector. 
In the United States we continued to see increasing interest in our 
retail cash solutions product, CASH360™, with two small contracts 
awarded recently.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the US has been 
delayed for large businesses. We do not expect it to have a material 
impact on G4S as the majority of our US employee healthcare plans 
are already broadly compliant.
Overall, the North American business has a strong contract pipeline 
with over £500 million in near-term opportunities across all sectors 
and a visible long-term contract pipeline of around £1.2 billion.
Good progress was made in the region on rationalising the portfolio. 
We sold our cash solutions business in Canada for £60 million in 
January 2014.

We have reorganised the UK & Ireland region into market-facing 
business units of cash solutions, secure solutions, central government 
solutions, facilities management and outsourced services and we 
continued to make a number of new management appointments 
to senior line and function roles.
There was revenue growth of 2% in UK & Ireland, with organic growth 
of 1%, principally due to good growth in the police outsourcing and 
utilities businesses offset by lower revenues in Ireland and the UK cash 
solutions business.
PBITA was 5.4% lower due to revenue mix, particularly from lower 
revenues in the UK cash solutions business. As discussed previously, 
signifi cant restructuring programmes are being implemented in UK 
cash solutions, Ireland cash solutions and secure solutions covering 
branch networks (Ireland and UK cash solutions), organisational design 
and operational labour effi ciency. Overhead headcount was reduced 
by more than 5% in the second-half of 2013. The cost of restructuring 
is £34 million and is expected to pay back within the next two years.
UK contracts won during 2013 include being selected by the 
Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) to manage the Child 
Maintenance Options Contact Centre Service, provision of security 
at the G8 Summit in June, Pennine Hospital facilities management, and 
our fi rst contract to provide secure patient transport services under 
a three-year contract with Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS 
Foundation Trust. Other recent contract awards include Derbyshire 
and Nottinghamshire Police Forensic Medical Services and Avon and 
Somerset police custody suites.
Against the backdrop of a highly competitive commercial security 
market, we won new contracts with key commercial customers such 
as a security contract with Bank of America, a new global framework 
agreement with Shell covering 30 countries and we retained our 
security contract with British Airways. The UK events security business 
successfully supported the UK Police Service of Northern Ireland 
(PSNI) at the G8 Summit held at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in 
June, delivering a range of specialised security solutions.
In cash solutions, we retained important contracts with HSBC and 
Barclays and have expanded our outsourcing partnership with Lloyds 
Banking Group, taking over the management of their Edinburgh cash 
processing centre.
We reached full and fi nal settlement with the UK Government on 
the electronic monitoring contract and two smaller contracts and have 
made signifi cant progress on our programme of corporate renewal 
in the UK. The renewal programme is embedded within our overall 
corporate programme and is not anticipated to give rise to signifi cant 
additional cost.

The secure solutions businesses delivered 6% growth in revenue 
driven by 17% growth in emerging markets and a solid performance 
in developed markets. Trading conditions in some developed markets, 
in particular in Europe, remain challenging and we have begun 
restructuring these businesses to strengthen business performance in 
the medium term. Lower US Federal government spending affected our 
secure solutions and systems businesses and our US systems business 
has been restructured to increase sales in the commercial sector.

Risk management
Managing risk effectively
Our aim is to deeply embed risk management 
disciplines which support effective strategy execution
OUR RISKS
The market sectors in which G4S provides security services present 
unique operational and health and safety risks which must be managed 
effectively in order to provide value to customers and to protect our 
employees. The breadth of countries in which G4S operates, together 
with continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions, also presents 
fi nancial control and commercial risks similar to those of other 
multinational companies.
HOW WE MANAGE OUR RISKS
Our risks are captured in a global risk reporting information system. 
These risks are reviewed and updated twice a year by the operating 
companies. The Group Executive Committee and Board Risk 
Committee review the most signifi cant risks on a regular basis and 
the board regularly reviews the overall impact of these major risks 
on the group’s activities.
WHAT WE DID IN 2013
As announced by the board in September 2012, G4S started a 
thorough review of its risk management processes and systems during 
2013 and will continue to make further improvements during 2014.
During the year the company established a Board Risk Committee and 
created a separate risk management function for the group, appointing 
a group director of risk and programme assurance and a group head of 
risk. These responsibilities were previously undertaken by the group 
head of internal audit. The new Board Risk Committee appointed 
Deloitte to conduct a review of the group’s risk management 
processes and then charged the group director of risk and 
programme assurance to develop a plan to respond to the fi ndings 
and recommendations. During the year, Regional Risk and Audit 
Committees were established to be responsible for assessing risk 
at a regional level and for monitoring the mitigation of risk and 
addressing internal and external audit matters at a regional level. 
WHAT WE WILL DO IN 2014
Regional Risk and Audit Committees will meet quarterly, the fi rst 
meetings having taken place in January 2014. A new approach to 
assessing risks has been defi ned and during 2014 this is being 
implemented across the business, supported by an updated risk 
management information system. This system will better support the 
risk identifi cation, assessment and action tracking process as well as 
providing enhanced risk reporting at all levels of the group. 
As a service business many of our risks stem from the contract bidding, 
mobilisation and service delivery lifecycle. In the fi rst quarter of 2014, 
new processes for contract take-on and on-going assurance will be 
implemented to give greater scrutiny to the delivery of the group’s 
most complex contracts. Based on contract style, complexity and risk 
profi le, these processes will ensure that, at all stages throughout the 
lifecycle, expert challenge, oversight and approval are given at regional, 
group or board level as appropriate. 
Our goal in making these changes is to embed more deeply an effective 
risk management culture to support strategy execution and to provide 
enhanced governance over critical business decisions.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE MODEL
Our operating 
companies identify 
and assess the 
risks to their 
business objectives 
and plan 
appropriate 
mitigating actions. 
These are recorded 
in our group-wide 
risk management 
tool.
Risk and Audit 
Committees in 
each region meet 
quarterly to review 
regional level risks; 
review progress of 
mitigating actions; 
and to review audit 
reports, fi nancial 
control status 
reports, internal 
fi nancial reviews and 
balance sheet 
integrity and any 
accounting 
judgements.
The Executive Risk 
Committee meets 
three times per year 
and considers the 
group’s principal 
residual risks and 
the progress of 
mitigating actions.
The Board Risk 
Committee meets 
three times per year 
to set the group’s 
risk appetite; to 
assess the group’s 
principal residual 
risks; and to assess 
progress on the 
improvements being 
made to enterprise 
risk management.
The Board Audit 
Committee meets 
four times per year 
to ensure that the 
group’s control 
framework is 
operating effectively.
The board has 
the ultimate 
responsibility for 
assuring our risk 
management 
processes. It reviews 
our most critical 
risks and controls, 
either directly or 
through its Risk and 
Audit Committees.

CONTRACT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE MODEL
LINES OF DEFENCE
Based on fi nancial, 
legal, reputational 
and operational 
risk criteria, the 
opportunity is 
referred to the 
region, group or 
board for review 
and approval.
Appropriate 
challenge is given to 
the bid’s customer 
value proposition, 
commercial terms 
and risk mitigation 
strategy . The 
expected risk 
return of the bid 
is assessed before 
approval is given 
or withheld.
Based on the 
complexity and 
risk profi le of 
mobilisation, 
appropriate 
methodologies 
and project 
management 
resources are 
applied. Key 
contractual 
requirements and 
risk mitigation 
strategies are 
mapped to 
accountable 
contract managers.
Based on the 
commercial scale 
and level of risk, 
contracts are 
subject to regular 
on-going scrutiny 
at regional or 
group level.

Group internal audit Board
We employ three lines of defence to control and manage risks across 
the group. The responsibility for the fi rst line sits with the managers of 
our businesses, whether line management or fi nancial support. The 
senior management team within each business is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining appropriate controls across their 
business to ensure the standards expected by the group, our customers 
and other stakeholders are met. The business managers are supported 
by oversight functions at both regional and group level including Risk, 
Finance and Legal which together make up the second line of defence.
The third line is designed to detect or prevent unexpected outcomes 
and comprises the group risk and internal audit functions. T ogether 
these provide independent assurance over the design and operation 
of controls. As part of its annual programme of work, the internal 
audit function conducts regular reviews of risk management processes 
and gives advice and recommendations on how to improve the 
control environment.
Our external auditors provide independent oversight of the 
entire process.

Principal risks
What are the key risks faced by G4S?
During January 2014 the Regional Risk and Audit 
Committees met to agree the regional principal 
residual risks. These meetings were facilitated by 
group risk management and identifi ed the risks to 
each region’s strategic business objectives and to 
on-going business operations. The meetings were 
informed by the country level risks recorded in the 
group’s risk management systems. 
Group risk management and the CFO consolidated 
these risks and identifi ed common themes and 
regional risks which were material to the group. 
These group principal residual risks were reviewed 
and approved by the Executive Risk Committee and 
the Risk Committee of the board. 
The potential impact of each risk was assessed on 
a 1 to 5 scale against fi ve criteria: strategy, fi nancial, 
reputation, service delivery, and health and safety, 
with the highest score being the overall impact. The 
likelihood of each risk over the next year, or to three 
year strategic goals, was also assessed on a 1 to 5 
scale. The risks detailed in the following pages are 
those which in aggregate scored 3.5 or higher on 
both impact and likelihood. Detailed descriptions are 
provided of each risk, its movement since last year, its 
potential impact and the mitigation strategies being 
employed by the group.

CULTURE & VALUES 
There has been a strong 
emphasis from the board, the 
CEO and the group executive 
committee on the importance 
of the company’s values 
underpinning everything we do. 
Progress has been made in this 
area, but reinforcing the core 
values across a diverse and 
globally spread workforce 
takes considerable effort. 
G4S provides security to people, premises and 
valuable assets. In its care & justice services businesses 
it also provides services which interact with detainees, 
victims of crime, those on state assistance, vulnerable 
people and other members of the public. This requires 
our staff to conduct themselves with the utmost 
integrity. We operate in 120 countries around the 
world with a diversity of local and national cultures. 
These factors mean that having a strong set of 
corporate values that unite the organisation, deeply 
embedded in our culture, is of particular importance. 
If we fail to behave in accordance with the high 
standards that we set ourselves there is a risk that 
we will not deliver on our commitment to customers, 
and fail to comply with legislation and international 
standards. We may also compromise the safety and 
security of our employees and the assets or people 
that we are protecting. 
This can lead to penalties, failure to renew contracts 
and ultimately reduced profi tability and damage to our 
global brand and reputation.
We have in place high ethical standards and policies 
which we expect our staff to observe globally and 
these are reinforced through awareness and training 
programmes and monitored through audit, whistle-
blowing and trading reviews. 
Senior managers’ performance contracts and bonuses 
are in part based upon adherence to our values. 
During 2013, our new CEO and the executive 
team has reiterated the importance of our values 
in delivering customer service and sustainable 
shareholder value. During 2014 we will be examining 
our HR processes to ensure that they fully support 
our values; we are refreshing our whistle-blowing 
policy; and we will continue to reinforce the group 
values at every opportunity. Compliance with the 
values is assessed through performance reviews, 
trading reviews, business self-assessments and audit. Strategic report

HEALTH & SAFETY
There has been a heightened 
focus by the board, the CEO and 
the group executive committee 
on the importance of health 
and safety. 
The provision of security services, often in hostile or 
dangerous circumstances across such a broad diversity 
of countries, presents particular health and safety 
challenges. The protection of our staff, people in our 
care and third parties, including the public, is of utmost 
importance. 
The principal health and safety risks are work-related 
attacks and road traffi c accidents. In 2013, 55 (2012: 
59) employees lost their lives. We are committed to 
strengthening our health and safety systems, processes 
and cultures. 
Fatalities and serious injuries to our staff impact not 
only the individuals concerned, but also their families, 
loved ones and other dependents. 
The Group Executive team is leading a programme 
to strengthen safety leadership and safety practices 
across the group, including:
 – Critical country reviews: conducting detailed 
assessments and developing mitigation plans in 
those countries and operations where we have 
identifi ed the greatest risks. 
 – Establishing a new group wide standard for health 
and safety management systems.
 – Health and safety resource: We made a number 
of new appointments across the group and at 
the beginning of 2014 we had 110 dedicated 
health and safety professionals, assisting us to reduce 
health and safety risks.
 – Safety leadership training and awareness is now 
mandatory for all senior managers. In addition, each 
member of the Group Executive team (and each 
of their teams) has specifi c health and safety 
performance objectives in 2014.
 – In support of our health and safety programme, 
we have established a new group value called 
Safety First.
PEOPLE
G4S’ human resource processes 
are well established and effective. 
Nevertheless, there will always 
be challenges in attracting and 
retaining employees. 
We are a people business and we take great care 
to ensure that we employ the best people to deliver 
quality services to our customers. As the largest 
employer listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
employing 618,000 people worldwide, and the largest 
security solutions provider in the world, our customers 
choose G4S because of the level of screening, training, 
integrity and trustworthiness. 
In a global and diverse business such as ours, there 
are risks associated with recruiting, robust screening, 
motivating, developing and training, as well as 
appropriately rewarding and retaining our 
critical talent. 
Failure to recruit and retain key managers and staff 
and to motivate and develop them can impact 
service delivery, customer retention and business 
management, which in turn can adversely affect our 
fi nancial performance. 
We use rigorous recruitment, selection, screening 
and induction processes and standards to ensure that 
we employ the best people, with the right values, 
for the requisite roles. Standards are set by group 
human resources and measured and enforced through 
a combination of regular staff surveys, country 
self-assessments, monitoring of regional and country 
specifi c KPIs and independent audits: all driving 
constant improvements in processes. 
Attracting and developing the right talent is the key 
to our success and we have a process for identifying 
high potential employees and putting in place career 
development plans to promote them into more senior 
positions. We engage our employees through our 
PRIDE model:

BRAND/REPUTATION
The nature of the services we 
provide means that we are often 
in the public eye. However, the 
issues which have arisen around 
a number of our high profi le 
contracts over the last two years 
have undermined the company’s 
brand and reputation, particularly 
as a trustworthy strategic 
supplier to the UK Government. 
The company’s brand is well known and associated 
with high quality security services around the world. 
However, recent events in the UK had an adverse 
impact on our reputation, in particular with the UK 
Government. Furthermore, as detailed in the chief 
executive’s review, our performance under certain 
UK electronic monitoring contracts was referred 
to the Serious Fraud Offi ce (SFO). 
There is a risk that until our reputation is suffi ciently 
repaired and the SFO investigation concluded, our 
sales pipeline could be impacted. The fi rst key step to 
repairing our reputation is rebuilding the confi dence 
of the UK Government in G4S as a strategic supplier. 
There is a risk that the changes we are implementing 
to this end take time to be accepted as suffi cient by 
the UK Government.
We continue to cooperate fully with the SFO 
investigation. In addition, we have an on-going 
programme of corporate renewal. This is supported 
by the broader changes being made across the group 
to leadership, governance and contract management 
and assurance; as well as by the heightened focus on 
corporate values and ethics. In order to ensure timely 
progress this programme is being monitored directly 
by the group executive and the board and being 
independently reviewed by a fi rm of accountants 
on behalf of the UK Government.
At individual region and country level there is a 
strong focus on delivering excellent customer service 
in order to protect and enhance our local brand 
and reputation.
We are investing in the strengthening of our risk 
management, audit and customer service capacity.
MAJOR CONTRACTS
The company’s strategy is to 
provide integrated security 
solutions to customers, which 
often results in taking on more 
complex contracts. The company 
is implementing improvements 
to bid assessment, programme 
management and assurance 
and new contract management 
processes. These will take time 
to bed in. 
The group has a number of long-term, complex, high 
value contracts with multi-national, government or 
other strategic customers. The company’s growth 
strategy includes a greater focus on higher value, 
and more technology-rich services. This will increase 
the complexity and individuality of customer 
requirements and contracts. 
For such contracts there are risks to the group 
accepting onerous contractual terms; mobilising 
contracts well; transitioning effectively from 
mobilisation to on-going contract management; 
delivering to contractual requirements; managing 
complex billing arrangements; managing contract 
change control; and managing sub-contractors.
Failure to ensure effective contract take-on, mobilise 
successfully and manage complex contracts 
effectively throughout their lifecycles can impact 
customer satisfaction, reputation, revenue, cash fl ow, 
and profi tability.
The company has tightened the criteria and level of 
scrutiny for regional and group level legal review of 
complex contracts during the bid cycle. 
The group has implemented a standardised 
approach to project management for complex 
mobilisations in the UK, which will be rolled out 
globally during 2014. External project management 
resource is utilised in cases when insuffi cient internal 
capability is in place. The group is also strengthening 
its processes for bid assessment, contract take-on 
and on-going contract assurance.

DELIVERY OF CORE SERVICE LINES
Our commitment to delivering 
sustainable growth and 
shareholder value is founded 
on delivering on our customer 
commitments. There is a 
continuous focus on this at the 
group executive. In addition, 
through the investments in the 
service excellence centres 
and within the regions and 
countries, we continued to make 
improvements in the processes 
and systems in many of our 
core businesses over the course 
of 2013. 
We deliver our core secure solutions services in 
100 markets and our core secure cash transportation 
services in 61 markets. A number of these businesses 
have been acquired over time, resulting in cultural 
differences, varying degrees of operational maturity 
and a multiplicity of information systems. 
This can create risks around core operational service 
delivery and supporting functions. Failure to meet 
the service delivery requirements of our customers, 
because we have not implemented the right solutions 
or followed appropriate agreed procedures, can 
create risks around cash losses; attacks on our staff, 
subcontractors or third parties; and the non-delivery 
of the service level agreements and KPIs agreed with 
our customers. 
Additional risks relate to business resilience, control 
systems, and the availability of critical systems, facilities 
and people to perform contractually agreed services.
This can lead to fi nancial penalties, and negatively 
impact customer retention and goodwill, to the 
detriment of fi nancial performance.
We have developed the G4S Way, which defi nes 
best practice processes and standards for all aspects 
of service delivery with the aim of improving service 
excellence and margin. The G4S Way is being 
implemented globally across all our businesses. It sets 
out requirements for managing contract take-on 
and mobilisation; completion of risk assessments; 
management of security assignments at customer 
and site levels; and defi nes service delivery KPIs to 
measure compliance. Minimum guidelines have been 
set for key areas such as control room management; 
security offi cer communications; fl eet routing and 
scheduling; resource planning and staff rostering; 
and escalation procedures for duress/attack/
absence situations. 
Recent developments in our secure solutions business 
include deployment of our core operating system, 
Saturn, to effi ciently match our security offi cer 
deployment to customer requirements. In our cash 
solutions business we have put in place a dedicated 
risk management team to ensure robust risk analysis 
and rectifi cation of deviations from our minimum 
standards. Our countries are required to have business 
continuity and crisis management plans in place and to 
test them regularly.
We are also making on-going improvements to 
the effi ciency and effectiveness of supporting and 
control systems.
LAWS & REGULATIONS
The products and services we 
provide are subject to the 
ever-changing legal landscape 
across the many jurisdictions in 
which we operate, requiring 
constant monitoring and 
change to ensure compliance. 
G4S operates in many jurisdictions globally, within 
complex and diverse regulatory frameworks. 
An additional complexity arises from the extra-
territorial reach of some of the legislation to which 
the company is subject.
Risks include increasing litigation and class actions 
especially in the United States; bribery and corruption; 
obtaining operating licences; complying with local tax 
regulations; changes to employment legislation; 
complying with human rights legislation; and new or 
changed restrictions on foreign ownership. Risk also 
arises from new or changing regulations which require 
modifi cation of our processes and staff training. 
The necessary changes to ensure continued 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or 
not being compliant, have far reaching consequences, 
including higher costs from claims and litigation; 
inability to operate in certain jurisdictions, either 
through direct ownership or joint ventures; loss of 
management control; damage to our reputation; and 
loss of customer confi dence. 
Each country in the group puts in place rigorous 
compliance policies, standards and controls, including 
training, to assure adherence to local laws, regulations 
and licence requirements. We review existing policies 
in light of changes to legislation and recent case law. 
The group has good procedures in place to ensure 
that our businesses are complying with anti-bribery 
& corruption legislation, including self-assessments; a 
training and awareness programme for staff in sensitive 
positions; an independent audit of the effectiveness of 
our procedures; and confi dential reporting hotlines.
We build positive constructive relationships with 
governments and related agencies by engaging in 
the legislative process directly and through local trade 
associations. Our aim is to support governments to 
craft legislation that achieves its aims in relation to our 
industry in as effi cient and effective a way as possible.

GROWTH STRATEGY
The group has placed a greater 
emphasis on higher value 
solution development and sales, 
underpinned by technology. It 
will take time to mobilise and 
build the right capabilities to 
deliver this strategy. 
Our growth strategy is to leverage our expertise 
to expand our core service lines into more complex, 
outsourcing areas which increase long-term customer 
partnerships; to focus on organic growth opportunities 
with less reliance on acquisitions; and to leverage 
our expertise in security systems technology across 
key markets.
There are risks that we will fail to optimise our 
product mix; fail to build the sales and solutions 
capability we need; fail to leverage our existing 
expertise and resources into the areas where we 
can best achieve organic growth targets; or that 
we will under-invest or invest in the wrong areas.
Failing to create higher value solutions that 
differentiate us from local competitors could impact 
targeted growth in revenues and margins.
We are investing in sales and business development 
resources to support growth and to strengthen our 
solution selling capability. 
We have established a single capital pool for all key 
investments and have revised our investment approval 
processes to approve only those capital requests 
that demonstrate an appropriate balance of risk and 
return. This is designed to ensure we make the right 
investments to support the strategy. A revised major 
bid assessment process has been implemented which 
will ensure that the key opportunities which underpin 
our growth strategy are properly positioned, 
resourced and managed. 
Rigorous trading and performance reviews for each 
business unit enable us to monitor progress against 
our strategic goals on a periodic basis. Our on-going 
capability review process will ensure we build the right 
skills needed to underpin the delivery of the strategy.
GEO-POLITICAL
Given the wide range of 
countries in which the group 
operates there will always be 
some with a degree of serious 
political instability. We take 
great care with our operations 
in these countries to monitor 
the situation closely and 
respond appropriately. 
We operate in 120 countries across the developed 
and developing world, with wide-ranging government 
and political systems, differing cultural landscapes, and 
varying degrees of rule of law; and within confl ict and 
post-confl ict zones. 
The risk factors range from political volatility, 
revolution, terrorism, military intervention and 
insurgency.
The geo-political risks we face impact us in many 
ways: the health and safety of our staff and customers; 
the continued operation of our businesses; and the 
ability to secure our assets and recover our profi ts.
We have a great deal of experience of operating in 
a wide range of diffi cult territories. We collaborate 
with our local partners and/or agents; conduct 
early risk assessments before and during security 
assignments; have robust operating procedures; and 
work closely with our local and global customers in 
managing the risks of operating in such environments. 
We have a global process for assessing the geo-
political risks of different countries which determines 
the types of customers we will serve and the types 
of services we will provide.

INFORMATION SECURITY
The sophistication of cyber 
hackers increases continuously 
and the heightened high profi le 
reputation of the group in the 
UK in particular make us a 
potential target. 
G4S has an obligation to safeguard the information 
that our customers, partners and employees entrust 
to our care. 
Given G4S' high profi le, we are at risk of cyber and 
physical attack by criminal organisations and individual 
hackers. Whilst we do have strong protection in place, 
the threat is increasing. If an attempt is successful, our 
information systems could be compromised or our 
information disclosed.
A successful attack could result in: censure and fi nes 
by national governments; loss of confi dence in the 
G4S brand and reputation; specifi c loss of trust by 
clients, especially those in government and fi nancial 
sectors; disruption to service delivery and integrity, 
particularly in cash solutions operations.
G4S has cyber security controls in place to protect 
information. 
In 2013, we appointed a group head of information 
security who has developed a strategy to improve 
our information security maturity. This strategy will 
be rolled out across the group to reduce the 
likelihood of a successful attack and to increase the 
ability of G4S to detect and respond to attacks.
CASH LOSSES
Through the work of the service 
excellence centres working with 
the regions, improvements have 
been made to processes and 
systems in many of our cash 
solutions businesses over the 
course of 2013. 
We have cash solutions businesses spread across 
the world responsible for cash held on behalf of our 
customers. We provide cash transportation from one 
site to another in high security vehicles, a range of 
cash management services including secure storage, 
counting, reconciliation and sorting of notes for 
ATMs, a range of ATM services and secure 
international transportation of cash and valuables. 
There are inherent risks in this business related 
to external attacks, internal theft and poor 
cash reconciliation. 
Cash losses can have a major impact for our 
customers and ourselves in respect of loss of profi t, 
increased cost of insurance and health and safety 
considerations for our staff and the public.
Our cash solutions service excellence centre (SEC) 
works in collaboration with the regions to embed 
robust procedures into every cash business to mitigate 
cash losses. Innovative security defence products are 
in use, ranging from pavement box tracking to vehicle 
protection foam and protective pavement boxes. 
All cash transactions are subject to strict authorisation 
limits and we have very tightly controlled cash 
reconciliation procedures to ensure cash is fully 
accounted for and controlled and these procedures 
are subject to constant monitoring and audits. We also 
have a robust process to monitor all cash-related 
incidents through a team of security specialists and 
we ensure that lessons learned are shared through 
the SEC.

Why CSR matters to G4S
CSR is an important differentiator for the group and we fi nd it 
increasingly important to customers as part of their process for 
evaluating and selecting a service partner – particularly given the 
sensitive nature of some of the services which customers require. 
Our approach to CSR provides our customers with confi dence that 
they are working with an organisation which respects laws and cultures, 
has high ethical standards, takes care of its employees and is a reliable 
and dependable partner.
Our CSR strategy
Every two years, we conduct a CSR materiality exercise which helps 
us to assess the current market environment, business challenges and 
most relevant CSR strategies. In 2013, we broadened the scope of this 
exercise to include a representative group of external commentators 
and stakeholders – seeking opinions from investors, NGOs and 
customers, in addition to our internal senior management and board 
members. This ensures that our strategies are aligned to stakeholder 
needs and the objectives of our business.
The process highlighted three core priority areas for 2014 – business 
ethics and anti-corruption, health and safety and human rights. 
Whilst these are our three highest priority and most material issues, 
we continue to focus on all aspects of CSR.
CSR management
Refl ecting the value we place on CSR and on our reputation, our 
CSR Committee has been a full board committee since 2011, 
comprising a number of experienced non-executive directors who 
meet regularly to discuss CSR related matters. The committee is 
chaired by Clare Spottiswoode, a G4S non-executive director who 
has been a member of the CSR committee since 2010. Elements of 
our CSR strategy such as health and safety and human rights are also 
a regular subject for discussion at group executive committee and 
board meetings. 
WHA T WE ARE DOING
Business ethics
T o ensure that our employees understand how they can play their 
part in delivering high ethical standards across the group, we continue 
to reinforce a group-wide ethics code that sets out how we expect 
our employees to behave. The code is supplemented with a business 
ethics policy which provides a more detailed summary of the group’s 
ethical standards of operation. The code and policy are reviewed each 
year, to incorporate evolving legislation 
Human rights
We recognise the growing importance of human rights as a material 
business issue and believe that G4S can play a positive role in 
respecting human rights around the world. Our business can contribute 
positively to the realisation of human rights through the range of 
services we offer to protect people. We also recognise that we have a 
duty to ensure that we are not at risk of violating human rights through 
the services we provide, the customers we work with and the suppliers 
we use and through the fair and appropriate treatment of our own 
employees and others who are in our care.
Increasingly, customers and other key stakeholders are looking to 
companies such as G4S to demonstrate specifi c actions and practices 
which are aligned to internationally recognised human rights 
standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights (2011), the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights 
(2000), and the International Code of Conduct for Private Security 
Service Providers (2010). Our human rights framework aims to bring 
our existing practices into line with these standards and introduce 
new guidelines in areas which are not covered by existing policies 
and practices.
Safeguarding 
our integrity
Integrity is one of the group’s core values. 
Being a responsible business partner, 
employer, customer or supplier is an 
important part of our strategy and forms an 
essential foundation on which we carry out 
our business. 44 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Health and Safety
As one of the world’s largest private employers, working in sectors 
where security and safety present a strategic risk, our responsibility 
to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees is one 
of our highest priorities.
“It is not acceptable to us that any colleague is injured or killed in the 
line of duty.” 
Ashley Almanza, CEO.
We continue to focus on health and safety and have introduced a 
number of important critical review processes and improvements 
to specifi c practices in order to protect our employees in their 
workplace. These will continue to be a major area of focus for the 
group at every level in 2014.

How we’re performing
The most prevalent risks to the health and safety of our employees 
are from work-related attacks and road traffi c incidents. Although the 
total number of work-related fatalities has reduced since 2011, our 
aim is to eliminate them altogether.
During 2013, we have:

In 2013, over 380,000 employees shared their views of working for 
G4S. This represents a 62% response rate, up from 38% in 2011. 
Overall levels of engagement also improved from an average of 80% 
to 82%. Encouragingly, the number of favourable responses to questions 
related to health and safety showed the most positive increase since 
the last survey, although there is clearly a need for substantial further 
improvement. The results for the senior leadership survey were also 
positive, with 81% of senior managers participating and an overall 
favourable score of 83%. 
Priorities for 2014
 – Establish a new group value called Safety First – to ensure absolute 
focus on health and safety in everything we do

for our global leadership management group

on G4S policies and practices

For further details of our Climate Action Programme, please refer to 
our 2013 CSR Report or visit www.g4s.com/cap
What we’re doing
Since 2008 we have used WBCSD
*
 and WRI GHG
**
 protocols to 
measure our Scope 1 and 2 emissions – vehicle fl eet, fuel, refrigerants 
and electricity usage for G4S businesses over which we have fi nancial 
and operational control. In addition we have measured Scope 3 
emissions from employee business air travel.
The businesses that reported data in our 2013 GHG measurement 
represent 94.5% of the group’s operations, across an 11-month period. 
This level of measurement, including each of our main service types, 
allows us to calculate reliably the total GHG emissions for 100% of 
the group over a period of 12 months.
How we’re performing
The G4S total carbon footprint, extrapolated to 100% of the business 
equates to some 559,000 t/CO
2
e. Since we launched our climate action 
strategy in 2009, our carbon intensity has decreased by 23.5% per £m 
of revenue – exceeding our stated target of 20%. This reduction 
translates to a real reduction of 4.9% in carbon emissions against a 
24.4% growth in the business during the same period, much of which 
includes carbon emissions from services which our customers have 
outsourced to G4S. This is a positive achievement which recognises the 
efforts made to increase the energy and fuel effi ciency of our business.

Securing our 
environment
Our customers and employees demonstrate 
increasing concern for environmental issues. 
Whilst our environmental impacts are not 
signifi cant relative to other businesses of 
comparable size, it remains important to 
us to be effi cient in the use of resources 
and, in doing so, curtail our greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Colombia, Estonia, India, Nigeria, Philippines and Thailand following 
the conclusion of the six-year fl agship G4S 4teen programme
 – invested almost £2 million in charitable community programmes

fi nancial hardship
Securing our

safe and secure environment around the 
world depends on the relationships we

with whom we work. We are therefore 
committed to working with charity and 
community partners to tackle issues which 
affect local communities, especially relating

OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The board sits at the top of the company’s governance framework, 
setting broad strategic targets, monitoring progress, approving 
proposed actions and ensuring appropriate controls are in place and 
operating effectively.
Management decisions, development of strategies and policies and 
implementation of board decisions fall to the executive committee.
Regional management teams have responsibility for businesses within 
their regions and are tasked with implementing policies and controls 
at business levels, as well as ensuring they meet agreed fi nancial goals.
The presence of a majority of independent non-executive directors on 
the board ensures objectivity, challenge and debate. It is the primary 
responsibility of the board to provide effective leadership for the group 
and this is done by, amongst other things, ensuring that decision making 
is conducted throughout the group within a strong internal control 
framework – and by setting values and standards.
There is a detailed schedule of matters reserved to the board under 
12 separate categories: strategy and management; structure and capital; 
fi nancial reporting and controls; risk and internal controls; contracts; 
communication; board membership and other appointments; 
remuneration; delegation of authority; corporate governance matters; 
policies; and other matters such as settling material litigation and 
approving levels of insurance. By way of example, board approval is 
required for: unbudgeted capital projects of more than £10m; entering 
into a sales contract where annual revenue is to be more than £50m; 
any changes to the group’s long-term objectives and commercial 
strategy; and the annual operating and capital expenditure budgets. 
The schedule of matters reserved to the board was reviewed and 
updated during the course of the year. 
The board fulfi ls a number of its most important functions through 
its committees. The work of these committees is described below in 
this report.
The terms of reference of the committees are available on the 
company’s website. www.g4s.com

Corporate governance report
DEAR SHAREHOLDER, 
G4S is committed to achieving and maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance, as we believe that these are the necessary 
foundations on which the long-term success of the group is built. Trust, 
integrity and transparency are at the heart of what we do. My role is 
to lead the board and ensure that it has the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the company to 
ensure its effectiveness. 
As explained in my chairman’s statement on pages 2 and 3, 2013 
has been a year of strong focus on board composition and in ensuring 
we have the right senior management team in place. I am pleased to 
report that the range of backgrounds, skills and experience of the new 
members of the board is already producing results. A strong emphasis 
was placed on ensuring that they have suffi cient knowledge of the 
company and the environment and conditions in which we operate. 
Details of inductions and professional development are found below. 
The role of the board is to challenge constructively and help develop 
the group’s strategy. The board took part in the thorough review of 
the strategy, which the new chief executive offi cer, Ashley Almanza, 
developed during the summer and which resulted in the adoption of 
the strategy for delivering the company’s objectives which is described 
in the Strategic Report. 
2013 also saw us embark on a thorough review of our risk 
management framework, which has led to a number of changes aimed 
at strengthening and enhancing internal controls and processes for 
identifying, reporting and managing risk. The board, through its newly 
created Risk Committee, oversaw the process. 
The purpose of the corporate governance report which follows is to 
give an understanding of the corporate governance framework and 
arrangements we have in place. It is also to explain how the group as 
a whole and the board in particular have complied with the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Codes, published in May 2010 and 
September 2012 (the “Code”).

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE CODE
The board’s statement on the company’s corporate 
governance performance is based on the Code, which is 
available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website (https://
www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-
governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-Code.aspx).
The Listing Rules require companies to disclose how they 
apply the Code’s main principles and report how they have 
done so. The Code recognises that alternatives to following 
its provisions may be justifi ed in particular circumstances if 
good governance can be achieved by other means, provided 
the reasons are explained clearly and carefully. In such cases, 
companies must also illustrate how their actual practices are 
consistent with the principle in question and contribute to 
good governance.
The company complied throughout the year under review 
with the provisions of the Code. The Corporate governance 
report, together with the Audit committee report and the 
Directors’ remuneration report, describe how the board has 
applied these provisions.

down as a member of the committee at the end of this year and as 
chairman of the Audit Committee after the 2014 AGM, when the role 
will be taken on by Tim Weller. Both Mark and Tim are the members of 
the Audit Committee with recent and relevant fi nancial experience, and 
Tim is a serving FTSE 100 CFO. Tim will therefore lead the external 
audit tender process which will be undertaken by the Audit Committee 
later this year (see page 63).
Induction and professional development
A tailored induction is provided to new non-executive directors joining 
the board. This includes spending time with the executive directors 
and other senior executives to understand the business, its structure 
and people as well as the company’s strategy and fi nancial performance. 
In March 2013, Messrs Crozier, Spence and Weller met the group’s 
regional CEOs who each presented an overview of their region. 
This was followed by a question and answer session also attended by 
the chief executive offi cer and the chief fi nancial offi cer. Visits to key 
locations within the group are also arranged. New directors are given 
the opportunity to visit businesses so they can learn about the 
group’s operations. 
In February 2013, John Connolly, Mark Elliott and Paul Spence attended 
the North American regional management conference in Miami. Prior 
to the conference, as part of his induction, Mr Spence attended a 
session with the Americas regional management team, who provided 
an overview of the businesses in the region, as well as the opportunities 
and challenges there.
The induction also provides details of the group’s governance policies 
and structure and includes a summary of the risks facing the group. 
Meeting regional and country staff continues throughout a director’s 
time on the board, as does continuing professional development, 
usually in areas where the director has specifi c committee responsibility. 
BOARD 54 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Board performance review
In 2013, the performance of the board and its committees was 
evaluated using a questionnaire-based self-assessment process which 
was then interpreted and reported on by the external consultancy 
(Lintstock Limited) which conducted an externally facilitated evaluation 
of the board and its committees’ performance in 2011. Reports 
generated by this process related to the board, the chairman and each 
of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and CSR committees. Lintstock 
has no connection with the company other than evaluating the board 
and its committees’ performance. 
Following consideration of the report on the board’s performance, the 
board has agreed a set of primary objectives for its work in 2014, which 
will include:
 – regular reviews of businesses within each region including the group’s 
risk services business
 – scrutinising the group’s technology strategy
 – focusing on succession planning
 – increased understanding of the group’s competitors
 – increased focus on effectiveness of internal controls environment
 – analysis of employee and customer satisfaction.
In addition, the reports considered the performance of the chairman 
and each board member and were used to inform the discussion 
about the chairman’s performance, which was conducted by the 
senior independent director without the chairman being present. 
The chairman has also conducted discussions with individual directors 
which, amongst other things, allowed the chairman to review directors’ 
training and development needs.
The chairman also held regular meetings with the non-executive 
directors without the executives being present.
Succession
The Nomination Committee, led by the chairman, is responsible for 
the recruitment of all new members of the board and the board 
as a whole discusses succession planning for the board and senior 
executives. 
Director re-election
The company’s articles of association require that all continuing 
directors are subject to election by shareholders at the next annual 
general meeting following their appointment and that they submit 
themselves for re-election at least every three years and that at least 
one-third of the directors not standing for election for the fi rst time 
stand for re-election at each annual general meeting. However, in 
accordance with the Code provision on re-election of directors, all 
the continuing directors will stand for re-election every year.
Confl icts authorisation
Each of the directors has disclosed to the board any situations which 
apply to them as a result of which they have or may have an interest 
which confl icts or may confl ict with the interests of the company. In 
accordance with the company’s articles of association, the board has 
authorised such matters. The affected directors did not vote when 
their own positions were considered. Where the board deemed it 
appropriate, such authorisation was given subject to certain conditions. 
The board reviews such matters on a regular basis.
RELA TIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company actively seeks to engage with shareholders and, during 
2013, senior management had extensive contact via one on one 
meetings, group meetings and telephone conference calls with 
shareholders representing more than 80% of the share register 
across over 200 institutions. 
In November, the chief executive and chief fi nancial offi cer presented 
to institutional investors at the group’s annual capital markets update 
which is video webcast and available on the group’s website. Additional 
results meetings are held for the preliminary and half-yearly results 
announcements and conference calls are arranged for the interim 
management statements. 
The chairman has engaged with major shareholders over senior 
management changes and other broader governance issues. 
The previous and current chairs of the CSR Committee, Mark Elliott 
and Clare Spottiswoode, and relevant senior executives met with a 
group of socially responsible investors in September 2013, updating 
them on the group’s corporate responsibility programme. Mark Elliott, 
in his capacity as chair of the Remuneration Committee, along with 
senior human resources executives, held a detailed consultation process 
with the company’s largest shareholders on proposals for a new 
long-term incentive plan. 
It is intended that all the directors will attend, and be available to 
answer questions at, the company’s annual general meeting which is 
an important opportunity for communication between the board 
and shareholders, particularly private shareholders. At the annual 
general meeting, the meeting is informed of the numbers of proxy 
votes cast and the same information is published subsequently on 
the company’s website.
BOARD MEETINGS AND INFORMATION FLOW
Seven scheduled board meetings were held during the year ended 
31 December 2013 and there were a further seven additional 
unscheduled board meetings. These additional meetings were mostly 
called at short notice and it was not always possible for all directors 
to attend. Three of the Remuneration Committee meetings were 
unscheduled. 
One of the scheduled board meetings was an extended two-day 
board and strategy session covering presentations on development 
and implementation of the company’s strategy. The board debated the 
company’s strategy and business plans and the company’s strategy was 
reviewed again by the board at a subsequent meeting. Prior to each 
meeting, comprehensive board papers are circulated to the directors 
addressing not only the regular agenda items on which the executives 
will report, but also details of any areas requiring approval or decisions 
such as signifi cant transactions or events or important market issues.
At each meeting, the board then receives reports from the chairman, 
the chief executive, the chief fi nancial offi cer and the company 
secretary, an HR report which includes summaries of developments 
on HR and health and safety matters and an investor relations report 
which includes analysts’ reviews and any comments received from 
major shareholders since the previous board meeting. After meetings 
of the board committees, the respective committee chairmen report to 
the board on the matters considered by each committee. In addition, in 
months where there is no board meeting scheduled, the board receives 
trading and fi nancial updates, investor relations and HR reports.
There are seven board meetings scheduled for the current year, 
including a two-day board and strategy meeting.

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE 
ASSESSMENT
In relation to compliance with the Code, the board has given 
consideration to whether the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.
The preparation of the annual report and accounts is coordinated 
by the fi nance, investor relations and company secretariat teams with 
group-wide support and input from other areas of the business. 
Comprehensive reviews were undertaken at regular intervals 
throughout the process by senior management and other contributing 
personnel within the group. The statement required to be given by 
the directors by Code provision C.1.1 can be found on page 83.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group’s system 
of risk management and internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness each year.
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Enterprise-wide policies and procedures, which are reviewed and 
monitored by the group director of risk and programme assurance, 
are in place to identify the key risks faced by each business unit and to 
put in place appropriate remediation strategies for any risks determined 
to exceed the group’s risk appetite. The most material risks are elevated 
to the board which evaluates their impact on the group’s activities and 
reviews any matters which may be considered by the board to present 
signifi cant exposure.
The group’s key risks are summarised in the Strategy section – 
Managing risk effectively and Our principal risks in detail on pages 34 
to 41.
The key features of the group’s risk management process, which was 
in place throughout the year under review, are:
 – Senior executives in each business unit and region use a common 
risk management framework* to provide a profi le of those 
risks which may have an impact on the achievement of their 
business objectives
 – Each signifi cant risk is documented in the group’s risk management 
system, showing an overview of the risk, its owner, how the risk 
is managed, and any improvement actions. Risk appetite/tolerance 
is considered in the context of the residual (after controls and 
mitigation) risk with a particular focus on “High” net risks. T o 
be categorised as “High”, a risk must meet at least one of the 
following criteria: 56 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Corporate governance report continued
 – major impact on the achievement of the business strategy
 – serious damage to business reputation
 – severe business disruption
 – impact of > 5% on operating profi t or assets
 – The risk profi les ensure that internal audit reviews of the adequacy, 
application and effectiveness of risk management and internal 
controls are targeted on the key risks.
 – Risk management committees have been established at regional 
and group level.
 – Risk and control self-evaluation exercises are undertaken for each 
operating company, for most companies at least twice a year, and 
updated risk profi les are prepared. Similar exercises are undertaken 
as part of the integration process for all major acquisitions. The 
results of the company risk evaluations are assessed by the regional 
risk management committees
*
. 
 – Both the regional committees and the group executive risk 
committee receive internal audit reports and regular reports on risks. 
They monitor the actions taken to manage risks.
The process is carried out under the overall supervision of the group 
executive risk committee, which comprises the group chief fi nancial 
offi cer, the group general counsel, the group communications director 
and the group human resources director. The group executive risk 
committee reports to the group executive and to the Risk Committee 
of the board. The process outlined above is reviewed regularly by the 
board through its Risk Committee to ensure its robustness and 
suitability to meet the group’s needs.
In 2013, a new board Risk Committee was constituted. This committee 
approved a plan for the improvement of the group’s risk management 
policies and procedures to be led by the group director of risk and 
programme assurance. Under this plan the following progress has 
been made:
 – Revised terms of reference have been agreed for regional risk and 
audit committees and the executive risk committee. The reporting 
arrangements and inter-relationships between these governance 
bodies and the Audit Committee have been clarifi ed.
 – Regional risk managers with revised, standardised, role descriptions 
have been appointed in each region as well as in the global risk 
services and consulting business.
 – A new group risk universe providing greater structure to the 
classifi cation of the group’s risk was developed.
 – A new methodology for identifying and assessing risks has 
been created.
 – An interim risk management tool, incorporating the risk universe 
and new methodology was put into place to capture risk at regional 
and group level.
 – In January 2014, the regional risk and audit committees all held risk 
workshops to identify and assess the principal regional residual risks 
afresh. These risks were recorded in the interim risk management 
tool and provided the basis for identifying and assessing the group’s 
principal residual risks presented in this annual report. Mitigation 
action plans are being refreshed for all regional and group 
residual risks.
 – During 2014, the risk management improvement programme 
will focus on:
 – Defi ning a new overall risk management approach and revised 
risk policy.
 – Defi ning a more precise group risk appetite.
 – Implementing a new risk management software tool with 
improved mitigation action tracking capabilities and improved 
management information and reporting.
 – Rolling-out new approaches to and policies on risk across the 
group.
 – Implementation of enhanced contract approval and contract 
management processes.
Further information about the Risk Committee, its remit, work during 
2013 and its plans for 2014 can be found on pages 34 to 41.
The internal control system includes clearly defi ned reporting lines 
and authorisation procedures, a comprehensive budgeting and monthly 
reporting system, and written policies and procedures.
In addition to a wide range of internal audit reports, senior 
management also receives assurance from other sources including 
security inspections, third-party reviews, company fi nancial control 
reviews, external audit reports, summaries of whistle-blowing activity, 
fraud reports and risk and control self-evaluations.
The group has in place robust internal control and risk management 
systems for fi nancial reporting. The group has a single global 
consolidation system which is used for internal management reporting, 
budgeting and planning as well as external reporting. The group has 
a comprehensive budgeting process with the budget being approved 
by the board. Forecasts for the year are reported at least quarterly. 
Actual results at business unit, region and group level are reported 
monthly and variances are reviewed. A programme of business internal 
fi nancial reviews is performed by a fi nance team from either region 
or group to check the accuracy of fi nancial reporting and compliance 
with the group fi nance manual.
The Audit Committee undertakes a high level review of risk 
management and internal control each year. As well as the above 
processes and sources of assurance, the Audit Committee also 
considers the following year end reporting in conducting this review:
 – Summary of 2013 internal audit work, including an update on all 
open audits with a defi cient rating, analysis of results by region, 
common audit fi ndings and areas identifi ed for improvement in 
internal controls
 – Summary of 2013 internal fi nancial reviews, including 
signifi cant accounting or fi nancial control issues and common 
concerns identifi ed
 – Overview of year-end fi nancial control status reports completed 
by all businesses confi rming adherence to group standards, with 
any exceptions reported
 – A broad overview of the general risk management and internal 
control systems in place during the year
 – Y ear-end group risk profi le 
 – Review of risk management processes and of the group’s principal 
residual risks by the board Risk Committee
 – External audit year-end reporting on fi nancial controls 
and accounting.
The Audit Committee has confi rmed that it is satisfi ed that the group’s 
risk management and internal control processes and procedures are 
appropriate. The board has reviewed the group’s risk management 
and internal control system for the year ended 31 December 2013 
by considering reports from the Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee and has taken account of events since 31 December 2013.
*
 
Because G4S Government Solutions, Inc. (“GSI”) is governed through a proxy 
agreement under which the group is excluded from access to operational 
information, it is not subject to the same risk management process as is applied 
to other group companies. The board has however satisfi ed itself as to the 
adequacy of the internal control processes adopted by GSI, which include 
a risk review by an external adviser. Governance

THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
“ There have been signifi cant changes to the 
board during the year. The Nomination 
Committee was engaged in selecting and 
appointing two new executive directors. 
In any appointment recommended to 
the board, the Nomination Committee 
continues to ensure that board membership 
represents the wide range of skills and 
experience required.”
John Connolly
John Connolly
Nomination Committee Chairman
MEMBERSHIP IN 2013
The members of the Nomination Committee are John Connolly 
(chairman), Adam Crozier and Mark Elliott. On 24 January Lord 
Condon left the committee and Adam Crozier joined.
ROLE
The Nomination Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations on board appointments and on maintaining 
a balance of skills and experience on the board and its committees. 
Succession planning for the board is a matter which is devolved 
primarily to the Nomination Committee, although the committee’s 
deliberations are reported to and debated by the full board. The 
board itself also regularly reviews more general succession planning 
for the senior management of the group.
KEY ACTIVITIES DURING 2013
Following an evaluation of the board committee memberships of the 
non-executive directors, proposals for changes were implemented in 
January 2013. Further details of these changes can be found in the 
relevant section relating to each committee. 
NEW APPOINTMENTS
In 2013, three new non-executive directors were appointed to the 
board during the year, having been selected and announced in 2012 
through a process led by the Nomination Committee which was 
assisted by the external executive search consultant, Zygos Partnership. 
Through a process led by the Nomination Committee which was 
assisted by the external executive search consultant, Inzito, Ashley 
Almanza was appointed as CFO on 1 May 2013. At the end of 2012, 
the board initiated a succession planning process to search for a new 
CFO. The chairman of the Nomination Committee led the process. 
Inzito, which was provided with a detailed brief for the role, undertook 
a thorough search. The list of potential candidates selected by Inzito 
was considered by the Nomination Committee, which carried out the 
review having regard to the balance of skills, experience and diversity 
on the board. Candidates who were shortlisted were all interviewed 
by the CEO and a smaller number also met with the chairman of 
the Nomination Committee and other non-executive directors. This 
process led to the Nomination Committee recommending to the 
board the appointment of Mr Almanza as the new CFO. The board 
accepted the recommendation, which resulted in the appointment of 
Mr Almanza on 1 May 2013. 
At the time of looking for a replacement for Mr Buckles, with Inzito’s 
assistance, the board considered the skills and experience of a range 
of potential external candidates as well as those of Mr Almanza. 
After careful review, the board concluded that Mr Almanza’s wealth 
of experience gained from working across international borders 
in complex businesses as well as his experience of strategic and 
operational management would enable him to provide strong strategic 
and operational leadership to the group. The board therefore approved 
Mr Almanza’s appointment as CEO. 
The Nomination Committee then instigated the selection process for 
a new CFO to replace Mr Almanza. Mr Almanza and the group human 
resources director interviewed a number of candidates, some of whom 
had been seen before, including Himanshu Raja. With Inzito’s assistance, 
a list of candidates was produced, a number of whom were interviewed 
by the CEO and by the chairmen of the Nomination Committee and 
the Audit Committee. The Nomination Committee recommended to 
the board the appointment of Mr Raja, and he was appointed as CFO 
on 7 October 2013. 
Inzito and Zygos Partnership each provided recruitment consultancy 
services to the Nomination Committee and neither has any other 
connection with the company. 
DIVERSITY
With operations in 120 countries, G4S operates in very diverse 
communities and businesses. Diversity covers many aspects such 
as gender, race, religion and language as well as background and 
experience. Our workforce refl ects this diversity. The board recognises 
that the group needs to continue to promote diversity in order to 
create an organisation that attracts, supports and promotes the 
broadest range of talent. This allows individuals to reach their full 
potential but also to provide the best service to our customers. 
Diversity is a consideration that forms part of any new recruitment 
for and appointment to the board. Although appointments will continue 
to be made on merit, the Nomination Committee and the board 
recognise that the board performs better when it includes members 
from varying backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Diversity will 
therefore continue to be a key consideration when contemplating the 
composition and refreshing of the board and senior management, 
although the board has no specifi c targets in relation to diversity 
including gender.  58 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
THE CSR COMMITTEE
“ Corporate social responsibility remains 
at the heart of G4S’ business strategy and 
operations. I was delighted to become chair 
of the CSR Committee in June 2013, taking 
over from my predecessor Mark Elliott. 
Although CSR matters considered by the 
committee are wide ranging, a signifi cant 
area of focus for the group and the CSR 
Committee is to ensure the health and 
safety of our colleagues around the world. 
Sadly, 55 of them lost their lives in 2013. 
This has been and remains a key concern 
for the committee. Whilst any employee 
fatality is unacceptable, we are making good 
progress in implementing our health and 
safety campaigns and strategies, which 
include signifi cant work around road safety, 
to reduce the number of injuries and 
fatalities across our global workforce. 
In addition, Safety First has been introduced 
as a new value for the group and 
performance-related objectives, which focus 
on health and safety awareness and role 
modelling, have also been implemented. 
This work continues in 2014.”
Clare Spottiswoode
Clare Spottiswoode
CSR Committee Chair
MEMBERSHIP IN 2013
The members of the CSR Committee are Clare Spottiswoode (chair), 
Winnie Fok and Paul Spence. Bo Lerenius retired from the board and 
left the committee following the company’s annual general meeting on 
6 June 2013. On the same date, Mark Elliott left the committee and 
Ms Spottiswoode became the committee’s chair. 
CSR Committee meetings are attended by the group communications 
director and the group human resources director and, from February 
2014 onwards, also by Grahame Gibson, one of the executive 
directors of the board. 
ROLE
The CSR Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring 
the group’s CSR strategy. This includes developing policies on various 
CSR-related matters for consideration by the board, reviewing the 
activities of the executives who are responsible for CSR matters and 
monitoring performance of the group against its policies and any 
associated targets. It also takes responsibility for the company’s CSR 
report. 
The company’s separate CSR report for 2013 provides more detail on 
the group’s CSR strategy and the progress it has made during the year. 
A brief summary of some of the issues which that report addresses is 
set out on pages 42 to 47.
KEY ACTIVITIES DURING 2013
During the year, the committee reviewed the content of the company’s 
2013 CSR report and the results of the CSR materiality exercise 
undertaken during the year. 
The committee also oversaw the group’s implementation of a number 
of initiatives to improve health and safety for the group’s employees. 
With regard to road safety specifi cally, which remains a strong area 
of focus, initiatives included the “Driving Force Rules” campaign, which 
was piloted in seven countries. In addition, the committee oversaw the 
introduction of enhanced incident reporting and investigation processes 
and the collection of “lost time incident” data. 
Early in the year, the committee oversaw the launch of human rights 
and policy guidelines throughout the group and will monitor their 
effectiveness. 
The committee reviewed the effectiveness of communication of the 
group’s whistle-blowing hotlines, following which the promotion of 
these hotlines was improved. 
Mark Elliott, the previous chair of the CSR Committee, and Clare 
Spottiswoode, the current chair, led a meeting with a group of socially 
responsible investors in September 2013 to provide an update on the 
group’s corporate responsibility programme.

THE RISK COMMITTEE
“ Over the past year we have begun an 
in-depth review of our risk management 
processes. A new Risk Committee, chaired 
by me, was created in 2013. The Risk 
Committee is tasked with overseeing this 
review and the implementation of agreed 
changes. A specifi c group risk management 
function, separate from internal audit, has 
also been created. In September 2013, 
Alastair James was appointed as group 
director of risk and programme assurance 
to lead the new function. I am confi dent 
that these actions will signifi cantly improve 
management of the group’s risks.” 
John Connolly
John Connolly
Risk Committee Chairman
MEMBERSHIP IN 2013
The members of the Risk Committee are John Connolly (chairman), 
Ashley Almanza, Himanshu Raja, Paul Spence and Tim Weller.
Other regular attendees include the group general counsel, the head of 
internal audit and the group director of risk and programme assurance. 
ROLE
The Risk Committee advises the board on the group’s overall risk 
appetite, develops the group’s risk management strategy, advises the 
board on risk exposures, reviews the level of risk within the group and 
assesses the effectiveness of the group’s risk management systems. 
The committee’s composition ensures that a broad-ranging set of skills 
and experience come together to take a fresh look at how the group 
manages risk in the business.
KEY ACTIVITIES DURING 2013
The board decided last year that it would establish a distinct Risk 
Committee to oversee a comprehensive review of the group’s 
enterprise risk management processes. It also decided that the 
company would implement more fully the best practice “three lines 
of defence” model for risk management, by separating responsibility 
for risk management from the group internal audit function. 
A thorough review of the effectiveness of the group’s risk management 
processes was commissioned and carried out by Deloitte. The review 
took place in July and August 2013. The Risk Committee met in 
September 2013 to receive Deloitte’s report, discuss the results and 
agree a plan of action designed to reinforce the group’s risk 
management approach.
The conclusion of the Deloitte report was that, while the group has in 
place a basically sound risk management process, there were a number 
of areas where improvements could be made. A plan was therefore 
developed to take forward Deloitte’s recommendations through 2014. 
The terms of reference of the Risk Committee were fi nalised and 
agreed by the board. 
During the year, a sub-committee of the Risk Committee met on fi ve 
occasions to review major contract bids, the risk associated with them 
and mitigation plans. 
IN 2014
In March, the Risk Committee reviewed the residual risks identifi ed 
by each of the regional risk and audit committees. The residual risks 
were identifi ed as a result of the consolidation of the risks identifi ed 
by these regional committees following a revised methodology rolled 
out towards the end of 2013. Further details of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the business are set out on pages 34 to 41. 
The Risk Committee plans to meet at least twice more in 2014 to 
carry out the following activities:
 – review progress on the improvement of the risk management 
approach
 – review the group’s residual risk exposure and the progress of 
mitigation action plans
 – review new and emerging risks.
The Risk Committee will consider all signifi cant risks to the group, 
not only fi nancial risks. The Risk Committee’s role is to support the 
Audit Committee and the board in discharging their responsibilities in 
respect of the monitoring, reviewing and reporting of internal control 
and risk management.  60 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Mark Seligman
Chairman of the Audit Committee
 – testing the effectiveness of the risk management procedures 
(through reviewing and considering reports from the 
Risk Committee)
 – reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls
 – advising the board on whether the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy

MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
DURING THE YEAR
The committee:
 – reviewed the company’s annual report, half-yearly results and 
preliminary announcement
 – reviewed and approved the 2013 external audit plan and received 
regular reports from the external auditor
 – reviewed and approved the external auditor’s fees, including fees for 
non-audit services
 – recommended to the board the re-tendering of the annual external 
audit process as set out on page 63
 – considered the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls over 
fi nancial reporting

its performance
 – considered the signifi cant issues below.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE AUDIT 
COMMITTEE
The primary areas of judgement considered by the committee in 
relation to the 2013 fi nancial statements, and how these were 
addressed, were:
Presentation of the income statement
In order to provide a better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business, for the half-yearly and full-year results, 
management presented a view of the underlying results of the 
group, with separate disclosure of restructuring charges and other 
specifi c items. 
The committee discussed the rationale with management and with 
the external auditor and concluded that separate presentation of 
restructuring charges and other specifi c items provides users of the 
group’s fi nancial statements with added clarity and transparency, and 
therefore facilitates a clearer assessment of the group’s performance 
over time. The committee confi rmed that appropriate accounting 
policies, controls and guidance on the constituents for specifi c items 
were in place and would be applied robustly in future years.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
2013 saw the appointment of fi rst Ashley Almanza, then Stuart Curl 
(on an acting basis) and subsequently Himanshu Raja as chief fi nancial 
offi cer after Trevor Dighton stepped down from that position at the 
end of April. Starting in May, a thorough review of the group’s balance 
sheet was undertaken and work began on a process of change to 
strengthen signifi cantly the group’s fi nancial capabilities. This process 
was fully supported by the committee, which reviewed and discussed 
the outcomes with executive management and the rest of the board.
During the course of the year, the Audit Committee devoted 
signifi cant time to reviewing the integrity and quality of the group’s 
fi nancial reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed and assessed the 
half-year and full-year exercises relating to the carrying value of the 
group’s assets and liabilities, the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment and the effectiveness of both the internal audit function 
and the external auditor. T ogether, these actions increased our 
understanding of the overall control environment, and resulted in a 
number of decisions intended to further strengthen controls. The Audit 
Committee concluded that the annual report and accounts was fair, 
balanced and understandable, and reported this to the board.
At the end of 2014 I will have served on the board for nine years and 
I will retire from the board at the 2015 AGM. Tim Weller will become 
chairman of the committee in my place after this year’s AGM, thereby 
allowing Tim to assume leadership of the external audit tender process 
described below.
Mark Seligman
Chairman of the Audit Committee
31 March 2014
ROLE
The committee’s tasks include:
 – reviewing the group’s fi nancial results announcements and fi nancial 
statements and monitoring compliance with relevant statutory and 
listing requirements
 – overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including 
discussing with them the nature, scope and fees for their work 
and making recommendations to the board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor
 – monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness and resourcing of the 
group internal auditing function 
 – reviewing the group’s whistle-blowing arrangements  62 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Risk of management override of internal controls
The group operates in a large number of diverse locations and has 
a decentralised management structure, with a signifi cant number of 
local fi nancial systems and processes which could potentially lead 
to management override of internal controls in the absence of 
group oversight.
The committee assessed the overall control environment of the group, 
reviewed and approved the group internal audit plan for the year as 
well as internal audit reports provided, interviewed senior management, 
and reviewed other controls including whistle-blowing arrangements. 
The committee also examined signifi cant accounting estimates and 
judgements and the supporting documentation for evidence of fraud 
or bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement, and satisfi ed 
itself that the risk of management override of internal controls is 
not material.
Review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities
Following the appointment of Ashley Almanza as chief fi nancial offi cer 
in May 2013 and subsequently as chief executive offi cer in June 2013, 
a balance sheet review was undertaken of the carrying value of 
the group’s assets and liabilities in advance of the half-year results. 
Following the appointment of Himanshu Raja as chief fi nancial offi cer in 
October 2013, a further and more detailed exercise was carried out. 
The committee had extensive discussions with both management and 
with the external auditor, which was asked to include the balance sheet 
review as part of the audit’s scope and report to the committee. 
Note 8 to the fi nancial statements provides the details of the assets 
that have been written down as a result of this exercise. In fi nalising the 
year-end results, the committee scrutinised the proposed adjustments 
and received assurance from management and the external auditor 
that the review was comprehensive and complete and that the revised 
estimates took account of current circumstances. The committee was 
satisfi ed that the adjustments made were balanced and reasonable.
Review of contracts
The group delivers outsourcing services that can be complex in nature 
and may be governed by unique contractual arrangements. There is a 
risk that revenue from these contracts is not recognised in accordance 
with contractual entitlements and therefore provisions may be 
required for refunds due to inaccurate billing and revenue recognition. 
During the year, the group was subject to a number of inquiries in 
relation to the accuracy of billing and services provided on some 
specifi c UK Government contracts, most notably the investigation into 
the electronic monitoring contracts where the Ministry of Justice 
alleged the group had overcharged for certain aspects of the services. 
Subsequent to year-end, a settlement was reached with the UK 
Government which is in line with the provision made at the year-end.
During the second half of the year, management undertook a review of 
163 contracts across the group. The committee tested management on 
the underlying principles and application of provisions relating to the 
contract portfolio review and was satisfi ed that the judgements made 
were balanced and reasonable.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation 
of subsidiaries
The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which 
are sometimes based upon local laws and regulations relating to foreign 
ownership. In some instances the group operates through local 
structures with limited direct share ownership of the business but 
exercises control through shareholder agreements. Forthcoming 
changes to the rules on consolidation require different judgements in 
deciding whether or not to consolidate the underlying business or to 
treat the operation as a joint venture, an associate or an investment, 
as appropriate. During the year, management carried out an extensive 
exercise to review whether the group is in compliance with local 
foreign ownership rules and whether or not the group holds suffi cient 
control and infl uence to support consolidation in the group results. This 
was a major area of focus in the external audit plan and the work was 
reviewed by the external auditor and by the committee.
As a result of this review, the committee was satisfi ed that the basis of 
consolidation and joint venture accounting was appropriate for the year. 
The committee also considered a report on the impact of adopting 
IFRS 10, 11 and 12 which came into force on 1 January 2014 and 
approved the enhanced disclosures relating to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 as 
set out in note 3(v) on page 103.
Carrying value of goodwill
The total value of the group’s goodwill as at 31 December 2013 is 
£2bn and it relates to a signifi cant number of acquisitions made. 
The estimation of the recoverable amount of goodwill supported 
by the group’s cash generating units requires signifi cant judgement 
primarily in relation to the achievability of long-term business plans 
and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation process.
The committee addressed these matters through receiving reports 
from management outlining the basis for the assumptions used, and 
was satisfi ed with the carrying value of goodwill. In addition, this matter 
is a prime area of external audit focus.
Going concern
The committee considered the group’s strategy and the principal risks 
and uncertainties, reviewed the liquidity position of the group taking 
into account the signifi cant undrawn but committed facilities available, 
and reviewed compliance with and availability of headroom in relation 
to covenants. In addition, the committee considered the group’s cash 
fl ow forecast for the next 12 months, considered a number of stress 
test scenarios to assess the robustness of this forecast.
The committee was satisfi ed that the cash fl ow forecast, taking into 
account reasonably possible risk sensitivities and the group’s current 
funding and facilities, alongside the group’s funding strategy; show that 
the group will continue to operate for the forseeable future. In addition, 
the committee has reviewed the relevant disclosures made in the 
statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 83. The committee 
has recommended to the board the adoption of the going concern 
statement for inclusion in the annual report and accounts. 
Discontinued operations
The group often has business disposals underway at any reporting date. 
There is a risk that any such businesses may not meet the group’s 
accounting policy for presentation as discontinued at the balance sheet 
date, either because they are not a separate major line of business 
or because there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of achieving the 
sale or the realisable value on disposal. The latter requires a level of 
judgement due to the range of potential sale prices. The committee 
reviewed the classifi cation of all discontinued businesses and, following 
discussions with management and with the external auditor, was 
satisfi ed that the likelihood of sale was highly probable and that the 
carrying value was reasonable based on market multiples and on 
expectations arising from negotiations with potential buyers. 
Taxation
The group operates in many tax jurisdictions, including countries 
where tax legislation is not always applied consistently and under some 
complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax 
arising is not always clear. 
The committee received reports from management and the external 
auditor on such issues, challenging them with assistance from external 
legal and other advisers, and is satisfi ed as to the judgements made. 
The committee also evaluated the adequacy of the group’s disclosures 
about the tax provisions and contingencies at notes 14 and 35 and the 
level of estimation due to uncertainty in the tax provisions at note 4.

EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER
T ender process
 – A request for a proposal will be sent to each of the global 
audit fi rms in the second quarter of 2014.
 – A tender evaluation team will be appointed comprising senior 
representatives from fi nance, group internal audit, group 
treasury, group legal and group tax.
 – Following a review and evaluation of submissions and 
interviews by the tender team, a shortlist of prospective fi rms 
will be agreed by the committee and those selected will be 
invited to present to the committee.
 – Members of the board and management will attend to 
assist the committee in developing a recommendation for 
the board. The committee will make the recommendation 
to the board.
Criteria 
Detailed criteria for evaluation will be developed so as to 
incorporate key aspects of the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Audit Quality Framework. 
Appropriate weighting will be given to:
 – organisation, capability and service delivery – including 
fully integrated global coverage, industry experience, 
in-depth appreciation of the group’s risk environment 
and technical expertise
 – audit quality – including quality assurance and compliance 
procedures, commitment to innovation and value-add, audit 
methodology, partner rotation and succession planning
 – audit approach – including audit planning and scope, 
materiality and risk focus, and 
 – team capability and fi t – including experience, continuity, 
culture, team structure and supervision.
INTERNAL AUDIT REVIEW
The Institute of Internal Auditors suggests that internal audit functions 
are subject to an external assessment at least every fi ve years. The last 
review of the group’s internal audit function was carried out in 2009, 
and updated in 2011. In May 2013, the committee commissioned an 
independent review of the group’s internal audit function. After a 
selection process which involved proposals from fi ve fi rms, Deloitte 
scored highest and was selected to carry out the review.
Deloitte’s report was considered by the committee in December 2013. 
The report found that the existing internal audit function was well 
organised and diligent, but that there were areas for improvement. 
Deloitte recommended the strengthening of the internal audit function 
and more emphasis on auditing the “third line of defence” activities. 
Deloitte also concluded that, although the group’s internal fi nancial 
review process was well designed, it could benefi t from being carried 
out by fi nance staff, with internal audit reviewing the outcome. 
The committee accepted Deloitte’s fi ndings, and adopted a number of 
changes including signifi cantly increasing the resources available to the 
internal audit function over the course of 2014. This will enable an 
increase in the amount of time available for on-site audits and the 
insourcing of testing of internal controls in the UK and of IT auditing. 
Internal audit’s effectiveness will be further enhanced by the 
strengthening of regional and country fi nance functions.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
The committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor, 
including the rotation of the audit partner, each year and also assesses 
their independence on an on-going basis. The external auditor is 
required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the group audit 
every fi ve years. The current lead audit partner has been in place for 
two years. The external auditor KPMG Audit Plc was fi rst appointed 
in 2005. 
So as to ensure that the independence of the audit is not 
compromised, during the year the committee reviewed its policy on 
the provision of non-audit services. Besides its formal audit function, 
the external auditor is permitted to provide consultation and due 
diligence services related to mergers and acquisitions, audits of 
employee benefi t plans, reviews of internal accounting and control 
policies and general advice on fi nancial reporting standards. Where the 
fees for such services are signifi cant, prior approval of the committee is 
required. The external auditor is also prohibited from providing other 
services without specifi c permission from the committee. The provision 
of any non-audit services by the external auditor must in any event 
comply with the requirements in that regard of the Auditing Practices 
Board. The committee has reviewed this policy and agreed that it 
will be amended to allow the external auditor to undertake certain 
controls testing activities and any other services with the committee’s 
approval which would not diminish the auditor’s independence. 
The external auditor has written to the committee confi rming that, 
in its opinion, it is independent. The committee discussed the levels of 
materiality used by the external auditor as set out in the report on 
page 92 and satisfi ed itself these were appropriate. The committee 
approved the fees paid to the external auditor, noting that the external 
audit is a complex exercise involving over 1,000 KPMG personnel. 
Details of the fees paid for audit services and non-audit services can 
be found in note 10 to the fi nancial statements. 
Effectiveness of the external auditor
A combination of formal and informal processes is used in the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process. 
Regular feedback is sought and received by management from the 
businesses within the scope of the external audit. At the conclusion 
of the year-end audit, this is fed back to the committee by the group 
fi nancial controller where appropriate. In addition, the committee has 
considered the results of an internal questionnaire about the external 
auditor completed by management and members of the committee. 
The questionnaire included questions relating to the quality, planning, 
execution and communication of the external audit programme. 
The committee also reviewed the fi ndings of the Financial Reporting 
Council’s report on its audit quality inspection of KPMG published in 
May 2013. Since the assessment of the external audit concluded that 
the external audit remains effective and the external auditor remains 
independent, the committee recommended to the board that KPMG 
should be re-appointed as the group’s auditor for 2014. The board 
accepted this recommendation and has proposed a resolution (set 
out on page 151) to shareholders for the re-appointment of KPMG. 
The committee also considered whether to tender the external audit. 
EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER
KPMG has been the group’s external auditor since 2005. As part of 
the committee’s review of the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit 
process, a detailed assessment was undertaken in 2013 as to whether 
the group should consider putting the external audit engagement out 
to tender. The committee concluded it was appropriate to undertake 
a full tender process for external audit services.
The committee has therefore approved a tender process (outlined 
below) which will be carried out during 2014. In the event that KPMG 
is unsuccessful, the board will appoint a successor with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2014 audit, and shareholders will be invited to 
confi rm this appointment at the AGM in 2015. If KPMG is successful, 
shareholders will have the opportunity to re-appoint the fi rm as the 
group’s external auditor at the AGM in 2015. 64 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
2014 REMUNERATION
The committee had two strategic issues to manage during the year. 
The development of a remuneration policy for approval by our 
shareholders and the creation of a new long-term incentive plan given 
the impending expiry of the plan approved in 2004. The policy is 
presented on pages 65 to 72 of this report. The proposed Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) is presented on pages 66 and 67 as well as 
page 78 of this report and a summary of its rules is contained in 
the Appendix to the Explanatory Notes to the AGM notice on 
pages 156 and 157. 
While the policy will not formally take effect until approved by the 
shareholders at the AGM on 5 June 2014, we intend to operate within 
that policy beginning immediately.
The committee consulted with 15 of the company’s largest 
shareholders and a number of key shareholder representative bodies 
in the development of both the policy and the LTIP . In particular the 
new LTIP was altered to refl ect: 
 – a desire for greater transparency in the way EPS is calculated
 – a change in our TSR comparator group
 – a desire to alter the metrics so that EPS is balanced with TSR and 
a third metric aligned with our strategy. We selected a cash fl ow 
metric which aligns with our strategic intent to reduce debt and 
to invest in organic growth
 – an increase in the shareholding requirement for executive directors.
We believe the result is a plan which is better aligned with our strategy 
and with shareholder interests. 
The committee believes the proposed policy and plan outlined in this 
report will allow us to attract and retain top talent for executive roles 
and will incentivise behaviour and performance aligned with 
our strategy and shareholder interest. 
As part of the annual salary review process, the committee determined 
that the CEO’s salary would be increased to £890,000 with effect from 
1 January 2014. Salaries for other executive directors were unchanged. 
An illustration of the effect of our remuneration policy during 2014 can 
be found on page 71 of the following report.
PAY DURING 2013
The committee was involved in approving the terms agreed with 
Messrs Buckles and Dighton upon their departure during the year 
and the employment terms for their replacements. The terms agreed 
with Messrs Buckles and Dighton simply refl ected their contractual 
entitlements. There were no additional payments nor was there any 
accelerated vesting of outstanding awards. Further details are set out 
on page 76 of the report. 
In recruiting new executives the committee considered a number of 
factors (including external market practice, internal relativities, individual 
experience, expertise and the requirements of the role). In the case 
of Ashley Almanza he was fi rst recruited as the chief fi nancial offi cer 
from 1 May 2013 and was awarded a salary commensurate with the 
position and variable compensation and benefi ts as refl ected in our 
policy. When he was promoted to chief executive in June 2013, his 
base salary, benefi ts and variable compensation were increased 
to refl ect his additional responsibility. No further payments were 
committed or made.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
In what has been a year of great change for the group, the 
Remuneration Committee has dealt with both the activities that 
occur in the normal course of events and those driven by changes 
in leadership and regulation.
COMMITTEE OPERATIONS
As announced in last year’s report, Lord Condon retired from the 
board at the AGM held on 6 June 2013 and thus I assumed the role 
of chairman of the committee. In addition, Winnie Fok joined the 
committee in January 2013.
As is best practice, the committee performed a formal review of its 
performance by collecting feedback from committee members and 
those associated with committee proceedings. In summary, the review 
found that the committee performed well but that we have the 
opportunity to improve in a few key areas such as greater involvement 
in the operation of incentives schemes across the group and in 
engagement with all of our stakeholders. We developed plans to 
enhance our performance and will monitor our improvement in 
those areas as part of this review. 
In addition, we regularly review our terms of reference to determine 
if they continue to refl ect best practice. We have recommended to the 
board minor updates to refl ect our intent to more closely monitor 
variable pay plans across the organisation’s top 220 senior managers. 
Our terms of reference continue to be available on our website.
The committee executed a formal review of its advisers in September 
and saw presentations and terms from three fi rms. We selected 
Deloitte to become our new advisers effective from October 2013.
Directors’ remuneration report
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Mark Elliott
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 65 
Following Ashley’s promotion to chief executive offi cer, Himanshu Raja 
was recruited as chief fi nancial offi cer. His base pay is equal to that paid 
to Ashley Almanza whilst he was chief fi nancial offi cer. 
The directors’ service contracts are available for inspection by 
shareholders. 
No bonuses were paid to executive directors in March 2013 for the 
year 2012. Having reviewed performance for 2013, Grahame Gibson, 
Regional CEO – Americas was awarded a bonus of £103,000 and 
the committee used some discretion to determine that bonuses 
of £648,000 and £234,375 will be paid to Ashley Almanza and 
Himanshu Raja respectively, in recognition of their signifi cant business 
achievements since joining the group. 
In Ashley Almanza’s case, he assumed the role of CEO in a time of 
great uncertainty. The board asked him to focus on identifying root 
causes of issues that had led to our profi t warning in May and to 
prioritise the correction of those issues in a sustainable manner. We 
asked him to stay equally balanced on delivering quality underlying 
operating results that would set the foundation for sustainable growth 
going forward. Given his assumption of the CFO role in May and then 
the CEO role in June, the committee concluded that the underlying 
PBITA of £442 million, as presented in the results, was “at target” for 
the fi nancial portion of his bonus. For the portion of his bonus based 
on non-fi nancial objectives, the committee, and indeed the whole 
board, was highly satisfi ed with the rate and pace of progress and the 
committee therefore awarded him the maximum quantum. The bonus 
was prorated to refl ect his nine months of employment by the group 
which resulted in the £648,000 payment. 
In Himanshu Raja’s case, given he did not join until October, the 
committee concluded that his prorated bonus would be awarded 
based on a set of non-fi nancial objectives that again addressed the 
immediate need to deal with underlying fi nancial and risk management 
processes in a manner that would correct root cause issues uncovered 
during 2013. Again the board and the committee were highly satisfi ed 
with the signifi cant progress he made in three months. Therefore we 
judged his performance to deserve a maximum prorated bonus of 
£234,375. 
In accordance with the plan rules a portion of these bonus payments 
will be deferred for three years and paid in shares. 
In Grahame Gibson’s case, there was no payment for the fi nancial 
portion of his bonus, since his fi nancial targets were not achieved. 
However, he met a number of his non-fi nancial objectives in relation 
to talent management, succession planning, portfolio management and 
in preparing our US businesses for the introduction of the Affordable 
Care Act. Therefore, Grahame was awarded a bonus of £103,000 
payable in cash. 
More information can be found on the committee’s deliberations of 
these bonuses on page 73 of the report. 
Executive directors are also eligible for long-term incentive awards 
although there was no vesting in relation to the awards made in 
2010 and 2011 which would have vested in March 2013 and 
March 2014 respectively. 
We hope that you fi nd this year’s remuneration report informative 
and that we will enjoy your support on all of the remuneration-related 
votes at the 2014 AGM.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
31 March 2014
OUR REMUNERATION POLICY
The committee reviews the company’s remuneration policy for 
directors regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with the company’s 
strategic objectives, in line with best practice and suitable to attract and 
retain high calibre individuals whilst rewarding performance fairly. 
When reviewing and setting the policy, the committee takes account 
of the overall approach and structure of employee reward across the 
group, pay decisions for the wider workforce as well as the results of 
relevant benchmarking data. It is the committee’s intention that pay 
should also refl ect responsibility attached to the role fulfi lled, individual 
performance and other relevant market information. Shareholders are 
consulted from time to time on the remuneration policy, for example 
where a signifi cant change to the policy is proposed.
When setting the policy, the committee is mindful of the need to have 
a remuneration framework which not only provides the ability to 
attract and retain high calibre executives but also motivates executives 
and rewards the delivery of superior performance. The strong link 
between executive reward and the group’s performance; alignment of 
the interests of the executives and the shareholders; and provision of 
incentive arrangements which focus appropriately on both annual 
and longer-term performance are at the heart of the policy. Overall, 
the committee remains intent on achieving remuneration levels which 
provide a market competitive base salary with the opportunity through 
the company’s incentive schemes to achieve earnings commensurate 
with the delivery of superior performance. 
The policy on remuneration of directors is set out on pages 66 
to 72 and a separate resolution to approve this will be put to the 
shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on 5 June 2014.  66 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

FUTURE POLICY TABLE
This remuneration policy will be effective from the day after the 2014 AGM.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Purpose and link 
to strategy Operation
BASE PAY
Base pay is set at competitive 
levels in order to recruit and 
retain high calibre executives 
with the skills required in 
order to manage a company 
of the size and global 
footprint of G4S.
The level of pay will refl ect a 
number of factors including 
individual experience, 
expertise and role.
Reviewed annually and fi xed for 12 months commencing 1 January. Interim salary reviews may be carried out following signifi cant changes in role, 
scope or responsibility or at any other time at the committee’s discretion. 
The fi nal salary decision may also be infl uenced by role, experience, individual and company performance, internal relativities and increases for 
group employees.
BENEFITS
As with base salary, a suitable 
range of benefi ts is made 
available in order to recruit 
and retain high calibre 
executives. 
Executives are entitled to a number of benefi ts comprising paid holiday, healthcare for themselves and their family and life insurance of up to four times 
base salary, car allowance, business-related transport, limited fi nancial advice from time to time, expatriate benefi ts where relevant. A relocation 
allowance refl ecting reasonable costs actually incurred will be paid. Other benefi ts may be granted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Reasonable business expenses in line with G4S expenses policy (e.g. travel accommodation and subsistence) will be reimbursed and in some instances 
the associated tax will be borne by the company. 
ANNUAL BONUS
Rewards the achievement of 
annual fi nancial and strategic 
business targets and delivery 
of personal objectives. 
Deferred element 
encourages long-term 
shareholding and discourages 
excessive risk taking. 
Awarded annually based on performance in the year. Targets are set annually and relate to the group and/or the business managed by the executive.
Bonus outcome is determined by the committee after the year end, based on annual performance against targets. 
Bonuses are paid in cash, but executives are required to defer any bonus payable in excess of 50% of their maximum bonus entitlement into shares. 
Deferral is for a minimum period of three years. Dividends or equivalents accrue during the deferral period on deferred shares.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (NEW)
Incentivises executives to 
achieve the company’s 
long-term fi nancial goals 
as well as focus on value 
creation, whilst aligning the 
interests of executives with 
those of shareholders.
Executive directors are granted awards on an annual basis, which vest over a period of at least three years subject to continued service and 
the achievement of a number of (currently three) key performance measures. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the quantum of awards to be made to each executive each year to ensure that they remain appropriate. 
Dividends or equivalents accrue during the vesting period on awards that vest.
The award is settled by the transfer of market-purchased shares to the executive directors.
All the released shares (after tax) must be retained until the minimum shareholder requirement is met. Currently, the minimum shareholding 
requirement is 200% of base salary for the CEO and 150% for the other executive directors.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
As with base salary and other 
benefi ts, making available a 
suitable retirement benefi ts 
package aids the recruitment 
and retention of high calibre 
executives, allowing such 
executives to provide for 
their retirement.
G4S operates a defi ned contribution group-wide personal pension plan in the UK in which executives may participate. Alternatively, G4S may provide 
a cash allowance in lieu of a contribution into such plan. 
The current executive directors receive cash allowances. The CEO receives 25% of base pay as a cash allowance; the CFO receives 20% of base pay 
and the other executive director receives 40% of base pay, refl ecting his historic participation in a defi ned benefi ts plan whi ch has been closed.
The level of award is kept under review by the committee and is intended to be broadly market comparable for the roles. Governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 67 
Maximum opportunity Performance measures and clawback
Actual base pay for each executive director is disclosed each year in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. 
In determining salary increases, the committee considers market salary 
levels including those of appropriate comparator companies.
Ordinarily, annual salary increases would be no more than the average annual 
increases across the group. However, in exceptional circumstances a higher 
level of increases may be awarded, for example:
• following a signifi cant change to the nature or scale of the business; or
• following a signifi cant change to the nature or scope of the role; or
• for a new appointment, where the base pay may initially be set below the 
market level and increased over time, as experience develops and with 
reference to the individual’s performance in the fi rst few years in the role. 
Where exceptional increases are made we will fully disclose and explain the 
rationale for such increases.
None, although individual performance may have a bearing on salary increases.
Maximum benefi ts per director per annum: 
• holidays – 30 days 
• car allowance – £20,000 
• business-related local transport – £40,000 
• for fi nancial advice, expatriate benefi ts and relocation expenses, the expense 
will refl ect the cost of the provision of benefi ts from time to time but will be 
kept under review by the committee 
• other benefi ts granted at the discretion of the committee up to 3% of base 
pay per annum per director 
• reasonable business expenses which are reimbursed are not subject to a 
maximum, since these are not a benefi t to the director. 
Any allowance in relation to relocation will provide for the reimbursement 
of reasonable costs incurred. 
None.
Maximum opportunity of 150% of base pay per annum for the CEO and 
the CFO.
125% of base pay per annum for any other executive director. 
Typically, executive directors’ bonus measures are weighted so that:
• between 70% and 85% of the bonus is based on achievement of challenging fi nancial performance 
measures (e.g. profi t before tax and amortisation, organic growth, cash fl ow measures, etc.), 
with each measure operating independently of the others; and
• the remainder is linked to personal and/or non-fi nancial measures, which are strategic 
or operational in nature. 
Each year, the committee may use its discretion to vary the exact number of measures as well 
as their relative weightings, and this will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.
As a result of the number of factors taken into account in determining bonus, there is no minimum 
pay-out level. For illustrative purposes, in the event that only threshold has been achieved, pay-out 
would be 35% of maximum, rising to full pay-out should achievement of a stretch performance level 
be achieved for all measures assuming the non-fi nancial performance measures were satisfi ed.
The deferred element of the bonus is not subject to any further performance measures but is 
subject to claw-back in certain circumstances. The non-deferred part of the bonus, which is settled 
in cash, is also subject to claw-back (see separate section below on page 68).
Maximum opportunity of 250% of base pay per annum for the CEO.
Maximum opportunity of 200% of base pay per annum for the other 
executive directors.
Awards vest based on performance over a period of at least three fi nancial years commencing 
with the fi nancial year in which the award is made. 
Performance will be measured based on a combination of earnings per share growth, total 
shareholder return against a comparator group and average operating cash fl ow. For awards made in 
2014, these will be in the proportion of 40%, 30% and 30% respectively. However, the committee 
retains the fl exibility to amend these proportions, provided that no single measure will be a 
signifi cantly greater proportion than the others.
At threshold, 25% of the relevant portion vests. This increases on a straight-line basis up to 100% 
for performance in line with maximum. Targets are set out on page 78.
Awards are subject to claw-back in certain circumstances (see separate section below on page 68).
Maximum opportunity of up to 25% of base pay for the CEO and 20% for 
the other executive directors save that 40% of base pay per annum is payable 
to Grahame Gibson.

CHAIRMAN’S FEE
T o attract and retain a high calibre chairman by offering 
a market competitive fee, which also refl ects the 
responsibilities and time commitment. There are no 
performance-related elements. 
The chairman’s fee is disclosed each year in the 
Director’s remuneration report. The fees are reviewed 
annually by the committee. The annual fee is an all-
inclusive consolidated amount. The committee retains 
the discretion to review the chairman’s fee at any other 
time if appropriate.
The chairman’s fee are reviewed against those of other 
companies of a similar size.
Ordinarily, any increase of the chairman’s fee would be in 
line with increases for similar roles in other companies
Fees payable to the chairman and other non-executive 
directors in aggregate per annum shall not exceed the 
maximum specifi ed in the company’s articles of association 
for the relevant year.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES (EXCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN)
T o attract and retain high calibre non-executive directors 
(NEDs) by offering market competitive fees which 
should refl ect the responsibilities and time commitment. 
There are no performance related elements. 
NED fees including any additional fee for any additional 
role listed below are disclosed each year in the 
remuneration report. 
With the exception of the chairman, the fees for NEDs 
are structured by composition build-up consisting of:
• a base fee
• an additional fee for chairing a committee
• an additional fee for the role of deputy chairman
• an additional fee for the role of senior 
independent director
The non-executive director component fees are reviewed 
annually by the executive directors. The board retains 
the discretion to review the NED fees at other times, 
as appropriate, to refl ect any changes in responsibilities 
or commitment.
The basic fee covers committee membership and each 
NED is expected to participate in one or more board 
committees. All the fees are reviewed against those of 
other companies of a similar size.
Ordinarily, any increase of the non-executive directors’ fees 
would be in line with other increases for similar roles in 
other companies.
Fees payable to non-executive directors (including the 
chairman) in aggregate per annum shall not exceed the 
maximum specifi ed in the company’s articles of association 
for the relevant year.
BENEFITS
Benefi ts may be provided from time to time in 
connection with the chairman and other NEDs 
performing their roles, such as business travel, 
subsistence and entertainment, accommodation 
and professional fees for tax and social security 
compliance, and other ancillary benefi ts. 
Reasonable business expenses in line with G4S expenses 
policy (e.g. travel accommodation and subsistence) will be 
reimbursed and in some instances the associated tax will 
be borne by the company. 
Reasonable business expenses which are reimbursed are 
not subject to a maximum, since these are not a benefi t 
to the director. 
Benefi ts and expenses will refl ect the actual cost of 
the provision. 
Notes to the future policy table 
1. Performance measures
Annual Bonus Plan – The actual performance measures and targets 
are set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year. 
The performance measures used for our annual bonus plan have been 
selected to refl ect the group’s key performance indicators. The 
committee aims to ensure that the measures appropriately encourage 
the executive directors to focus on the company’s strategic annual 
priorities, whilst the targets are set to be stretching but achievable. 
The aim is to strike an appropriate balance between incentivising annual 
fi nancial and strategic business targets, and each executive director’s key 
role specifi c objectives for the year.
Long Term Incentive Plan – In choosing the performance measures for 
the proposed new Long Term Incentive Plan, the committee aims to 
fi nd a balance of measures which refl ect the company’s long-term 
fi nancial goals as well as incentivise executives to create sustainable, 
long-term value for shareholders.
Legacy plans – The committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments including payments for loss of offi ce 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy 
came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not 
a director of the company and, in the opinion of the committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
director of the company. For these purposes, payments may include 
the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration. In cases 
where all or a part of the variable remuneration award was in the 
form of shares, the payment terms are those agreed at the time the 
award was granted. 
In particular, awards made under the previous Performance Share Plan 
will continue to vest in accordance with the rules of that plan and to 
the extent that the relevant performance tests are met. Details of the 
vesting of the awards will be published in the annual remuneration 
report each year.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any incentive 
schemes nor do they receive any benefi ts other than those referred 
to in the above table. 
2. Changes in period
During 2013, a new CEO and CFO were appointed. No changes 
were made to the remuneration policy in effect during the previous 
year and the new CEO and CFO were recruited in line with the 
existing remuneration framework. Without the infl uence of the historic 
participation in a defi ned benefi t scheme, the new hires were recruited 
on a lower pension cash allowance than the previous CEO and CFO.
3. Malus and claw-back mechanisms
Since 2010, any cash and/or shares awarded under the annual bonus 
plans and the current Performance Share Plan may be subject to 
claw-back. The proposed new Long Term Incentive Plan and the current 
annual bonus plan may be subject to malus or claw-back from the 
executive director concerned if the Remuneration Committee so 
determines and, in the case of misstatement of accounts, where the 
Audit Committee concurs. The time period in which the claw-back can 
be operated depends on the reason for the overpayment. Please see 
the explanatory table on page 69.  Governance

The amount to be clawed back directly from the executive director will 
be the overpaid amount, but the Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to claw-back the “net” (i.e. post-tax) amount of the award 
received by the executive director.
PRINCIPLES AND APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND 
INTERNAL PROMOTION OF DIRECTORS
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting to the board from 
within the group, the committee will offer a package that is suffi cient 
to retain and motivate and, if relevant, attract the right talent whilst 
at all times aiming to pay no more than is necessary. Ordinarily, 
remuneration for a new executive director will be in line with the 
policy set out in the table above. However, discretion may be required 
for exceptional circumstances such as dealing with remuneration 
relinquished in a previous job. The maximum level of on-going variable 
pay that may be awarded to new executive directors on recruitment 
or on promotion to the board shall be limited to 400% of base salary 
as set out in the policy table above (calculated at the date of grant, 
excluding any buy-out awards – see below). Remuneration and any 
buy-out arrangements will be announced as far as possible at the time 
a new executive director or chairman is appointed, or in the following 
Directors’ remuneration report.
When determining the remuneration of a newly-appointed 
executive director, the Remuneration Committee will apply the 
following principles:
 – The on-going remuneration package to be designed in accordance 
with the policy table above
 – New executive directors will participate in the Annual Bonus 
Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan on a similar basis to existing 
executive directors
 – The Remuneration Committee shall have discretion to grant 
one-off cash or share-based awards to executive directors where 
it determines that such an award is necessary to secure the 
recruitment of that executive director and where it is in the best 
interests of the company to do so. Such awards would only be made 
as compensation for remuneration relinquished under a previous 
employment (i.e. buy-out arrangements) and would be intended to 
mirror forfeited awards as far as possible by refl ecting the value, 
nature, time horizons and performance measures attached. In such 
circumstances, the company will disclose a full explanation of the 
detail and rationale for such one-off award
 – In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to buy out long notice 
periods of previous employment
 – With regard to internal promotions, any commitments made before 
promotion and unconnected with the individual’s promotion may 
continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be 
consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfi lled
 – For external and internal appointments, the Remuneration 
Committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation 
expenses (including legal fees), as set out in the policy table
 – In determining the approach for all relevant elements, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider a number of factors, 
including (but not limited to) external market practice, current 
arrangements for existing executive directors and other 
internal relativities.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Shareholders are entitled to inspect copies of executive directors’ 
service contracts at the company’s head offi ce and annually at 
the AGM.
Executive directors’ service contracts all have the following features:
 – Contracts are drafted in line with best practice at the time the 
executive directors were appointed
 – Terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party.
Specifi c provisions for Ashley Almanza and Himanshu Raja’s contracts 
(dated 2013) that are not in Grahame Gibson’s contract (dated 
2006) include:
 – Following board approval, Ashley Almanza is allowed to hold two 
external non-executive appointments (he is currently a non-
executive director of Noble Corporation and of Schroders plc) 
and retain the fees paid directly to him for the appointments. 
Himanshu Raja is allowed to hold one external non-executive 
appointment and retain any fees paid directly to him for the 
appointment. Grahame Gibson’s contract does not specifi cally 
deal with NED positions, which will therefore be subject solely 
to board discretion.
 – Mitigation obligations on termination payments are explicitly included 
in the 2013 contracts. Notice payments for Ashley Almanza are 
payable monthly and those for Himanshu Raja are payable in two 
six monthly instalments payable in advance. 
There are no express mitigation provisions in Grahame Gibson’s 
contract.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment:
 – Appointment is subject to the provisions of the articles of 
association of the company, as amended from time to time regarding 
appointment, retirement, fees, expenses, disqualifi cation and removal 
of directors
 – All continuing non-executive directors’ are required to stand for 
re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years, 
although they have agreed to submit themselves for re-election 
annually in accordance with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code
 – Initial period of appointment is two years
 – All reasonably incurred expenses will be met
 – Fees are normally reviewed annually.
LOSS OF OFFICE PAYMENT 
The duration of the notice period in each of the executive directors’ 
contracts is 12 months.
The Remuneration Committee would consider the application of 
mitigation obligations in relation to any termination payments where 
such provisions exist in the executive director’s contract.
The contracts do not provide for the payment of a guaranteed bonus 
in the event of termination. Directors (other than Himanshu Raja) will 
not be eligible for bonus accrual during any period of garden leave. 
In the case of Himanshu Raja, his contract provides for such accrual 
although any level of payment would depend on the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.  70 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
The value of the termination payment would cover the balance of any salary and associated benefi ts payments due to be paid for the remaining 
notice period, the value of which will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee would also retain the 
discretion to make appropriate payments necessary to fi nalise any settlement agreement, but in exercising such discretion the Remuneration 
Committee will remain mindful to ensure that there is no reward for failure. 
The fees for outplacement services and reasonable legal fees in connection with advice on a settlement agreement may be met by the company.
The table below illustrates how each component of pay would be calculated under different circumstances:

apportioned basis, unless the 
Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise, and 
subject to the achievement of 
the performance measures.
Awards will lapse.

Awards will vest on the relevant 
vesting date on a time-

subject to the achievement of 
performance measures at the 
relevant vesting date.
The vesting date for such 
awards will normally be the 
original vesting date, unless 
otherwise determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Awards will lapse.
As directors may leave employment for a wide range of reasons, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion to approve payments 
where the reason for leaving does not fall precisely within the 
prescribed “good leaver” category. The committee will take account of 
the director’s performance in offi ce and the circumstances of their exit. 
The committee will seek to balance the interests of shareholders, the 
departing director and the remaining directors. Any awards subject to 
performance conditions would be assessed at the end of the relevant 
period and be subject to time apportionment. 
CORPORA TE ACTION
If the company is subject to a change in control, the current 
Performance Share Plan and the proposed new Long Term Incentive 
Plan provide that awards will vest subject to the performance targets 
having been satisfi ed up to the date of the change of control and, unless 
the committee determines otherwise, time pro-rating. On a variation of 
share capital, other reorganisation of the company, or a demerger of a 
substantial part of the group’s business, the committee may make such 
adjustment to awards as it may determine to be appropriate.  Governance

Directors’ remuneration report continued
STATEMENTS OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The structure of the executive directors’ pay policy is generally in line with the policy for remuneration of the senior management within the 
group, though the levels of award will be different. The performance measures that apply in the variable element of the remuneration will refl ect 
the relevant areas of responsibilities. There may be one-off awards for retaining scarce and critical individuals below board level.
Remuneration of employees globally will depend on local regulation and practice, taking any collective bargaining agreements into account, 
where they exist.
Elements of remuneration Availability
Fixed Base salaries Available to all employees worldwide
Pensions Available to most employees in developed markets
Variable Annual bonus Available to all senior managers worldwide
Long-term incentive plan Available to some senior managers worldwide
Benefi ts Car or car allowance Available to all senior managers worldwide
Protection insurance Available to most employees in developed markets
Private Healthcare Available to all senior managers and above worldwide
Across the group the company seeks to pay competitively, taking 
into account external benchmarking and internal moderation at 
each level to ensure that remuneration is in line with market practice. 
When determining base salary increases for executive directors, the 
Remuneration Committee pays particular attention to the data at 
senior manager level.
At G4S, the Remuneration Committee does not normally consult 
directly with employees as part of the usual process of determining the 
remuneration policy and pay decisions for executive directors and has 
not therefore done so in setting this remuneration policy. However, 
employee surveys are carried out biennially to determine employees’ 
views of their own pay and benefi ts, as well as those of colleagues 
in general.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
We are committed to consulting with our top shareholders on key 
remuneration issues and we would usually seek to consult prior to 
any major change in policy or practice. This helps us to understand any 
potential concerns our shareholders may have, and take any views on 
board. In 2013 and early 2014, we consulted with some of our largest 
shareholders and certain shareholders’ representative bodies in respect 
of the proposed new LTIP and the directors’ remuneration policy. 
Details of the consultation are provided in the Chairman’s statement 
section of this report. 
Furthermore, our Remuneration Committee chairman will be available 
to answer any questions and listen to the views of our shareholders at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting.

1 John Connolly was appointed in June 2012. 
2 Lord Condon and Bo Lerenius retired on 6 June 2013.
3 Mark Elliott was appointed as chair of the Remuneration Committee and senior independent director on 6 June 2013.
4 Clare Spottiswoode was appointed as Chair of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee on 6 June 2013.
5 Adam Crozier and Paul Spence were appointed on 1 January 2013.
6 Tim Weller was appointed on 1 April 2013.
7  Benefi t values include the costs of travel, overnight accommodation and meals which HMRC treats as a taxable benefi t, and on which the company will pay tax in due 
course, although it does not consider such expenses to be benefi ts in the ordinary sense.
8  The only benefi ts paid for non-executive directors in 2012 were business expenses which HMRC treats as a taxable benefi t. Such expenses were not required to be 
disclosed in 2012 and so they were not recorded separately for each director. Therefore the benefi ts fi gures listed for 2012 are estimated and based upon 2013 data. 
Ashley Almanza received £113,000 from Schroders plc and a fee of $33,000 as well as shares valued at $285,000 from Noble Corporation for his non-executive 
directorships referred to on page 48 and retained such remuneration. Mr Almanza uses his annual leave entitlement for Noble Corporation board meetings. 
FURTHER NOTES TO THE SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION TABLES
Executive directors’ base pay
Ashley Almanza’s base pay in 2013 as group CEO was £850,000 
per annum. 
Himanshu Raja’s base pay as group CFO was £625,000 per annum.
Grahame Gibson’s base pay was last increased in January 2011. He 
receives part of his salary in sterling and part in US$. The US$ element 
has been converted into sterling for the purposes of reporting, at the 
exchange rates prevailing in each month in which Grahame Gibson 
was paid.
2013 Annual bonus
In previous years, the annual performance-related bonus scheme 
was dependent on profi t. However, during the fi nancial year ending 
31 December 2013, the annual bonus scheme rules were amended to 
include two other fi nancial measures, organic growth and cash 
generation. The organic growth target which is measured against the 
budgeted percentage increase constituted 20% of maximum bonus. 
Cash generation measured against a cash conversion target was 15% 
with profi t measured by achievement against budget being 35%. 
Non-fi nancial strategic objectives linked to the delivery of the business 
plan were also introduced. These measures were personal objectives 
with 15% of maximum bonus attributable to strategic objectives taken 
from the business plan and a further 15% linked to objectives relating 
to the organisation such as people, CSR, risk, values etc. Each of the 
measures operated independently of the others.
The maximum bonus entitlement for the chief fi nancial offi cer 
increased from 125% to 150% of base pay, while the maximum bonus 
entitlement for the chief executive (150% of base pay) and other 
executive directors (125% of base pay) remained unchanged; however, 
the maximum pay-out is only reached when the relevant stretch 
targets are achieved. 
Bonuses are paid in cash up to 50% of their maximum entitlement. 
Where the bonus amount is in excess of 50% of the maximum 
bonus entitlement, the amount which exceeds 50% will be delivered 
in the form of a deferred share award which vests after a period of 
three years.
Payments approved by the committee under the 2013 bonus scheme 
were as follows:
For Ashley Almanza, given that he assumed the CEO role in a time 
of great uncertainty in June, the board asked him to focus on the 
achievement of high quality underlying profi t for the portion of his 
bonus relating to the fi nancial measures. In view of the part-year for 
which Ashley was CEO, we judged his delivery of £442 million of 
underlying operating profi t against a budget of £439 million to be “on 
target”. For the portion of his bonus relating to non-fi nancial measures, 
the board asked Ashley to complete a thorough assessment of the root 
causes for our performance issues and to develop and implement the 
changes required for long-term success. The committee and the board 
noted in particular the following performance in concluding that 
Ashley has earned a maximum entitlement on the non-fi nancial 
element of his bonus:
 – Balance sheet – an equity placement in nine days and the 
aggressive management of cash-fl ow allowed us to reduce debt by 
£269 million and to improve our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.6x. 
The identifi cation of underperforming assets with plans to fi x or 
dispose delivered £124 million of proceeds with more to follow. 
 – Risk management – developed a new risk and assurance organisation 
and recruited professional staff to develop and implement new 
contract management processes.
 – Customer engagement – personally led the work to understand 
delivery and billing issues with our UK MoJ contract. Ashley 
personally interacted with the UK Government to understand 
concerns and to develop a corporate renewal programme 
which when fully implemented will regain the trust of this 
important customer. 
This renewal programme sets the highest ethical standards and 
commitment to customer service as the standard behaviour 
expected throughout the organisation.
 – Leadership – recruited new leaders for regional roles and a high 
calibre CFO to lead the transformation of the fi nance organisation 
and its process and procedures.  74 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
These scores lead to the following calculated bonus:
Based on his average base pay, Ashley’s maximum potential bonus 
for a full year’s service would have been £1,200,000 in the event of 
achievement of a stretch target, 30% of which would be attributable 
to non-fi nancial objectives and the remainder to fi nancial objectives. 
The payment was prorated to take account of the different levels in 
base pay and the period for which he was employed, namely nine 
months. £270,000 was therefore paid in respect of non-fi nancial 
objectives and £378,000 for the “on target” fi nancial achievement. 
In accordance with the bonus plan rules, 30.55% of the bonus paid 
will be awarded as shares, deferred for three years.
The board is satisfi ed that Ashley has made very signifi cant progress 
in establishing a foundation for long-term sustainable growth of 
quality earnings.
Himanshu Raja did not join the group until October. Himanshu’s 
objectives included strengthening the group’s audit and risk 
management functions, reviewing and applying balanced accounting 
judgements to the group’s assets and liabilities and assessing prior 
year underlying performance, undertaking a fi nancial review of the 
group’s large contracts portfolio, developing and implementing a 
successful 2014 budget process and supporting the CEO with the 
group’s transformation programme. The committee noted that 
excellent progress was made against each of these objectives and 
therefore awarded Himanshu a maximum prorated bonus of £234,375. 
Based on his base pay for a full year’s service, Himanshu’s maximum 
potential bonus would have been £937,500. The payment was prorated 
to take account of the period for which he was employed, namely three 
months. In accordance with the bonus plan rules, half of the bonus will 
be paid in shares, deferred for three years.
For Grahame Gibson, the payment of a bonus under the fi nancial 
portion of the annual bonus scheme was dependant on the attainment 
of three fi nancial objectives relating to the Americas region (PBITA, 
cash conversion and working capital reduction). Since the threshold 
targets for these objectives were not met, no bonus is payable under 
the fi nancial portion. For the portion of his bonus relating to non-
fi nancial measures, Grahame was set a number of strategic objectives 
linked to the delivery of the Americas region’s business plan such as 
portfolio management and progress on operational and fi nancial 
effi ciencies, as well as a number relating to the organisation such as 
succession planning and progress on health and safety. Having met 
a number of his non-fi nancial objectives, Grahame was awarded a 
bonus of £103,000 (paid as $147,717 and £8,608.10), which represents 
16.11% of his maximum bonus entitlement.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH AND TABLE
The line graph below shows the eight-year annual T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) performance against the FTSE 100 index. The directors believe 
this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison given the size and geographic coverage of the 
company and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE 100.

Notes:
1  Nick Buckles stepped down as CEO on 31 May 2013 and Ashley Almanza took over as CEO from 1 June.
2  After July 2011, the CEO’s total single fi gure of annual remuneration included payment in lieu of pension. This was 40% of base pay for Nick Buckles and is 25% of base 
pay for Ashley Almanza. Prior to July 2011, a notional sum equal to 40% of relevant base pay has been included. The value of shares that vested in the relevant year under 
the PSP (or a notional value in the case of shares vested but unexercised) have been included in the prior year’s CEO’s total fi gures since that is the most relevant year 
for measurement of performance.
3 Prior to 2013, the CEO’s total single fi gures did not include taxable expenses. 
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CEO’S REMUNERATION
The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, 
benefi ts and bonus between 2012 and 2013 compares with the 
percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay 
for a selected group of G4S employees. The Remuneration Committee 
has chosen all employees in the UK as the group which should provide 
the most appropriate comparator. 
Percentage change in remuneration between 
2012 and 2013
Salary Benefi ts Annual bonus
CEO 1.4% 0.1% See note 2
Average increase for 
all other UK 
employees 8.2% 9.7% See note 3
1 The CEO’s benefi ts for 2013 were calculated on a like for like basis and 
therefore do not include taxable business expenses and grossed up tax and 
NIC payable thereon. In future years, the comparison will include such taxable 
business expenses and the baseline cost for 2013 will be £84,820.
2 There was no bonus paid to the CEO in 2012.
3 Information on bonuses is not available for all other UK employees.
G4S employs more than 618,000 employees globally. Infl ation is a key 
driver of general increases in salary and the structure of the benefi ts 
provided is often driven by the local market practice. Hence, as the 
CEO is based in the UK, employees in the same country rather than 
all employees within the group have been chosen as the comparator.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF 
REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2014
Our Remuneration Policy for directors as set out on pages 66 to 72 
will, if approved, take effect following the 2014 AGM and will then be 
implemented on the basis set out in this report. Some elements of pay 
for executive directors, forming a signifi cant proportion of the total 
reward available, are subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions. 
Base pay
The committee agreed to freeze base pay for executive directors in 
2009 and 2010 and again in 2012 and 2013, in view of the economic 
circumstances and the pay and employment conditions across the 
group. For 2014 at the annual pay review, it was decided to increase 
Mr Almanza’s base pay by just under 5% whilst no change was made 
to the base pay of the other two executive directors.
Annual Bonus Scheme
The annual bonus for the fi nancial year ending 31 December 2014 
will be consistent with the policy detailed in the remuneration policy 
section of this report in terms of the maximum bonus opportunity, 
deferral and claw-back provisions. The committee selects for each 
executive director, from a range of fi nancial and non-fi nancial measures 
which support the group’s key strategic objectives. The range of 
fi nancial measures includes group profi t, organic growth and operating 
cash fl ow. The non-fi nancial measures are based on the core values 
and include the following key areas:
 – Health & safety
 – Customer service and retention
 – People and organisation
 – Operational excellence
 – Business development
 – Values
Between 70% and 85% of the bonus will be based on fi nancial 
measures and the balance will be based on non-fi nancial measures. 
Details of the performance measures and targets are commercially 
sensitive. They will be disclosed in the 2014 report when they are 
no longer commercially sensitive.
Performance Share Plan
Awards will be granted under a new LTIP , subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2014 AGM. 
Details of the new LTIP are as set out in the summary of the scheme 
on pages 156 and 157. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that a combination of 
earnings per share growth, total shareholder return and cumulative 
cash fl ow targets are the most appropriate performance measures 
for 2014 awards, as they provide a transparent method of assessing 
the company’s performance, both in terms of underlying fi nancial 
performance and returns to shareholders.

The company’s current policy is to use market purchased shares to 
satisfy performance share plan awards. The new plan will continue to 
do the same.
Participants in the LTIP will receive a further share award with a value 
equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid in respect of 
future LTIP award vesting at the end of the performance period. 
The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have 
been achieved by reference to the company’s audited accounts which 
provide an accessible and objective measure of the company’s earnings 
per share.
Adjustments to the EPS will be made in respect of:
 – Constant exchange rates – which will be normalised to the rates in 
the base year
 – Acquisition – earnings will be added to the EPS base at the level 
used in the acquisition business case
 – Disposal – earnings will be removed from the EPS base at the 
business plan rate
 – Share buy back – the company will only execute buy-backs if the 
investment is economically accretive and it is in the interest of 
the company. The adjusted EPS for the purposes of calculating 
performance against the LTIP target shall be further adjusted by
(a)  Increasing the average number of shares in issue during the 
performance year by the number of shares bought back during 
the past three years
(b)  Decreasing the net interest cost in the performance year in 
respect of the interest charge on the cash cost of any share buy 
backs during the past three years.  Interest will be calculated at 
the group’s average costs of funds for the year.
The Remuneration Committee will apply discretion in the event of 
impairment, if the impairment is not a result of management failure, 
then it does not impact the payout.
The Remuneration Committee may alter the terms of the EPS measure 
if it feels that it is no longer a fair measure and is no longer incentivising.
Operating cash fl ow is a measure taken before capital expenditure 
and investments to ensure that management is not incentivised to 
under-invest in growth opportunities. Operating cash fl ow is expressed 
as EBITDA +/- working capital and provisions movement as a 
percentage of EBITA. Average operating cash fl ow is the average 
over three years.
TSR ranking will be verifi ed externally.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
The fees payable to the non-executive directors are set by the 
executive directors and the chairman. The fees payable to the 
non-executive chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee. 
In both cases, fees are reviewed mid-year. Governance

T owers Watson has also provided and will continue to provide 
management remuneration information in respect of senior 
management below the level of the group executive committee. 
The Remuneration Committee has satisfi ed itself as to the 
independence of Deloitte. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration

Herbert Smith Freehills LLP (HSF) provided legal advice to the 
company throughout the year, including in relation to the operation 
of the company’s incentive arrangements and on executive directors’ 
service agreements. This advice was available to be considered by the 
Remuneration Committee. HSF has also advised the Remuneration 
Committee on compliance with the new regulations relating to 
directors’ remuneration. 
The CEO (Nick Buckles to 31 May 2013 and from 1 June 2013, 
Ashley Almanza) provided guidance to the Remuneration Committee 
on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group. 
Further guidance was received from the group’s HR director, Irene 
Cowden, and the director of compensation and benefi ts Sok Wah Lee. 
Neither the CEO nor the HR director participated in discussions 
regarding their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfi ed that the advice it received 
during the year was objective and independent based on the 
experience of its members generally. 
The table below sets out the members of the Remuneration 
Committee who were present during any consideration of directors’ 
remuneration, and shows the number of meetings attended by 
each director:
Name Number of meetings attended

STATEMENT OF VOTING AT GENERAL MEETING 
An ordinary resolution to receive and approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration report contained in the annual report for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 was passed at the company’s annual 
general meeting which took place on 6 June 2013, with 78.4% of the 
votes in favour and 21.58% against. 28,733,156 votes were withheld. 
It is believed that many of the votes against and abstentions were 
prompted by a recommendation from one of the proxy adviser fi rms 
which expressed concern about an increase in the PSP allocations in 
2013. The then chairman of the Remuneration Committee and his 
successor have consulted widely with key shareholders and shareholder 
representatives to explain the rationale for the policy adopted in 2013 
and that proposed for the future. 
Following his appointment as chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Mark Elliott has also undertaken an extensive process 
of consultation with major shareholders on the proposed new LTIP .

to be made within 45 days. 
The company entered into two US Private Placement Note Purchase

448,500,000 and GBP 69,000,000 remain outstanding and will mature 
between 15 July 2015 and 15 July 2020. Under the terms of both USPP 
Agreements, the company is required to offer the note holders to 
purchase the notes at par value together with interest thereon upon 
a change of control.
Under the terms of the GBP 2,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note

carry a sub-investment grade in the period immediately prior to the 
change of control, or in certain circumstances where the MTNs are 
downgraded to sub-investment as a result of the change of control. Governance

7. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE
Research in connection with the development of new services and 
products and the improvement of those currently provided by the 
group is carried out continuously. Research and development written-
off to profi t and loss during the year amounted to £5 million (2012: 
£5 million).
8. EMPLOYEES
High levels of employee engagement are crucial to the success of our 
business. Making our people feel valued and able to contribute fully in 
their roles helps ensure they can deliver excellent customer service and 
in turn improves business performance.
T o measure levels of engagement the company conducts regular 
employee surveys across the organisation. The latest survey, conducted 
in 2013, was the most comprehensive to date, with over 62% (380,000) 
of employees responding. T o encourage employees to participate, the 
survey was offered both online and in a paper version in 31 languages. 
The questions in the survey were based around the employment 
engagement model, or PRIDE, and asked employees to rate the extent 
to which the company takes steps to protect, respect, involve, develop 
and engage them. The responses to these questions showed positive 
improvements, with 82% of employees responding favourably 
compared to 80% when the last employee survey was conducted in 
2011. Having shared the survey results, businesses in each country are 
now implementing the action plans they have developed to address 
areas identifi ed for improvement.
We value the constructive relationships we have with unions globally, 
regionally and locally. With over a third of our employees covered by 
collective agreements, unions provide additional opportunities for 
sharing information with employees on the company’s performance 
and consulting them on decisions likely to affect their interests. 
Protecting our people is a key challenge especially where they work in 
roles and environments where the risk of harm is high. As the reduction 
in work-related fatalities indicates, we have made some progress in 
2013, but there is much more to be done. In 2014 the increased 
resources, improved processes and leadership commitment to health 
and safety will ensure more progress is made.
With employees in six continents and 120 countries, the diversity of 
ideas and thinking available to the business is a competitive advantage 
and one we seek to safeguard by having employment policies and 
procedures that do not discriminate. Creating an inclusive workplace 
where everyone can fl ourish regardless of their background is often an 
important factor that infl uences people’s decision to join, to stay and to 
recommend the company to others. Offering the same opportunities 
for training, development and promotion and making reasonable 
adjustments to support new employees or people who have become 
disabled during the course of their employment with G4S is just one 
example of how we strive to create an inclusive environment.
9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Details of the fi nancial risk management objectives and policies of the 
group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign 
exchange risk are given in note 32 to the consolidated fi nancial 
statements.
10. POLITICAL DONATIONS
Each year shareholders of the company have passed a resolution, on 
a precautionary basis, to allow the company and its subsidiaries to 
make political donations to political organisations or incur political 
expenditure not exceeding £50,000. However, the board confi rms that 
the group’s policy is not to make any fi nancial contribution to political 
parties and that the company and its subsidiaries have made no 
contributions during the year to political parties carrying on activities, 
or to candidates seeking election within the EU, or anywhere else in 
the world.
11. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Our customers and employees demonstrate increasing concern for 
environmental issues. Whilst our environmental impact is not signifi cant 
relative to other businesses of comparable size, it remains important 
to us to be effi cient in the use of resources and, in doing so, to curtail, 
where possible, our greenhouse gas emissions. We are required to 
state the annual quantity of emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent from activities for which the group is responsible, including 
the combustion of fuel and the operation of any facility. Details of our 
emissions for 2013 and information about the group’s actions to reduce 
them are set out on page 46 and form part of the Directors’ report.

13. AUDITOR
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc, chartered accountants, 
as auditor to the company and for their remuneration to be fi xed by 
the directors will be submitted to the annual general meeting. 82 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
14. DIRECTORS
The directors, biographical details of whom are contained on pages 
48 and 49, held offi ce throughout the year with the exception of 
Tim Weller who was appointed to the board on 1 April 2013, Ashley 
Almanza, who was appointed to the board on 1 May 2013, and 
Himanshu Raja who was appointed to the board on 7 October 2013. 
Nick Buckles stepped down from the board on 31 May 2013 and 
Trevor Dighton, Bo Lerenius and Lord Condon retired on 6 June 2013.
In accordance with the code provisions on re-election of directors 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012, each of the directors 
continuing in offi ce will offer themselves for re-election (or, in the case 
of Himanshu Raja, election). The board believes that the directors 
standing for re-election possess experience and expertise relevant to 
the company’s operations; that they continue to be effective; that they 
are committed to the success of the company; and that they should 
be re-elected at the annual general meeting.
Mr Raja has been appointed to the board since the last annual general 
meeting and so he would, in any event, be required to retire in 
accordance with the company’s articles of association. Being eligible, he 
offers himself for election. The board believes that Mr Raja’s extensive 
experience of leading fi nancial discipline in large and complex global 
organisations, strong track record of streamlining fi nancial reporting 
systems and processes to improve controls and visibility of business 
performance and building strong relationships with the investor 
community, adds signifi cant value to the board and therefore 
recommends that he is elected at the annual general meeting.
The contracts of service of the executive directors have no unexpired 
term since they are not for a fi xed term. They are terminable at 
12 months’ notice. None of the non-executive directors has a contract 
of service.
The company has executed deeds of indemnity for the benefi t of each 
of the directors in respect of liabilities which may attach to them in 
their capacity as directors of the company. These deeds are qualifying 
third party indemnity provisions as defi ned by section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and have been in effect since 3 November 2006 
for Mark Elliott, Mark Seligman and Grahame Gibson, 14 June 2010 
for Ms Spottiswoode, 1 October 2010 for Ms Fok, 8 June 2012 for 
Mr Connolly, 1 January 2013 for Messrs Spence and Crozier, 1 April 
2013 for Mr Weller, 1 May 2013 for Mr Almanza and 7 October 2013 
for Mr Raja. Copies of the forms of indemnity are available on the 
company’s website. In addition, indemnities have been granted by the 
company in favour of certain of the directors of certain of the group’s 
subsidiaries in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. The company has 
maintained a directors’ and offi cers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the year under review.
Details of directors’ interests (including the interests of their connected 
persons) in the share capital of G4S plc and of the directors’ 
remuneration are set out on pages 64 to 79. 
The directors who held offi ce at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
report confi rm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware and each 
director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a 
director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
None of the directors had a material interest in any contract signifi cant 
to the business of the group during the fi nancial year.

Directors’ responsibilities
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the group and parent company fi nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company fi nancial statements for each fi nancial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the group fi nancial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company fi nancial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the fi nancial 
statements unless they are satisfi ed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their 
profi t or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and 
parent company fi nancial statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 – for the group fi nancial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
 – for the parent company fi nancial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company fi nancial 
statements; and 
 – prepare the fi nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are suffi cient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
fi nancial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its fi nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and fi nancial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
fi nancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
Each of the directors, the names of whom are set out on pages 48 
and 49 of this annual report, confi rms that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge:
 – the fi nancial statements in this annual report have been prepared in 
accordance with the applicable accounting standards and give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, fi nancial position and profi t of 
the company and the group taken as a whole; and
 – the management report required by DTR4.1.8R (contained in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ report) includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the company and the group taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face
The Strategic Report from the inside front cover to page 47 and pages 
84 to 89 includes information on the group structure, the performance 
of the business and the principal risks and uncertainties it faces. The 
fi nancial statements on pages 94 to 150 include information on the 
group and the company’s fi nancial results, fi nancial outlook, cash fl ow 
and net debt and balance sheet positions. Notes 23, 27, 28, 31 and 32 
to the consolidated fi nancial statements include information on the 
group’s investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, 
fi nancial risk management objectives, hedging policies and exposure to 
interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and market risks. In addition 
to the above, the directors have considered the group’s cash fl ow 
forecasts for the next 12 months. The directors are satisfi ed that 
these cash fl ow forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible risk 
sensitivities associated with them and the group’s current funding and 
facilities and its funding strategy, show that the group will continue to 
operate for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group 
and company will continue to operate within the level of available 
funding for the foreseeable future and it is therefore appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the fi nancial statements.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The statement of directors’ responsibilities and the Strategic Report 
was approved by a duly authorised committee of the board of 
directors on 31 March 2014 and signed on its behalf by Himanshu 
Raja, chief fi nancial offi cer.

Chief Financial Offi cer’s review
A solid underlying 
performance
Himanshu Raja
Chief Financial Offi cer
We also carried out a global fi nancial review of 163 contracts with 
annualised revenues of around £2bn which together with the 
settlement for the UK Electronic Monitoring contracts and two 
smaller contracts resulted in a £136m charge. 
The balance sheet and contract reviews, together with the settlement 
with the MoJ and our restructuring programmes, resulted in a £386m 
charge to profi ts in 2013 and contributed to a decrease in net assets, 
which fell to £919m (2012: £1,231m).
The resulting total PBITA for the year was £56m (2012: £364m).
Cash fl ow from continuing operations improved by 36% to £460m. 
The group has previously highlighted its focus on cash and free cash 
fl ow, and this remains a key target in 2014.
During the year, we also strengthened the fi nancial position of the 
group. The group raised £343m from a 9.99% share placing in August 
and has taken a disciplined approach to managing the portfolio of G4S 
businesses. We disposed of our Colombia secure archiving business. 
T ogether, these steps helped to reduce net debt to £1,533m as at 
31 December 2013. This has also improved the group’s net debt 
to EBITDA ratio to 2.6x. Since the end of the year, we have also 
completed the divestment of businesses in Norway and Canada, 
raising net proceeds of £89m. 
Underlying EPS was 14.7p against 15.8p in 2012 and total loss per 
share was 24.9p, compared with earnings per share of 2.9p in 2012. 
The group has declared a fi nal dividend of 5.54p (2012: 5.54p), making 
the total dividend for the year 8.96p (2012: 8.96p). 
This section presents a summary of our fi nancial 
performance, providing commentary on the group’s 
underlying and reported results. During the year, the 
group took the opportunity to enhance its results 
presentation by separately disclosing the underlying 
business performance from restructuring and other 
specifi c items.
“ Our strong market positions and focus on 
operational excellence, operating cost reduction 
and cash fl ow generation, provide a platform for 
sustainable growth in profi t and cash fl ow in the 
medium term.”
INTRODUCTION
The continued opportunities we see in our emerging and developed 
markets are mirrored in the fi nancial results. The group’s underlying 
revenue increased by 5.8%. Emerging markets grew by 16% and now 
represent 37% of the group’s total revenue and 44% of the group’s 
underlying PBITA. In our developed markets, revenue overall was fl at 
on 2012, with growth of 2% in the UK & Ireland, no change in North 
America and Europe down 2%. 
Underlying PBITA was £442m
1
, an increase on £430m
2
 in 2012, 
refl ecting solid progress during the year. In the fourth quarter, we 
accelerated the restructuring of some of our businesses which, together 
with the actions taken in the fi rst-half, resulted in a restructuring 
charge of £68m for the full year. This will help to improve the market 
competitiveness of those businesses and improve profi tability, with 
paybacks generally in the range of 12-36 months.
In terms of specifi c items, we undertook an extensive review of the 
balance sheet to assess the carrying value of the group’s assets and 
liabilities. This resulted in a total specifi c items charge of £182m to 
PBITA and a £46m charge to goodwill impairment. The balance sheet 
at 31 December 2013 is therefore on a more balanced footing. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 85 
Strengthening our capability 
The group has grown rapidly, both organically and through acquisition, 
resulting in considerable variation in fi nancial capability, operational 
systems and processes across the world, including manual processes. 
We are committed to maintaining disciplined fi nancial management.
We have begun a process of change to signifi cantly strengthen our 
fi nance capability by bringing in people with experience of operating 
in a global fi nance organisation. We are also moving to regional shared 
service centres which will further strengthen the control environment 
and bring greater consistency to our fi nance operations, whilst at the 
same time reducing costs. The shared service centres will act as a 
platform to bring further activities into shared service environments 
to get the benefi ts of scale in being part of a large global organisation. 
On the operational front, we are committed to standardising certain 
operational processes and procedures across the business. These 
include programmes on direct labour effi ciency, organisational effi ciency, 
vehicle route planning, telematics, IT standardisation and procurement. 
Over time this will drive operational improvement and reduce costs at 
the same time. 
Outlook 
Demand for the group’s services and products remains robust, as 
refl ected in 5.8% revenue growth and the potential in the global sales 
pipeline of £5 billion. (see page 19).
Our focus in 2014 is to continue to invest in organic growth and 
operational capacity and for the on-going and accelerated restructuring 
of a number of our businesses to begin to deliver benefi ts in 2014. 
In the medium term we expect the group to deliver attractive revenue 
growth and we expect that operational actions across a wide range 
of areas will underpin our plans to deliver sustainable growth in profi t 
and cash fl ow in the medium term. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read 
in conjunction with, the consolidated fi nancial statements, including the 
related notes, that form part of this annual report. The consolidated 
fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the EU. A reconciliation of 
non-EU IFRS prior period results is set out on page 86.

Chief Financial Offi cer’s review continued
Prior year reconciliation from total to underlying results
Prior year results have been re-presented to clearly show the impact 
of net charges arising from the balance sheet review of assets and 
liabilities performed in 2013 (more details are given in note 3), 
restructuring costs and the Olympics contract. The group considers 
that this presentation provides readers with a clearer understanding 
of comparative underlying performance and trends. A reconciliation 
of reported statutory results to underlying results is set out below. 
The £40m prior year impact of the review of assets and liabilities 
in 2013 relates mainly to a write-down of receivables and 
obsolescent inventory.

Organic growth was 4.7%. Contributions from acquisitions in South 
Africa and Indonesia in 2013 and a current year benefi t from 
acquisitions in Brazil in 2012 helped the group’s underlying revenue 
increase by 5.8%. Emerging markets grew by 16% and now represent 
37% of the group’s total revenue (2012: 34%). In our developed 
markets, revenue overall was fl at on 2012, with 2% growth in the UK,

(2012: 20.8%) for the year ended 31 December 2013. Developed 
markets declined 120 basis points to 18.8% (2012: 20.0%) mainly as 
a result of challenging economic conditions in the UK and Europe 
and the impact of Federal spending cuts affecting both our secure 
solutions and technologies businesses in the US. Emerging markets

Contracts review 
A global fi nancial review of 163 contracts with annualised revenues 
of around £2bn, which together with the settlement for the UK 
Electronic Monitoring contracts and two smaller contracts resulted 
in a £136m charge. 
Review of assets and liabilities
A review of the group’s assets and liabilities was initiated in the fi rst 
half of 2013, resulting in a PBITA charge of £132m. This was extended 
to cover all legal entities during the second half of the year. Completion 
of this review resulted in a further charge of £50m, bringing the 
full-year charge to PBITA of £182m. The total charge related principally 
to impairment of fi xed assets, inventory obsolescence, write down 
of receivables and the recognition of employer related liabilities. 
The group’s balance sheet is therefore on a more balanced footing 
as at 31 December 2013.
Restructuring
Following the strategic review over the summer, we identifi ed 
opportunities to signifi cantly enhance the competitiveness of some 
of our businesses and to reduce overheads, specifi cally in the UK & 
Ireland and in certain European operations, resulting in £35m of 
restructuring programmes announced in August 2013. 
Acceleration of the restructuring programme in the fourth quarter, 
primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium and Finland, resulted in additional 
charges of £33m. 
Amortisation and impairment 
Acquisition-related intangible assets included in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2013 consisted of £1,966m goodwill, £137m customer-
related intangible assets and £4m other intangible assets.
The charge for the year for the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets other than goodwill amounted to £72m (2012: £84m).
Goodwill is not amortised, but it is tested for impairment annually. As a 
result of the group’s impairment test for the year ended 31 December 
2013, the group incurred an impairment charge of £46m to continuing 
operations (mainly relating to the technology business in Brazil; see 
note 19 on page 117 for details) and a further £80m to discontinued 
operations (relating to the US Government Solutions business; see 
note 7 on page 108 for details).  Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 87 
Net fi nance expense
Net interest payable on net debt was £108m. This is a net increase 
of 2.9% over the prior year cost of £105m, principally due to the 
increase in the group’s average gross debt in the fi rst-half of the year. 
The pension interest charge was £20m (2012: £15m), resulting in total 
net fi nance costs of £128m (2012: £120m). 
The group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2013, net of interest 
rate hedging, was 4.1%, compared to 4.3% in 2012. The cost based on 
prevailing interest rates at 31 December 2013 was 3.7%, compared to 
3.9% at 31 December 2012.
Taxation
The underlying taxation charge of £75m represents an effective tax 
rate of 24%, an increase from 22% in 2012. The cash tax rate is 
18% compared to 23% in 2012. 
The group’s target is to maintain the effective tax rate in the short 
term. The amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets gives rise 
to the release of the related proportion of the deferred tax liability 
established when the assets were acquired, amounting to £21m 
(2012: £25m). 
Disposals and discontinued operations
In August 2013, the group sold its Colombian secure archiving business 
for £34m and its cash business in Slovakia for £1m. In January 2014 
the group completed the sale of its cash solutions business in Canada 
and its remaining business in Norway for total proceeds of £89m. 
The cash solutions business in Canada, the business in Norway and the 
US Government Solutions business were classifi ed as held for sale as 
at 31 December 2013 and therefore their results have been included 
within discontinued operations in the income statement.
The classifi ed US Government Solutions business continues to be 
classifi ed within discontinued operations as at 31 December 2013 as 
it was held for sale at that date. Due to the restrictions on US 
Government spend during the year, the sale process has been 
extended but the group is confi dent a sale will be fi nalised in 2014.
During the prior year the group disposed of its cash solutions business 
in Sweden in February 2012, its businesses in Poland in September 
2012, its justice services businesses in the United States and Canada 
in April 2012 and its security solutions business in Pakistan in 
October 2012.
The total loss from discontinued operations of £116m (2012: £56m) 
includes a post-tax trading loss of £11m, restructuring costs of £2m 
and an impairment charge of £103m, of which £80m relates to 
goodwill impairment in the US Government Solutions business. 
The contribution to the turnover and operating profi t of the group 
from discontinued operations is shown in note 6 on page 106 and 
their contribution to net profi t and cash fl ows is detailed in note 7 
on page 108.
Consolidation of subsidiaries
The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, often 
driven by local laws and regulations relating to foreign ownership. 
As set out in note 3 and on pages 103 to 104, the group has not 
adopted early the new consolidation standards, IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
Financial Statements’ and IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. Had the group 
applied IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, revenue would have been £317m lower 
(2012: £277m lower) and PBITA would have been £32m lower at 
£410 (2012: £27m lower at £443m). As shown on page 104, profi t 
to equity holders would have been unchanged.
Non-controlling interests 
Profi t attributable to non-controlling interests was £20m in 2013, a 
slight decrease on £22m for 2012, mainly due to the partners’ share 
of specifi c charges in the year.

Underlying earnings per share was 14.7p compared to 15.8p in the 
prior year. T otal loss per share was 24.9p (2012: earnings per share

A reconciliation of the total and underlying EPS is provided in 
note 16. Underlying earnings, as analysed in note 16 on page 112, 
excludes the result from discontinued operations, amortisation and 
impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related 
costs and non-underlying items, all net of tax. This better allows the 
assessment of operational performance, the analysis of trends over 
time, the comparison of different businesses and the projection of 
future performance.

Cash generated from continuing operations was £460m (2012: £337m) 
resulting from improved working capital management and the receipt 
of £76m relating to the Olympics contract, offset by approximately 
£60m of payments which were deferred from December 2012 to 
January 2013 and from £27m of receivables withheld as at the year-end 
in relation to the UK electronic monitoring contracts.
Net investment in the business was £211m (2012: £226m). The main 
areas of investment have been in vehicles and plant and equipment, 
together with investment in new contracts and also includes £35m on 
acquisitions, mainly in the fi rst-half of 2013, with a number of smaller 
cash solutions acquisitions in South Africa and Indonesia. 
Tax paid was £88m (2012: £85m), interest paid was £110m (2012: 
£111m) and group shareholder dividend payments were £130m 
(2012: £120m).
Net cash fl ow was £284m (2012: outfl ow of £186m) resulting in an 
improved net debt of £1,533m.
Net debt
The net debt position as at 31 December 2013 was £1,533m (2012: 
£1,802m) resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6x. The decrease 
of £269m is principally attributable to the improvement in net cash 
fl ow after investing in the business and the proceeds of the share 
placing, offset by interest, tax and dividend payments.
Net debt maturity
The group’s funding position is strong, with committed but undrawn 
facilities of £965m and with no signifi cant debt maturing before 2016.

COMMITTED FUNDING – 
MATURITY PROFILE (£m) at 31 December 2013*
The group’s primary sources of bank fi nance are a £1.1bn multi-
currency revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of lending 
banks at a margin of 1.30% over LIBOR and maturing 10 March 2016. 
The group also has US $550m in fi nancing from the private placement 
of unsecured senior loan notes on 1 March 2007, maturing at various 
dates between 2014 and 2022 and bearing interest at rates between 
5.77% and 6.06%. The fi xed interest rates payable have been swapped 
into fl oating rates for the term of the notes, at an average margin of 
0.60% over LIBOR.
On 15 July 2008, the group completed a further US $514m and £69m 
private placement of unsecured senior loan notes. $449m and £69m 
remain outstanding, maturing at various dates between 2015 and 2020 
and bearing interest at rates between 6.43% and 7.56%. US $200m of 
the loan note proceeds have been swapped into £101m fi xed rate 
sterling for the term of the notes.
On 13 May 2009, the group issued a £350m note bearing an interest 
rate of 7.75% and maturing in 2019.
On 2 May 2012, the group issued a Euro 600m note bearing an interest 
rate of 2.875% and maturing in 2017. €325m was swapped into £266m 
fi xed rate sterling and the interest rate on €90m was swapped to a 
fl oating rate linked to six month EURIBOR.
On 6 December 2012, the group issued a €500m note bearing an 
interest rate of 2.625% and maturing in 2018. €350m was swapped 
into £284m fi xed rate sterling and the interest rate on €120m was 
swapped to a fl oating rate linked to six month EURIBOR.
The group’s net debt at 31 December 2013 was £1,533m. The group’s 
committed but unutilised facilities at 31 December 2013 were £965m. 
The group has suffi cient capacity to fi nance its normal funding and 
current investment plans.
Credit rating 
The group’s credit rating was revised by Standard & Poor’s from 
BBB- (Negative) to BBB- (Stable) on 4 September 2013.
Dividend
The directors recommend a fi nal dividend of 5.54p (DKK 0.4954) 
per share, unchanged from 2012. The interim dividend was 3.42p 
(DKK 0.2972) per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 
8.96p (DKK 0.7926)per share, unchanged from 2012.
The proposed dividend cover is 1.6 times (2012: 2.4 times) on adjusted 
earnings. The board’s intention is that dividends will increase broadly in 
line with underlying earnings over the medium term.

OTHER INFORMATION
Pensions
As at 31 December 2013 the defi ned benefi t pension obligation on the 
balance sheet was £504m (2012: £471m), or £405m net of tax (2012: 
£367m) of which £472m (2012: £436m) related to material funded 
defi ned benefi t schemes. The most signifi cant pension scheme is in the 
UK and accounts for 95% (2012: 95%) of the total material scheme 
obligation. The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further 
details of the make up of the scheme are given in note 33 on page 129.

Scheme assets 1,564 1,474 90
Obligation (2,013) (1,886) (127)
T otal UK obligation (449) (412) 37
The movement in the UK scheme was as a result of scheme obligations 
increasing by £127m partly offset by an increase of £90m in the value 
of scheme assets arising from contributions paid to the scheme during 
the year and an increase in underlying asset values. The increase in the 
obligation is mainly due to actuarial losses incurred in the year resulting 
from discount rates decreasing to 4.4% (2012: 4.5%), infl ation rates 
increasing to 3.4% (2012: 3.0%) and a change in demographic 
assumptions during the year. 
The group made payments of £38m (2012: £37m) into the scheme 
during the year. Following the recent triennial valuation, the group 
agreed with the Trustees to increase next year’s annual defi cit recovery 
payment to £42m and extended the term of these payments from 
2022 to 2024. The next triennial valuation is in 2015. 
Due to the nature and materiality of the group’s pension schemes 
certain risks exist as detailed further in note 33 on page 130.
Financing and treasury activities
The group’s treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability 
of cost-effective fi nance and for managing the group’s fi nancial risk 
arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit. 
Treasury is not a profi t centre and it is not permitted to speculate in 
fi nancial instruments. The treasury department’s policies are set by the 
board. Treasury is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it 
manages. These risks are discussed in note 32 on pages 124 to 127.
T o assist the effi cient management of the group’s interest costs, the 
group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management 
system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A+ rated bank. At 
year-end, credit balances of £425m were pooled with debit balances of 
£422m, resulting in a net pool credit balance of £3m. There is legal right 
of set off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of £3m.
Interest rate risks and interest rate swaps
The group’s investments and borrowings at 31 December 2013 were 
at a mix of fi xed rates of interest and fl oating rates of interest linked 
to LIBOR and EURIBOR. 
The private placement notes in March 2007 and July 2008 and the 
public notes in May 2009, May 2012 and December 2012 were all 
issued at fi xed rates, whilst the group’s investments and bank 
borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR 
and EURIBOR. 
The group’s interest risk policy requires treasury to fi x a proportion of 
its interest exposure on a sliding scale in US dollars, sterling and euro, 
using the natural mix of fi xed and fl oating interest rates emanating 
from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest rate and 
cross currency swaps. The proceeds of the private placement notes 
issued in March 2007 and part of the public notes issued in May 2012 
and December 2012 were swapped to fl oating interest rates and 
accounted for as fair value hedges, with a net gain at 31 December 
2013 of £45m. The market value of the pay-fi xed receive-variable 
swaps and the pay-fi xed receive-fi xed cross currency swaps outstanding 
at 31 December 2013, accounted for as cash fl ow hedges, was a net 
gain of £40m. 
Foreign currency 
The group has many overseas subsidiaries and associates denominated 
in various different currencies. Treasury policy is to manage signifi cant 
translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated 
net debt/EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, 
where possible. The group no longer uses foreign exchange contracts 
to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans. 
The group believes cash fl ow should not be put at risk by these 
instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets. 
At 31 December 2013, the group’s US dollar and euro net assets were 
approximately 59% and 82% respectively, hedged by foreign currency 
loans. As at 31 December 2013, net debt held in US dollar and euro 
and in those currencies offi cially pegged to these two currencies 
equated broadly to a ratio of 2 times the EBITDA generated from 
these currencies. 
If year-end 31 December 2013 exchange rates were used for 2013, 
underlying PBITA would have been £422m, a reduction from £442m 
due to a strengthening of the relative value of sterling.
Exchange differences on the translation of foreign operations included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income amount to a 
loss of £109m (2012: £95m). 
Corporate governance 
The group’s policies regarding risk management and corporate 
governance are set out in the Corporate governance report on 
pages 52 to 60.
Going concern 
The directors are confi dent that, after making enquiries and on the 
basis of current fi nancial projections and available facilities, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the fi nancial statements.

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED 
We have audited the fi nancial statements of G4S plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 94 to 150. In our opinion:
 – the fi nancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 – the group fi nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union; 
 – the parent company fi nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
 – the fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the group 
fi nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the fi nancial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit 
were as follows:
Presentation of the income statement
Refer to page 61 (Audit Committee Report), page 98 (accounting policy) and page 108 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – In order to give better understanding of the underlying performance of the business, management have presented a view of the 
underlying results of the group, with separate disclosure of specifi c items. There is a risk that items included within ‘restructuring’ and ‘specifi c 
items’ are not in accordance with clearly disclosed group accounting policies and therefore the ‘underlying’ result is misstated. There is a related 
presentation risk concerning discontinued operations and held for sale assets and liabilities which are further considered below.
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, inter alia, providing detailed instructions to all in-scope audit teams on the defi nitions 
of items that can be included within these income statement categories to assist them in their assessment of specifi c items identifi ed in their 
components. We considered and challenged the work of the group fi nance team in reviewing with the regional and local fi nance teams the basis 
of any specifi c items. In doing so we critically assessed their accuracy and presentation of specifi c items taking into account their policy, considered 
the appropriateness, by reference to accounting standards, of the individual items presented within these categories and therefore excluded from 
‘underlying results’ at both the local and group levels.
We have also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about the items included within ‘restructuring’ and ‘specifi c items’ in notes 8 
(specifi c items) and 34 (restructuring) and the related accounting policies for these categories on page 98 and on page 101.
Risk of management override of internal controls
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report).
The risk – The de-centralised structure of the group and the manual nature of many accounting entries means there is a higher risk of management 
override of fi nancial controls. There is also a risk of management bias within judgements and estimates including those related to the other risks 
discussed in this report. The application of management override or biased judgements could be infl uenced by targets on which bonuses are paid 
which could be signifi cant to the relevant individuals. This risk affects all areas of the fi nancial statements.
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, among others, extending the scope of our audit to include businesses where we see 
a risk of management bias or override of controls (see below). We also mandated certain key audit procedures be performed by all in-scope audit 
teams to assist in the identifi cation of management override of fi nancial controls within the local books and records. We tested the reconciliations 
from the group consolidation package to the local books and records for 84% of the group including for those businesses out of scope for the 
group audit, performed testing on manual journals within all in-scope businesses, performed testing on the group consolidation system, identifying 
and testing signifi cant unusual transactions and assessing indications of management bias in judgements and estimates. This work was performed 
with assistance from our Forensic Accounting specialists. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 91 
Revenue recognition particularly on UK Government contracts and related provisions
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), page 102 (accounting policy) and page 134 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – The group delivers outsourcing services that can be complex in nature and may be governed by unique and complex contractual 
arrangements. In these circumstances there is a heightened risk of inaccurate billing and revenue recognition. In particular the group was subject 
to a number of inquiries in relation to the accuracy of billing and services provided on certain of its UK Government contracts. There was an 
investigation into an electronic monitoring contract where the Ministry of Justice alleged the group has overcharged for certain aspects of the 
services. There was a risk that revenue recognition on these contracts is not in accordance with contractual entitlements and therefore provisions 
may be required for refunds due (e.g. to the UK Government) or costs of termination. There was further a risk that the provisions for refunds are 
not appropriately disclosed and presented. 
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing the sales process on complex and signifi cant contracts 
in order to critically assess controls over process risks which might lead to revenue recognition issues, and comparing the contractual terms 
of the relevant agreements to the accounting treatment adopted. We made inquiries with contract managers and reviewed customer 
correspondence to identify, investigate and evaluate any areas of dispute or subjectivity within contracts and related billing, meeting with the 
company’s legal advisors to discuss their advice on any areas of interpretation within the contract. We also considered the recovery of signifi cant 
overdue receivables including seeking external evidence of likely recovery, taking into account the ageing of receivables and comparing any 
provision to recovery levels post year end.
We inspected correspondence with the Government and its appointed advisers. Based on those inquiries we recalculated the quantum of 
potential exposures and critically assessed the judgements made by management as to the provision made for the settlement of any and all claims 
arising from these contracts.
Full and fi nal settlement in respect of the Ministry of Justice claims was reached in March 2014. We have evaluated the adequacy of the group’s 
disclosures about the UK Government settlement and amounts recognised within the fi nancial statements as revenue and provisions.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), page 98 and 105 (accounting policy) and pages 140 and 141 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – The group is required to comply with sometimes complex or imprecise foreign ownership rules in the countries in which it operates. 
There is a risk that the rules may be interpreted in different ways. In some instances the group operates through local structures with limited 
direct share ownership of the business but exercising control through shareholder agreements. These structures can mean there is a higher 
level of judgement required in deciding whether or not to consolidate the underlying business or treat the operation as a joint venture/
associate/investment. 
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, inter alia, understanding the structure of local businesses and evaluating whether they 
are in compliance with local foreign ownership rules involving local lawyers where applicable. We also challenge the Directors’ conclusions on 
whether or not consolidation was appropriate by comparing the rights bestowed by share ownership and all related ownership and management 
agreements to the requirements set out in the relevant accounting standards.
We have also evaluated the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about the degree of judgement as to which businesses can be consolidated 
in note 4 and the reasons for consolidating those businesses with less than 50% ownership in note 3 and note 43.
Recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), page 100 (accounting policy) and page 115 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – The group has £2.2 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. Although the majority of this relates to business units where the 
carrying value is exceeded by the calculated Value In Use by a signifi cant margin, in the current economic environment there is a risk of impairment 
related to particular business units within the group. The estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generating units requires signifi cant 
judgement in relation to the appropriate discount rates, growth rates, terminal values, forecast cashfl ows and, where the fair value less costs 
to sell approach is used, the appropriate fair value multiple. 
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, among others, challenging the forecast earnings and cash fl ows over the fi ve year 
forecast period, for example by comparison to historic results and budgets and by seeking explanations for any assumed trends and growth rates. 
We also challenged the discount rates and terminal values and, where a fair value less costs to sell approach is used, challenged the multiples 
employed. Where possible we compared the group’s assumptions to externally derived data. Our valuations specialists assisted in the evaluation 
of the more subjective and material cash generating units. We challenged the group’s sensitivities to help us assess whether the key assumptions 
and drivers considered are correctly identifi ed. We compared the group’s aggregate recoverable amount to its market capitalisation.
We have also assessed the adequacy of the group’s disclosures on goodwill impairments (see note 19) and considered whether the sensitivity 
analysis provided properly refl ects the risks inherent within the estimate of the recoverable amount of goodwill. 92 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Discontinued operations and held for sale assets and liabilities
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee Report), page 103 (accounting policy) and pages 108 and 121 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – The group often has business disposals underway at any reporting date. Given the judgement involved, there is a risk that any such 
businesses may not meet the accounting standard’s criteria for presentation as discontinued at the balance sheet date as either they are not 
a separate major line of business, the Directors are not committed to the sale and that sale is not highly probable, or the business has not 
been exited. 
The results of discontinued businesses are presented below profi t before tax on the face of the income statement and therefore any profi ts/losses 
from discontinued businesses are not included within underlying PBITA being the group’s own key fi nancial KPI. Were the group to incorrectly 
classify a loss making business as discontinued a higher underlying PBITA would result. 
For the US Government Solutions business, which is presented as held for sale, the calculation of the fair value less costs to sell is subject 
to judgement due to a range of potential sales prices and assumptions around the method and quantum of recovery of working capital balances. 
This subjectivity creates a risk around the determination of an appropriate fair value for the business and therefore the appropriate 
impairment recognised. 
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, amongst others, using our knowledge of the business to perform an assessment 
of whether the businesses constitute separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operations. We also obtained and evaluated 
evidence to critically challenge the level of the Directors’ commitment to sell the businesses classifi ed as held for sale and to critically challenge 
the probability of those sales at the balance sheet date. We sought external evidence of likely sales prices and compared these to the net book 
value of the held for sale assets and liabilities to assess whether any further impairment was required. For those businesses being wound down 
and therefore being classifi ed as discontinued on the basis that the business has been exited, we sought external evidence that the group 
is no longer operating that business.
We have also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about discontinued operations and held for sale assets in notes 7 and 26.
Taxation exposures and provisions
Refer to page 63 (Audit Committee Report), page 102 (accounting policy) and page 111 (fi nancial disclosures).
The risk – The group is required to make estimates of tax provisions in jurisdictions and/or circumstances where the application of the tax rules 
is complex, uncertain and in some cases inconsistent.
Our response – Our audit procedures included, consideration of each signifi cant exposure on a case by case basis taking into account our 
understanding of the facts, any specifi c advice the group has received, past experience and any relevant observations of our tax specialists. 
Using this information we conducted a critical review of the group’s judgement as to the provision required. We have also evaluated the adequacy 
of the group’s disclosures about the tax provisions and contingencies in note 14 and the level of estimation uncertainty in the tax provisions 
in note 3(r).
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The materiality for the group fi nancial statements as a whole was set at £10m. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of group 
loss before tax, adjusted for non-recurring items including ‘restructuring costs’, ‘specifi c items’ and ‘goodwill impairment’, which we consider to be 
one of the principal considerations for members of the company in assessing the fi nancial performance of the group. Materiality represents 4.9% 
of group profi t before tax adjusted for these items and 4.4% of group profi t before tax from continuing operations as disclosed on the face of the 
income statement.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identifi ed through our audit with a value in 
excess of £0.5m for errors impacting profi t and in excess of £4m for balance sheet only misclassifi cations, in addition to other audit misstatements 
below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed by component auditors at the key reporting components in 42 countries. In addition, 
specifi ed audit procedures were performed by component auditors in a further 42 countries. These group procedures covered:
Group revenue
Audit for group reporting purposes 81%
Specifi c audit procedures 13%
Not covered 6%
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the group were all performed to materiality levels set by, 
or agreed with, the group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged from £0.02m to £5m. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all the auditors in these locations. These instructions covered the signifi cant audit areas that should be 
covered by these audits (which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) and set out the information required to 
be reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team visited the following locations: the Philippines, Ireland, South Africa, Botswana, 
Peru, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India, Belgium, Finland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Telephone meetings were also held with the auditors of 25 
signifi cant countries as part of the planning process and a further 22 high risk countries as part of the audit close out process.

4. OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion: 
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the fi nancial year for which the fi nancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the fi nancial statements. 
5.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT OF THE MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED 
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identifi ed 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the fi nancial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 – we have identifi ed material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
that the annual report and fi nancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 – the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the parent company fi nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specifi ed by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 83, in relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 53 in the Chairman’s letter relating to the company’s compliance 
with the nine provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code specifi ed for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities. 
SCOPE OF REPORT AND RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 83, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the fi nancial statements and for being satisfi ed that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of fi nancial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at

Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated fi nancial statements incorporate 
the fi nancial statements of the company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the company (collectively comprising the group) and the 
group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year. The group operates throughout the world and 
in a wide range of functional currencies, the most signifi cant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling. The group’s fi nancial statements are 
presented in sterling, as the group’s primary listing is in the UK. The address of the registered offi ce is given on page 160.
2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The consolidated fi nancial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted 
by the European Union (adopted IFRSs). The company has elected to prepare its parent company fi nancial statements in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). These are presented on pages 142 to 150.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated fi nancial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except 
for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and fi nancial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. Judgements 
made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a signifi cant effect on the fi nancial statements, and estimates with 
a signifi cant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4. The directors are confi dent that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current 
fi nancial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Further information on the going concern assessment is given in note 32 on pages 124 to 127.
In preparing the fi nancial statements the notes to the accounts have been presented with regard to the principles set out in the Financial Reporting 
Council’s publication ‘Cutting Clutter’ to make the fi nancial statements easier to follow and more intuitive to provide readers with a clearer 
understanding of the fi nancial performance of the group.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued during 
the current year. Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by £273m and PBT has decreased by £7m compared to the fi gures 
published previously. Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7. In addition, the comparative consolidated statement 
of fi nancial position as at 31 December 2012 has been restated to refl ect the completion during 2013 of the initial accounting in respect of 
acquisitions made during 2012. Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to £15m, 
with an equivalent decrease in the reported value of goodwill. The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17. 
(b) Changes in presentation of the income statement
During the year the group has enhanced its presentation of business performance by separately disclosing ‘underlying results’. Underlying results 
exclude specifi c items and for the prior year re-present the effect of one-off credits relating to fair value and other provision releases. 
The group’s income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specifi c items. Specifi c items are those that in 
management’s judgement need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In determining whether an event or 
transaction is specifi c, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. 
Specifi c items include items relating to acquisitions and disposals including amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, 
discontinued operations, restructuring costs and impairments and other one-off items such as the review of the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities performed in 2013 or the impact of the Olympics contract in the prior year.
This is consistent with the way that fi nancial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and assists in providing 
a meaningful analysis of the underlying results of the group. The directors believe that presentation of the group’s results in this way is relevant 
to an understanding of the group’s fi nancial performance, as specifi c items are identifi ed by virtue of their size, nature or i ncidence. Any reversal 
arising from a recovery of previously impaired assets will also fl ow through specifi c items such that the underlying results refl ect the ongoing 
recurring results of the business.
Specifi c items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specifi c items for the current and prior years are disclosed in note 8.
(c) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the fi nancial and operating policies 
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefi ts from its activities, determined either by the group’s ownership percentage, or by the terms of any 
shareholder agreement. In the case of certain investments detailed analysis of the different contracts in place is required, together with a level 
of judgement, to ascertain whether there is control under the defi nition of IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (see note 4).
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred as consideration to the vendor and does not 
include transaction costs. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Any defi ciency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to 
the income statement in the year of acquisition. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 99 
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of put options held 
by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition. For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the 
present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon fi nal settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments 
to the cost of acquisition. For acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement with respect to contingent 
consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options. Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the 
fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Profi ts and losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest 
of the parent and to the non-controlling interest. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Joint ventures 
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, 
in that strategic, fi nancial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties. 
The group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the group’s share of the results 
and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the group’s consolidated fi nancial statements. 
Associates 
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise signifi cant infl uence, but not control or joint control, through participation 
in the fi nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the group’s consolidated fi nancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition 
changes in the group’s share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the associates 
in excess of the group’s interest in those associates are not recognised. 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Where a group company transacts with a joint venture 
or associate of the group, profi ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the relevant joint venture or associate. 
(d) Foreign currencies 
The fi nancial statements of each of the group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business. T ransactions in 
currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their 
acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated into sterling 
at the average exchange rates for the period (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). Exchange differences arising are recognised 
in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the group’s net 
investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to 
the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective. On disposal, translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period 
in which the operation is disposed of. 
(e) Derivative fi nancial instruments and hedge accounting 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative fi nancial instruments to manage the group’s exposure to fi nancial 
risk, not for trading purposes. Such fi nancial risk includes the interest risk on the group’s variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the group’s 
fi xed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the 
group’s results and on the translation of the group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies. The group manages these risks through a range 
of derivative fi nancial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fi xed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign 
exchange contracts and currency swaps. 
Derivative fi nancial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position as fi nancial assets or liab ilities at fair value. 
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge 
accounting. Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item 
being hedged as described below. 
Fair value hedge 
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Cash fl ow and net investment hedges 
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity 
and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash fl ow or hedged net investment impacts the income statement. 
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.  100 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements continued
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(f) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method. Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifi able assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, 
associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition. No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling 
interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction. Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and 
is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate 
or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profi t or loss on disposal. 
Acquisition-related intangible assets 
Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships. The fair value 
of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, 
or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method. 
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life. The directors review 
acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Trademarks and technology    up to a maximum of fi ve years
Customer contracts and customer relationships   up to a maximum of ten years
Other intangible assets 
Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group. Such expenditure is recognised 
as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifi able asset, its cost can be measured reliably, 
it is probable that it will generate future economic benefi ts, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has suffi cient resources 
to complete development. In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, 
up to a maximum of ten years. The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, 
provide for any impairment in value. 
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. 
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on software 
so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic 
lives up to a maximum of eight years. 
(g) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided 
on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their 
estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings   up to 50 years
Short leasehold buildings (under 50 years)    over the life of the lease 
Equipment and motor vehicles    2 to 10 years
Assets held under fi nance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the expected useful economic life and the term of the relevant lease. 
Where signifi cant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually. 
(h) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and fi nancial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value. The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through 
the use of a bad debt allowance account. The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due, in accordance 
with local conditions and past default experience. 
Service concession assets 
Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or similar project, the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the 
purchaser of the associated services. In such cases, the group’s interest in the asset is classifi ed as a fi nancial asset and included at its discounted 
value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the 
concession for the construction of the asset. T o the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon 
the extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset. 
Current asset investments 
Current asset investments comprise investments in securities which are classifi ed as held-for-trading. They are initially recognised at cost, 
including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the 
income statement.  Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 101 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral 
part of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ow. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using 
the effective interest method. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
(i) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business 
in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads. Cost is calculated using either the weighted 
average or the fi rst-in-fi rst-out method. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred 
to completion and disposal. 
(j) Impairment 
The carrying value of the group’s assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any 
indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount. The amount of the reversal is limited such that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed that which would have been determined (after depreciation and amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
(k) Employee benefi ts 
Retirement benefi t costs 
Payments to defi ned contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefi t 
schemes are dealt with as payments to defi ned contribution schemes where the group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those 
arising in a defi ned contribution retirement benefi ts scheme. 
The retirement benefi t obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position represents the present value of the defi ned 
benefi t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from the calculation 
is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
For defi ned benefi t plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and past service cost. 
The fi nance element of the pension charge is shown in fi nance expense and the remaining service cost element is charged as a component 
of employee costs in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses and other remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately 
in full through the statement of comprehensive income. 
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date 
of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number 
of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions. 
(l) Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the 
amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount recognised as a provision is the group’s best estimate of the cost of settlement 
at the end of the reporting period. 
In respect of claims and litigation, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outfl ow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable 
estimate can be made of the likely outcome. For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon 
the eventual outcome of any settlement. Management exercise judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 34) 
through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of fi nancial outcomes.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate 
discount rate. 
(m) Restructuring provision
A restructuring provision is recognised when the group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those 
affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are 
those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. 102 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements continued
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(n) Revenue recognition 
Revenue 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value 
of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue for manned security and cash solutions 
products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to refl ect the period in which the service is provided. Revenue 
on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion 
method in respect of construction contracts. 
Construction contracts 
Where signifi cant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured either by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to 
date bear to the estimated total contract costs or by the proportion that the sales value of work completed to date bears to the total sales value. 
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred. Where it is probable that 
total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement. 
Construction contracts are recognised in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position at cost plus profi t recognised to date, less provision 
for foreseeable losses and less progress billings. Balances are not offset. 
(o) Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts incurred after the point at which the group achieves preferred bidder status 
(at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained) are capitalised and expensed over the life of the contract subject to 
recoverability criteria. Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the event that 
preferred bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract.
(p) Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfi lling the contract throughout the contract 
period exceed the forecast income receivable. Management plans to recover the position on loss-making contracts require a level of judgement 
and are only taken into account in the calculation of the onerous contract provision when implementation has commenced and tangible evidence 
exists of benefi ts being delivered. The provision is calculated based on discounted cash fl ows to the end of the contract.
In-year losses from onerous contracts will continue to be reported in underlying earnings as they are incurred, whilst provisions for future losses 
on onerous contract provisions will be charged and unwound through specifi c items.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant. 
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash fl ows to the end of the lease taking into account expected future sub-lease income.
(q) Interest 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. This is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the fi nancial asset’s net carrying amount. Borrowing costs are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement.
(r) Income taxes 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity 
or other comprehensive income. The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
Current tax is based on taxable profi t for the year. Taxable profi t differs from net profi t as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the consolidated fi nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profi t, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that suffi cient taxable profi ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretation of tax legislation and 
uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainty exists, provision is made for contingent tax liabilities 
and assets on the basis of management judgement following consideration of the available relevant information. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 103 
(s) Leasing
Leases are classifi ed as fi nance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
On occasion this classifi cation requires a level of judgement. All other leases are classifi ed as operating leases. 
Assets held under fi nance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of fi nancial position as a fi nance lease obligation. 
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between fi nance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as 
to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset. 
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are 
incentives to enter into operating leases. 
(t) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classifi ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classifi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition. The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year from the date of classifi cation. 
A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area 
of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria 
to be classifi ed as held for sale. 
(u) Dividend distribution 
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders 
in general meeting.
(v) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations
In the year ended 31 December 2013, the group adopted the following new standards and amendments:
 – As a result of the amendment to IAS 19 (2011), the group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the 
income or expense related to its post-employment defi ned benefi t plans.
The amendment makes changes to the recognition, measurement and disclosure of the defi ned benefi t expense, in particular requiring that 
the return on investment assets recognised in the income statement be calculated at the same interest rate as that used for calculating the 
fi nance cost on the obligations, and to the disclosures of employee benefi ts. 
Pensions interest has therefore been restated for the change in calculation of the net pension interest charge, resulting in an additional £14m 
interest cost for the year ended 31 December 2013 and £7m additional interest cost for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The amendments also require that the group re-allocates pension administration costs from its previous classifi cation within fi nance income 
through other comprehensive income (OCI) to disclosing it within PBITA. Current year and prior year PBITA has reduced by £3m as a result 
of this restatement.
 – As a result of the amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the group has modifi ed the presentation of items of 
comprehensive income in its condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to present separately items that would be 
reclassifi ed to profi t or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassifi ed. Comparative income has also been re-p resented 
accordingly. The adoption of the amendment to IAS 1 has no impact on the recognised assets, liabilities and comprehensive income of the group.
 – The group also adopted IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ during the year. This has not resulted in any signifi cant impact on the group’s results 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 or the year ended 31 December 2012.
The group has not adopted early any standard, amendment or interpretation. A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2013. Those that are expected to have an impact 
on the group accounts are detailed below:
 – IFRS 10 (2011) ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, which replaces parts of IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ and all 
of SIC-12 ‘Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities’, introduces a new control model that focuses on whether the group has power over an 
investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. 
This differs from the previous approach where one of the main criteria used to consolidate was to have the power to govern the fi nancial 
and operating policies of the entity. Apart from certain exceptions within the Asia Middle East region (including certain business in Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia and Qatar) it is expected that under the terms of the existing shareholder agreements the remainder of the group’s principal 
subsidiaries (see note 43) will continue to be consolidated upon adoption of IFRS 10 (2011). Those entities which do not meet the IFRS 10 
(2011) criteria to be consolidated will be accounted for generally as joint ventures under the new IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’.
 – IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ replaces IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ and SIC-13 ‘Jointly Controlled Entities – Non-monetary Contributions 
by Vendors’ and removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities using the proportionate consolidation method. Instead all jointly 
controlled entities will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting, similar to that used to account for associates under the current 
standards. As the group currently applies the proportionate method of accounting to its jointly controlled entities this will impact the group’s 
consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of fi nancial position. 104 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

 – IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities’ is a new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interest 
in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The standard includes 
disclosure requirements for entities within the scope of IFRS 10 (2011) and IFRS 11.
 – IFRS 10 (2011), IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 together form a suite of standards that are effective from 1 January 2013. However they have been 
endorsed by the EU to be applied from 1 January 2014. The group will therefore adopt all three standards for its fi nancial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. 
4. ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the fi nancial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the fi nancial statements and the 
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected 
economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on management’s best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most signifi cance in preparing the group’s 2013 accounts are detailed below:
Review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities
In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, taking into account any changes in 
facts or circumstances since that date. The purpose of this review was to ensure that the fi nancial statements were presented in a more balanced 
way. This exercise required a level of judgement and in many cases taking a more balanced judgement based on the group’s current understanding 
of circumstances surrounding each issue. The results of the review are presented within ‘specifi c items’ given the one-off nature of the review 
performed and are disclosed in note 8.  Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 105 
Contract portfolio review
The group delivers outsourcing services that in some circumstances can be complex in nature and may be governed by unique contractual 
arrangements. There is a risk that revenue recognition on these contracts is not in accordance with contractual entitlements and therefore 
provisions may be required to be recognised within ‘contract provisions’ (see note 34). Estimates and judgements are therefore required 
to determine the appropriate level of provisioning applied to these contracts.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries
The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and regulations relating to foreign 
ownership. In some instances the group operates through local structures with limited direct share ownership of the business but exercises control 
through shareholder agreements. In determining whether some group entities qualify for consolidation under IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’, professional and legal advice is sought and a level of judgement is required. Consolidation of any of these entities would be at risk if 
the group’s ability to enforce its rights of control were successfully challenged. Furthermore, as set out in note 3(v), following the adoption of IFRS 
10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ in 2014, the group expects to cease to consolidate some of these entities and will equity account for them.
Carrying value of goodwill
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that 
amounts may be impaired. The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash fl ows from the use 
and eventual disposal of the assets. Such an analysis includes the estimation of future results, cash fl ows, annual growth rates and discount rates. 
Judgement is required in relation to the achievability of the long-term business plan and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation 
process. In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent transactions), fair value less costs to sell 
is used as a basis for the recoverable amount. This involves judgements and estimates to apply reasonable valuations techniques and to estimate 
future selling costs. The full methodology and results of the group’s impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Discontinued operations
The group normally has business disposals underway at any reporting date. There is a risk that any such businesses may not meet the accounting 
standard’s criteria for presentation as discontinued at the balance sheet date either because they are not a separate major line of business 
or there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of achieving the sale or the realisable value on disposal (see note 7). The latter requires a level 
of judgement due to the range of potential sale prices.
Taxation
The group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied and under some complex 
contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear. Management are required to apply judgements and estimates 
to determine the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.
Valuation of retirement benefi t obligations
The valuation of defi ned retirement benefi t schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualifi ed independent actuaries who use t he projected 
unit credit method for determining the group’s obligations. This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including 
the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees 
and infl ation. Full details of the group’s retirement benefi t obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key 
assumptions are presented in note 33.

7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2012 mainly comprised the cash and secure solutions businesses in Pakistan, which were disposed 
of in October 2012, the justice business in the United States of America, which was disposed of in April 2012, and the group’s classifi ed 
US Government Solutions business.
The classifi ed US Government Solutions business is still included within discontinued operations as at 31 December 2013 as it was held for sale 
at that date. Due to circumstances beyond the group’s control, mainly relating to the impact on market sentiment arising out of political uncertainty 
culminating with the US Government shutdown in early October 2013, the sale process has been extended and has now taken over 12 months 
since the previous year end. The sale process has progressed to a stage of negotiation with potential buyers and the group is confi dent a sale 
will be agreed in 2014.
Operations qualifying as discontinued in 2013 also included the group’s cash business in Canada and the group’s remaining business in Norway, 
both of which were sold in January 2014.

Contracts review
A global fi nancial review of 163 contracts, including UK Electronic Monitoring and other contracts, with annualised revenues of around £2bn 
resulted in a £136m charge. For more details of the UK Electronic Monitoring settlement please see note 34 on page 135.
Review of assets and liabilities
A review of the group’s assets and liabilities applying more balanced judgements was initiated in the fi rst half of 2013, resulting in a PBITA charge 
of £132m. This was extended to cover all legal entities during the second half of the year. Completion of this review resulted in a further charge of 
£50m, bringing the full-year charge to PBITA of £182m. The total charge related principally to impairment of fi xed assets, inventory obsolescence, 
write down of receivables and the recognition of employee related liabilities. 
Restructuring costs
Restructuring charges of £68m (2012: £42m) were incurred during the year. These include £35m in respect of restructuring programmes in the UK 
& Ireland, Finland and other European businesses. Acceleration of the restructuring programme in the fourth quarter, primarily in the Netherlands, 
Belgium and in North America, resulted in additional charges of £33m.

allows the assessment of operational performance, the analysis of trends over time, the comparison of different businesses and the projection 
of future earnings. 
Share placing
In August 2013 the group completed a 9.99% share placing which resulted in the weighted average number of shares for the year increasing 
to 1,452 million.
17. ACQUISITIONS
Current year acquisitions 
The group undertook a number of business combinations in the current year including the acquisition of Deposita, a cash solutions business 
in South Africa.

Deferred tax liabilities (3)
Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 14
Goodwill 4
T otal purchase consideration (paid in cash) 18
Adjustments made to identifi able assets and liabilities on acquisition are to refl ect their fair value. These include the recognition of customer-related 
intangible assets amounting to £12m. The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation 
exercise. These estimates may be adjusted to refl ect any development in the issues to which they relate.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes and the 
opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business. None of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable 
from goodwill. No goodwill acquired in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From their respective dates of acquisition, the acquired businesses contributed £28m to revenues, £4m to PBITA and £3m to profi t for the part 
year they were under the group’s ownership. If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2013, group revenue would have been £7,434m, 
underlying PBITA would have been £443m and total loss for the year would have been £341m. 114 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements continued
17. ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
Prior year acquisitions 
Principal acquisitions in subsidiary undertakings in the prior year included the purchase of a 100% interest in Vanguarda Segurança e Vigilância Ltda 
‘Vanguarda’, a security personnel, security systems and monitoring services provider in Brazil.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value adjustments made against net assets acquired were provisional. The initial accounting in respect of acquisitions 
made during 2012 has since been fi nalised. This resulted in fair value adjustments to acquired trade debtors (increase of £9m), trade creditors 
(decrease of £3m) and provisions (decrease of £3m) with a resulting £15m decrease in the value of goodwill. 
The net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of all acquisitions made in 2012 are as follows:

Adjustments made to identifi able assets and liabilities on acquisition are to refl ect their fair value. These include the recognition of customer-related 
intangible assets amounting to £31m. 
In the year of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed £39m to revenues, £4m to PBITA and £1m to profi t for the part year 
they were under the group’s ownership. If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2012, group revenue would have been £7,264m, underlying 
PBITA would have been £472m and total profi t for the year would have been £64m. 
Post balance sheet acquisitions
No signifi cant acquisitions have been effected between the balance sheet date and the date that the fi nancial statements were authorised for issue.
18. DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES
During the current year the group disposed of its data solutions business in Colombia and its cash business in Slovakia. Since the year end the 
group has disposed of its business in Norway (for proceeds of £29m) and its cash solutions business in Canada (for proceeds of £60m). In the 
prior year the group disposed of its cash solutions business in Sweden, a justice services business in the United States of America, its security 
systems business in the Netherlands and its businesses in Poland and Pakistan.

19. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Goodwill allocation
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) which are expected to benefi t from that business 
combination. The majority of the group’s goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor 
in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck. 
Goodwill impairment testing
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications 
that any of these assets may be impaired. The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is fi nalised 
and reviewed post year end. The group’s impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU with its recoverable amount. CGUs are 
identifi ed on a country level basis including signifi cant business units, as per the group’s detailed management accounts. Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash fl ow calculations. The key 
inputs to the calculations are described below. In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent 
transactions), fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount.
Forecast cash fl ows
All operating countries in the group are required to submit a budget for the next fi nancial year (for the current year test this is for the year 
ended 31 December 2014) and their strategic plan forecasts for the following two years (in this case the years ended 31 December 2015 
and 31 December 2016).
The revenue fi gures submitted as part of this exercise are used to derive a growth rate for the discounted cash fl ow calculation (see the growth 
rate table below). The group applies a 10% forecast risk to reduce revenue forecasts in each year to refl ect the uncertainties inherent in estimating 
future revenue streams.
Forecast cash fl ows are adjusted from year 4 onwards by applying a growth rate as detailed in the growth rate section, and discounted using 
specifi c risk-adjusted discount rates as described in the discount rate section.
Growth Rate
Growth rates are determined from the budgeted and forecast revenue in years 1-3 and then projected using the lower of the forecast growth 
rate and the country’s nominal growth rate (per the IMF) to a terminal growth rate in year 15 of 1% for developed markets or 3% for emerging 
markets. This is detailed in the table below:
Growth 
assumptions Y ear 1 Y ear 2 Y ear 3 Y ear 4 Y ear 5 Y ear 6 to 15 Terminal value
Input Budget* Forecast* Forecast* Projected – to 
year 5 at lower

Projected –to

‘terminal growth’
Estimate of residual 
growth: developed 
1%; emerging 3%
Example 8% 7% 6% 5% 4% 4% to 1% 
over 10 years
1%
* Budgets and forecasts are reviewed by the group Board.
In the above example, budgeted year 1 growth rate is 8%, forecast growth in year 2 is 7% and in year 3 is 6%. The country growth rate is 4% 
so the growth rate is reduced each year to reach 4% at year 5. From year 6 the growth rate is then reduced over the next ten years to provide 
a terminal value growth of 1% (the example is based on a developed market CGU).
Discount rate
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU based on the relevant local risk-free rate adjusted for that CGU’s specifi c risk-adjusted equity risk 
premium. For the impairment test performed for the year ended 31 December 2013 the group has revised the calculation of the discount rates 
applied to certain CGU’s. This revision adjusts for the current low-interest rate environment by increasing abnormally low discount rates. Details 
of how the other key discount rate inputs are derived are given below:
Input How determined 31 Dec 2013
Risk free rate The risk free rate is generally obtained from the applicable government’s 10 year gilt/bond 
rates. Where these are unavailable the group uses the closest available information 
(eg shorter term gilt rates). 2.83% in UK
UK equity risk premium The equity risk premium is determined for the UK by analysing a variety of sources including 
economic studies carried out by Barclays Capital and others. 5.0% in UK
Operating country 
equity risk premium
Specifi c local equity risk premiums are based on the UK risk premium adjusted for specifi c 
economic and fi nancial risks. The sources for these adjustments are the Institutional Investor 
Magazine and the IMF website as well as other studies by independent economists.
Leveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to refl ect the risk of the group’s 
operating companies relative to the market as a whole. The group’s beta is obtained from 
independent market studies and is adjusted for the appropriate leverage of the group.
0.8 for the 
group 
Tax rate Local tax rates are applied to each CGU to calculate pre-tax cost of equity. 23% in UK
Debt margin The group applies a margin to the cost of debt for each CGU, with a higher margin applied 
to those CGUs operating in higher risk environments. These margins range from 1.5% 
in less risky CGUs (for example in the UK) to 5-6% in more risky CGUs (eg 5.5% in Y emen). 1.5% in UK
Weighted average 
cost of capital
The weighted average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of equity and the 
cost of debt by the applicable debt:equity ratio at the year end. 8.6% in UK Financial statements

T otal 2,012 (46) 1,966
* Lower of country growth rate per IMF and implied year 3 business forecast growth rate.
The impairment charge in Brazil was driven by losses incurred in the fi rst half of the year in the technology business and a general downturn in 
trading. The impairment in Ireland was as a result of the economic challenges in the country and the specifi c situation of the group’s cash business. 
Certain CGUs in Africa were impaired as a result of worsening economic and political circumstances in those countries.
Sensitivity to key assumptions
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash fl ow calculations relate to the discount rates and growth rates used. The table below shows the 
additional impairment that would arise from an increase in discount rates by 1% and 3% (with all other variables being equal, for example taking 
the UK base rate from 8.6% to 9.6% and 11.6%) or a decrease in growth rates by 1% and 3% (with all other variables being equal, for example 
taking the UK growth rate from 4.3% to 3.3% and 1.3%) for the group in total and for each of its signifi cant countries.

21. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES
At the year end the group owned 59% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Ltd. The group jointly shares operational and fi nancial control 
over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of its results, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held. 
The group’s correctional facilities in South Africa are under a similar arrangement other than that the group’s holding is 20%. During the year the 
group acquired a 50% share of the equity of Policity Limited, to construct and run a police training academy facility in Israel, which also operates 
under a similar arrangement. 
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies. The way the group accounts 
for joint ventures will change in 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, as explained in note 3(v). In particular, the group will no 
longer account for joint ventures using the proportionate method and will instead apply the equity method.

24. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)
Credit risk on trade receivables
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the group’s customers are both large in number and dispersed 
geographically in 120 countries. The group’s largest customer is the UK Government which comprises approximately 13% (2012:10%) of the total 
trade debtor balance as at 31 December 2013. Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to 
assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers. These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set 
amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to refl ect the different risks within each country in which the group 
operates. There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past 
default experience.

Net trade debtors 1,120 1,197
Included within ‘not yet due’ in the prior year is £75m relating to the Olympics contract settlement.
No additional provision has been made on the above amounts as there has not been a signifi cant change in credit quality and the group 
believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The proportion of trade debtors 
at 31 December 2013 that were overdue for payment was 21% (2012: 26%). The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end 
was 54 days (2012: 60 days).
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash fl ows, approximates to their book value.

At 31 December 2013, disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale primarily comprised the assets and liabilities associated with the classifi ed 
Government Solutions business in the United States of America (see note 7), the group’s business in Norway which was sold in January 2014 
and the cash solutions business in Canada which was also sold in January 2014. A further impairment charge of £80m has been applied to 
goodwill and other assets in the US Government Solutions business during the year.
At 31 December 2012, disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale primarily comprised the assets and liabilities associated with the classifi ed 
Government Solutions business in the United States of America, which were subject to a £35m impairment charge to goodwill in the prior year 
to write down their assets to their estimated recoverable value.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise principally short-term money market deposits, current account balances and group-owned cash held in ATM 
machines and at 31 December 2013 bore interest at a weighted average rate of 0.7% (2012: 0.5%). The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
is limited because wherever possible and in accordance with Group Treasury policy, the cash is placed with bank counterparties that hold 
investment grade credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included over 140 group companies at 31 December 2013. 
It is expected that the number of participants in the group will continue to grow. The group met the conditions of IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’ allowing balances within this cash pool to be offset for reporting purposes. At 31 December 2013 £422m (2012: £360m) of the 
cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset. 
Cash and cash equivalents of £39m (2012: £27m) are held by the group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. Their use is restricted 
to the settlement of claims against the group’s captive insurance subsidiaries.  122 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

At 31 December 2013, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to £965m (2012: £856m). Interest on all committed bank borrowing 
facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and re-priced within one 
year or less. 
Borrowing at fl oating rates exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk. The management of this risk is discussed in note 32. 
The group issued fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m (£332m) on 1 March 2007. The notes mature 
in March 2014 ($100m), March 2017 ($200m), March 2019 ($145m) and March 2022 ($105m). 
The group issued further fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$514m (£310m) and £69m on 15 July 2008. 
$65m notes matured and were repaid on 15 July 2013, with the remaining notes maturing in July 2015 ($150m), July 2016 (£25m), 
July 2018 ($224m) and (£44m), and July 2020 ($75m).
The group issued its inaugural public note of £350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on 13 May 2009. The note matures 
in May 2019.
During 2012 the group issued two further public notes, a €600m note issued in May 2012 maturing May 2017 and a €500m note 
issued in December 2012 maturing December 2018. Financial statements

The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one fi nancial covenant (net debt to EBITDA ratio where EBITDA 
is calculated as underlying group PBITA plus depreciation and amortisation) and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration 
of maturity. The group complied with the fi nancial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2013 and the year to 31 December 2012. 
The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year. 
Bank overdrafts, bank loans, the loan notes issued in July 2008, the loan notes issued in May 2009, €510m of the loan notes issued in May 2012 
and €380m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 are stated at amortised cost. The loan notes issued in March 2007, €90m of the loan notes 
issued in May 2012 and €120m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 are stated at amortised cost recalculated at an effective interest rate 
current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair value hedge relationship. 
US$200m (£121m) of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of £21m (2012: £31m) resulting from the cross currency 
swaps fi xing the sterling value of this portion of the loan notes at an exchange rate of 1.975.
€325m (£270m) of the loan notes issued in May 2012 have a fair value market gain of £5m (2012: loss £5m) partly resulting from the cross 
currency swaps fi xing the sterling value of this portion of the loan notes at an exchange rate of 1.222 and partly resulting from the cross currency 
swaps fi xing the sterling and euro interest rates.
€350m (£291m) of the loan notes issued in December 2012 have a fair value market gain of £16m (2012: £2m) partly resulting from the cross 
currency swaps fi xing the sterling value of this portion of the loan notes at an exchange rate of 1.233 and partly resulting from the cross currency

It is the group’s policy to lease certain of its fi xtures and equipment under fi nance leases. The weighted average lease term is eight years. For the 
year ended 31 December 2013, the weighted average effective borrowing rate was 4.8% (2012: 4.9%). Interest rates are fi xed at the contract date. 
All leases are on a fi xed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.

Derivative fi nancial instruments are stated at fair value, measured using techniques consistent with Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy (inputs other 
than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly). The source of the market prices is 
Bloomberg and in addition the third party relationship counterparty banks. The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the fl oating rate 
cash fl ows anticipated under the instrument which are discounted back to the balance sheet date. This value is compared to the original transaction 
value giving a fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date.

32. FINANCIAL RISK
Capital management
On 28 August 2013 the group raised equity capital amounting to £348m before costs. The net proceeds of £343m were used to reduce debt 
that was drawn on the group’s £1.1bn bank facility. 
In May 2013, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the group’s long term credit rating to BBB- Negative. However, following the equity capital raising 
the group’s rating was revised to BBB- Stable in September 2013. The group intends to continue to manage its capital structure so that it retains 
an investment grade rating.
The group’s policy is to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio to below 2.5 times. At the end of 2013 the ratio was 2.6 times, before £89m 
of divestment proceeds received in January 2014. It is expected the ratio will be within the target range in 2014. 
The group is currently well fi nanced with £965m available and undrawn facilities from its committed £1.1bn bank facility. It has no signifi cant 
maturity until March 2016 and has a medium to long term debt maturity profi le. The group can access fi nance from the debt capital markets 
and the bank market. Borrowings are principally in sterling, US dollars and euros refl ecting the geographies of signifi cant operational assets 
and profi ts. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 125 
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are suffi cient undrawn committed facilities available to it. For more details of the group’s bank 
overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 28.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows:
31 December 2012  28%
31 March 2013  25%
30 June 2013  25%
30 September 2013   32%
31 December 2013   32%
T o reduce re-fi nancing risk, group treasury obtains fi nance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source 
of fi nance terminating on a single date.
Re-fi nancing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium term facility at least 
12 months before its termination date.

Market risk
Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts 
The group conducts business in many currencies. Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its 
fi nancing activities in local currency. However, the group presents its consolidated fi nancial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject 
to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries. The group hedges a substantial proportion 
of its exposure to fl uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies. 
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign 
currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges. 
At 31 December 2013, the group’s US dollar and euro net assets were approximately 82% and 59% respectively hedged by foreign currency 
loans (2012: US dollar 85%, euro 60%). 
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £101m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private 
Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £266m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on €325m of the euro public notes issued 
in May 2012, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2217.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £284m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on €350m of the euro public notes issued 
in December 2012, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2332.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar and the euro, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part 
of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by £7m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps
Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 28 exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits 
approved by the directors. Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion 
of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi ve years. At 31 December 2013 the nominal value of such contracts 
was £97m (in respect of US dollar) (2012: £98m) and £37m (in respect of euro) (2012: £73m); their weighted average interest rate was 1.3% 
(US dollar) (2012: 1.3%) and 2.8% (euro) (2012: 3.2 %), and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a half years. All the interest 
rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity. 
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors wanting a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes. 
At the time of the fi rst issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest 
rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectivel y converting 
the fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement 
is Libor + 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the 
movements in their fair value posted to profi t and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the sterling public notes issued in May 2009, 510m of the euro public notes 
issued in May 2012 and 380m of the euro public notes issued in December 2012 was kept at fi xed rate.
All three public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling. Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fi xed rate 
loans and interest rate swaps which provide certainty on the vast majority of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains. A 1% increase 
in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2013 debt position constant throughout 2014, 
would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of £8m in the 2014 fi nancial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps
The group’s principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses. Commodity 
swaps and commodity options are used to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility. Commodity swaps 
hedging 41 million litres of projected 2014 diesel consumption, 27 million litres of projected 2015 diesel consumption and 9 million litres of 
projected 2016 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2013.
Counterparty credit risk 
The group’s strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis. 
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty. The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated 
by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the 
transaction. The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is also closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each 
counterparty. For short-term transactions (under one year), at inception of the transaction, the fi nancial counterparty must be investment grade 
rated by either the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating agencies. For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the fi nancial 
counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB+/Baa1 from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. 
Treasury transactions are dealt with the group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. At 31 December 2013 
the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were £29m and £28m and both were held with institutions with a long 
term Standard & Poor’s credit rating of A and A- respectively. These exposures represent 13% and 12% of the carrying values of the treasury 
transactions, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date. Both of these banks had signifi cant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc 
at 31 December 2013.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A+ rated bank. At year end 
credit balances of £425m were pooled with debit balances of £422m, resulting in a net pool credit balance of £3m. There is legal right of set off 
under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of £3m.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies. Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, 
counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months. Due to the 
group’s global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.  128 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
Notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements continued
33. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The group operates a wide range of retirement benefi t arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices 
within the countries concerned. These include funded defi ned contribution, multi-employer and funded and unfunded defi ned benefi t schemes. 
Defi ned contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefi t arrangements operated by the group are of a defi ned contribution structure, where the employer 
contribution and resulting income statement charge is fi xed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. Contributions made to defi ned 
contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled £99m (2012: £107m).
In the UK, following the closure of the defi ned benefi t schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in 
defi ned contribution scheme. 
G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is the administrator of several defi ned benefi t schemes. G4S Government Solutions, Inc. is responsible for making 
periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defi ned benefi t schemes as determined by independent actuaries. In each instance, the US 
Department of Energy (‘DOE’) acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and G4S Government Solutions, Inc. its responsibility 
for all unfunded pension and benefi t liabilities. Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as defi ned contribution schemes. 
Multi-employer arrangement
In the Netherlands, most of the employees are members of the Security Industry Wide Pension Fund (IWPF). This is a career-average defi ned 
benefi t plan. Pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that refl ects social security levels. Withdrawal from the scheme is only 
possible under certain strict conditions determined by Dutch law and by the pension fund board of the IWPF. 
The plan is funded by a premium that is set by the IWPF board in line with the fi nancing rules that state that the premium should cover the 
cost of the annual accrual of pension benefi ts. Historically, the premium has been 30% of pensionable salaries and the employer pays 60% 
of this premium and the employees the remaining 40%. 
The fi nancing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefi ts. This means 
that in case of insuffi cient funding, the benefi ts of participants could, in theory, be reduced. The current solvency ratio is 116.6% (October 2013). 
The required solvency ratio according to Dutch law is 122% (as at 31 December 2012). Should a surplus appear within the scheme the board 
will decide if a reduction in premium is possible although this would only be possible at much higher solvency levels. 
Premiums paid to the scheme by the group and charged to the income statement in 2013 totalled £8m (2012: £8m). The estimated amounts 
of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the fi nancial year commencing 1 January 2014 in respect of the on-going accrual 
of benefi ts is approximately £8m. The premium that the IWPF received in 2013 is not yet available; in 2012 this amounted to €60m of which 
approximately €8m was paid by the group. The total number of employees in the scheme is approximately 22,000 at the end of 2012. The number 
of employees working for the group is approximately 5,600 as at 31 October 2013. 
The scheme is not accounted for as a defi ned benefi t scheme under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefi ts’ as it is not possible to identify the group’s share of 
the scheme’s assets and liabilities. As a result, and in line with general practice for such schemes, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defi ned 
contribution scheme under IAS 19. 
Defi ned benefi t arrangements 
The group operates several funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes where the benefi ts are based on employees’ length of servi ce. Whilst 
the group’s primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands and Canada and other less material plans 
elsewhere. Under funded arrangements, the assets of defi ned benefi t schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar 
structures in the countries concerned. 
There are also various less material unfunded arrangements; for these the group does not hold related assets separate from the group.

UK Defi ned Benefi t Scheme
The defi ned benefi t scheme in the UK accounts for 95% of the net balance sheet liability for material funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes. 
It comprises three sections: the Group 4 section which is the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A/S; the Securicor section, 
responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, and the GSL section, responsibility for which the 
group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL. 
The UK scheme is closed to future accrual apart from some sub-sections of the GSL section, and for most members defi nes the pension based on 
fi nal salary. The GSL section has historically remained open to provide a facility to accept former public-sector employees who join G4S through 
outsourcings. In the Group 4 and Securicor sections, members retain their link to fi nal salary where appropriate on their benefi ts accrued up to 
closure in 2011. 
As at the latest actuarial funding valuation, the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows:

Pensioner participants
– Number 3,024 581 8,891 12,496
– Average age 69.9 63.6 71.2 70.5
There is a mix of fi xed and infl ation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which vary from member to member according 
to their membership history and the section of the scheme.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections are respectively 17 years (Group 4 section), 18 years 
(GSL section) and 18 years (Securicor section).
The scheme is set up under UK law and governed by a Trustee company which is responsible for the scheme’s investments, administration 
and management. The Board of the Trustee Company is comprised of an independent chairman and further independent, group and scheme 
membership representatives.
The current schedule of defi cit recovery contributions provides for a contribution of approximately £42m during 2014. In addition, the company 
has pledged a share of any material disposal proceeds to the pension scheme (to be shared in the same proportion as the pension scheme defi cit 
bears to overall group indebtedness) and has agreed that additional contributions would be made in the event that the average annual dividend 
payment to ordinary shareholders over the three fi nancial years 2013, 2014, 2015 exceeds a certain threshold or in the event that the company 
makes a signifi cant special dividend payment, (or equivalent capital return), to its ordinary shareholders over the same period. 
A funding valuation is carried out for the scheme’s Trustee every three years by an independent fi rm of actuaries. Depending on the outcome of 
that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated; the group has guaranteed any contributions due from its subsidiaries. The most 
recent valuation had an effective date of 5 April 2012. 130 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Other material Defi ned Benefi t Schemes
Apart from the multi-employer scheme referred to above, the group operates two material pension schemes in the Netherlands which apply 
to different employee populations; they are known as the Securicor Staff and Cash Solutions schemes. Both schemes defi ne pensions in terms 
of average career pay, are open to new entrants and are funded in accordance with Dutch requirements.
Pension increases in the Securicor Staff scheme are conditional on the funding level and so are only required if there is a funding surplus. 
The Securicor scheme has a risk sharing arrangement whereby members pay 50% of the cost of the scheme but the group has opted to record 
100% of the defi cit as a company liability due to uncertainties as to the practicalities of applying the scheme’s provisions in this respect; for example 
in 2012 benefi ts were reduced rather than increasing members’ contributions.
The Cash Solutions scheme is required to provide benefi ts at least equivalent to the industry-wide multi-employer scheme, and in particular 
pension increases in payment and deferment, as well as revaluation of active members’ rights in the Cash Solutions scheme have to follow the 
multi-employer scheme (which also applies a conditional approach). The Cash Solutions scheme is insured, so longevity risk on the base level of 
insured pension (that is before increases) is carried by the insurer, and any bonuses from the insurer’s returns may defray the cost of pension 
increases. Accordingly, there is a counterparty risk against the insurer. 
The other material scheme is in Canada; it is a fi nal salary scheme that is closed to new entrants, other than to hourly-paid members in a few 
specifi c locations. Most of the benefi ts are not subject to indexation in payment. The scheme is funded in accordance with Canadian requirements. 
The sponsoring business is held for sale as at 31 December 2013. It was sold on 17 January 2014 and the entire liabilities and assets of the scheme 
are now the responsibility of the purchaser.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the schemes are respectively 28 years (Netherlands Securicor Staff), 
28 years (Netherlands Cash Solutions) and 18 years (Canada).
Expected Contributions
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the material schemes during the fi nancial year commencing 1 January 2014 in 
respect of the ongoing accrual of benefi ts are approximately £9m (split £6m UK, £3m Netherlands) and it is anticipated that these will remain at 
a similar level in the medium term subject to changes in fi nancial conditions. Additional contributions of approximately £42m will also be made in 
2014 in respect of the defi cit in the UK schemes. 
Principal Risks
The group’s pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases on benefi ts are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, 
dependent on infl ation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefi ts payable are future infl ation levels (including the impact of infl ation 
on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefi ts payable will also be infl uenced by a range of other factors 
including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefi ts in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions 
to the pension plans. For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns (for funding valuations) are set based on fi xed margins 
over the LIBOR swap curve. The management of the pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager which manages the assets 
against a liability benchmark. The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows:
 – An asset mix which is managed dynamically over time rather than a set strategic allocation
 – Interest rate and infl ation risk is managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage of the asset value through 
the use of debt instruments (government bonds) and derivatives
 – Currency risk is managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the use 
of forward foreign currency contracts
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject 
to change and may impact G4S’ pension schemes.
Regarding fi nancial reporting measures, the IAS 19 liability measurement (DBO) and the service cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions 
made on a range of demographic and fi nancial matters that are used to project the expected benefi t payments, the most important of these 
assumptions being about future infl ation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation. The DBO and service cost 
are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefi t payments. The discount rate 
depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind 
and do not seek to provide a specifi c hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of liabilities. As a result the difference between the market value 
of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be volatile. Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 131 
Assumptions and sensitivities 
The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
UK Canada Netherlands
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2013
Discount rate 4.4% 5.0% 3.7%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 3.0% 2.0%
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI* with a limit of 5% p.a.) 3.2% 1.4% 1.4%
Infl ation 3.4% 2.3% 2.0%
  
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2012 
Discount rate 4.5% 4.5% 3.7%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.1% 3.0% 2.0%
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI with a limit of 5% p.a.) 2.9% 1.4% 1.0%
Infl ation 3.0% 2.3% 2.0%
* The CPI assumption used for the UK valuation in 2013 was 2.4%.
IAS 19 specifi es that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high-quality corporate bond rates. The group considers that 
it is appropriate to consider AA-rated corporate bonds as high quality and therefore have used discount rates based on yields on such bonds 
corresponding to the liability profi le of the schemes.
The effect of a movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax adjustments) 
by approximately the amounts shown in the table below:
Sensitivity analysis
Increase/(decrease) in the 
DBO of the UK Scheme
2013
£m
Discount rate assumption being 0.5% higher (163)
Discount rate assumption being 0.5% lower 181
The effect of a movement in RPI infl ation applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax adjustments) 
by approximately the amounts shown in the table below:
Sensitivity analysis
Increase/(decrease) in the 
DBO of the UK Scheme
2013
£m
Infl ation assumption being 0.5% higher 79
Infl ation assumption being 0.5% lower (70)
The above sensitivities allow for infl ation-dependent assumptions such as salary growth and relevant pension increases to vary corresponding 
to the infl ation assumption variation. Due to the caps and fl oors on pension increases a certain movement in the infl ation assu mption will not 
generally result in the same movement in the pension increase assumption.
In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes’ obligations. The mortality tables 
used for the scheme in the UK are: Birth year table S1P[M/F]A Base with future improvements in line with CMI_2013 Core projections, based 
on a long term improvement rate of 1.25% p.a. and allowing for individual scaling factors based on the majority analysis carried out as part 
of the last funding valuation.
The resulting assumed life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 is between 21 and 22 years, depending on the 
section of the plan. The assumed life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 is between 22 and 23 years. At those ages, the assumed life 
expectancy for a female member is between 2 and 3 years higher than for a male member. 
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities (before associated deferred tax adjustments) 
by approximately £88m. 
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the DBO to key assumptions should not be interpreted as the group expressing 
any specifi c view of the probability of such movements happening. 132 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Netherlands; by 31 December 2012 the scheme was in defi cit and no restriction was necessary, and this was still the case at 31 December 2013.
The contribution from sponsoring companies in 2013 included £38m (2012: £37m) of additional contributions in respect of the defi cit in the

in active markets. Other UK investments are predominantly not quoted.
Derivatives include a range of interest rate and infl ation linked swaps, forward currency contracts, equity index total return swaps, equity options, 
and futures. Investing in interest rate and infl ation linked swaps is designed to mitigate the impact of future changes in interest rates and infl ation.

Employee benefi ts
The provision for employee benefi ts is in respect of any employee benefi ts which accrue over the working lives of the employees, typically 
including items such as long service awards and termination indemnity schemes. 
The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefi ts other than retirement benefi ts represents the present value of the future 
benefi t that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be 
settled directly.
Restructuring 
Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued 
operations. Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable. The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term. 
Claims reserves 
The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the 
group’s cash solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies. The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review 
and are adjusted as appropriate. Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the fi nal settlements and their timing 
is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range 
of claims or possible claims. 
Contract provisions 
Contract provisions include provisions for onerous contracts including future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sub-let 
at a shortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties. 
Provisions relating to revenue recognition are also included in this category. The provision is based on the value of future net cash outfl ows. 
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration. 
On 12 March 2014 the group announced that it had reached agreement with the UK Ministry of Justice (MoJ) on a settlement in respect 
of claims arising in relation to Electronic Monitoring services provided between 2005 and 2013. The agreement also concluded outstanding 
matters relating to two UK facilities management contracts.
The total settlement amount was £109m and the group has provided for this amount within contract provisions as at 31 December 2013.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business, none of which are individually 
or collectively signifi cant.

At 31 December 2013, the group had unutilised tax losses of approximately £705m (2012: £485m) potentially available for offset against future 
profi ts. A deferred tax asset of £30m (2012: £28m) has been recognised in respect of approximately £120m (2012: £106m) of gross losses. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £585m (2012: £379m) of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future 
profi t streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a signifi cant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities. 
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of £15m which will expire between 2014 and 2023. Other losses may be carried 
forward indefi nitely. 
At 31 December 2013, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £1,220m (2012: £1,378m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences 
on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
At 31 December 2013, the group had total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately £58m (2012: £5m) relating to unresolved tax 
issues in various jurisdictions.  Financial statements

in 2000 and the acquisition of Securicor plc by the group in 2004. In 2013 the £308m addition to the merger reserve resulted from the group’s 
9.99% share placing in August 2013.
Reserve for own shares 
An employee benefi t trust established by the group held 6,934,564 shares at 31 December 2013 (2012: 7,589,853 shares) to satisfy the vesting 
of awards under the performance share plan and performance-related schemes. During the year no shares were purchased by the trust, whilst 
655,289 shares were used to satisfy the vesting of awards under the schemes. At 31 December 2013, the cost of shares held by the trust was 
£18,460,753 (2012: £20,207,798), whilst the market value of these shares was £18,203,231 (2012: £19,470,928). Shares held by the trust are 
treated as treasury shares, are deducted from equity, do not receive dividends and are excluded from the calculations of earnings per share.  138 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The group leases a number of its offi ce properties, vehicles and other operating equipment under operating leases. Property leases are negotiated 
over an average term of eight years, at rates refl ective of market rentals. Periodic rent reviews take place to bring lease rentals in line with 
prevailing market conditions. Some but not all lease agreements have an option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. Leased vehicles 
and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of four years. 
Certain leased properties have been sub-let by the group. Sub-leases are negotiated on terms consistent with those of the associated property. 
The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received by the group from sub-let properties amount to £12m (2012: £10m). Financial statements

40. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Shares allocated conditionally fall under either the group’s performance-related bonus scheme or the group’s Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
Shares allocated conditionally under the performance-related bonus scheme vest three years following the date of grant provided certain 
non-market performance conditions are met. Those allocated under the PSP vest after three years, to the extent that (a) certain non-market 
performance conditions are met and (b) certain market performance conditions are met. The proportion of the allocation of awards to these 
criteria is described in the remuneration report. Vesting occurs after the third anniversary of the date the shares were allocated conditionally. 
T o the extent that the performance criteria have been met and the shares are not forfeited, these shares can only be released upon request 
after the third anniversary but before the tenth anniversary. 
The number of shares allocated conditionally is as follows:

The weighted average remaining contractual life of conditional share allocations outstanding at 31 December 2013 was 16 months (2012: 16 
months). The weighted average share price at the date of allocation of shares allocated conditionally during the year was 291.7p (2012: 277.1p) 
and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was three years. 
Under the PSP , the vesting of half (2012: half) of the shares allocated conditionally depends upon T otal Shareholder Return (a market performance 
condition) over the performance period measured against a comparator group. 25% of the allocation vests upon the group’s T otal Shareholder 
Return equalling median performance amongst the comparator group. The fair value of the shares allocated subject to this market performance 
condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
The income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of shares conditionally awarded subject to non-market performance conditions. 
The charge for 2013 was £nil (2012: £nil).  140 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Notes to the parent company fi nancial statements 
(A) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of preparation
The separate fi nancial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain fi nancial instruments and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (UK GAAP).
The fi nancial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis.
Exemptions
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profi t and loss account. 
The company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash fl ow statement under the terms of FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’. 
The cash fl ows of the company are included within its consolidated fi nancial statements.
The company is also exempt under the terms of the revised FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing related party transactions with 
wholly owned subsidiaries within the group.
Intangible fi xed assets
Intangible fi xed assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Intangible fi xed assets are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their expected economic life. Software is amortised over periods up to a maximum of eight years.
Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments, which comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost less amounts written off.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and fi nancial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. 
External debtors
Debtors do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value. The company provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that 
are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts
Cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the profi t and loss account on an accrual basis 
using the effective interest method. 
External creditors
Creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at their fair value. 
Amounts owed to/from subsidiary undertakings
Amounts owed to/from subsidiary undertakings bear interest at prevailing market rates.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative fi nancial instruments and hedge accounting 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the company only holds or issues derivative fi nancial instruments to manage the group’s exposure to fi nancial 
risk, not for trading purposes. Such fi nancial risk includes the interest risk on the group’s variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the group’s 
fi xed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the 
group’s results and on the translation of the group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies. The company manages these risks through a range 
of derivative fi nancial instruments, including interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and 
currency swaps. 
Derivative fi nancial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as fi nancial assets or liabilities at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement 
to fair value is recognised immediately in the profi t and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting. Where derivatives do qualify for 
hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below: 
Fair value hedge
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profi t and 
loss account. 
Cash fl ow hedge
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and 
subsequently recycled to the profi t and loss account when the hedged cash fl ow impacts the profi t and loss account. The ineffec tive portion of the 
fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profi t and loss account.  Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 145 
Foreign currencies
The fi nancial statements of the company are presented in sterling, its functional currency. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are 
translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which 
are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the profi t 
and loss account.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based 
on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is 
considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profi ts from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
Pensions
The company participates in multi-employer pension schemes in the UK, which provide benefi ts based on fi nal pensionable pay. The company is 
unable to identify its share of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. In accordance with FRS 17 ‘Retirement 
Benefi ts’, the company treats the schemes as if they were defi ned contribution schemes and recognises charges as and when contributions are 
due to the scheme. Details of the schemes are included in note 33 to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
Share-based payments 
The company grants equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date 
of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of 
the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares 
that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions. 
Developments expected in future accounting periods
The new UK fi nancial reporting framework which comes into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 consists of three 
new standards; FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Standards’ sets out the application of fi nancial reporting requirements in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland, FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ outlines the reduced disclosure framework available for use by qualifying entities 
choosing to report under IFRS and FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ is the new ‘UK GAAP’ 
which replaces all previous SSAPs and FRSs in one standard. A full analysis is currently being undertaken to identify the most appropriate option.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid. Dividends proposed but not declared are not 
recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements. 
Financial guarantees
The company enters into fi nancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group. The company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The company therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability 
unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Own shares held by employee benefi t trust
Transactions of the company-sponsored employee benefi t trust are included in the parent company fi nancial statements. In particular, the trust’s 
purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity. 146 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Borrowings consist of £37m of fl oating rate bank loans (2012: £73m) and £1,064m of fi xed rate loan notes (2012: £1,144m). Bank overdrafts, bank 
loans, loan notes issued in July 2008 and May 2009 are stated at amortised cost. The loan notes issued in March 2007 are stated at amortised cost 
recalculated at an effective interest rate current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair value hedge relationship. The directors believe 
the fair value of the company’s bank overdrafts, bank loans and the loan notes issued in March 2007, calculated from market prices, approximates 
to their book value. US$200m (£121m) of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of £21m (2012: £31m). The fair value of 
the remaining notes approximates to their book value.
Borrowing at fl oating rates exposes the company to cash fl ow interest rate risk. The management of this risk is detailed in note (h). 
There were no fi nancial liabilities upon which no interest is paid.

(H) FINANCIAL RISK
Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts 
The group conducts business in many currencies. The group presents its consolidated fi nancial statements in sterling and as a consequence is 
subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries. The company together with G4S 
International Finance plc hedges a substantial portion of the group’s exposure to fl uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net 
assets by holding loans in foreign currencies. Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profi t 
and loss account.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £101m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private 
Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750. 
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency 
loan notes would be expected to fall by £1m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps 
Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 28 to the consolidated fi nancial statements exposes the group to cash fl ow int erest rate risk, which 
the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors. Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are 
utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi ve years. At 31 
December 2013 the nominal value of such contracts was £nil (in respect of US dollar) (2012: £nil) and £37m (in respect of euro) (2012: £73m), 
their weighted average interest rate was nil% (US dollar) (2012: nil%) and 2.8% (euro) (2012: 3.2%), and their weighted average period to maturity 
was twelve months. All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair 
value have been deferred in equity. The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as Treasury 
activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc. 
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors looking for a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes. 
At the time of the fi rst issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest 
rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectivel y converting the 
fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 
+ 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the movements in 
their fair value posted to profi t and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the sterling Public Bond issued in May 2009 was kept at fi xed rate.
The core company borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling. Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fi xed rate 
loans and interest rate swaps which fi x a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains. A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield 
curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2013 debt position constant throughout 2014, would lead to an expectation of an 
additional interest charge of £3m in the 2014 fi nancial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps
The group’s principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses. The company 
acts as a market intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical 
terms with its subsidiaries to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility. 
Counterparty credit risk
The company’s strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis. 
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty. The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by 
applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the 
transaction. The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each 
counterparty. For short-term transactions (under one year), at inception of the transaction, the fi nancial counterparty must be investment grade 
rated by either the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating agencies. For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the fi nancial 
counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB+/Baa1 from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. 
Treasury transactions are dealt with the company’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating. At 31 December 2013 
the largest two counterparty exposures relating to treasury transactions were £28m and £20m and both were held with institutions with 
long-term Standard & Poor’s credit ratings of A- and A respectively. These exposures represent 42% (2012: 37%) and 30% (2012: 29%) of the 
carrying values of derivative fi nancial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date. Both of these banks had signifi cant loan 
commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2013.
The company participates in the group’s multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an Aa3 rated 
bank. There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement. 150 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

(J) AUDITOR’S REMUNERA TION
Fees paid to KPMG Audit Plc and its associates for non-audit services to the company itself are not disclosed in its individual accounts because the 
company’s consolidated fi nancial statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis. 
(K) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The group has one type of equity-settled, share-based payment scheme in place being the conditional allocations of G4S plc shares. An employee 
benefi t trust established by the group holds shares to satisfy the vesting of conditional allocation awards. Reserve for own share disclosures 
relevant to the company are presented within note 37 to the consolidated fi nancial statements. Share-based payments disclosures relevant to the 
company are presented within note 40 to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
(L) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Certain disclosures relevant to the company are presented within note 41 to the consolidated fi nancial statements. Company transactions with 
group undertakings primarily consist of royalty charges, central service charges, group insurance recharges and loan transactions. 
There were no material transactions with non-wholly owned group undertakings in 2013 (2012: none).
(M) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
T o help secure cost effective fi nance facilities for its subsidiaries, the company issues guarantees to some of its fi nance providers. At 31 December 
2013 guarantees totalling £479m (2012: £493m) were in place in support of such facilities.
The company also guarantees the debt obligations of G4S International Finance plc. At 31 December 2013 contingent liabilities of £1,012m (2012: 
£1,061m) were outstanding in support of such debt obligations. 
The company is included in a group registration for UK VAT purposes and is therefore jointly and severally liable for all other UK group companies’ 
unpaid debts in this connection. The liability of the UK group registration at 31 December 2013 totalled £17m (2012: £19m). Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 151

Notes
1.  Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any 
of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at 
the meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy 
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder 
of the company. A proxy form which may be used to make such 
appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice. 
2.  Details of how to appoint a proxy are set out in the notes to 
the enclosed proxy form. In order to be valid an appointment of 
proxy must be returned with any power of attorney or any other 
authority under which it is executed, by one of the following 
methods: in hard copy form by post to Capita Asset Services, PXS 1, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF; in hard copy form 
to that address by courier or by hand during usual business hours; 
or, in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service as described in paragraphs 8 and 9 
below. In each case the form of proxy must be received by the 
company no later than 2.00pm on 3 June 2014. T o change your 
proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment 
using the method set out above. The deadline for receipt of proxy 
appointments also applies in relation to amended instructions. 
Persons listed on the VP Securities register should follow the 
instructions on their Voting Request Form. 
3.  The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument 
or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not prevent a shareholder 
attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if 
he/she wishes to do so. 
4.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated 
under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights (a 
“Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her 
and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right 
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy 
for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such 
proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, 
under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the 
shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in paragraph 1 above does not apply to 
Nominated Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can 
only be exercised by shareholders of the company. 
6.  T o be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
(and for the purpose of the determination by the company of 
the votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the 
Register of Members of the company at 5.30 pm on 3 June 2014 
(or, in the event of any adjournment, on the date which is two 
working days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes 
to the Register of Members after the relevant deadline shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and 
vote at the meeting. 
7.  As at 28 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of this Notice) the company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 1,551,594,436 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. 
Therefore, the total voting rights in the company as at 28 March 
2014 was 1,551,594,436. 
8.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via 
www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST Personal Members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf. 
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 153 
9.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifi cations, 
and must contain the information required for such instruction, as 
described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether 
it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to 
the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order 
to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent 
(ID RA10) by 2.00 pm on 3 June 2014. For this purpose, the time 
of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time 
stamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry 
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should 
be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
10.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or 
voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for 
any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, 
therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. 
It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, 
if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored 
member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to 
those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations 
of the CREST system and timings. 
11.  The company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the 
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertifi cated 
Securities Regulations 2001. 
12.  Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather 
than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting 
as shareholders’ votes are to be counted according to the number 
of shares held. As soon as practicable following the Annual General 
Meeting, the results of the voting at the meeting and the numbers of 
proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes actively 
withheld in respect of each of the Resolutions will be announced via 
a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the company’s 
website: www.g4s.com.
13.  Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a shareholder provided that they do not do so in relation 
to the same shares. 
14.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold 
requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter 
relating to: (i) the audit of the company’s accounts (including the 
auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the company ceasing to hold offi ce 
since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The company 
may not require the shareholders requesting any such website 
publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 
or 528 of the Act. Where the company is required to place a 
statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must 
forward the statement to the company’s auditor not later than 
the time when it makes the statement available on the website. 
The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General 
Meeting includes any statement that the company has been 
required under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website. 
15.  Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The company must cause to be answered any such 
question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting 
but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere 
unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the 
disclosure of confi dential information, (b) the answer has already 
been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or 
(c) it is undesirable in the interests of the company or the good 
order of the meeting that the question be answered. 
16. Under sections 338 and 338A of the Act, members meeting the 
threshold requirements in those sections have the right to require 
the company (i) to give, to members of the company entitled to 
receive notice of the meeting, notice of a resolution which those 
members intend to move (and which may properly be moved) at 
the meeting; and/or (ii) to include in the business to be dealt with 
at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) 
which may properly be included in the business at the meeting. 
A resolution may properly be moved, or a matter properly included 
in the business, unless (a) (in the case of a resolution only) it would, 
if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of any inconsistency 
with any enactment of the company’s constitution or otherwise); 
(b) it is defamatory of any person; or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. 
A request made pursuant to this right may be in hard copy or 
electronic form, must identify the resolution of which notice is to 
be given or the matter to be included in the business, must be 
authenticated by the person(s) making it and must be received 
by the company not later than 23 April 2014, being the date six clear 
weeks before the meeting, and (in the case of a matter to be 
included in the business only) must be accompanied by a statement 
setting out the grounds for the request.

The board of G4S plc considers that the Resolutions set out in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting are likely to promote the success 
of the company and are in the best interests of the company and its 
shareholders as a whole. The directors unanimously recommend that 
you vote in favour of the Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of 
their own benefi cial holdings.
Explanatory notes in relation to the business to be conducted at the 
Annual General Meeting are set out below.
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY 
(RESOLUTION 1)
The chairman will present the fi nancial statements of the company for 
the year ended 31 December 2013 and the reports of the directors 
and auditor thereon to the Annual General Meeting. 
2. REMUNERATION (RESOLUTIONS 2 TO 4)
Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) have resulted 
in new requirements this year both for the content of the Directors’ 
remuneration report (the “Report”) and its approval. Accordingly the 
Report, which is set out on pages 64 to 79, contains:
 – A statement by Mark Elliott, chairman of the company’s 
Remuneration Committee;
 – The directors’ remuneration policy in relation to future payments to 
the directors and former directors; and
 – The annual implementation report on remuneration, which sets out 
payments made in the fi nancial year ending 31 December 2013.
The policy part of the Report, which sets out the company’s forward 
looking policy on directors’ remuneration (including the approach to 
exit payments to directors), is subject to a binding shareholder vote by 
ordinary resolution at least every three years. The statement by the 
Remuneration Committee chairman and the annual implementation 
report on remuneration will, as in the past, be put to an annual advisory 
shareholder vote by ordinary resolution.
Resolution 2 is therefore the ordinary resolution to approve the 
directors’ remuneration policy which is set out within the Report on 
pages 66 to 72. As noted on page 64, the directors’ remuneration 
policy will commence on 6 June 2014. Payments will continue to be 
made to directors and former directors (in their capacity as directors) 
in accordance with existing contractual arrangements until this date.
Once the directors’ remuneration policy commences, all payments by 
the company to the directors and any former directors must be made 
in accordance with the policy (unless the payment is separately 
approved by shareholder resolution).
If the directors’ remuneration policy is approved and remains 
unchanged, it will be valid for up to three fi nancial years without a new 
shareholder approval. If the company wishes to change the policy, it will 
need to put the revised policy to a vote again before it can implement 
the new policy.
If the directors’ remuneration policy is not approved, the company will, 
if and to the extent permitted by the Act, continue to make payments 
to directors in accordance with existing contractual arrangements 
and will seek shareholder approval for a revised policy as soon as 
practicable.
Resolution 3 is the resolution to approve the directors’ remuneration 
report, other than the part containing the directors’ remuneration 
policy. This is an advisory resolution and does not affect the future 
remuneration paid to any director.
Resolution 4 relates to the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which 
the company proposes to introduce to replace the Performance Share 
Plan which was adopted by the Board in July 2004 and will expire in 
July 2014. In order to ensure executives continue to be incentivised to 
deliver the group’s strategy over the longer term, the Remuneration 
Committee has concluded that a replacement long term incentive plan 
should be introduced and, having consulted widely, has set revised 
performance measures, including the introduction of average operating 
cash fl ow as a third measure. The principal terms of the LTIP are set 
out in the appendix to these explanatory notes on pages 156 and 157. 
This ordinary resolution seeks shareholder approval of the LTIP . 
The full rules will be available for inspection during the hours and 
at the locations set out in note 18 to the Notice of Meeting.
3. FINAL DIVIDEND (RESOLUTION 5)
A fi nal dividend of 5.54p (DKK 0.4954) per ordinary share for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 is recommended for payment by the 
directors. If the recommended fi nal dividend is approved, it will be paid 
on Friday 13 June 2014 to all ordinary shareholders who were on the 
register of members at the close of business on 2 May 2014.
4. ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
(RESOLUTIONS 6 TO 16)
Resolution 6 deals with the election of Mr Raja as a director as he was 
appointed since the company’s last Annual General Meeting and, in 
accordance with the company’s articles of association, he will retire 
and stand for election.
Resolutions 7 to 16 deal with the re-election of the other directors in 
accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code which provides for all directors of FTSE 350 companies to be 
subject to re-election by shareholders every year. 
Biographies of each of the directors seeking election or re-election 
are set out on pages 48 and 49. The board has confi rmed following a 
performance review that all directors standing for re-election continue 
to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
5. REAPPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR AND AUDITOR’S 
REMUNERATION (RESOLUTIONS 17 AND 18)
Resolution 17 relates to the reappointment of KPMG Audit Plc as the 
company’s auditor to hold offi ce until the next Annual General Meeting 
of the company.
Resolution 18 authorises the directors to set the auditor’s 
remuneration.
6. AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES (RESOLUTION 19)
Resolution 19 seeks shareholder approval for the directors to be 
authorised to allot shares. 
At the last Annual General Meeting of the company held on 6 June 
2013, the directors were given authority to allot ordinary shares in 
the capital of the company up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£235,110,000. This authority expires at the end of this year’s Annual 
General Meeting. Of this amount 470,220,000 shares could only be 
allotted pursuant to a rights issue.
Resolution 19 will, if passed, renew this authority to allot on the same 
terms as last year’s resolution (save that the number of shares in 
question has increased). The board considers it appropriate that the 
directors be granted the same authority to allot shares in the capital 
of the company up to a maximum nominal amount of £258,598,000 
representing a little under two thirds of the company’s issued ordinary 
share capital as at 28 March 2014 (the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting). Of this amount, 
517,196,000 shares (representing a little under one third of the 
company’s issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted pursuant 
to a rights issue. The authority will last until the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The directors do not have any present intention of exercising this 
authority. In accordance with best practice, if the directors were to 
exercise this authority so as to allot shares representing more than 
one third of the current capital of the company, they would all offer 
themselves for re-election at the following Annual General Meeting, 
although it is the directors’ current intention to stand for election 
annually in any event in accordance with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Recommendation and explanatory notes relating to business to be conducted at the 
Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2014 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 155 
As at the date of the Notice of Annual General Meeting, the company 
does not hold any ordinary shares in the capital of the company in 
treasury. However, the 6,934,564 shares held within the G4S Employee 
Benefi t Trust and referred to on page 137 (note 37 to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements) are accounted for as treasury shares.
7. DISAPPLICATION OF STATUTORY PRE-EMPTION 
RIGHTS (RESOLUTION 20)
Resolution 20 seeks shareholder approval to give the directors 
authority to allot shares in the capital of the company pursuant to the 
authority granted under Resolution 19 for cash without complying with 
the pre-emption rights in the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) in 
certain circumstances. This authority will permit the directors to allot:
(a)  shares up to a nominal amount of £258,598,000 (representing a 
little under two thirds of the company’s issued share capital) on an 
offer to existing shareholders. However unless the shares are 
allotted pursuant to a rights issue (rather than an open offer), the 
directors may only allot shares up to a nominal amount of 
£129,299,000 (representing a little under one third of the 
company’s issued share capital) (in each case subject to any 
adjustments, such as for fractional entitlements and overseas 
shareholders, as the directors see fi t); and 
(b)  shares up to a maximum nominal value of £19,394,000, 
representing approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the company as at 28 March 2014 (the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting) 
otherwise than in connection with an offer to existing shareholders. 
As with Resolution 19, the terms of Resolution 20 are the same as 
last year’s resolution (save that the number of shares in question 
has increased).
The directors confi rm their intention to follow the provisions of the 
Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding cumulative 
usage of authorities within a rolling three-year period. The Principles 
provide that companies should not issue shares for cash representing 
more than 7.5% of the relevant company’s issued share capital in any 
rolling three-year period, other than to existing shareholders, without 
prior consultation with shareholders. 
The authority contained in Resolution 20 will expire upon the expiry of 
the general authority conferred by Resolution 19 (i.e. at the end of the 
next Annual General Meeting of the company).
8. PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES (RESOLUTION 21)
Resolution 21 seeks to renew the company’s authority to buy back 
its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Act. The 
authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to a 
maximum of 155,159,000 (representing a little less than 10% of the 
company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 28 March 2014 (the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting)) and sets minimum and maximum prices. This authority will 
expire at the conclusion of the company’s Annual General Meeting 
in 2015. 
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to 
purchase the company’s ordinary shares but will keep the matter under 
review, taking into account the fi nancial resources of the company, the 
company’s share price and future funding opportunities. The authority 
will be exercised only if the directors believe that to do so would result 
in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the interests of 
shareholders generally. No shares were purchased pursuant to the 
equivalent authority granted to the directors at the company’s last 
Annual General Meeting. 
As at 28 March 2014 (the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting), there were 
no options over the ordinary shares in the capital of the company.
9. POLITICAL DONATIONS (RESOLUTION 22)
Resolution 22 deals with the rules on political donations contained in 
the Act. Under these rules, political donations to any political parties, 
independent election candidates or political organisations or the 
incurring of political expenditure are prohibited unless authorised 
by shareholders in advance. What constitutes a political donation, 
a political party, a political organisation, or political expenditure is not 
easy to decide, as the legislation is capable of wide interpretation. 
Sponsorship, subscriptions, payment of expenses, paid leave for 
employees fulfi lling public duties, and support for bodies representing 
the business community in policy review or reform, may fall within this. 
Therefore, notwithstanding that the company has not made political 
donations requiring shareholder authority in the past, and has no 
intention either now or in the future of making any such political 
donation or incurring any such political expenditure in respect of any 
political party, political organisation or independent election candidate, 
the board has decided to put forward Resolution 20, which is the same 
as the resolution on this subject which was passed at the company’s 
Annual General Meeting held on 6 June 2013. This will allow the 
company to support the community and put forward its views to wider 
business and government interests without running the risk of being in 
breach of the law. This authority will cover the period from the date 
Resolution 20 is passed until the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the company. As permitted under the Act, Resolution 22 
also covers political donations made, or political expenditure incurred, 
by any subsidiaries of the company. 
10. PERIOD OF NOTICE FOR CALLING GENERAL 
MEETINGS (RESOLUTION 23)
Resolution 23 is a resolution to allow the company to hold general 
meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) on 14 days’ notice.
The minimum notice period permitted by the Act for general meetings 
(other than Annual General Meetings) is 21 days. However the Act 
allows companies to reduce this period back to 14 days (other than for 
Annual General Meetings) provided that two conditions are met. The 
fi rst condition is that the company offers a facility for shareholders to 
vote by electronic means. This condition is met if the company offers a 
facility, accessible to all shareholders, to appoint a proxy by means of a 
website. The second condition is that there is an annual resolution of 
shareholders approving the reduction of the minimum notice period 
from 21 days to 14 days.
The board is therefore proposing Resolution 23 as a special resolution 
to approve 14 days as the minimum period of notice for all general 
meetings of the company other than Annual General Meetings. The 
approval will be effective until the company’s next Annual General 
Meeting, when it is intended that the approval be renewed. 
The board will consider on a case by case basis whether the use of 
the fl exibility offered by the shorter notice period is merited, taking 
into account the circumstances, including whether the business of the 
meeting is time sensitive, and will balance that against the need for 
shareholders to consider their voting decisions, particularly where the 
proposals concerned are complex and may require more time for 
proper evaluation. 156 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
APPENDIX
SUMMARY OF THE G4S LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
(THE “L TIP”)
Administration
Awards will be granted, and the LTIP will be administered, by the board, 
or a duly authorised committee of the board. Awards for executive 
directors will be determined and administered by the Remuneration 
Committee (and references to the board shall mean the Remuneration 
Committee in respect of such awards). 
Eligibility
Awards may be granted to any of the employees of the company or its 
subsidiaries, including the executive directors.
Form of awards
Under the LTIP , awards will take the form of either:
 – a conditional right to receive shares which will be automatically 
transferred to the award holder following vesting (a ‘’Conditional 
Award’’); or
 – an interest in shares which will be held on behalf of the award holder 
until vesting (a “Forfeitable Share Award’’). The award holder will not 
be entitled to call for or otherwise deal in the shares subject to a 
Forfeitable Share Award prior to vesting.
Timing of grant of awards
Awards under the LTIP may, save in exceptional circumstances, only be 
granted within a period of 42 days (i) commencing on the date of the 
adoption of the LTIP or (ii) following the date of announcement by 
the company of its interim or fi nal results (or as soon as practicable 
thereafter if the company is restricted from being able to grant awards 
during such period). 
Awards under the LTIP may not be granted more than ten years 
after the rules are approved by shareholders of the company in 
general meeting.
Non-Transferable and Non-Pensionable
Awards are non-transferable and do not form part of pensionable 
earnings.
Dividend equivalents
Award holders may receive an additional payment (or shares of 
equivalent value) equal to the dividends during the vesting period 
which would have been paid on the number of shares that vest. Award 
holders shall not be, unless the board determines otherwise, entitled to 
receive any dividends paid in respect of shares subject to a Forfeitable 
Share Award.
Individual limit
The maximum market value of the shares over which an employee 
may be granted an award under the LTIP in any calendar year shall not 
exceed an amount equal to 250 per cent. of the employee’s gross 
annual basic salary at that time. 
Plan Limits
Shares may be newly issued, transferred from treasury or market 
purchased for the purposes of the LTIP .
The number of shares subject to outstanding options or awards 
granted within the previous 10 years and the number of shares issued 
for the purpose of options and awards granted within the previous 
10 years shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the company’s ordinary share 
capital in issue immediately prior to the proposed date of grant under 
all employees’ share schemes adopted by the company.
The number of shares subject to outstanding options or awards 
granted within the previous 10 years and the number of shares issued 
for the purpose of options and awards granted within the previous 10 
years shall not exceed fi ve per cent. of the company’s ordinary share 
capital in issue immediately prior to the proposed date of grant under 
all discretionary employees’ share schemes adopted by the company.
These limits do not include rights to shares which have been released, 
lapsed or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting. Any 
option or award which the board has determined will only be satisfi ed 
with existing shares (or which is granted on such terms), will not be 
subject to or counted in calculating the above limits. Treasury shares will 
count as new issue shares for the purpose of these limits for so long as 
institutional investor bodies consider that they should be so counted.
Performance conditions
The board will determine the performance conditions which will apply 
to awards and which will be measured, ordinarily, over a period of 
not less than three years (or such shorter period as the board may 
determine to be appropriate on the recruitment of an employee). 
There will be no provision for re-testing. The board may alter the 
performance conditions if events happen after the date of grant that 
cause the board to consider that any element of the performance 
condition is no longer a fair measure of the company’s performance, 
provided that the revised target is not considered to be materially less 
challenging in the circumstances. Performance conditions proposed for 
executive directors are outlined in the company’s remuneration policy, 
and will be set out in the annual report on directors’ remuneration.
Vesting
Awards will normally only vest three years after the date of grant (or 
such earlier date as the board may determine to be appropriate on 
the recruitment of an employee), while the award holder remains in 
offi ce or employment with the group, and to the extent that relevant 
performance conditions have been met. 
For those awards that are to be granted in June 2014, the board has 
determined that any such awards will be treated as if they were granted 
in March 2014 (both in respect of the vesting period and the share 
price that is to be used to calculate the number of shares over which 
an award can be granted) in order to bring these awards in line 
with the company’s usual grant cycle. This is because the board 
has historically granted allocations under the company’s existing 
Performance Share Plan in March each year, but as noted in paragraph 
2 of the Explanatory Notes on page 154, the Performance Share Plan 
will shortly be expiring and therefore new awards will be granted under 
the LTIP . As the LTIP will not be adopted by the board until after it has 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, awards 
under the LTIP cannot be granted until June 2014 at the earliest.
If the board so determines, an award may be satisfi ed in whole or 
in part by a cash payment as an alternative to the issue or transfer 
of shares.
Leavers
An award will normally lapse where the award holder ceases to hold 
offi ce or employment with the group. Awards will not lapse on death 
or where the cessation of offi ce or employment with the group is due 
to injury, disability, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the transfer of the 
award holder’s employment in connection with a business sale, the 
company with which the award holder holds offi ce or employment 
ceasing to be a member of the group, or any other reason if the board 
so determines (a “Good Leaver’’).
Where an award holder ceases employment for a Good Leaver reason, 
the award will continue and vest on its normal vesting date. However, 
the board may determine that the award will instead vest on or at any 
time following the date of cessation. On the death of a participant, an 
award shall immediately vest.
Recommendation and explanatory notes relating to business to be conducted at the 
Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2014 continued Annual Report and Accounts 2013 G4S plc 157 
Corporate actions
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest. In the 
event of the passing of a resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the 
company, awards will vest. In the event of a demerger of a substantial 
part of the group’s business, a special dividend or a similar event 
affecting the value of the shares to a material extent, awards may be 
adjusted as set out below or the board may allow awards to vest. 
Where the corporate action forms part of an internal re-organisation, 
unless the board determines otherwise, an award shall not vest, and 
instead will be rolled-over into an award over shares in the new 
controlling company of equivalent value.
Extent of vesting
Awards will only vest (including for leavers or on a corporate action) to 
the extent that the relevant performance conditions have been satisfi ed. 
Where an award vests prior to the normal vesting date, the board 
will assess performance using such information as it determines to 
be appropriate.
Where, prior to the normal vesting date, an award holder ceases 
employment for a Good Leaver reason or there is a corporate action, 
the number of shares in respect of which an award vests will, unless 
the board determines otherwise, be pro-rated on the basis of the 
number of whole months which have elapsed from grant to the date 
of cessation or the corporate action (as applicable).
Variation of capital
The number of shares subject to awards may be adjusted, in such 
manner as the board may determine, following any variation of share 
capital of the company, a demerger of a substantial part of the group’s 
business, a special dividend or a similar event affecting the value of 
shares to a material extent.
Alterations 
The board may amend the LTIP rules as it considers appropriate, 
subject to any relevant legislation, provided that no modifi cation may 
be made which confers any additional advantage on participants 
relating to eligibility, plan limits, the basis of individual entitlement, the 
price payable for the acquisition of shares and the provisions for the 
adjustment of awards without prior shareholder approval, except 
in relation to performance conditions or minor amendments to 
benefi t the administration of the LTIP , to take account of a change in 
legislation, or to obtain or maintain favourable tax exchange control 
or regulatory treatment for participants or the company (or other 
group companies).
Clawback
The board may apply clawback where at any time before or within two 
years of vesting it determines that the fi nancial results of the company 
were misstated, an error was made in any calculation or in assessing 
performance, which resulted in the number of shares in respect of 
which the award was granted or vested being more than it should have 
been. The board may also apply a claw-back where the award holder 
has been dismissed for misconduct.
A clawback may be satisfi ed in a number of ways, including by reducing 
the amount of any future bonus, by reducing the vesting of any 
subsisting or future options or awards (other than tax-advantaged 
options or awards), by reducing the number of shares under any vested 
but unexercised option and/or by either one or both of a requirement 
to make a cash payment or transfer of shares to the company.
The clawback provisions will not apply following the occurrence of a 
takeover or similar corporate event.
Overseas plans
The LTIP contains provisions which permit the board to establish 
further plans for the benefi t of overseas employees based on the LTIP 
but modifi ed as necessary or desirable to take account of overseas tax, 
exchange control or securities laws. Any new shares issued under 
such plans would count towards the individual and overall plan limits 
outlined above. 158 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

management of all Group companies. This process not only enabled us to engage with
and retain the best talent residing within the enlarged Group, it was also motivating,
accelerated positive team building and allowed us to adopt ‘best practice’ in our

partnership which delivers significant value to both parties. By
working together at a strategic level, Phoenix is able to deliver

In October 2007 Phoenix IT services successfully renewed
the contract to deliver a fully managed service solution to
Sun for a further 3 years. The contract comprises a
combination of 100 on-site engineers and call despatch
functions. In addition, Phoenix continues to support Sun in
a number of key multi vendor support contracts.

14771PHOENIX:Layout 4  15/7/08  11:15  Page 6 Throughout the test ICM provided a seamless solution. Stuart
Dunsmore: “I can safely say that my expectations were
surpassed. The staff at ICM were outstanding — their
professionalism and customer care were exemplary from start
to finish and the test ran like clockwork. The whole experience
really reinforced our impressions here at Commerzbank that
should we have an invocation we are in more than capable
hands.”
The facilities at ICM’s disaster recovery centres have also
impressed Commerzbank, with further evidence of ICM’s
knowledge of client needs and attention to detail apparent in the
quality of sites ICM offers.  Stuart Dunsmore: “For Commerzbank,
ICM’s business continuity sites epitomise exactly what we would
need in the event of an invocation. The layouts, resources,
locations and general look and feel were perfect for us.  
The Future Together
The two companies have now worked successfully together for 7
months and the relationship saw Commerzbank recently winning
the Crisis Strategy of the Year Award at the 2008 CIR Business
Continuity Industry Awards. For Stuart, his first impression of ICM
has been borne out.
The need for business continuity provision has never been more
acute in the financial services sector . For Commerzbank, ICM has
met that need head on, providing the highest level of provision to
ensure the bank has exactly the level and type of cover it needs.
Regular testing and close liaison ensure changing needs are met
and that both the bank and ICM know exactly how any invocation
would work. For Stuart Dunsmore the benefits of this relationship
are clear — “Knowing that we are in expert hands gives us the
reassurance that we are looking for from our business 
continuity partner .”
CASE STUDY:
COMMERZBANK
Security For Financial Services
Business continuity provision is essential to any business, but in
the financial services industry it’s in a league of its own. With
international money markets moving at the speed of light, and
billions of pounds being traded every second, the threat to both
the profits and reputation of a bank, should it be unable to
communicate to the market, is critical. 
Commerzbank is the second largest bank in Germany. The bank
has two offices in the City of London, with the majority of staff
housed in one densely inhabited building over 9 floors, posing a
definite logistical consideration for the business continuity team.
When considering a business continuity partner , Stuart
Dunsmore, Head of Business Continuity at Commerzbank,
consulted a number of potential providers. The breadth and
depth of ICM’s offering, its experience and its approach to
customer service all ticked important boxes for him. “I needed a
provider who could offer first-class service and provide us with
110% dedication to our continuity needs,” commented Stuart.
“ICM offered the outstanding levels of provision and the
essential human touch that we were looking for .”
Words into Practice
When Commerzbank undertook its first business continuity
test, the quality of service ICM offered became apparent.  “For a
financial services firm, these tests are crucial” commented
Stuart. “We are obligated by bodies such as the Financial
Services Authority to ensure we have water-tight plans in place
to minimise any business interruption from an incident —
whether it’s a power outage or a terrorist attack — so the
pressure was on ICM to deliver .”

Servo’s passion to deliver ‘benefits’ to a customer’s business provides
a significant competitive differentiator in a marketplace in which
competitors seem to focus on offering product and service ‘features’.
Past performance in delivering business benefits to customers has
helped establish Servo’s market reputation as a ‘specialist’ provider
of IT infrastructure services and has enhanced customer loyalty and
relationship longevity.  
Servo’s primary target is that mid-market customer , operating under
constraints to stay lean, who does not have the staff numbers or
expertise to provide informed decisions on the management and
development of IT support.
Servo adopts a consultative approach to the marketplace enabling
us to engage in depth with our primary target customer group, whilst
secondary targets include larger enterprise customers who wish to
augment their own IT knowledge and skills with Servo’s consultancy
services, and those wanting full management control of their IT
resource and only want to take products and services of their choice
from Servo’s extensive and competitively priced ‘menu’.
Servo maintains accreditations from all major IT software, hardware
and network majors and prides itself on keeping all technical,
engineering, sales and consultancy staff at the leading edge of
industry developments.
Integration of the two businesses enhances Servo’s competitiveness
by providing greater scale, operating efficiencies, geographical
coverage and sales knowledge to leverage future opportunities
within vertical channels of expertise (e.g. local government, retail,
education, professional services, financial services).  
www.servo.co.uk
The enlarged Servo company is well positioned
to provide the UK mid-market with the breadth
and depth of industry knowledge, technical
skills and services to design, deliver and
manage a customer’s IT infrastructure.
Although offering a comprehensive range of IT
infrastructure products and services, above all
else, Servo strives to work with customers to
deliver tangible benefits by focusing and
aligning their IT resources to drive revenue,
improve efficiencies, reduce costs, manage
business information and manage risk.

Comprehensive Service Offering
In 2004, Ramsay carried out a review of their service provision
and, whilst they had embarked on a pan-European outsourcing
agreement with a company based in Sweden, Ramsay Health
Care UK ultimately wanted to keep their service provision
requirements within the UK.
The following year , due to the ever increasing requirements of
medical care in the UK hospital infrastructure, a growing user
database and the need for support in the management of their
patient administration systems, Ramsay entered into
discussions to outsource their user helpdesk and the hosting
and management of their datacentre.
Ramsay needed a provider who could be flexible in its service
delivery and provide a ‘one stop shop’ for all their service
requirements in this new phase of their IT development.
All Ramsay’s project infrastructure requirements were fulfilled
by Servo. With a nationwide network of service centres,
datacentres and engineering resources, and with a proven track
record in service delivery of which Ramsay already had
experience, the choice was easy to make.
Mutual Benefits from Lasting Relationships
Servo now provides datacentre hosting and managed services,
user helpdesk and on-call break-fix, technical consultancy and
deskside support to the entire network of Ramsay Health Care
UK’s hospitals as well as its Head Office, and continues to be
Ramsay’s chosen hardware maintenance service provider .
Ramsay has a strong position in the UK market for public health
care with considerable potential for further expansion, and
Servo’s solutions have the flexibility to adapt with Ramsay’s
business needs as they grow and change.
CASE STUDY:
RAMSAY HEALTH CARE UK
Servicing Private Health Care
Ramsay Health Care UK is a leading provider of independent
health care, with over 30 sites including acute hospitals, private
patients units, Independent Sector Treatment Centres,
neurological rehabilitation centres and mobile imaging services.
Ramsay provides a comprehensive range of specialised and
efficient clinical specialties from orthopaedics and general
surgery, to cardiac surgery and oncology.
Recognised by all major medical insurers, Ramsay offers fast,
convenient, effective and high quality treatment for all patients,
whether medically insured, self-pay, or from the increasing
number referred by the NHS.
Servo  has a long-standing relationship with Ramsay Health
Care UK as their hardware maintenance service provider ,
having delivered support for Intel servers, desktop and legacy
systems since the company’s inception in the UK in 1999.

14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
Review of the Year
I am pleased to report that Phoenix IT Group plc has delivered good
results in 2008 against a backdrop of significant change during the
year . Following the Group’s largest acquisition to date, that of ICM
Computer Group plc in May 2007 , an integration review and
planning exercise was undertaken and the resulting integration
programme is nearing completion. As a result the Group is well
placed in each of the markets that it serves and enters the new
financial year in a strong position.
Results
Group revenues increased by 82.1% to £230.8m (2007: £126.7m)
and operating profit before non-recurring items and amortisation
of acquired intangibles increased by 45.4% to £33.0m (2007:
£22.7m). Profit from operations (after amortisation of acquired
intangibles) increased by 13.1% to £23.4m (2007: £20.7m). The
Group has continued to be highly cash generative during the year
with the free cash flow increasing by 26.2% to £29.7m (2007:
£23.6m).

Dividend
The Board recommends a proposed final dividend of 3.65p (2007:
second interim dividend of 3.17 4p), which, if approved at the Annual
General Meeting, will be paid on 1 October 2008. Combined with
the interim dividend of 1.83p paid in January 2008, this makes a
total dividend per share of 5.48p (2007: 4.764p), an increase of 15%. 
Board Changes 
During the year we announced that Nick Robinson stepped down as
Chief Executive Officer and became Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman from 1 January 2008. Nick joined the business in its
earliest years and has been instrumental in its successful growth
and development. He remains a substantial shareholder and I am
very glad that the Group will continue to benefit from his
involvement on the Board.
I became Executive Chairman on 22 November 2007 after serving
as Non-Executive Chairman since 21 October 2004. It is currently
expected that I will remain in this role until 31 December 2008
when I will revert to Non-Executive Chairman.
Jeremy Stafford, who has served as Chief Operating Officer since
24 April 2007 , became Chief Executive from 31 March 2008.
Employees
We are fortunate to have a strong team of talented and
hardworking people in the Group who have delivered the successful
performance achieved in the year and I thank them all on behalf of
the Board and the shareholders. I am also pleased to formally
welcome the management and staff of ICM to Phoenix IT Group.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Group’s registered
office, Technology House, Hunsbury Hill Avenue, Northampton on
Thursday, 14 August at 10.30 a.m. 
Summary
The integration phase is nearing completion and the Group is
confident that the new structure will not only deliver the
anticipated synergy cost savings in the next financial year but also
provide a platform for growth for each of the business units.

Overview
The past year has seen Phoenix IT Group move to a new level
following the acquisition of ICM at the end of May 2007 and the
acquisition of Servo which completed in November 2006. During
the year , we began the process of integrating these recently
acquired companies, together with other Group Companies, into
larger , more competitive business units focused on discrete market
sectors. We have also worked on introducing a new operating
model that leverages the benefits of scale of the enlarged Group.
This integration process is currently being implemented and will be
materially complete by the autumn of 2008. 
We have also had a successful year financially. For the year ended
31 March 2008 Group profit before tax (before non-recurring items
and amortisation of acquired intangibles) grew by 20.2% to
£25.6m
1
(2007: £21.3m) on Group revenues of £230.8m (2007:
£126.7m), an increase of 82.1%. 
Success factors in this growth and operational performance have
included a focus on servicing the needs of our customers;
operational precision; introduction of new and innovative services;
and tight cost controls that help us quote for new business more
accurately and keenly. 
The Markets the Group Serves
With effect from 1 April 2008 the Group moved from five operating
units to three customer facing divisions — ICM Continuous Business
(Business Continuity), Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services) and
Servo (Mid-Market) — supported by Shared Operations and
Corporate Services. 
Structural overview and the integration process
Following the ICM acquisition, the Group has undertaken a
thorough integration review and planning exercise and the
resulting integration programme is in the process of being
executed. 
 ICM Continuous Business (Business Continuity)
The Business Continuity Division, comprising Network Disaster
Recovery (‘NDR’) and the Business Continuity business of ICM,
will be branded ICM Continuous Business. The two businesses
coming together create a powerful force in the UK business
continuity market with 15 purpose built centres, over 7 ,500
recovery positions, extensive Mobile and IT recovery capabilities,
and over 2,100 customers. The customer bases of the two
businesses are complementary, with ICM having greater high
end market penetration compared to NDR’s mid-market
strength. This element of the integration plan will be
substantially complete by the end of June 2008.
 Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services)
Phoenix IT Services continues to focus on delivering a wide
range of IT support services to typically large end users through
partners. 
 Servo (Mid-Market) 
Servo and ICM’s Managed Availability Services business are
being merged resulting in a significant operation enjoying
increased scale benefits focused on providing IT solutions and
services to a large mid-market customer base. From 1 April
2008, this division has been branded Servo. This element of the
integration is under way and it is envisaged that it will be
substantially complete by the end of Autumn 2008.
 The Group is also in the process of establishing a centralised
operational shared services unit which will undertake
activities (for example, logistics) on behalf of the three
operating divisions to maximise operational efficiencies.
Existing activities are being progressively transferred from the
individual business units to the shared services centre. This is
expected to be substantially complete by the end of Autumn
2008. 
The integration process is delivering a number of cost synergies for
the enlarged Group, including:
 a reduction in the number of sites from which the business
continuity division will provide services. Two sites in High
Wycombe are in the process of being closed and the contracts
will be transferred to other recovery centres; the two sites in
Bristol have been combined; and the Darlaston, West Midlands
facility is in the process of being combined with the NDR head
office in Aston, Birmingham;
 greater operating efficiencies derived from the creation of
larger units throughout the UK which will have a greater
density of coverage; and 
 increased procurement and productivity gains arising from
the combination of the Group’s respective logistics operations
and support functions. 
During the year the Group incurred a total of £6.4m of non-
recurring items of which £4.3m has been a cash expense. £5.5m of
the non-recurring items incurred during the year relate to the
integration project and it is anticipated that a further £4.6m will be
incurred during the next 12 months. The project has yielded cost
synergies of £1.7m during the year and it is anticipated that further
cost synergies of £5.5m will be achieved in the financial year to
March 2009. 
ICM Continuous Business (Business Continuity)
The ICM Continuous Business division serves the business
continuity and disaster recovery market and for the year ended 
31 March 2008 combined revenues were £42.0m (2007: £18.8m)
with an operating profit of £8.9m (2007: £4.9m). The Business
Continuity business of ICM has been part of the Group for 10
months of this financial year .

The merging of ICM and NDR creates a critical mass business
providing a national network of business recovery centres that are
well placed in relation to our target customer groups, with each
centre equipped to meet the needs of our customers. The quality of
our proposition and service offering has been recognised at the
recent Business Continuity Annual Awards Ceremony which was
held on 8 May 2008 where we received a number of awards
including Service Provider of the Year .
Acquired in 2005, NDR provides business continuity and disaster
recovery services, targeting predominantly small and medium sized
enterprise (‘SME’) customers. The company has built a strong
reputation in this sector which it services effectively with
consultancy services, real time data back-up, office and mobile
facilities and support in the case of disaster or major business
interruption. There has been continued investment in infrastructure
to create additional work area and data centre capacity at the
existing NDR Aston and Uxbridge facilities. 
The Business Continuity business of ICM provides services to a wide
range of customers and in June 2007 acquired a lease on a
100,000 sq ft facility in Farnborough, Hampshire, and has
subsequently signed two major contracts for the facility as
previously announced, with values of £8.4m over 7 years and
£12.0m over 3 years.
Combining the ICM and NDR customer bases has given us
extensive penetration of the large enterprise and SME sectors
providing us with a solid platform for growth and the knowledge
and expertise to accelerate business progress.
Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services)
Our Partner Services business targets large enterprise scale
customers through IT services companies (‘Partners‘). Against a
market background of increased competition and commoditisation,
our revenues exceeded £100m (2007: £91.5m) for the first time,
representing double digit growth year on year , and delivered £17 .8m
(2007: £17 .6m) of operating profit. Operating margins for the year
were 17 .2% (2007: 19.2%) and management believe the division’s
margin is broadly sustainable at this level due to increased
economies of scale, low cost of sale and operational innovation. 
The performance of this division and in particular the decline in the
operating margin reflects the material contribution of a large, high
margin contract in the prior year . This contract did not contribute
materially in the financial year under review. The underlying
business has progressed significantly and is now well positioned for
the future. The move away from reliance on a small number of very
large contracts is both reflective of changes in the market and a
determination to create a more stable and predictable base for this
business.
We performed well in all sectors in which our Partner business
competes: our system support business exhibited annual growth of
12%, managed services grew by 22%, projects by 23% and network
services by 9% giving overall growth of 12.6%. 
Our engagement with established partners has also progressed
well during the year . Service quality has remained high and we
continue to meet overall customer service SLA’s. 
We measure on-going cost performance in all phases of service
delivery in order to find ways to improve efficiencies and protect
margins. Cost is only one element of competition; differentiating
our offer is another and considerable effort has been devoted to
creating innovative new services, with good results. For example,
we have introduced OneStream, an integrated remote monitoring
system. Similarly, we have developed a web based password reset
tool to enable users to reset their own passwords securely. After a
successful pilot, we aim to scale-up the product in preparation for
wider distribution. 
Established in 1979, Phoenix has grown
consistently with a reputation for high
quality service levels.

right strategy and structure in place
for the enlarged Group to deliver value
to our customers and to achieve
sustainable profitable growth.”
Jeremy Stafford, Chief Executive
Our small French operation which delivers services to IT industry
partners continued to grow by replicating the proven UK partner
model. The French operation continues to be profitable. 
Servo (Mid-Market)
The Servo division comprises the Servo business, which was
acquired by the Group in November 2006, and ICM Managed
Availability Services (for 10 months). Combined revenues for the
year ended 31 March 2008 were £85.9m (2007: £16.4m) and
operating profit was £9.0m (2007: £1.7m). 
The Servo division provides customers with a complementary and
extended range of services together with improved geographical
coverage. 
The Servo business saw improving performance quarter on quarter
and posted a very strong end to the year , reflecting both an
improvement in Servo’s business mix and healthy new business
generation. 
ICM Managed Availability Services has a strong technical capability
and this has thrived within the business development culture of the
Group. ICM has been developing its hosting capabilities and has
3,000 m
2
of hosting space which is nearly all sold as a result of
strong market demand. A further 1,000 m
2
of data centre space is
under construction for 2008/9 with an anticipated commission
date of August 2008.
Strategy 
We are confident that we have the right Group strategy in place to
deliver value to our customers and to achieve sustainable,
profitable growth. Each of our three operating divisions benefits
directly from being part of the wider Group, leveraging our shared
operation and corporate services capability as well as opportunities
to cross-sell between divisions and to sell a wider portfolio of
services to individual customers. In addition, as we plan for the
longer term growth of the Group, we have established a strong
modular structure which can be expanded with the addition of
service lines and further acquisitions, as appropriate. 
The Board believes that a continuing focus on the UK will maximise
the performance of the Group for the foreseeable future. 
Outlook
This has been a transformational year for the Group in which we
have made very good progress with the integration of ICM as well
as delivering a strong set of results. We are confident that we have
the right strategy and structure in place for the enlarged Group to
deliver value to our customers and to achieve sustainable profitable
growth. 
We have achieved good momentum into the current financial year
and, in spite of continuing macro economic uncertainties, we
remain positive about the outlook for the current year and beyond.

Summary of Results
The 2008 results represent another positive year for the Group.
Taking into account the ICM acquisition, revenues, profit before tax
and cash generation were all at record levels. The results were
achieved in an environment of significant change for the Group
following the acquisition of ICM during the year , the acquisition of
Servo in the latter part of the previous year , and the subsequent
transition from five principal UK operating companies to three
customer facing divisions. The integration activity is progressing to
plan and will position the Group for further organic and acquisition
led growth.
The acquisition of ICM Computer Group plc was completed at the
end of May 2007 for a cash consideration of £65.4m, including
acquisition costs of £3.6m, and the issue of 14,047 ,184 shares in
Phoenix IT Group plc. Accordingly, ten months results from the ICM
business are included in these financial statements. In the ten
months to 31 March 2008, ICM contributed total revenues of
£68.2m and profit from operations of £6.9m. The ICM Business
Continuity division generated revenues of £21.4m and profit from
operations of £2.9m and the ICM Managed Availability Services
division generated £46.8m and profit from operations of £4.0m.
The ICM order book at 31 March 2008 was £97 .4m, with £65.0m
attributable to the Business Continuity division and £32.4m to the
Managed Availability Services division.
Revenue and Profits 
Revenues increased by 82.1% to £230.8m (2007: £126.7m). 
Group profit from operations before non-recurring items and
amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 45.4% to £33.0m
(2007: £22.7m). Group operating profit margin before non-
recurring items and amortisation of acquired intangibles has
decreased to 14.3% (2007: 17 .9%). This reduction in Group
operating profit margin is primarily due to the operating margins of
the mid-market businesses of Servo and ICM (which include a
significant proportion of product resale) being lower than those of
the Partner and Business Continuity businesses. 
As a result of a combination of continuing organic growth and the
effect of the acquired businesses, profit before tax, non-recurring
items and amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 20.2%
to £25.6m (2007: £21.3m).
1
Non-recurring items are those significant non–recurring items
which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to
enable a full understanding of the Group’s operating performance.
Transactions which have given rise to non-recurring items are
principally integration related charges of £6.0m (2007: £nil) and
costs in relation to arrangement of the Group’s new bank facilities
at the time of the acquisition of ICM of £0.4m (2007: £nil). A full
analysis of the non-recurring items is set out in note 7 . The Group’s
integration and reorganisation programme is progressing
according to plan and was well underway at the year end and
consequently the further costs associated with the plan in the next
financial year will be at a lower level than incurred to date. The
project has yielded cost synergies of £1.7m during the year . Profit
from operations (after non-recurring items and amortisation of
acquired intangibles) increased by 13.1% to £23.4m (2007: £20.7m).
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’, customer relationships and the brand name have
been recognised on the acquisition of ICM as acquired intangible
assets. A valuation of £18.7m has been attributed to these resulting
in an additional amortisation charge in the period of £1.6m.
Profit before tax decreased in the year by 19.4% to £15.5m (2007:
£19.3m) as a result of the non-recurring items and increases in both
amortisation and interest charges. Investment income and finance
costs are discussed below.
ICM Continuous Business (Business Continuity)
The Business Continuity division, which comprises NDR and the
Business Continuity division of ICM, had total revenues for the year
of £42.0m (2007: £18.8m), an increase of 123.0%. The order book
increased by 254.0% to £93.1m (2007: £26.3m). Profit from
operations, although impacted by the acquisition of the
Farnborough facility which made an anticipated start up loss of
£0.1m, was strong at £8.9m (2007: £4.9m), giving an operating
profit margin of 21.1% (2007: 26.2%). The reduction in the margins
reflects the lower utilisation rates of the ICM Business Continuity
facilities compared to those of NDR.
NDR, in isolation, increased its revenues by 9.6% to £20.6m (2007:
£18.8m), profit from operations by 18.8% to £5.9m (2007: £4.9m)
and order book by 6.6% to £28.1m (2007: £26.3m). The operating
profit margin increased to 28.4% (2007: 26.2%).

Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services)
The Partner Services division (Phoenix IT Services Limited and
Phoenix IT Services S.A.) has achieved a resumption of revenue
growth in the year with revenues increasing by 12.4% to £102.9m
(2007: £91.5m). The order book at the year end was £171.9m (2007:
£154.6m) an increase of 11.2% on the prior year and gives a strong
platform for growth going into the new financial year . Divisional
operating profit increased by £0.2m to £17 .8m (2007: £17 .6m) and
the operating profit margin, although still strong, has decreased to
17 .2% (2007: 19.2%) as a result of the continuing commoditisation
of certain service lines and the ongoing effect of a significant
reduction in what was the division’s largest contract. Excluding the
effect of the reduction in this contract, underlying operating
margins increased to 16.7% (2007: 16.5%). 
Servo (Mid-Market)
The Mid-Market division comprises Servo Computer Services
Limited, which was acquired by the Group in November 2006, and
ICM Managed Availability Services Limited, which was acquired at
the end of May 2007 . This division reported revenues of £85.9m
(2007: £16.4m) an increase of 425.4%, including the full year effect
of Servo and the acquisition of ICM. The total order book for the
division increased by 338.7% to £46.5m (2007: £10.6m), with an
increase in Servo Computer Services Limited’s order book of 33.2%
to £14.1m (2007: £10.6m).
Divisional operating profit, including the full year effect of Servo
and the ICM acquisition, increased by 424.9% to £9.0m 
(2007: £1.7m).
Investment Income and Finance Costs
During the year the Group arranged new banking facilities with
Royal Bank of Scotland plc (replacing the existing facilities)
comprising 2 and 5 year term loans totalling £100.0m, a five year
£30.0m revolving credit facility and a £10.0m overdraft facility. The
Group entered into a three year interest rate swap on 
28 September 2007 at an interest rate of 5.78% plus applicable
margin against the amortising balance of the principal term loan,
giving interest rate certainty over £80.0m, £51.8m and £42.0m 
of the Group’s bank debt in the three years ending 
30 September 2010. 
Primarily as a result of the cash element of the ICM consideration,
Group borrowings, including finance leases, increased to £103.0m
(2007: £27 .7m) and as a result, the Group’s interest charges on
borrowings and overdrafts increased to £6.7m (2007: £1.3m) and
other finance costs (including the write-off of unamortised loan
costs and loan break costs following the arrangement of new bank
facilities — £0.5m) increased to £2.1m (2007: £0.4m). The Group
places surplus cash on deposit as appropriate in order to maximise
the short-term return on cash balances which generated
investment income of £0.2m in the year (2007: £0.2m).
Taxation
A full analysis of the tax charge for the year is set out in note 12.
The Group’s effective tax rate in 2008 was 30.6% (2007: 28.7%).
Balance Sheet
The significant changes to the Group balance sheet arise as a result
of the acquisition of ICM. A full analysis of the book and provisional
fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is given
in note 35.
As a result of the fit-out costs following the acquisition of a lease on
a 100,000 sq ft flagship business continuity centre in Farnborough
in June 2007 , together with further investment in data-centre
facilities and capital expenditure arising from the integration
programme, the Group’s capital expenditure during the year was
exceptionally high at £21.4m (2007: £4.4m). It is pleasing to report
that the additional business continuity and data-centre capacity is
operating in line with expectations and is expected to achieve
profitability in the year to 31 March 2009, with significant unutilised
capacity remaining to drive further growth in profit from this site.
Whilst the nature of business continuity and the Group’s data-
centre activities are significantly more capital intensive than the
other areas of activity, additional capital expenditure is only
incurred with clear visibility of the demand for the services that the
Group can then provide. 
Cash Flow
Strong control is exercised over the Group’s working capital and the
conversion of profit into cash. Consequently the Group continued
to be highly cash generative. Cash generated by operations was up
45.7% to £45.3m (2007: £31.0m). Cash generated by operations
before non-recurring cash flows were £49.5m (2007: £31.0m)
representing 168% of profit from operations before non-recurring
items (2007: 150%). The free cash flow for the year increased by
26.2% to £29.7m (2007: £23.6m).

Shareholders’ Returns
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding non-recurring items
and amortisation of acquired intangible assets were 24.1p (2007:
24.4p).
2
Diluted earnings per share were 14.6p (2007: 22.2p) a
decrease of 34.2% primarily due to the non-recurring items
incurred in the year . Comparable basic earnings per share were
15.0p (2007: 23.0p). 
Dividend
The Board has declared a proposed final dividend of 3.65p per share
to be paid on 1 October 2008 to Shareholders on the register at 
12 September 2008. This gives a total dividend for the year of 5.48p
per share (including the interim dividend of 1.83p paid to
Shareholders on 30 January 2008), compared to 4.764p for 2007 ,
giving an increase of 15.0%. The total dividend for the year is
covered 2.7 times by basic earnings per share, and Shareholders’
funds at the end of the financial year were £120.3m (2007: £56.4m).
Principal risks and uncertainties
As a result of the contracted revenues in the order book, the Group
has a high degree of forward visibility of its revenues over the next
twelve months. Nonetheless, there are a number of potential risks
and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the
Group’s performance over the current financial year and which
could cause the Group’s actual results to materially deviate from
expected and historical results.
Integration risk
The ongoing integration of ICM and reorganisation of the Group
into three customer facing divisions supported by Shared
Operations and Corporate Services is expected to yield material
annual cost savings and operational efficiencies. Execution of the
plan is now well underway and the Group has good visibility of the
remaining actions and activities, the synergies that will be delivered
and the one-off costs arising. However , an activity of this scale may
cause short term disruption to the Group. To mitigate this risk the
integration activity has been thoroughly planned, external advisers
have been used where appropriate, and the Group parallel-runs
activities to test the effectiveness of the new processes. The
resulting plans are being executed in series and are being tested at
each stage to ensure that any disruption to the Group’s customers
is either eliminated or minimised.
Acquisition risk
Since November 2004, the Group has made three successful
acquisitions. However , acquisitions can involve risks that may have
a material impact on the Group. The Group mitigates this risk by
undertaking thorough due diligence, and, where practical, by
contractual representations, warranties and indemnities.
Competitor risk
The IT services industry is highly competitive. Several competitors,
including, in some cases, Phoenix’s partners, have longer operating
histories, higher brand recognition, greater financial, technical,

at record levels.”
David Simpson, Chief Financial Officer
marketing, personnel and other resources than the Group. The
Group’s competitors have, and other potential competitors may have,
well established relationships with current and potential partners of
the Group. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond
more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in partner
requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their services, than the Group. In addition, the
Group may experience increased competition from low cost
outsourcing centres, including offshore centres, and new or existing
niche market participants whose costs, particularly for labour and for
service desks may be lower . Increased competition could lead to the
loss of market share, loss of material contracts, renegotiation of
price levels or a general reduction in revenues of the Group.
Macro economic risk
Whilst the Group has not seen any downturn in activity the recent
tightening of credit and increases in market interest rates could lead
to a slowing of growth in the UK economy. However , while there is a
risk of macro economic factors and particularly the so called ‘credit
crunch’ affecting direct sales activities, this risk is mitigated by the
high proportion of long term contracted annuity business.
Treasury policies and objectives
The Group operates within policies and guidelines approved by 
the Board. 
It is the Board’s preference to manage market risks without the use
of derivatives but they will be used where necessary and
appropriate to reduce the levels of volatility to both income and
equity. The use of derivatives is strictly controlled and they are not
permitted to be used for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group’s main treasury risks relate to the availability of funds to
meet its future requirements. At the year end, the Group had
undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £36.2m. The Group’s
policy with respect to facilities is to ensure that these are sufficient
to cover the expected needs of the Group, having reflected the
inherent uncertainty of projections and forecasts.
Key Performance Indicators
The Group regards its profit and cash generation as the most
appropriate measures of its financial performance.
Revenues
The Group’s aim is to increase revenues each year through a
combination of price and volume growth, organic expansion and
acquisitions. For the year ended 31 March 2008, Group revenues
increased by 82.1% to £230.8m (2007: £126.7m). Organic growth,
excluding the effect of acquisitions, contributed 6.8%.
Operating margin
This represents the Group’s profit from operations before non-
recurring items and amortisation of acquired intangibles divided by
Group revenues. For the year ended 31 March 2008, Group
operating profit margin was 14.3%, a reduction on the prior year
margin which was 17 .9%. This reduction was primarily due to the
lower operating profit margins of the Servo (Mid-Market) division
compared to the rest of the Group.
Profitability
Our main profitability KPIs are profit from operations before non-
recurring items and amortisation of acquired intangibles and
adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures increased in
the year by 45.4% and reduced by 1.2% respectively to £33.0m and
24.1p (2007: £22.7m and 24.4p).
Cash generated from operations
Strong control is exercised over the Group’s working capital and
conversion of profit into cash. For the year ended 31 March 2008,
cash generated from operations was up 45.7% to £45.3m (2007:
£31.0m). Cash generated by operations before non-recurring cash
flows were £49.5m (2007: £31.0m) representing 168.4% of profit
from operations before non-recurring items (2007: 150.2%).
Non Financial KPIs
Order book
The order book grew significantly in the year to £311.5m (2007:
£191.5m) an increase of 62.6%. The like-for-like order book,
excluding the effect of the ICM acquisition also increased to £214.0m
(2007: £191.5m) an increase of 11.8%. Of the total £311.5m, 53.2% is
expected to be recognised in revenues in the next financial year .
Contract renewal rates
The contract renewal rates by value for each operating division
improved on last year . ICM Continuous Business (Business
Continuity) division renewal rate was 89% (2007: 88%), the
Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services) division renewal rate was
86% (2007: 57%) and the Servo (Mid-Market) renewal rate was
92% (2007: 82%).

1477 14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
The Directors present their report together with the audited
financial statements for the Group and the Company for the year
ended 31 March 2008.
Principal Activity and Review of the Business
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of information
technology and business continuity services. A review of the
Group’s performance and future prospects is provided in the Chief
Executive’s Review and the Financial Review.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial and other
risks, a review of which is provided in the Financial Review and note
19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
The Directors propose a final dividend of 3.65p per Ordinary share
which, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, will be
paid on 1 October 2008, to Shareholders on the register at 
12 September 2008. The shares will go ex dividend on 10 September
2008. The final dividend together with the interim dividend of 1.83p
per Ordinary share paid in January 2008 makes a total dividend
per Ordinary share of 5.48p (2007: 4.764p), an increase of 15%. 
Capital Structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital
during the year are shown in note 30. The Company has one class
of Ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share
carries the right to one vote at the general meetings of the
Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the Articles of
Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware
of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
Details of employees’ share schemes are set out in note 39. Shares
held by the employee benefit trust do not attract any payment of
dividends nor do they have any voting rights attached to them.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
The Directors have authority to allot the Company’s unissued
Ordinary shares (within the meaning of Section 80 Companies Act
1985) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £200,908 (being
approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share capital at 
18 May 2007) and the power to disapply pre-emption rights in
respect of the allotment of shares (under Section 95 Companies
Act 1985) up to an aggregate nominal value of £30,136
(representing 5% of the Company’s issued share capital at 18 May
2007). In addition, the Directors have authority, on behalf of the
Company, to make market purchases of up to 3,013,624 Ordinary
shares of the Company (representing 5% of the Company’s issued
share capital at 18 May 2007). These authorities were conferred by
approval of separate resolutions at the Company’s last AGM and
are due to expire at the end of the forthcoming AGM. Separate
resolutions to renew these authorities will be proposed at the AGM
on 14 August 2008. Details of these resolutions are set out in the
Notice of AGM, which is shown on page 76.

Employment Policy and Investment
As a progressive service organisation, employees at every level are
critical to the Company and its future. Management and
professional and technical expertise are the Group’s major assets.
Investment in developing and retaining such skills is ongoing and
well established, and is supported by extensive use of in-house and
external training programmes.
The Board recognises the value of effective communication and
consultation with all employees and informing them of the progress
and policies of the Group. This is achieved through formal and
informal meetings, briefing groups and internal newsletters.
It is the Group’s policy to encourage the recruitment, training and
development of disabled persons on the basis of their aptitude and
ability, and the retention and retraining of employees who become
disabled.
Consistent with the Group’s human resources policies, the Board
encourages staff to identify with the financial success of the
business through the opportunity to acquire Ordinary shares. Staff
can participate in the financial prosperity of the Group through
share ownership. Employee incentive arrangements include a
Performance Share Plan, Share Option Schemes and Share
Incentive Plan.
Payments to Suppliers
The Group’s operating companies determine terms and conditions
of payment for the supply of capital and revenue items by
agreement with suppliers. Payment is then made on these terms,
subject to the terms and conditions being met by the suppliers. As
at 31 March 2008, trade creditors of the Group were equivalent to
56 days (2007: 41 days) and in the Company 59 days (2007: nil).
Charitable Donations
The total amount of charitable donations made during the year was
£31,994 (2007: £26,084). There were no political donations.
Going Concern
The Directors have considered detailed profit and cash flow
forecasts and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue as an operational business for the
foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore been
prepared on a going concern basis.
Auditors
An ordinary resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as
auditors of the Company is to be submitted to the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year . Under that law, the Directors have elected to
prepare the Group financial statements under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and the parent company financial statements under United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The financial statements
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company's
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set
out in the International Accounting Standards Board's 'Framework
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements'. In
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However , Directors are also
required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial
performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;

 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that
the parent company financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the corporate and financial information included on the Company's
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this
report confirms that:
(1) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(2)the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 August
2008 (together with explanatory notes) is sent to Shareholders
with this annual report. The special business of the meeting
includes the following resolutions:
Authority to Allot Shares (Resolution 7)
The Directors are seeking authority under Section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985 (‘the Act’) to allot shares up to an aggregate
nominal value of £249,965. This amount represents approximately
one-third of the total Ordinary share capital as at 14 May 2008. The
authority will be in substitution for the previous authority taken at last
year’s Annual General Meeting and will expire on the earlier of the
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or 14 November 2009.
The Directors have no present intention to make any such issue of
shares, other than in respect of shares that may be issued pursuant
to the Company’s share option schemes, but consider it is desirable
for them to be given this opportunity by Shareholders.
As at 14 May 2008, the Company held no treasury shares.
Disapplication of Pre-Emptive Rights (Resolution 8)
The Directors are seeking authority from Shareholders to allot
Ordinary shares for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis (as
required by Section 89 of the Act) in limited circumstances. The
Directors recommend that Section 89 of the Act should not apply
to any allotment of shares in connection with a rights issue, open
offer or other pre-emptive offer in favour of Ordinary Shareholders
in accordance with normal practice in the UK, nor to an issue for
cash of shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £37 ,495 which
is equivalent to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 
14 May 2008. The authority sought will expire on the earlier 
of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or 
14 November 2009.
Authority to make Market Purchases of Shares (Resolution 9)
The Directors are seeking authority to make market purchases,
pursuant to section 166 of the Act, of shares up to 3,7 49,478 Ordinary
shares which is equivalent to 5% of the Company’s issued share
capital as at 14 May 2008 on such terms and in such manner as the
Directors may determine, provided that the amount paid for each
share (exclusive of expenses) will not be more than 5% above the
average middle market quotation for Ordinary shares as derived from
the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange plc for the five
business days before the date on which the contract for the purchase
is made and in any event not less than 1p per ordinary share. The
authority sought will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the
next Annual General Meeting or 14 November 2009.
The Directors have no present intention to make any such market
purchases but consider it is desirable for them to be given this
opportunity by Shareholders. The authority will only be exercised if
to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and is in
the best interests of Shareholders generally.
As at 14 May 2008, there was a total of 2,236,536 options to
subscribe for equity shares in the Company outstanding,
representing 3.0% of the Company’s issued share capital. If the full
authority sought by this resolution is used, this number of
outstanding options would represent 2.8% of the Company’s issued
share capital.
The Board of the Company recommends that Ordinary
Shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting and is of the opinion that they are in
the best interests of security holders as a whole.
By order of the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in June
2006 contains only a limited number of modifications to the
Combined Code (2003). Following the Financial Services Authority’s
(FSA) adoption of the Combined Code (2006) and the release of
the FSA’s amended Listing Rules in October 2006, the Combined
Code (2006) (‘the Combined Code’) takes effect for reporting
periods commencing on or after 1 November 2006. The application
of the principles of the Code, in the composition and operation of
the Board, the remuneration of the Directors, relations with
Shareholders and procedures for financial reporting and internal
control are described below.
Statement of Compliance
The Directors consider that throughout the year ended 31 March
2008, the Company has complied with the principles set out in
Section 1 of the Combined Code with the exception of provision A2.1
as described below.
The Board of Directors
The Group is controlled by a Board of Directors which meets
regularly and currently comprises three Executive and three Non-
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are Nick Robinson
who is Deputy Chairman, John Sussens who is the Senior
Independent Director and Brian Sellwood. The latter two are
considered by the Board to be independent of management and
free from any business or other relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Nick
Robinson, previously the Chief Executive, is considered to be non-
independent. The Non-Executive Directors regularly meet
independently of management.
In November 2007 , Nick Robinson resigned as Chief Executive.
Peter Bertram assumed the role of Executive Chairman becoming
involved in the day to day running of the business in conjunction
with the senior management team. The Board accepted temporary
non-compliance with provision A2.1 of the Combined Code, to the
extent that the Chairman has acted in an executive capacity, as
being in the overall interests of the Group. Jeremy Stafford was
appointed Chief Executive on 31 March 2008. However , Peter
Bertram will remain Executive Chairman until 31 December 2008
when he will relinquish his executive responsibilities and revert to
his role as Non-Executive Chairman.
The Board intend to appoint another independent Non-Executive
Director to ensure appropriate balance. 
The Chairman’s other main commitments are disclosed on page 18.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring
its effectiveness and setting its agenda.
In advance of each meeting, the Directors are provided with or
have full and timely access to information in relation to the matters
to be discussed.
At Board meetings, the Directors receive presentations from the
senior executives on the implementation of the Company’s
strategies and the Board receives regular updates on changes to
the business, legislative and regulatory environments.
The Board is responsible to Shareholders for the proper
management of the Group and for its system of corporate
governance. It receives information on a monthly basis to enable it
to review trading performance, forecasts and strategy and it has a
schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision. The most
significant of these are: 
 Changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board;
 Consideration of the independence of Non-Executive Directors;
 Review of management structure and senior management
responsibilities;
 With the assistance of the Remuneration Committee, approval
of remuneration policies across the Group;
 Approval of strategic plans, profit plans and budgets and any
material changes to them;
 Oversight of the Group’s operations ensuring competent and
prudent management, sound planning, an adequate system of
internal control and adequate accounting and other records;
 Final approval of annual accounts and accounting policies; 
 Approval of the dividend policy;
 Approval of the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and major
investments and capital projects;
 Delegation of the Board’s powers and authorities, including the
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief
Executive and other Executive Directors; and
 Receiving reports on the views of the Company’s Shareholders.
Operational management of the Group is delegated to the Chief
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer .
The Board receives a regular flow of information to enable it to
discharge its duties, including a monthly report detailing current
and forecasted trading results and treasury positions. It also
receives regular updates on shareholders’ views as part of the
monthly report, and more formal briefings on shareholders’ views
are given to the Board following the presentation of the Company’s
interim and annual results. Board papers are generally distributed
not less than five days in advance of the relevant meeting to allow
the Directors fully to prepare for meetings, and minutes of
committee meetings are circulated. The Board is kept fully
informed of developments within the Company’s businesses
through regular presentations by divisional management. Induction
programmes for newly-appointed Directors are devised to ensure
that Directors spend time with divisional management and can visit
operational sites.

Procedures exist to allow the Directors to seek independent legal
advice in respect of their duties at the Company’s expense where
the circumstances are appropriate. All Directors have access to the
Company Secretary who is a qualified Solicitor .
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at
regular intervals and at least every three years.
During the year , the Board undertook an evaluation of its
performance and that of its committees. Detailed questionnaires
were used for the performance evaluation process. The Board
concluded that overall the Board and its committees operated
effectively. The performance of each of the Directors was evaluated
while the Senior Independent Director evaluated the performance
of the Chairman. The Board considered that the evaluation process
was satisfactory and that the use of an external third party to assist
in such evaluation was not necessary.
Committees of the Board
The following formally constituted Committees deal with specific
aspects of the Group’s affairs in accordance with their written
terms of reference, which have been reviewed in the light of the
Combined Code and are available on request and on the Group’s
website. The Company Secretary also acts as secretary to each
Committee.
The Audit Committee’s purpose is to assist the Board in the
discharge of its responsibilities for financial reporting and
corporate control and to provide a forum for reporting by the
external auditors. The Committee, chaired by Brian Sellwood who
the Board consider to have recent and relevant financial
experience, comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors
and meets at least three times a year .
A report on its activities is given on page 27 .
The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by John Sussens
and comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors, meets at
least twice a year and additionally as required. It is responsible for
reviewing remuneration arrangements for members of the Board,
and all senior reports of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial
Officer , for providing general guidance on aspects of remuneration
policy throughout the Group and for the Group’s Share Incentive
Plans. New Bridge Street Consultants have been appointed by the
Group to assist and advise the Remuneration Committee in the
performance of its duties. New Bridge Street Consultants do not
provide any other service to the Group and are independent of the
Group’s auditors.
A report on its activities is given on pages 28 to 30.

reference of new appointments and uses external advisers to
identify suitable candidates. The process is for the Committee to
interview each candidate with a view to preparing a shortlist for the
Board, for further interviews to take place as appropriate and for
the Chairman to consult with the Chief Executive and any external
advisors before any appointment is made.

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the
Group’s system of internal control. Internal control systems are
designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and the risks to
which it is exposed. By their nature, however , internal control
systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material mis-
statement or loss.
Key elements of the internal control system are described below.
These have all been in place throughout the year and up to the
date of this report and are considered and monitored regularly by
the Board (and once during the year):
 On going procedures to identify, evaluate and manage
significant risks faced by the business in accordance with the
guidance of the Turnbull Committee on Internal Controls and
procedures to monitor the control systems in place to reduce
these risks to an acceptable level;
 Clearly defined management structure and delegation of
authority to Committees of the Board and the Executive
Directors;
 Clearly documented internal procedures set out in the Group’s
ISO 9001 accredited quality manual;
 High recruitment standards and formal career development and
training to ensure the integrity and competence of staff;
 Regular and comprehensive information provided to
management, covering financial performance and key
performance indicators, including non-financial measures;
 A detailed budgeting process covering budgets for the coming
year which are approved by the Board;
 Procedures for the approval of capital expenditure, investments
and acquisitions;
 Monthly monitoring and reforecasting of results against budget,
with major variances followed up and management action taken
where appropriate;
 Regular internal audits of key processes and procedures under
the Group’s ISO 9001 accredited quality assurance process; and
 Formal consideration of progress made against significant
business risks at monthly Operating Board meetings, with
quarterly briefings to the Board.
The Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems
of internal control. During the year , the Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the systems of internal control and risk
management based on a review of significant risks identified and
the results of quality and other reports from management.
Following the review, the Board concluded that the systems were
satisfactory and in accordance with the Turnbull guidance. The
Board seeks to ensure that steps continue to be taken to try to
embed internal control and risk management further into the
operations of the Group’s business and to deal with any areas of
improvement which come to its attention. 
Whistleblowing: The Group’s Whistleblowing Policy allows
employees, in confidence, to raise concerns about possible
improprieties including, in financial reporting, other operational
matters or inappropriate personal behaviour in the workplace. 
The Internal Audit function is described in the Audit Committee
Report.
Auditor Independence
The Company has a formal policy designed to ensure that the
Auditor’s independence is not compromised by its undertaking
inappropriate non-audit work. All significant non-audit work
commissioned from the external Auditor requires the Audit
Committee’s formal approval. The external Auditor is only selected
to undertake non-audit work where the nature of the advice makes
it more timely and cost-effective to select advisers who already
have a good understanding of the Group.
The Audit Committee has undertaken a review of the nature and
amount of non-audit work undertaken by the external Auditor to
satisfy itself that there is no effect on its independence. The split
between audit and non-audit fees is shown in Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Going Concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a
period of not less than twelve months from the date of this report.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.

Communication with Shareholders
The Company values the views of Shareholders and recognises
their interests in the Group’s strategy and performance. It holds
briefings with institutional fund managers, analysts and other
investors, primarily following the announcement of interim and
preliminary results, as well as at other times during the year as may
be appropriate. The Company’s programme of investor relations
activities is designed to ensure that the investing community
receives a balanced and consistent view of the Group’s
performance. All Shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual
General Meeting, at which the Board of Directors will be available to
answer questions from Shareholders.
Provision D.1.1 of the Combined Code requires the Senior Non-
Executive Director to meet with major Shareholders. During the
year , this requirement has been undertaken by the Chairman, who
has met with a range of major Shareholders to discuss governance
and strategy. The Senior Non-Executive Director has been available
for all such meetings if requested. The views of major shareholders
are communicated to the Board as a whole by the Chairman. In
addition, the Board receives reports from the Company’s broker
twice a year that communicate feedback from major Shareholders.
The Board also reviews analyst coverage of the Company every
month.

INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by John Sussens and
comprises all the independent Non-Executive Directors. Peter
Bertram resigned from the Committee on his appointment as
Executive Chairman in November 2007 . 
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors and their senior direct reports and makes
recommendations thereon to the Board within agreed terms of
reference.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed executive
remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants, and has
consulted New Bridge Street in relation to assessing comparability
to the IT services marketplace and in particular the remuneration
policies of the Group’s peer companies. 
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Group on Directors’ remuneration is to provide
competitive market-based packages which reward Group and
individual performance and align the interests of Directors and
Shareholders. Remuneration packages comprise a basic salary,
annual performance related bonus, pensions and other benefits
and, where appropriate, participation in the share incentive plans
set out below. Salaries and bonuses are reviewed annually and any
other changes effected from 1 April. 
It is Company policy that Executive Director service contract notice
periods should not normally exceed 12 months. Any compensation
payment made as a result of an Executive Director leaving the
Company’s employment is subject to Remuneration Committee
approval, taking account of the terms of their contract and the
reasons for termination. Other than as contractually necessary,
severance payments are usually limited to payment of unworked
contractual notice, comprised of base salary and a cash equivalent
value for fixed benefits (including pension contributions). In
circumstances where a breach of the Company’s policies results in
dismissal, either a reduced payment or no payment may be made.
Depending on the situation, an Executive Director may have an
entitlement, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its
discretion to allow, an exercise of outstanding share option 
awards or long-term incentive grants subject to the rules of the
relevant plan. 
The Group introduced a number of share incentive schemes on
flotation, of which all members of staff, including the Executive
Directors, are potential beneficiaries. These include an Employee
Share Option Scheme, a Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior
managers and an All-Employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Since
flotation, no further awards have been granted under the Group’s
pre-flotation share schemes.
The Board determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the
other Non-Executive Directors. Directors are not involved in
decisions about their own remuneration.
Individual components of remuneration packages and service
contracts are discussed below.
Basic Salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is based on externally
benchmarked market data for comparable companies operating in
IT services, experience and achievement of objectives. In addition
to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits
such as a company car (or equivalent allowance) and private
medical insurance.
The salaries of the Executive Directors who served during the year
are given on page 30. David Simpson and Jeremy Stafford have
service agreements subject to a 12 month notice period and include
the right for the Company to make a payment in lieu of salary and
benefits for any unexpired period of notice. Peter Bertram and 
Nick Robinson have a 6 month notice period in their contracts and
John Sussens and Brian Sellwood have 3 month notice periods.
Performance related bonuses
For Executive Directors, amounts available for bonuses are agreed
by the Remuneration Committee.
Jeremy Stafford had a guaranteed bonus for the year ended
31 March 2008 of £250,000 (first year only). 
David Simpson had a bonus for the year ended 31 March 2008
of £94,000. 
The maximum potential bonus levels for the year ending 31 March
2009 are capped at 100% of basic salary for Jeremy Stafford and
75% for David Simpson. Peter Bertram does not qualify for a bonus
for the year ending 31 March 2009 due to the temporary nature of
his role as an Executive Director .
Pension Arrangements
The Executive Directors are also entitled to receive personal
pension contributions of 20% of basic salary for David Simpson
and Jeremy Stafford.
Share Incentives
The Group’s policy is to award share incentives to Executive
Directors in order to align their interests with those of the
Company’s Shareholders. The Executive Directors have participated
in the Performance Share Plan during the financial year . The
performance conditions were selected after consulting
independent share incentive advisers.

Performance Share Plan
During the year , the Company granted awards over 860,607 shares
under the PSP. Jeremy Stafford was granted awards over 121,080
shares and David Simpson was granted 55,351.
The awards will vest fully if the Group’s average annual earnings
per share growth over the three years from grant (measured by
reference to EPS in the year immediately prior to grant) exceeds
20% per annum. If the average annual growth is 5% per annum,
the award will vest as to 20% of the maximum. If average annual
earnings per share grow between 5% and 20%, then the award will
vest on a progressive scale. The award will not vest at all if average
earnings per share growth is less than 5% per annum.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Under the Share Incentive Plan, employees are able to buy shares
by deduction of up to £1,500 from their pre-tax salary in each tax
year or , if less, 10% of salary.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
We have audited the Group financial statements of Phoenix IT
Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the
consolidated statement of income, the consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet,
the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 40.
These Group financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described
as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual Company financial
statements of Phoenix IT Group plc for the year ended 31 March
2008. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors' Remuneration Report and the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and
whether the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described
as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent
with the Group financial statements.
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited Group financial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation
of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error .
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the group financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group's affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit
for the year then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the Group financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in Note 3 to the Group financial statements, the Group,
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with the
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion, the Group financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 31 March 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended.

1. General information
Phoenix IT Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered
office is given on the inside back cover . The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and in the
Chief Executive’s review and Financial review on pages 11 to 17 .
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
2. Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year , the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 , and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The impact of the
adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the
Group’s financial instruments and management of capital (see note 19).
The following interpretations, issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), are effective for the
first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or
financial position:
 IFRIC 8 — Scope of IFRS 2 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006)
 IFRIC 9 — Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006)
 IFRIC 10 — Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006)
 IFRIC 11 — IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007)
In addition, the Group has elected to adopt IAS 23 (Revised) Borrowing costs in advance of its effective date for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The principal change to the Standard, which was to eliminate the previously available option to
expense all borrowing costs as incurred, has meant that the Group has capitalised £102,000 of borrowing costs in accordance with
the policies set out in note 3 that would have previously been expensed through the income statement during the year .
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
 IFRS 8 — Operating Segments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
 Amendment to IFRS 2 — Share-based Payments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
 Amendment to IFRS 3 — Business Combinations (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009)
 Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
 Amendment to IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2009)
 Amendment to IAS 28 — Investments in Associates (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009)
 Amendment to IAS 31 — Interests in Joint Ventures (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009)
 Amendment to IAS 32 — Financial Instruments: Presentation (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009)
 IFRIC 12 — Service Concession Agreements (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008)
 IFRIC 13 — Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008)
 IFRIC 14 — IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008)
The Amendment to IFRS 3 will have the effect of expensing all future acquisition costs to the income statement rather than
capitalising them. The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the remainder of these Standards and Interpretations in future
periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures required relating to
IFRS 8 and IAS 1.

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where stated below. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year . Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill) and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Cash-flows and operations that relate to a major component of the business or geographical region that has been sold or is classified
as held for sale are shown separately from continuing operations.
Assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. No
depreciation is charged on assets and businesses classified as held for sale.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in
its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed
sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually with cash generating units assessed by segment (see
note 15). Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit for the period and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as adopted by the European Union has been retained at the
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP in
the year ended 31 March 1999 and earlier periods has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or
loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Other revenues, apart from those falling under
maintenance contracts (shown below), are recorded as earned or as the services are performed after provision for estimated
customer credits.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s
net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Maintenance Contracts
For fixed-fee maintenance contracts the revenue arising is spread evenly over the term of the contract. Costs incurred under these
contracts are charged to the income statement as they arise.
Leasing
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or , if lower , at
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges
are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease
term and discounted where material.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on
retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences
arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s profit and loss reserve. Such translation differences will be
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs 
Defined contribution pension schemes
The principal subsidiary undertakings contribute to a number of Group personal pension plans in respect of certain employees. These
plans are defined contribution plans and the annual charge to the income statement is the contributions payable in the year .
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in
the balance sheet.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit funded pension scheme.
The costs of providing pensions under the defined benefit funded pension scheme are estimated on the basis of independent
actuarial advice, with full actuarial valuations carried out on a triennial basis, and updated at each balance sheet date.
The operating and finance costs of the scheme are recognised separately within the statement of income. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.

14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Short-term employee benefits
The cost of short-term accumulating balances is charged to the income statement over the period during which the entitlement is
earned, at an average pay rate plus social security costs. Differences between the entitlement earned and the entitlement actually
paid is shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provisions for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment 
Land and buildings, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and recognised impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold property Period of lease
Fixtures and equipment 2 to 5 years
Motor Vehicles 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , where
shorter , over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured initially at fair value and are amortised on a systematic basis over their estimated useful lives on the
following bases:
Value of trade name 15 years
Customer contracts and relationships 6 to 10 years

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment policy
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset
may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is immediately recognised as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an
impairment loss is immediately recognised as income.
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Service stocks, other than consumable stocks, are systematically amortised over four years so as to reduce their value to nil at the
end of the period. Consumable stocks are expensed as they are purchased.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical
experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which
they arise.

14771 14/07/2008 Proof 7
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Equity instruments are any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined by reference to
market rates for similar instruments.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This
effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until
the highly probable forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur , the net cumulative gain or loss
recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of income for the period.
Cash flow hedges 
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash
flows are recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income where
relevant. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or
liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in
equity are included in the initial measurement. For hedges that result in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, amounts
deferred in equity are recognised in the statement of income in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Provisions
Provisions relate to the obligation to reinstate certain properties to their former condition at the end of their leases. Provisions are
measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are items of income or expenditure that, in management’s judgement, should be disclosed separately on the
basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size. Such items are included within the income statement caption to which
they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the accounts to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of
the consolidated income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at
fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
Shares purchased through the employee benefit trust (EBT) are held at cost and are deducted from Shareholders equity. The right to
a dividend on these shares has been waived.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Information about such judgements and estimation is
contained in the accounting policies or the notes to the accounts, and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are:
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are items of income or expenditure that, in management’s judgement, should be disclosed separately on the
basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size, to an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and
significantly distort the comparability of financial performance between periods. Items of income or expense that are considered by
management for designation as non-recurring items include such items as significant restructuring, impairments of non-current
assets, integration of acquired businesses and gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets. Details of non-recurring items are
included in note 7 .
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in
its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed
sale within one year from the date of classification. In making this judgement, impairment losses of £471,000 have been reflected in
the income statement as non-recurring items. Details of the losses are disclosed in note 17 .
Valuation of intangible assets and useful life
The Group has made assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows to be determined from separable intangible assets
acquired as part of business combinations. This assessment involves assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate
discount rates and the useful life of such assets. These assumptions impact the income statement over the useful life of the intangible
asset. These assumptions are discussed further below. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are:
Retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which has been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 — Employee Benefits.
Application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in excess of
inflation, employer and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets. Phoenix IT Group determines the
assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice generally, but
the application of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the financial statements. Further
details can be found in note 10.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets have been impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which they have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of the carrying
amount of goodwill and intangible assets are shown in notes 15 and 16 respectively.
Share-based payments
In valuing the share-based payments realised in the Group’s accounts, the Company has used the Black–Scholes calculation model,
which makes various assumptions on factors outside the Group’s control, such as share price volatility and risk-free interest rates.
Details of the options and assumptions used in deriving the share-based payments are disclosed in note 39.
Dilapidation provisions
Dilapidation provisions have been derived on the basis of the most recent assessment of likely cost. Many of these obligations will not
arise for a number of years and the costs are difficult to predict accurately. In making these assessments, the Group has sought the
aid of independent experts where appropriate. The total provisions are disclosed in note 28.

6. Segmental reporting
Following the acquisition of ICM Computer Group plc, the Board has determined that the primary segmental reporting format is by
business line, based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. The Group’s operations are based entirely in the
UK and considered to be one geographical segment.
Principal activities are as follows:
Partner services business Provision of information technology services, networking support and infrastructure services
Business continuity Provision of business continuity and IT disaster recovery services
SME IT services Provision of information technology services and systems
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Corporate costs relate to central group costs, including finance, legal and employee costs that are not directly attributable to the
operating segments.  
Inter segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices.

10. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of
the Group.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Defined contribution scheme 1,655 1,011
Defined benefit scheme
This is the first year the Group has operated a defined benefit scheme for certain of its employees following the acquisition of ICM.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.25% and 1.67% of final salary, multiplied by
number of years of pensionable service, on attainment of a retirement age of 65. No other post retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme’s defined benefit obligation was carried out at 6 April 2006 and updated to
31 March 2008 by a qualified independent actuary for IAS 19 purposes. The projected unit method was used in all valuations and
assets were taken into account using market values.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
2008
%
Discount rate 6.40
Expected return on equities, bonds and cash 6.80
Expected rate of salary increases 4.25
Future pension increases 3.30
Inflation 3.60
Mortality tables used PxA92(YOB)MC
The current life expectancies (in years) underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for pension plan are:
2008
Male Female
Member currently age 65 21.9 24.7
Member currently age 40 23.2 26.0
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows:
2008
£’000
Current service cost 419
Interest cost 687
Expected return on scheme assets (638)
468
The current service cost for the period has been included in staff costs. Actuarial gains of £592,000 have been reported in the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement benefit
scheme is as follows:
2008
£’000
Present value of defined benefit obligations 13,182
Fair value of scheme assets (12,103)
Deficit in scheme and liability recognised in the balance sheet 1,079

10. Retirement benefit schemes continued
Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows:
2008
£’000
On acquisition of ICM during the period (note 35) 13,365
Current service cost 419
Interest cost 687
Benefits paid (87)
Members’ contributions 352
Actuarial gains on obligation (1,554)
At 31 March 2008 13,182
Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows:
2008
£’000
On acquisition of ICM during the period (note 35) 10,524
Expected return on scheme assets 638
Contributions by employer 1,638
Members’ contributions 352
Benefits paid (87)
Actuarial losses on scheme assets (962)
At 31 March 2008 12,103
The fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows:
2008
£’000
Equities 7,342
Bonds 4,732
Cash 29
12,103
The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by or other assets used
by the Group.
The expected rate of return on the equities was determined by reference to long term historic out performance of this asset class
over bonds, so a view was taken that it was appropriate to take a future return rate on equities of 7 .5% pa. The investment return
in relation to these assets is variable and as such they are considered riskier investments. This results in ‘the equity risk premium’
which is included in the yield on the equity investment and compensates investors for the additional risk of holding this type of
investment. There is significant uncertainty about the expected size of this risk premium and this risk is managed by holding assets
which are less risky in nature but have a corresponding lower return.
The expected rate of return on bonds was determined by taking a blend between the gross redemption yields on corporate and
governments bonds, which was the two types of bonds held within the scheme at 31 March 2008, resulting in a return rate on
bonds of 5.70%. The risk of default on these assets is small. 
The expected rate of return on cash was determined by reference to the level of bank base rate of 5.25% pa.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with how the plan assets are
invested.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of £368,000.

Fair value of scheme assets (12,103)
Deficit 1,079
Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities —
Percentage of scheme liabilities 0%

The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current financial year is £1,413,600 (which
includes payments to eliminate the pension deficit of £669,600), and the employers ordinary contribution rate has increased to 8.9%
of pensionable salaries. The Group has agreed with the trustees that it will aim to eliminate the deficit over the next three years by
means of contributions of £669,600 per annum paid monthly.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been
allocated as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Partner services business 21,745 21,7 45
Business continuity 82,804 36,075
SME IT services 70,099 26,270
174,648 84,090
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These have been calculated based on
projections that incorporate the Group’s best estimates of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and expected changes to
selling prices and operating costs, prepared from internal forecasts for the next three years extrapolated into the future using a
2.25% growth rate. Cash flow projections have been discounted to reflect the time value of money, using a pre-tax discount rate of
13% for SME IT services and 10% for partner services business and business continuity. The discount rate used reflects
management’s view on the differing risk profiles of the CGUs.

difference between their carrying value and fair value in the market. The impairment loss of £471,000 is recognised in cost of sales
on the consolidated statement of income.
Included in the above is land at cost of £5,767 ,000 (2007: £508,000) which is not depreciated.
The net book value of fixed assets includes £13,488,000 (2007: £5,470,000) in respect of assets held under finance leases and hire
purchase contracts.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the redevelopment of property amounting to
£1,960,000 (2007: £nil).
18. Derivative financial instruments

19. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk
and liquidity risk.
Funding and treasury risk management is carried out under a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the Board. The
Board is responsible for regular review and monitoring of treasury activity and for approval of specific transactions, the authority
of which may be delegated. The Group accounting function provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board of
Directors.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Capital risk management
The Group seeks to match long term assets with long term funding and short term assets with short term funding. 
Equity, retained profits and long term fixed interest debt are used primarily to finance intangible assets and fixed assets. Short
term borrowings are required primarily to finance current assets.
The Group capitalisation policy seeks to maintain a strong credit rating and an appropriate funding structure whilst safeguarding
Group ability to continue as a going concern.
Market risk
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but also conducts some business in foreign currencies, mainly
the US Dollar and Euro. As a result it is subject to foreign exchange currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will
affect the Group’s transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operation.
The Group manages these currency exposures by maintaining, where possible, a broadly equivalent revenue and expense stream
in the relevant currency. The Board periodically reviews the net risk and implements strategies as appropriate. Due to the relative
stability of the foreign currencies in which the Group deal, and the size of the foreign exchange transactions, the Group does not
hedge the foreign exchange risk as the potential exposure is considered not to be material to the Group’s results.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as
follows:
Assets Liabilities
2008 2007 2008 2007
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
US Dollar 339 167 76 62

Norwegian Kroner 135 108 — —
2,855 1,906 1,699 1,139
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest
rate swap contracts. These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Group’s reported financial performance.
All borrowings before interest rate swaps are at variable rates. The table below sets out the carrying amount of borrowings that
are exposed to interest rate risk after taking into account interest rate swaps:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Fixed interest rate borrowings (note 25) 80,000 —
Floating interest rate borrowings (note 25) 23,342 26,917

19. Financial risk management continued
On 28 September 2007 , the Group entered into an interest rate swap to hedge risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on
the variable rate £80m term loan (note 18) which matures on 30 September 2010. The interest rate swap settles on a quarterly
basis. The rate was fixed at 5.78% based on three months LIBOR. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and
floating interest rate on a net basis. The interest swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge in order to reduce the Group’s
cash flow exposure resulting from the variable interest rate on the term loan. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on
the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating
rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
The quantitative disclosures relating to derivative financial instruments can be found in note 18.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group monitors its credit exposures to its counterparties via their credit rating, where applicable, or through other publicly
available financial information and its own trading records.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties having similar
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities. Concentration of
credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. The credit risk
on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-rating
assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amounts of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity requirements by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. All borrowing is agreed and monitored by the Board of Directors. The
Group’s undrawn committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 25. The Group has a policy of pooling Group cash flows in order
to maximise the return on surplus cash and also utilise cash within the Group. Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposits.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative financial
instruments as at the balance sheet date. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows:

Sensitivity analysis
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.  The following
analysis, required by IFRS 7 , is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the
US dollar and Euro to sterling exchange rate on the Group’s financial instruments.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement
benefits obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of the overseas subsidiary.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of
the debt and the derivative portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the
basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 , respectively.  As a consequence, this sensitivity
analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that
would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK interest rates and in the US dollar and Euro to sterling
exchange rate, before the effects of tax.

As at 31 March 2008, trade receivables of £2.48m (2007: £2.75m) were past due but not impaired. The ageing of these trade
receivables from due date is as follows:

Total 2,481 2,7 45
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and
unrelated. Due to this, the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for bad and
doubtful debts.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value due to their short
maturities.

The funding of the acquisition of ICM Computer Group during the period necessitated a renegotiation of the Group’s borrowing
facilities.
The Group entered into the new facilities on 28 March 2007 which were drawn down on 12 June 2007 .
(i) a loan of £80m. Repayments commence in September 2008 and will continue until March 2012. The Company and certain
subsidiaries (as guarantor) have entered into a composite guarantee in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland on account of the
Company and certain subsidiaries (as principal). The loan carries an interest rate of 1.262% above LIBOR. The hedging terms
relating to the loan are discussed in note 19.
(ii) a loan of £3.342m. The loan is due for repayment in full in March 2009. The Company and certain subsidiaries (as guarantor)
have entered into a composite guarantee in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland on account of the Company and certain
subsidiaries (as principal). The loan carries an interest rate of 1.262% above LIBOR.

repayment amounted to £27 .0m with loan break costs incurred of £0.1m.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings to be equivalent to its book value. At 31 March 2008, the
Group had available £36.158m (2007: £20m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

average term is 5 years. Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no
arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
All lease and hire purchase obligations are denominated in sterling.
There is no material difference between the minimum lease payments and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £65,410,856 (2007: £31,836,630). No liability has been recognised
in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

35. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking
On 29 May 2007 the Group acquired control of ICM Computer Group plc (ICM). The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of
ICM for a cash consideration of £61,772,000 and the issue of 14,047 ,184 shares in Phoenix IT Group plc.  The fair value of the equity
instruments issued as consideration was the market value on the date of acquisition.  The costs of acquisition amounted to
£3,608,000.  ICM is the parent company of a group of companies involved in the provision of IT services and equipment.  This
transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.

Details of the provisional fair value adjustments to the book values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are as follows:
(a) Tangible fixed assets were revalued in order to reflect their fair value to the Group.
(b) Intangible assets arising on the acquisition relate to the valuation of the acquired customer relationships expected to endure
beyond the minimum contracted order terms and the brand name. The intangible asset valuation has been derived using the
estimated net present value of the net future after tax cash flows which are expected to arise from the customer relationships
and the brand name.
(c) Stock was adjusted to reflect the valuation on the date of acquisition.

35. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued
(d) Trade debtors were reduced by £54,000 to take account of post acquisition credit notes raised and invoices raised.
(e) Other debtors were adjusted to take into account balances arising as a result of the exercise of employee share options.
(f) Other creditors were adjusted to take account of additional liabilities on the date of acquisition.
(g) Provisions comprise dilapidation provisions of £2,160,000.
(h) Corporation tax was adjusted to take account of the charge for the eleven months to the date of acquisition.
(i) Deferred tax assets were revalued to take account of the deferred tax liability that arises from the other fair value adjustments
and freehold property.
(j) The goodwill recognised of £90.6m is attributable to the value of the established workforce and infrastructure; the future
growth potential, particularly in the business continuity and disaster recovery market; and the anticipated synergies arising
from the acquisition.
ICM contributed £68,175,000 revenue and £6,938,000 to the Group’s profit from operations before amortisation of acquired
intangibles and non-recurring items for the period between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2008.
If the acquisition of ICM had been on the first day of the financial period, the contribution to the Group revenues for the period
would have been £81,272,000 and the contribution to the Group’s profit from operations before amortisation of acquired
intangibles and non-recurring items attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £8,444,000.

behavioural considerations.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of
Phoenix IT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which

auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the parent company financial statements in accordance with

Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:

view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at

1. Accounting Policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with the
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. As permitted by the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its
own profit and loss account.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the
preceding year .
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. 
Group undertakings
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, less any direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct issue
costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit and loss using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements. The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting variable rate to fixed rate or vica versa. Interest
differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting new interest payable over the period of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked
to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time. 
2. Staff costs
The Directors were the only employees during the period and they received all of their remuneration, as disclosed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on page 30, from Phoenix IT Services Limited.
3. Profit of parent company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Parent Company is not presented as
part of these accounts. The Parent Company’s profit after tax for the financial year amounted to £1,002,000 (2007: £7 ,330,000).

Notes:
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a
member of the Company) to attend and, to vote instead of the member . Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a
member from attending and voting at the meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so.
2. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been
nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (‘nominated
persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds the shares on their
behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such a right, or
do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to
the exercise of voting rights.
3. In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or
office copy of such power or authority, must reach the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing,
BN99 6DA not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is a non-working day) before the time of the meeting or of any
adjournment of the meeting. 
4. As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, Shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated form
must be entered on the Company’s share register at 6.00 p.m. on 12 August 2008 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the
Annual General Meeting. Such Shareholders may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the
relevant register after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5. Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment of each of the Directors will be available for inspection at the registered
office of the Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) and at the place of the
Annual General Meeting from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
6. Biographical details of each Director who is being proposed for reappointment or re-election by Shareholders, including their
membership of Board committees, are set out on pages 18 to 19 and page 24 of the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts.
7 . The total number of Ordinary shares in issue as at 11 July 2008, the last practicable day before printing this document, was 75,140,634
Ordinary shares and the total level of voting rights was 75,140,634.
8. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a
corporate Shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in
accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that Shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those
corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate
representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate
Shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate Shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate
representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will
vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. 
Corporate Shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies
and corporate representatives — www.icsa.org.uk — for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of
representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. A letter in this form would be acceptable to the
Company and its Registrars.

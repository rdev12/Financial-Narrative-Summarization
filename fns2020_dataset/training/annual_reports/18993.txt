STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
This year we have seen outstanding 
performance in some areas of the business 
but performance below our expectations 
in others. The overall result is that 
underlying proﬁ ts before tax moved ahead 
6.1% to £661.2m. We have achieved a 
number of the strategic priorities we set 
out at the beginning of the year, becoming 
a more capable company with signiﬁ cantly 
stronger infrastructure, but we experienced 
some implementation issues along the way. 
We embedded new values aligned with our 
strategic goals. These values, which put 
integrity at their core, respect our heritage 
whilst helping us to become the modern, 
agile company we need to be. Above all, we 
remain focused on one thing: off ering our 
customers products of exceptional quality 
and value that they can trust, however they 
choose to shop with us.
PERFORMANCE
Our Food business had an outstanding year 
in a sector that continues to go through 
profound change. In the most competitive 
food market of recent years, we delivered 
like-for-like growth in every quarter and 
maintained our margin. We have a clear and 
distinct off ering and our growth plans look 
clear and achievable. 
Our General Merchandise (GM) business 
delivered signiﬁ cant margin gains – the 
ﬁ rst step in reaping the beneﬁ ts of the 
investment we have made – and our 
products were well received by our 
customers and the fashion press. Whilst 
our overall performance was aff ected by 
the implementation issues outlined below, 
it was pleasing to exit the year in the ﬁ nal 
quarter with all elements of our GM 
business showing growth. 
Performance in our International 
business was disappointing. Strong sales 
performance in key owned markets, for 
example India and Hong Kong, was more 
than off set by macroeconomic issues and 
performance in key franchise markets, 
particularly Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. 
We implemented two crucial pieces of 
infrastructure: our new M&S.com website 
and our automated distribution centre at 
Castle Donington, two of the largest 
projects of their kind in Europe. Whilst 
projects of this scale are likely to 
experience some initial performance issues, 
these were greater than we anticipated. Our 
skilled teams acted decisively to address 
the issues. The strategic rationale for both 
projects remains clear.
BOARD PRIORITIES
The Board’s three priorities have remained 
the same since I became Chairman in 201 1: 
we are focused on strategy and execution, 
people and succession, and values. Having 
completed the bulk of our major three-year 
investment programme to transform M&S 
into an international, multi-channel retailer, 
the Board’s focus again this year was on 
ensuring that our substantial investment 
delivers the required returns. We also 
devoted time to ensuring we have the right 
talent and skills required in our business, 
and to debating and articulating our values, 
discussed below.
BOARD CHANGES
There have been a number of changes to 
the Board this year. 
Jan du Plessis, our Senior Independent 
Director, stepped down in March 2015, 
having served on the Board since 2008. 
I would like to thank Jan for his 
commitment and contribution to M&S over 
the years. His insights and experience have 
been invaluable. Vindi Banga, who has 
served on our Board since 201 2, took on the 
position of Senior Independent Director; he 
also chairs the Remuneration Committee.
In April 2015, Richard Solomons joined the 
Board as a non-executive director. Richard 
is Chief Executive of InterContinental 
Hotels Group and brings strong 
commercial, consumer, branding and 
global experience to the M&S Board.
On the executive team I would like to 
extend a warm welcome to Helen Weir, 
our new Chief Finance Offi  cer. Helen has 
exceptional credentials in both retail and 
ﬁ nance having previously held the same 
position at John Lewis Partnership, Lloyds 
Banking Group and Kingﬁ sher.
This year we reviewed our senior 
remuneration framework to align it more 
clearly with our strategic objectives. 
Further details are laid out in our 
Remuneration Report on page 52.
OUR VALUES AND PLAN A

The culture at M&S is important to the

new core values built on the principles that 
have guided M&S since it was founded in 
1884. The values – Inspiration, Innovation, 
Integrity and In Touch – aim to equip us all 
to deliver our strategic plans. 
But while the words are new, we have not 
changed what matters to us. Acting with 
integrity is at the heart of the way we do 
business. So our customers can be sure 
that the GM margin gains we achieve will 
not come at the expense of the standards 
we expect in our factories; they can be 
safe in the knowledge that we will not 
compromise on the provenance of our 
food; and they can rely on us to be a force 
for good in the communities in which we 
operate. 
Our commitment to Plan A, the 
programme we launched eight years ago to 
become the world’s most sustainable major 
retailer, remains as deeply held today as it 
ever was. As people become increasingly 
aware of how their behaviour impacts the 
world around them, we believe businesses 
need to connect with the communities in 
which they operate. From healthy living 
to ethical sourcing, we are committed to 
leading the way and striving to off er our 
customers the most sustainable options 
possible. As M&S becomes more 
international, our ability to lead with others 
on a global scale grows, whether by using 
our scale to drive improvements in our own 
supply chain, or by lending our expertise to 
global industry initiatives.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Engaging with stakeholders and employees 
is particularly important during times of 
change. We communicate regularly with our 
shareholders to ensure they understand 
our progress and plans. Outside our results, 
this year, we held investor brieﬁ ngs on 
M&S.com and our International business, 
and Marc Bolland and his executive team 
had many meetings with investors. All 
information shared at these events 
is available to shareholders at 
marksandspencer.com/investors. We 
again held a governance event for our 
largest shareholders, which I led with our 
Senior Independent Director. 
We have recently implemented a new 
loyalty scheme for our private investors. 
The scheme allows over 190,000 of our 
UK-registered private investors to use 
money from their dividend payment to buy 
an M&S Shareholder Card at a discount. It 
operates much like a gift card. The initiative 
reﬂ ects the fact our private investors are 
also some of our most loyal customers and 
we value them greatly.
Our ‘Fit for the Future’ programme was one 
of our biggest ever engagement exercises, 
where employees discussed the shape of 
the new values. We also launched a scheme 
for the 3,500 section managers who 
between them manage 92% of our sales 
ﬂ oor colleagues. The programme inspired 
and motivated these managers, who are 
the beating heart of M&S.
LOOKING AHEAD AND DIVIDEND 
M&S is a more capable and better 
equipped business than it was a year ago. 
In the coming year we will continue to 
focus on growth in Food, improving 
GM performance, further improving 
margins and cash generation.
Our dividend policy remains a progressive 
one, with dividends broadly covered twice 
by earnings. We intend to pay a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 1 1.6p this year, taking the total 
dividend to 18.0p, up 5.9% on last year. In the 
context of our increased free cash ﬂ ow, we 
are also pleased to announce an ongoing 
programme of returns of capital to 
shareholders, starting this year, with a 
share buyback programme of £150m.
Finally, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their hard work and 
commitment at a time of signiﬁ cant 
change. M&S employees are dedicated and 
upbeat – I am always struck by their positive 
attitude and energy. Their pride in M&S and 
commitment to the business are what 
makes us special. I want to thank every 
one of them in stores and in our offi  ces 
for their contribution this year.

OUR RESOURCES & RELATIONSHIPS
We create long-term value through the 
eff ective use of our resources and relationships. 
We manage these in line with our core values of 
Inspiration, Innovation, Integrity and In T ouch. 
These values inﬂ uence how we behave and they 
run through everything we do – they make the 
M&S diff erence: enhancing lives every day 
through the products and services we off er 
our customers in the UK and internationally.
PRESERVING OUR 
TRUSTED BRAND
Our own brand model sits at the very heart 
of the M&S diff erence. Our unique products 
set us apart and our innovative culture 
means we are always improving them for the 
better. By providing high-quality products 
alongside an industry leading approach 
to provenance, ethics and environmental 
standards, we have built a brand that our 
customers trust – this is our competitive 
advantage. M&S occupies a very special 
place in Britain and we work hard to protect 
that position by always acting with the 
integrity our customers have come to 
know and expect.
STRATEGY & FINANCIAL 
PLANNING 
A well run business relies on robust 
ﬁ nancial management and planning. 
We are committed to creating value for 
shareholders by making M&S a more 
proﬁ table business through improved 
gross margin and strong cash generation, 
driven by rigorous control of costs and 
capex. In line with our strategy to build an 
infrastructure ﬁ t to support the future 
growth of the business, we continue to 
invest in our supply chain and technology. 
We fund future growth through existing 
cash ﬂ ows, a policy which supports our 
commitment to maintaining an investment 
grade rating. 
LISTEN & UNDERSTAND
Understanding our customers informs 
everything we do. Our Customer Insight 
Unit (CIU) listens and talks to around 60,000 
customers a month, analysing the results 
to build a comprehensive understanding 
of what our customers want and how this 
is changing. We also engage with over 
2.6  million customers every day via our 
social media channels, giving a constant 
ﬂ ow of information about how they are 
feeling about M&S and our products. By 
keeping closely in touch with our customers, 
we can ensure that we stay relevant and 
continue to off er the products and services 
they want to see at M&S.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
In 201 4/1 5 we made further progress 
against our strategy to become a leading 
international, multi-channel retailer – as we 
enhanced our M&S.com infrastructure. 
With our new infrastructure largely in 
place, we have been focused on execution. 
A number of key projects, for example 
improvements to our product allocation 
and replenishment systems, have been 
successfully implemented this year. We 
also built up our design capabilities and 
capitalised on our market leading food 
product development. Whilst we faced 
some diffi  culties during the bedding in 
period of the website and distribution 
centre, we have learned more about how to 
improve our online customer experience 
and how best to stabilise the complex 
operations at Castle Donington. Thanks to 
our strengthened in-house capabilities, 
these learnings have been eff ectively put 
into practice, enabling us to return M&S.com 
to growth in the ﬁ nal quarter of the year. 
In 201 4/1 5 we invested in our organisation 
and our people to get the very best from our 
new infrastructure and ensure we are truly ﬁ t 
for the future. We have brought in key skills 
and competencies that have historically 
been outsourced – helping us work more 
proﬁ tably and with greater pace. This has 
included strengthening our in-house 
clothing and home design capability and 
our software engineering team. 
We developed four new core values of 
Inspiration, Innovation, Integrity and 
In Touch. By putting these values at 
the heart of everything we do, we are 
encouraging employees to do things 
diff erently and take a fresh look at how we 
can inspire our customers – with exquisite 
quality and styling in our clothing, and 
innovative, ﬁ rst to market, exceptional 
quality food. This consistency will help 
customers recognise the values of our 
brand and what makes M&S diff erent. 
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
We made good progress in three of our 
four key strategic priorities for the year. 
In driving Food growth we delivered an 
excellent performance with sales up 
3.4% and growth ahead of the market. 
We signiﬁ cantly increased our GM gross 
margin by 190bps. GM sales, however, 
were challenging, particularly in the third 
quarter due to the impact of the disruption 
at Castle Donington and the unseasonal 
weather. Finally, we continued to control 
costs tightly and reduced capital expenditure. 
This, combined with a focus on working 
capital, has delivered free cash ﬂ ow pre 
dividends of £524.2m up 22.5%.
FOOD
The strategy we set out in 2010 to be more 
of a specialist in Food is working very well 
and diff erentiates us from the competition. 
We had an outstanding year in a diffi  cult 
market. Sales increased despite deﬂ ation 
across the sector and our proﬁ tability rose 
as we streamlined our processes. Our Food 
division has now seen 22 consecutive 
quarters of like-for-like sales growth. 
Customers continued to turn to M&S 
for both everyday quality and special 
moments. They love our constant 
innovation: over the year we launched 
1,700 new products. It is this newness and 
innovation that makes M&S food special. 
GENERAL MERCHANDISE 
Customers recognised the improvements 
in the style and quality of our clothing. Our 
collections over the year were a stylish, 
wearable interpretation of the key trends, 
meeting with approval from the fashion press 
and customers alike. By the fourth quarter, 
all GM departments were seeing growth. 
The rise in gross margin came about through 
better buying and sourcing. We also focused 
on full price sales and saw customers trade 
up to our better and best ranges. 
CHANNELS
Despite a diffi  cult start to the year, the 
performance of M&S.com steadily 
improved as we listened to customers’ 
feedback and worked hard to improve 
the online shopping experience. The site 
made gains on three key metrics as the 
year progressed: traffi  c, conversion and 
customer satisfaction levels. We now off er

online experience. M&S.com is a superior 
shop window for our products and our 
customers appreciate its strong editorial 
point of view: 8.2m people visited its Style 
& Living editorial section over the year. 
Together, this has resulted in a steady 
improvement in sales and we ﬁ nished the 
year with growth of 1 3.8% in Q4. Over 7m 
people have registered to use the site, 
surpassing registrations on our old site. 
We continue to improve our stores to 
make them more inspiring places to shop. 
We invested in the quality of the store 
environment, with refreshed Womenswear 
departments and new look Menswear 
departments. We also improved 
Shop Your Way with extended delivery 
cut-off  times, off ering a more convenient 
and joined-up customer experience. 
INTERNATIONAL
Our International business faced multiple 
macroeconomic challenges this year. 
These issues aff ected franchise partners, 
particularly in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey – 
our Middle East region – and resulted in 
reduced wholesale shipments, which led to 
lower proﬁ ts. However, we were pleased by 
our performance in other priority markets, 
particularly India, and by the good growth 
in our Food business in Europe and 
Hong Kong.
BRAND
The new core values are aligned with our 
business and will drive the behaviours 
needed to achieve our customer promise 
of ‘enhancing lives, every day’. Our brand 
was enhanced by imaginative marketing. 
We launched Only M&S, a uniﬁ ed campaign 
for Food and clothing – we are one 
brand with many stories to tell. In Food, 
‘Adventures in…’ celebrated the creativity, 
craftsmanship and passion behind our 
food and was very well received by our 
customers. The clothing campaign marked 
a step change in approach and with 
renewed conﬁ dence we showcased our 
edit of the latest trend. ‘The Two Fairies’ 
Christmas campaign combined bold ideas 
with imaginative use of social media to 
position M&S as a relevant, lively brand.
PEOPLE 
For M&S to thrive in the future, we have 
to be a modern, forward-looking and agile 
company today. Over the year, we continued 
to roll out the necessary systems and 
processes to ensure that – from top to 
bottom – we are in the right shape to meet 
future challenges. Our Fit for the Future 
programme saw us reﬁ ne the way we do 
things. We streamlined our processes, 
clariﬁ ed lines of command and introduced 
initiatives to encourage entrepreneurialism. 
We also realigned our executive team’s 
responsibilities. The changes ensure greater 
accountability and our new simpliﬁ ed team 
structures allow us to move with more 
speed and agility.
PLAN A 
A
Over the last 1 3 1 years, M&S has built a 
unique position and a signiﬁ cant part of 
that is down to customer trust. Maintaining 
this position of integrity is central to the 
Company’s future. Our customers trust us 
to always do the right thing, which is why 
Plan A 2020 is absolutely crucial. Plan A 
has taught us that we can achieve more 
when we collaborate inside and outside of 
the business. We celebrated a decade of 
Marks & Start, our scheme which provides 
training and work experience within M&S 
and our supply chain for the long-term 
unemployed. Make Your Mark, our 
programme that focuses on supporting 
young people facing barriers to 
employment, is part of Movement to Work, 
a larger programme we helped to found 
in 201 3. Almost 200 of the UK’s biggest 
companies are now signed up. Engaging 
with our communities underpins Plan A 
and this year our employees and customers 
raised a total of £7 .5m for our local and 
national charity partners. We have a clear 
plan to further engage our customers and 
communities in Plan A. In 2010, we set out 
our goal to be the world’s most sustainable 
retailer and this continues to drive our 
ambition to improve things for the better. 
MARC BOLLAND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
As we continue the work to transform 
our infrastructure, we will now focus on 
consolidating our position as a leading 
international, multi-channel retailer.
Using our strengthened capabilities, our 
priorities, both in the UK and International, 
will be to accelerate our Food growth, deliver 
an end-to-end GM operating model and to 
drive the experience on M&S.com. We will 
continue to develop a world class talent 
pool, further growing our skills in key 
strategic areas.
The UK food market will remain 
challenging but we are well positioned 
with a store format that caters for how 
shopping habits are changing. We opened 
62 Simply Food stores this year, and we 
have a strong pipeline with the fastest 
Food store opening programme planned 
in M&S’s history . 
Whilst we expect the Clothing and Home 
market to remain highly competitive, we will 
deliver growth through a focus on stylish 
design, quality and newness, with better 
availability and more choice. 
We anticipate that our International 
business will continue to be impacted 
by this year’s weakening euro and 
macroeconomic factors will remain a 
challenge, particularly in our Middle 
East region. However, we will focus on 
delivering relevant ranges to our local 
customers, improving our like-for-like 
sales performance across our owned 
and franchised market and building 
our international supply chain.

GROWTH
We have improved levels of 
availability and choice. 11 2 stores 
now carry our full range of 6,300 Food 
products, increasing convenience for 
our customers. By off ering our full 
range in a larger number of stores we are 
helping people cater for their busy lives; 
over 40% of our customers buy food for 
today or  tonight.
Our Simply Food format continues 
to grow strongly. We opened 62 new 
stores in the UK this year, taking our 
total to 504. Our franchise partners 
play a key role in this growth. In March 
we opened our 200th Simply Food 
store through our partnership with BP .
In a crowded marketplace, our position as a food 
specialist sets us apart from our rivals. Customers love 
our innovation: it’s a strategy that makes us truly diff erent. 
Last autumn, our Belgian Chocolate Jaff a Sphere became 
our fastest-selling dessert ever: we sold 1 70,000 in just six 
weeks. Such was the demand that our supplier went into 
24-hour production.

OUR PLAN IN ACTION: 
GM GROSS MARGIN
IMPROVEMENT
A better buying process has helped 
increase our margins, for example 
through the way that we procure our 
fabric. We used to source our linen 
from 28 fabric mills. Now, we use eight. 
Consolidating the number of mills has 
allowed us to create effi  ciencies, save 
time and be smarter in how we buy.
Better availability is key to boosting 
our margins, but some of the behind-
the-scenes systems and processes 
which regulate this are over 25 years old. 
Our GM4 Programme is changing this – 
we are overhauling everything from our 
merchandise planning systems to our 
allocation and replenishment systems. 
GM4 will make us more effi  cient and 
more proﬁ table.
As part of our strategy to improve our margins, we 
are bringing much of our design in-house. 35% of our 
clothing is now created, designed and sourced by our own 
teams, up from 20% at the end of last year, and our target 
is 60% by 201 6/1 7 . Our Direct Design strategy has led to 
greater collaboration between our buying teams, our 
design teams and our regional Sourcing Offi  ces.

(WOMENSWEAR)
Customers love newness, so we’ve 
made sure that we send more to more 
stores, with new lines landing in store 
every 2- 3 weeks. Our Limited Edition 
range is now in all stores and our Rosie for 
Autograph lingerie and sleepwear is in 
the majority of stores, giving more choice 
to more of our customers, no matter 
where they live. 
Over 70% of our female customers deem 
the ﬁ t of a garment to be the number 
one determining factor of quality. Our 
Fit Development team, which is unique to 
M&S, undertook a major project to ensure a 
consistent, good ﬁ t across all our brands. It 
has resulted in a 20% reduction in customer 
complaints about ﬁ t. We want our customers 
to feel conﬁ dent about ﬁ nding stylish 
clothes that ﬁ t and ﬂ atter , whatever they buy .
When we see a trend coming, we work quickly to 
interpret it for our customers. As the UK market 
leader in Womenswear denim, we knew that the recent 
denim catwalk trend would resonate with our shoppers. 
With strong editorial backing on M&S.com, a feature in 
Vogue, bold in-store visual merchandising and joined-
up marketing, our range was a hit. We sold 4.3m pairs of 
women’s jeans, up 7% on the year.

OUR PLAN IN ACTION: 
STRONG CASH 
GENERATION
We have become a more agile and 
ﬂ exible organisation, resulting in 
improved working capital. Tactical 
supply chain initiatives such as our 
move to ‘push allocation’ – whereby 
stock is replenished automatically 
based on customer demand – have 
resulted in better, more effi  cient 
stocking, saving us time and money.
Capital expenditure this year fell 
to £527m, from £710m, following a 
period of major investment to bring 
our infrastructure up to date. We are 
now in a good position to maintain 
our existing assets while also having 
the headroom to invest in new ones 
as we fulﬁ l our ambition to be an 
international, multi-channel retailer.
Prudent cost management has led to strong cash 
generation across the business. We run our stores more 
effi  ciently than in the past. This year we launched a new 
Resource Planning System to increase the eff ectiveness 
of our colleagues’ work patterns. We also saw the beneﬁ ts 
of a new payroll system which centralised administration. 
Our free cash ﬂ ow before dividends was £524.2m this year, 
compared to £427 .9m last year .

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
In 2014/15, we made progress in the delivery 
of our strategy, with sales of £10.3bn level 
on last year, and underlying proﬁ t of 
£661.2m, up 6.1%. Underlying earnings 
per share were 33.1p, up 2.8% on last year.
Strong ﬁ nancial management is at the 
heart of our strategic priorities. Focusing 
on margin and cash generation, we have 
ﬁ nished the year in a stronger ﬁ nancial 
position and delivered improved returns 
for shareholders, with a total dividend of 
18.0p and signiﬁ cant share price growth 
over the period. 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
S
UK Food revenue was up 3.4% and we 
outperformed the market by 3.5%. Food 
gross margin was up 30bps at 32.8% as we 
eliminated ineffi  ciencies by streamlining 
our processes. 
UK GM revenue was down 2.5% year-on-
year. However, this decline was off set by the 
stronger gross margin. We delivered gross 
margin improvement of 190bps at 52.6%. 
180bps of the increase was a result of 
improvement in the buying margin driven 
by the shift to direct design and sourcing 
which allow us to buy more eff ectively. 
Whilst M&S.com delivered sales of £636.5m, 
down 2% on last year, we saw a steady 
improvement in performance, exiting the 
year with growth of 1 3.8% in Q4. 
UK operating costs were up 1.5% against 
last year, to £3.2bn. However, 2.4% of this 
growth was accounted for by depreciation 
and asset impairments, meaning that the 
remaining costs were down, demonstrating 
our tight control of costs and the beneﬁ t of 
initiatives such as better resource allocation 
in stores and new contractual terms with 
our main Food logistics supplier.
Whilst some key owned international 
markets continued to perform well 
despite challenging trading conditions, 
macroeconomic issues signiﬁ cantly 
impacted International second half proﬁ t, 
particularly in our franchise business. 
Wholesale shipments to our franchise 
partners in our Middle East region slowed 
as a result of some destocking. A review 
of our International store estate, coupled 
with the adverse euro exchange rates and 
tough consumer environment, resulted in 
writedowns of £37 .2m relating to certain 
underperforming stores in Western Europe, 
Ireland and China.
M&S Bank performed well with underlying 
proﬁ t contribution of £60.2m, up 5.3%, and 
there was good take up of the fee-free 
current account launched in May 2014. 
STRONG CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
Improved performance and eff ective 
balance sheet management have resulted 
in strong cash generation. As a result, our 
net debt position has reduced by £240.4m 
to £2.2bn. Fixed charge cover was 3.6 times, 
broadly level with last year. 
We performed well against the criteria we 
set out for capital allocation at the start of 
the year:
> Strong free cash ﬂ ow pre dividends of 
£524.2m, up 22.5% on last year;
> Reduced capital expenditure of £526.6m 
down by £183.0m;
> Full year dividend at 18.0p, up 5.9% on last 
year, in line with our progressive policy; 
> BBB minus rating, in line with our 
commitment to maintaining an 
investment grade rating;
> Net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.7x, 
comfortably within our ratio range 
of 2.0x –1.5x.
After a period of signiﬁ cant investment, our 
ROCE has now stabilised. By ensuring we 
achieve the appropriate balance between 
investment for growth and investment to 
maintain the business, we expect our 
returns to improve going forward.
DELIVERING RETURNS TO 
SHAREHOLDERS
Following the recent programme of 
investment, we now have a stronger, more 
capable business. While there is still more 
to do, the reduction in capital investment 
and the improving business performance 
will lead to strong cash generation.
The Board is now setting out a clear capital 
allocation policy: 
> Commitment to a strong balance sheet, 
including maintaining an investment 
grade credit rating;
> Continuing to invest in the business 
for growth, underpinned by strong 
investment disciplines;
> Progressive dividend policy, broadly 
twice covered by earnings; and 
> Returning any surplus cash generated 
to shareholders on a regular basis. 
Consistent with this approach, we have 
announced an ongoing programme of 
returns of capital to shareholders. In 
2015/16, we expect to return £150m of 
cash to shareholders in the form of a share 
buyback programme. This is the ﬁ rst of 
what is expected to be an ongoing 
programme of returns, with the quantum 
and method determined by the Board 
each year based on the performance and 
needs of the business.
Strong ﬁ nancial disciplines are 
at the heart of how we run the business.

INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
Investment to make our supply chain ﬁ t 
for the future continued with a focus on our 
GM IT systems and logistics network. Upon 
completion, these two interdependent 
projects will deliver greater supply chain 
ﬂ exibility and better availability for our 
customers. In IT, we completed the 
Allocation & Replenishment element of 
our GM4 programme, implementing a new 
stock distribution system that allocates 
stock to stores based on demand, ensuring 
our customers can get the products they 
want in the location in which they want 
them. In logistics, we continue to reshape 
our GM warehouse network, and the 
next milestone will be the launch of our 
redeveloped Bradford National Distribution 
Centre in 2016. 
MANAGING OUR PROPERTY PORTFOLIO
We added 1.5% of UK selling space, driven 
by our Simply Food growth programme. We 
opened 67 new stores this year, including 
62 Simply Food stores. We closed 1 3 stores, 
of which ﬁ ve were relocations, as we 
continue to reshape our portfolio to ensure 
that our stores are in the most convenient 
locations. We expect Food space to 
increase by 4.5% in 2015/16, again driven 
by growth in Simply Food store numbers. 
Our strategy is for GM space to remain ﬂ at, 
although we will continue to manage our 
estate to improve the quality of stores for 
our customers. 
SUSTAINABLE REPORTING  
A
Our commitment to Plan A drives us to run 
our business effi  ciently. An eff ective, 
sustainable business plan ultimately 
delivers value for shareholders. Investors 
recognise the long-term value of sourcing 
responsibly, cutting waste and using 
resources effi  ciently.
As members of the International Integrated 
Reporting Council and the Prince’s 
Accounting for Sustainability project (A4S), 
we are committed to reporting the long-
term value created by sustainable business. 
We have participated in projects supporting 
natural capital accounting, and we are 
taking part in the development of natural 
capital protocols led by the Natural Capital 
coalition, with the results due in 2016. 
We are committed to managing and 
reporting our global tax aff airs in keeping 
with our longstanding values and paying 
our fair share of tax. There is further detail 
on our tax contribution on page 18.

UK operating costs were up £47 .8m (1.5%), with higher depreciation 
and asset impairments contributing £76.0m (2.4%) of the 
total increase. 
Retail staffi  ng costs were down in part as a result of lower 
volumes, but also helped by better resource allocation following 
the implementation of a new labour planning system. Our store 
customer satisfaction scores were up on the year.
The increase in occupancy costs mainly reflects increased depreciation 
and asset impairments arising from investment made in our UK store 
environment as well as the addition of new space in Food.
Distribution costs were down, reﬂ ecting new contractual terms with 
a key Food logistics supplier, the beneﬁ ts of the ﬁ rst stage of our 
single tier network and lower volumes in GM.
Marketing and related costs increased due to the re-launch of the 
M&S brand, including new TV advertising campaigns across both 
Food and GM. 
Support costs were up largely due to higher depreciation on the 
new M&S.com web platform and additional staff  incentive costs this 
year, partially off set by the release of employee beneﬁ t provisions.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Net underlying interest payable was down 15.9% to £94.8m due to a 
decrease in the average cost of funding to 5.0% (last year 5.4%) and 
a £240.4m reduction in net debt. This has resulted in a decrease in 
net ﬁ nance costs of £1 2.8m.
Non-underlying adjustments to proﬁ t were £61.2m net charge (last 
year £42.5m net charge). The main element of these charges is a 
provision for impairment in underperforming stores in Western 
Europe, Ireland and China. 
 Full details of non-underlying items are disclosed in note 5 on p100.
TAXATION
The full year underlying eff ective tax rate was 18.9% (last year 18.8%) 
and statutory eff ective tax rate was 19.7% (last year 1 2.8%).
TOTAL TAX CONTRIBUTION
In 2015 our total cash tax contribution to the UK Exchequer was 
£767m (2014: £803m

); split between taxes ultimately borne by the 
Company of £388m (2014: £372m) (i.e. corporation tax, customs 
duties, employer’s NIC, business rates and sundry taxes) and 
taxes attributable to the Company’s economic activity which are 
collected on behalf of the government of £379m (2014: £43 1m
1
) 
(i.e. PAYE, employees’ NIC, value added tax, excise duties and 
sundry taxes).

UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX

in the UK business and lower interest costs.

GROUP REVENUE
Group revenues were level (up 0.4% on a constant currency basis). 
UK revenues were up 0.7% in total with a like-for-like decrease of 
1.0%. International revenues were down 5.7% (down 2.1% on a 
constant currency basis). 
GROSS MARGIN
UK gross margin was up 75bps at 41.4% as a result of strong 
improvement in GM margin.
UK GM gross margin was up 190bps at 52.6% driven mainly by an 
improvement in buying margin as a result of sourcing initiatives. 
Despite a highly promotional marketplace, we remained focused 
on full price sales and we reduced the number of price promotions. 
However, clearance markdown was higher due to additional stock 
into sale as a result of unseasonal Autumn/Winter conditions.
Food gross margin was up 30bps at 32.8% due to ongoing 
operational effi  ciencies. The beneﬁ ts realised through streamlining 
our operations have been reinvested in price and quality, and also 
shared with our suppliers to help them create further effi  ciencies. GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS

Group capital expenditure was down £183.4m versus last year, 
as many of our large infrastructure projects have now been 
completed.
The largest proportion of spend continued to be on supply chain 
and technology as we developed our single tier distribution 
network and continued to roll out our GM4 commercial systems.
We also continued to invest in our UK store estate to create a more 
inspiring environment, including the launch of our new look and 
feel Menswear departments. 
The proceeds from property disposals mainly relate to the 
deferred consideration from the sale of the White City warehouse, 
which is being received over three years.
The business delivered strong free cash ﬂ ow pre dividends of 
£524.2m which, after the payment of dividends, led to a reduction in 
net debt of £240.4m. The improved free cash ﬂ ow reﬂ ects stronger 
business performance resulting in £1,3 1 2.6m of underlying EBITDA, 
an increase of £92.9m (7 .6%) on last year. In addition, there was a 
£1 79.5m reduction in working capital, due to lower inventory levels 
and also higher creditor levels, in part due to the earlier timing of 
Easter this year. In addition, it includes an ex-gratia payment of 
£40.0m (last year nil) from HSBC following agreement reached over 
a number of issues in connection with the Relationship Agreement. 
These movements are partially off set by capital expenditure cash 
payments of £664.4m. These are higher than our actual capital 
expenditure as a result of high prior year end capex accruals which 
were paid in the ﬁ rst half of this year. Pension funding includes 
£56.0m of additional deﬁ cit reduction funding contributions paid 
into the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme during the year.
SUPPLIER INCOME
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has asked retailers “to 
provide investors with suffi  cient information on their accounting 
policies, judgements and estimates arising from their complex 
supplier arrangements”. Due to our focus on own brand products, 
supplier income is a relatively small proportion of our value of 
stock expensed. As at the year end, accrued income in relation 
to supplier income was £1 3.5m (last year £9.3m). 
 Further details are disclosed in note 1, on p94, note 17, on p112 and in 
the Audit Committee Report on p49.
PENSION
At 28 March 2015 the IAS 19 net retirement beneﬁ t surplus was 
£449.0m (last year £189.0m). The increase is due to movement in 
the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t surplus, speciﬁ cally an increase in the 
market value of scheme assets attributable to higher than 
expected returns. This is partly off set by an increase in the present 
value of scheme liabilities due to a decrease in the discount rate 
from 4.45% to 3.10% from the movement in corporate bond yields. 
The Strategic Report, including the market context on pages 20-21 
and risk management on pages 23 to 25, was approved by a duly 
authorised Committee of the Board of the Directors on 19 May 
2015, and signed on its behalf by

UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE
Underlying basic earnings per share increased by 2.8% to 33.1p 
per share. The weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the period was 1,635.6m (last year 1,615.0m). 
DIVIDEND
We are pleased by the improvement in cash generation over the 
year. Following the increase in the interim dividend, the Board has 
proposed a 7 .4% increase in the ﬁ nal dividend to 1 1.6p. This will 
result in a total dividend of 18.0p, up 5.9% on last year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
The UK economy continues to improve. 
Unemployment is falling and house 
prices are rising. Last summer, consumer 
conﬁ dence moved into positive territory for 
the ﬁ rst time since March 2005. As a result of 
the more optimistic outlook, there has been 
a gradual opening up of purses and wallets. 
Rather than increasing their everyday 
spending, people are looking to spend 
on the big purchases they put off  in the 
downturn. This spending, however, is 
accompanied by a healthy dose of caution. 
Consumers still feel bruised by the credit 
crisis; they are looking to save, and spending 
remains careful and considered.
Feelings of stability among UK consumers 
have also been dented by a year of upheaval 
abroad. From the Middle East to Russia and 
Ukraine, the last 1 2 months have been 
tumultuous. This has tempered people’s 
positivity. Domestically, the Scottish 
independence referendum and the recent 
general election had similar eff ects. People 
like certainty, and there is always uncertainty 
around the outcome of such events.
UK
We saw more conﬁ dence among our 
customers this year. They told us that they 
are feeling secure, stable and cautiously 
optimistic. 
Although clothing sales were down year-on-
year, customers were investing more in our 
‘better’ and ‘best’ products. People told us 
they were excited to shop with us. They 
particularly loved the colours and vibrancy 
of our Spring/Summer 201 5 collections. This 
renewed conﬁ dence was reﬂ ected in fewer 
promotions than last year. The shift towards 
convenience store shopping within the food 
market means there is intense competition 
for a limited number of sites. In order to 
help us address this challenge we have put 
in place a Simply Food surveying team to 
identify and secure the best located sites 
and we also beneﬁ t from our longstanding 
franchise partnerships with the likes of BP 
and SSP . Customers in our smaller stores 
told us they wanted greater choice when 
they shopped. We responded by increasing 
the ranges available in those stores. When 
it came to our in-store environment, 
customers told us that our stores are now 
more exciting and enjoyable places to shop. 
But we also beneﬁ ted from the continuing 
undercurrent of caution among shoppers. 
With consumers’ focus on clever spending, 
they want to buy once and buy well, and 
turn to brands they can trust and whose 
quality can be relied on, like M&S.
Consumers’ emphasis on celebrating life 
and indulging their loved ones played to 
our Food division’s strengths. Our mission 
in Food is to excite customers with the 
newness, quality and diff erence of our 
products, and we continued to distinguish 
ourselves with unrivalled innovation. Britain 
is fast becoming a nation of foodies and, 
in an intensely price focused market, we 
focused on off ering high-quality, good 
value food to our customers. As a result, 
we outperformed the market once again. 
There is a sense of discovery in buying food 
at M&S, and our customers trust us when it 
comes to scouring the world for the best 
there is. We excelled during events such 
as Christmas and Valentine’s Day. And we 
extended our events beyond dates in 
the calendar; our summer-long food 
campaign saw us promote our barbecue, 
grill and world food ranges throughout 
the season. 
INTERNATIONAL
Convenience continues to drive growth in 
the European food market, with demand in 
France particularly strong. This presents 
good growth opportunities for our 
international Food off er and we opened six 
standalone Food stores in Paris this year 
in convenient city centre and transport 
locations. Following the popularity of our 
online stores on China’s leading websites 
and in response to the expanding Chinese 
children’s clothing market, we launched a 
dedicated Kidswear store on Tmall.com, 
which resulted in exceptional year-on-year 
growth. We continue to target the growth of 
the middle class and the expanding lingerie 
market in India with our Lingerie & Beauty 
stores. Our overseas shoppers see M&S as a 
respected brand and they like the fact that 
we are ﬁ rmly grounded in our Britishness. 
TECHNOLOGY
Technology continues to shape how 
customers shop. The proliferation of 
diff erent channels – stores, online, tablet, 
mobile – is turning shopping into a seamless 
experience. Mobile is increasingly the ﬁ rst 
port of call for consumers’ research and the 
number of shoppers using smartphones to 
search for clothing increased by more than 
half over the last year. Visits to M&S.com 
via mobile were also up 51%. We have 
adopted a mobile-ﬁ rst approach to digital 
development, ensuring the primary devices 
our customers use are at the heart of the 
design. The pace of change in technology 
continued – with the launch of some of 
the ﬁ rst wearable tech devices. Our Digital 
Labs team – made up of product design 
specialists and data scientists – ensure 
we stay at the forefront of technological 
developments. The team uses the agile 
techniques of the start-up world to help us 
test and validate new ideas and concepts 
and apply the learnings as quickly and 
effi  ciently as possible. For example, the 
team was able to develop our popular 
Cook with M&S app for the Apple Watch 
ahead of its UK launch. 
In a fast-changing retail world, it is crucial that we listen to our
customers and understand their needs. Our Customer Insight Unit (CIU) 
analyses responses from 60,000 customers a month. It combines this 
feedback with market research to monitor the consumer climate and 
understand how it is inﬂ uencing shopping behaviour.

INNOVATION
Customer Insight We know our customers 
look to M&S for innovative ideas. In a 
crowded retail market, they want to know 
that when they shop with us they will 
get high-quality products 
that are only available at 
M&S and are better than 
ever before.
Products & Channels Over a quarter of our 
Food products were new this year. And our 
clothing ranges were constantly refreshed 
with wearable interpretations of the latest 
trends. As the UK market leader in lingerie, 
our bra ﬁ t service is popular with our 
customers, however one in four will not go 
into store for a bra ﬁ t. So our team of 
software engineers developed a digital 
solution. Our digital Bra Fit tool gives 
customers an accurate and convenient way 
of measuring themselves in the privacy of 
their own home.  Read more on p26-27.
Brand & People Store presentation is crucial; 
we have great products and we want to 
showcase them at their best. So this year 
around 5,000 colleagues trained in 
The M&S Way, supported by an innovative 
online learning tool to promote consistent 
visual merchandising standards across 
our GM ranges. Our marketing campaigns 
constantly break new ground. Our 
‘ Adventures In…’ Food ads used new 
photography techniques to showcase our 
food innovation with dancing fruit and 
bursting berries.  Read more on p28 and 30.
Last summer, consumer conﬁ dence moved 
into positive territory for the ﬁ rst time in almost 
a decade as people felt more secure about the 
macroeconomic environment. Although it has 
ﬂ uctuated since, conﬁ dence has remained 
consistently higher than in previous years. There 
remain regional diff erences throughout the UK. 
But wherever they are, consumers are looking 
for both value and quality.
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX
INTEGRITY
Customer Insight Our customers tell us that 
they trust us to do the right thing. At M&S, we 
pride ourselves on the high levels of integrity 
in our products and in our 
supply chain. In a competitive 
and challenging food 
market, customers know 
that we will not cut corners 
when it comes to the 
quality and provenance 
of the food that we sell. 
Products & Channels T raceability is key . Due 
to our close relationship with our suppliers, we 
can pinpoint the very herd that produces any 
particular batch of our milk. This year , a third of 
our food products came from Gold and Silver 
sustainability standard producers, in line with 
our Plan A target. T oday, 64% of our food and 
clothing products have a Plan A quality, up 
from 5 7% last year . The quality either relates t o 
the mat erials that the pr oducts ar e made fr om 
or t o the manufacturing pr oc ess.
Brand & People Since we started our 
Shwopping initiative in 20 1 2, customers have 
shwopped 1 0.6 million clothing garments for 
Oxfam, worth £7 .3 million to the charity . Our 
Behind the Barcode initiative ensured that 
colleagues in our International stores were up 
to speed when it came to brand awareness 
and the service standards that make M&S a 
world-class retailer . 
INSPIRATION
Customer Insight Our customers 
t ell us they want an inspiring shopping 
experience every time they enter 
an M&S store or visit our websit e. 
They also want t o see ranges that 
are creative and exciting. We seek 
to inspire our customers with every 
product they buy from us, be it a 
prepared meal or a raincoat.
Products & Channels Our ranges were 
positivel y received by the fashion pr ess this year . 
Customers’ feedback about the quality and 
style of our clothing ranges has improved, and 
they have noticed the better ﬁ t of our clothing. 
With our Food ranges we want to delight our 
customers and we independently test all our 
products for taste and quality, ensuring our 
products are always a cut above the rest.

Brand & People Our new M&S logo 
emphasises the heritage and quality for which 
we are known. It is just one of the ways that we 
have inspired cust omers this year . At Christmas, 
we carried out random acts of kindness all 
across the UK. The strategy forged a warm 
connection between our people and our 
customers at a special time of year .

IN TOUCH
Customer Insight T o stay relevant, our 
customers tell us we need to stay in touch 
with them, so we constantly talk to them and 
monitor their spending habits. As well as 
analysing responses from 60,000 customers 
a month, our CIU looks at 600 million unique 
customer transactions a year . We use the 
data to help us give our customers a great 
experience every time they 
shop with us.
Products & Channels It is crucial that we are 
in touch with our customers through every 
channel available. M&S.com uses bespoke 
content to communicate with our customers 
2 4 hours a day and is regularly updated to take 
int o ac c ount cust omer feedback. Social media is 
an incr eas ingl y importan t wa y o f c ommunica t ing 
and we  have a social media ‘audience’ of 
over 2.6  million via platforms and websites 
such as T witter , Instagram and Facebook.

Brand & People We pride ourselves on the 
connections we have with the communities 
in which we work – staying in touch with the 
communities where we operate is central 
to Plan A. Whether it’s through the volunteer 
work of our store colleagues, through our 
partnerships with local charities, or via 
community-based initiatives like the Big Beach 
Clean-Up, we aim to be a force for good in 
the towns and cities where we have stores 
and operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
Our people are at the very heart of M&S: 
bringing our values to life and putting our 
strategy into action. To create value for our 
shareholders we must engage employees 
across the business in our strategic plans 
and ensure we have the right people, 
with the right mix of skills to drive our 
growth ambitions. 
ENHANCING LIVES, EVERY DAY 
We have done a lot of work this year 
to ensure that we have the correct 
management structures in place to deliver 
on our promise of enhancing lives, every 
day. In the face of changing shopping 
habits, we have to make sure that our 
framework is  ﬁ t for the future.
Last summer we realigned our executive 
team’s responsibilities to ensure greater 
accountability across the business. We also 
streamlined our processes and introduced 
more collaborative ways of working 
throughout the Company to speed up 
decision-making.
Our four new core values underpin 
everything we do: Inspiration, Innovation, 
Integrity and In Touch.
OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM
The changes we made last June saw UK  Retail 
and International represented at Board level 
for the ﬁ rst time. T o reﬂ ect the increasingly 
‘channel neutral’ outlook of our  customers, 
Laura Wade-Gery assumed responsibility for 
UK Retail as well as Multi-channel. 
Patrick Bousquet -Chavanne took on 
responsibility for International, as well as 
Marketing, to help bolster M&S’s global 
brand position. 
We were delighted to welcome Helen Weir 
onto our Board as Chief Finance Offi  cer on 
1 April 20 1 5. Helen, who replaced Alan 
Stewart, brings with her a wealth of retail, 
consumer and ﬁ nancial experience. She was 
formerly Chief Finance Offi  cer at the John 
Lewis Partnership. Prior to that she held 
senior positions at Lloyds Banking Group 
and Kingﬁ sher. 
Our Management Committee helps shape 
our annual business priorities and drives the 
delivery of our plan. T o ensure that all areas 
of our business work as one team, it was 
extended to ensure it is fully representative 
of the entire business. The Management 
Committee is ably supported by the Senior 
Leadership Group, whose key objective is 
to  drive a high performance culture and 
promote a wide understanding of our plans 
and priorities, so that every employee feels 
clear and conﬁ dent about the direction of 
our business.
A NEW APPROACH
In order to support the organisational 
changes, we launched a new leadership 
programme – Fit to Lead The Future. 
Designed to equip our people with the 
insights and practical techniques to build 
and lead high performing teams, it will 
ensure our leaders understand what’s 
required of an organisation to remain 
sustainable in a quickly changing world. 
We are also running engagement events 
for our 1,300 head offi  ce employees who 
have responsibility for directly managing 
individuals or teams to ensure they 
understand the important role that they 
play in driving high performance. Our new 
values are reﬂ ected in our employee 
policies, including the behaviours we 
look for when we recruit, the induction 
of new employees, in performance 
management and as part of our 
development programmes.

RISK MANAGEMENT
APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board has overall accountability for 
ensuring that risk is eff ectively managed 
across the Group and, on behalf of the 
Board, the Audit Committee reviews the 
eff ectiveness of the Group Risk Process. 
Each business area is responsible for 
identifying, assessing and managing 
the risks in their respective area. 
Risks are identiﬁ ed and assessed by all 
business areas half-yearly and are measured 
against a deﬁ ned set of criteria, considering 
likelihood of occurrence and potential 
impact to the Group. The Group Risk 
function facilitates a risk identiﬁ cation and 
assessment exercise with the Executive 
Board members. This information is 
combined to form a consolidated view of 
risk. The top risks (based on likelihood and 
impact) form our Group Risk Proﬁ le, which is 
reported to the Executive Board for review 
and challenge, ahead of ﬁ nal review and 
approval by the Group Board.
To ensure that our risk process drives 
continuous improvement across the 
business, the Executive Board monitors 
the ongoing status and progress of key 
action plans against each risk quarterly. 
KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
We continue to drive improvements to our 
risk management process and the quality of 
risk information generated, whilst at the 
same time maintaining a simple and 
practical approach. This year we have 
placed signiﬁ cant focus on developing 
our approach to risk appetite.
The objective of our risk management 
approach is to identify and assess all 
signiﬁ cant risks to the achievement of 
our strategic objectives. Risk appetite is 
an important consideration in strategic 
decisions made by the Board. It is an 
expression of the types and amount of risk 
we are willing to take or accept to achieve 
our plan and should support the deﬁ nition 
of mitigating activities required to 
manage risk likelihood and impact to 
within acceptable levels. By deﬁ ning our 
risk appetite we aim to support consistent, 
risk-informed decision-making across 
the Group.
This year we have taken steps to strengthen 
our approach to risk appetite, starting with 
the deﬁ nition of draft, Group-level risk 
appetite statements. The purpose of these 
is to articulate the Board’s desired risk-
taking approach to the achievement of our 
strategic objectives, in the context of 
managing our principal risks. During the 
201 5/1 6 ﬁ nancial year we will further develop 
our approach to risk appetite, reﬁ ning these 
statements and integrating them with our 
wider risk management processes. For 
more information on this, please see p45.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As with any business, we face risks and 
uncertainties on a daily basis. It is the 
eff ective management of these that places 
us in a better position to be able to achieve 
our strategic objectives and to embrace 
opportunities as they arise.
Overleaf are details of our principal risks and 
uncertainties and the mitigating activities in 
place to address them. It is recognised that 
the Group is exposed to risks wider than 
those listed. However, we have disclosed 
those we believe are likely to have the 
greatest impact on our business at this 
moment in time and those that have been 
the subject of debate at recent Board or 
Audit Committee meetings.
To achieve a holistic view of the risks facing 
our business, both now and in the future, 
we  consider those that are:
>  External to our business;
>  Core to our day-to-day operation;
>  Related to business change activity; and
>  Those that could emerge in the future.
The ‘risk radar’ below maps our principal 
risks against these categories. This tool is 
also used to facilitate wider Executive and 
Board level discussions on risk.

Notes: The Group Risk Proﬁ le will evolve as mitigating activities reduce net risk over time, or as new risks emerge. Two new risks have been added to the Group Risk Proﬁ le since the prior 
year (Food competition and Staff  retention); the remaining risks have essentially remained the same. No risks have been removed from the Group Risk Proﬁ le since the prior year.
The risks listed do not comprise all those associated with Marks & Spencer and the numerical referencing does not denote an order of priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not 
presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse eff ect on the business. Further information on the ﬁ nancial risks we face and how

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOOD
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
Following another very strong year in Food, 
we have now seen 22 consecutive quarters 
of like-for-like sales growth. Our mantra has 
been to become ‘more relevant, more often’ 
for our customers. We have achieved this 
through our constantly evolving ranges, our 
quality and our innovation. We continue to 
excite people with our products, whether 
they are doing the weekly shop, buying for 
tonight or picking up a treat for a loved one. 
At M&S we have a Food business that is 
ambitious in nature, adventurous in scope 
and growing in size, highlighted by us 
outperforming the market by 3.5%.
QUALITY AND PRICE 
Our industry-beating growth springs from 
our focus on the provenance, taste and 
excitement of the food on our shelves. We 
have maintained a competitive stance on 
price. For example, this year we refused to 
match the industry in cutting the price of 
milk. The reason is simple: our milk is better 
than our competitors’. At M&S we will not 
compromise on either our quality or 
our relationships with our farmers. We 
independently taste test all our food and 
upgrade or eliminate any product that does 
not exceed our rivals’ equivalent. We know 
that customers like this stance. As a result, 
we are growing our market share. 
INSPIRATION
This year we introduced 1,700 new products, 
equivalent to over a quarter of our entire 
range. Our teams of technologists, chefs 
and nutritionists searched the world for 
interesting new food ideas. Thanks to the 
longstanding bond of trust between us 
and our customers, we can be counted on 
to source the most exotic and authentic 
ﬂ avours. Popular new lines included our 
Taste range of cuisine from Thailand, Mexico, 
Vietnam and Japan. Whether customers 
wanted a pho or a taco, a gyoza or a pad thai, 
we had it covered. We also launched our 
39-strong Frozen Meals range, which ﬁ rmly 
destroyed the notion that ready meals are 
limited to lasagne and cottage pie, with 
new dishes including Slow Cooked Chicken 
and Chorizo Stew and Pulled Pork with 
Potato and Kale Hash. The convenient dishes 
showed customers that a busy lifestyle 
shouldn’t be an impediment to a delicious 
meal. We continued to perform particularly 
well on special occasions, from Valentine’s 
Day to Christmas. Our Collection range of 
gifting and chocolate treats saw sales rise by 
27% over the festive period. 
STORES 
Our store opening programme continued at 
pace. This year we opened 62 Simply Food 
stores in the UK and ten overseas. We also 
upped the opening target set in 201 3/1 4 of 
200 new stores by 201 6/1 7 to 250. The Simply 
Food format plays into evolving shopping 
habits. People are shopping more regularly 
and more locally, meaning that our 
convenience format is one of our key 
diff erentiating factors. In terms of our 
in-store environments, we updated the look 
and feel of our stores, introduced chefs and 
increased the roll-out of Deli counters, 
adding theatre to the shopping trip.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTEGRITY  
R
We continued our programme to rebase our 
supply chain. By streamlining our processes, 
optimising volumes and consolidating 
factories we have generated effi  ciencies 
and savings. We have reinvested this money 
in price and quality, and also shared it with 
suppliers to help them create further 
effi  ciencies, thus establishing a virtuous 
circle. Nothing is more important to us 
than food safety and we have led the way 
in reducing campylobacter in our poultry, 
a stance which has been endorsed by the 
Food Standards Agency. 
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES 
A
Food waste is a key concern for our 
customers. Our priority is to reduce food 
waste whilst ensuring that, where there is 
food surplus, we put it to the best possible 
use by working with redistribution partners 
like FareShare and Community Shop. 
The ﬁ rst social supermarket in the UK, 
Community Shop, gives shoppers on the 
cusp of food poverty access to surplus 
products that would otherwise have been 
wasted. We believe supporting communities 
in this way is the right thing to do.
Our mission in Food is simple: inspire 
our customers with high quality, great value 
products in stores full of new ideas.

OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS
GENERAL MERCHANDISE
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
Two of M&S’s key priorities for 201 4/1 5 were 
to increase our GM gross margin and to 
improve GM performance. We achieved the 
former, with a 1 90bps increase – one of the 
largest margin improvements ever seen in 
one year at M&S. The rise was largely due 
to better buying and sourcing, resulting in 
an overall increase in proﬁtability for our 
GM business. We also focused on further 
improving our clothing ranges, which 
were well received by customers and the 
fashion press, most notably Womenswear. 
This was underlined by our fourth quarter 
performance – we ended the year in growth 
on a total and like-for-like sales basis, giving 
us positive momentum to take into the new 
ﬁnancial year.
MARGIN AND SALES 
Despite a highly promotional marketplace, 
we remained focused on full price sales and 
we reduced the number of price promotions 
this year. This approach also contributed to 
our substantial gross margin improvement. 
However, whilst we remain the UK’s clothing 
leader, our focus on margin growth and full 
price sales has impacted our discounted 
market share, contributing to a slight 
reduction in our overall market share.
We also changed the way we buy our 
merchandise. We now design 35% of our 
products in-house compared to 20% last 
year, and we are making good progress 
against our long-term target of 60% by 
201 6/1 7 . We continue to use our scale to 
source fabric and raw materials more 
eff ectively whilst ensuring we uphold our 
quality credentials – perceptions of quality 
were up 6%.
Sales for the year as a whole were 
disappointing. The UK retail sector was 
impacted by the third warmest autumn 
on record and we were disproportionately 
aff ected due to our high market shares in 
winter categories such as knitwear and 
coats. We also faced disruption to deliveries 
due to the unsatisfactory performance of 
our online distribution centre over the peak 
Christmas period. At the start of the year, we 
said that our GM sales would be negatively 
impacted by the settling in period of our 
new website. Since then, good progress has 
been made – M&S.com sales were back in 
growth in the fourth quarter.
OUR PRODUCTS
Overwhelmingly positive press coverage 
gave customers conﬁdence to turn to us 
for our interpretation of the key trends. 
Customers’ feedback was equally 
encouraging; they were excited to see 
more conﬁdent, bolder collections. 
We continue to improve the style of our 
ranges – customer perceptions of style were 
up 4%. We listened to customer feedback 
and brought greater consistency to the 
ﬁ t of our garments across all product 
categories and brands. Overall, customer 
complaints fell by 34% over the year as 
customers noticed the improvements to 
our Womenswear.
INSPIRING OUR CUSTOMERS
We have made a number of improvements 
to our stores to make them easier and more 
inspiring places to shop. We presented outﬁt 
ideas to customers in smarter ways through 
better use of mannequins and pictures in 
our stores. We introduced a new Menswear 
layout with simpliﬁed displays and strong 
images emphasising our style and quality. 
We extended our Womenswear Limited 
Edition brand to all stores and our popular 
Rosie for Autograph lingerie and sleepwear 
ranges to more stores, giving our customers 
more choice no matter where they shop.
WORKING EFFICIENTLY AND 
WITH INTEGRITY  
A
Much has been going on behind the scenes 
to improve our supply chain. We have 
successfully rolled out the ﬁrst new system 
to improve the replenishment of our 
products and availability. Along with the 
ongoing improvements we are making to 
how we design, source and buy, further 
planning system changes will be made in 
the coming year. 
R
 
Responsible supply chain management 
is a key part of ensuring we off er customers 
the high-quality products they expect 
from us. We believe that great quality starts 
with good factory and supply chain ethics, 
and we continue to work closely with 
our suppliers to ensure these rigorous 
standards continue to be upheld.
We have improved the quality and style 
of our ranges and delivered strong gross 
margin growth.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
T o ensure that we have one view of the M&S 
customer , we brought our UK Retail and 
M&S.com channels together under single 
management this year . The change reﬂ ects 
our need to deliver a consistent and 
convenient experience for our customers 
however they shop with us, whether it’s on a 
computer , a tablet, a mobile phone or in one 
of our 852 UK stores. It has been a pivotal 
year in terms of our infrastructure. Whilst we 
faced some diffi  culties during the bedding in 
period, our investment in M&S.com and our 
distribution centre at Castle Donington are 
the right thing for our business in the long 
term. We are now ﬁ t for the future and in 
control of our multi-channel ambitions. 
STORES
We focused our space growth on the Simply 
Food format, opening 62 new stores, which 
increased customer access – an additional 
1 .2 million people are now within ten minutes 
drive of a Simply Food. Although our strategy 
is to add no net new GM space to our store 
estate after 20 1 5/1 6, we continue to review our 
portfolio to ensure that our stores are in the 
most convenient locations. We opened two 
full line stores at Monks Cross in Y ork and 
Wolstanton near Stoke-on-T rent. 
Within our stores we concentrated on 
creating an environment that projects our 
products’ style and innovation credentials. 
Guidance was a central theme. Using the 
M&S Way principles, we merchandised our 
collections in more cohesive and colour 
coordinated ways to show customers how 
they might wear the latest styles. We 
upgraded the environment in many of our 
stores, including new Menswear departments 
in our top 70 stores, with elements of the 
new scheme rolled out to a further 48, and 
refreshed Womenswear departments in 
44 stores. Stronger visual merchandising in 
Food helped customers to discover new 
ﬂ avours. We have started the roll out of our 
new Food Hall concept, which adds theatre 
and adventure to the shopping trip. 
Knowledgeable employees are our bedrock, 
and this year our training initiatives continued 
to ensure that customers had an easy and 
enjoyable shopping experience. Our 
colleagues know that our unyielding focus on 
Presentation, Availability, Cross-selling and 
service, and Knowledge – our P ACK priorities – 
is what separates us from the competition. 
M&S.COM
Following our move from the Amazon web 
platform, this was the ﬁ rst full year in which we 
had control of our website. Whilst it proved to 
be technically resilient, the new site presented 
a bigger change for our customers than we 
anticipated and sales were aff ected. We 
worked hard to address this and made a 
number of updates to improve the shopping 
experience. Our customers liked the 
enhanced functionality and cleaner look of 
the site, which we continually ﬁ ne-tune to 
make as intuitive as possible. M&S.com sales 
returned to growth in the fourth quarter and 
we saw gradual improvement across all key 
metrics: over the year traffi  c grew by 1 0.9%, 
customer satisfaction rose by 1 8% and 
conversion rates improved as customers got 
more familiar with the new site layout. Some 
7 million shoppers have now registered on 
the site, surpassing the number on our former 
Amazon-run site. Customers enjoy the site’s 
strong editorial point of view – we know they 
are more likely to buy if they see supportive 
editorial alongside a garment they like. On 
average, conversion was 20% higher on 
products that were featured as Editor’s Picks. 
R
 
Our performance was impacted by 
operational challenges at our Castle 
Donington distribution centre over the peak 
Christmas period. Highly automated sites like 
this often need reﬁ nement during their ﬁ rst 
period of sustained demand and we have 
made progress in addressing the issues. We 
have learned from this, made improvements 
to our systems, and strengthened our 
management team who continue to closely 
monitor its performance. We are conﬁ dent in 
our long-term ability to serve our customers 
better . Customers saw improvements in our 
delivery proposition as the year progressed, 
with the introduction of a 1 0pm cut -off  for 
paid next day home delivery and a 5pm 
cut-off  for free next day store collection. 
Since it opened, Castle Donington has 
handled over 85 million products.
 
Our website and distribution centre are 
powerful engines for growth. Following 
our investment in them, we now have a big 
opportunity to drive online sales growth, 
increase our online proﬁ tability and set 
M&S up for years to come. 
We aim to deliver a consistent, convenient 
and inspirational experience for our customers 
whichever way they choose to shop with us.

INTERNATIONAL
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
From Paris to Prague and from Cairo to 
Kolkata, M&S is seen as a trusted and 
progressive brand with a strong sense of 
British identity . We now trade from 480 stores 
and online in 5 9 territories across the world. 
We accelerated the roll-out of our Food stores 
overseas and continued to focus on our 
priority markets, delivering some strong 
performance in key owned markets such as 
India and Hong Kong. Following the action 
we took to restructure our business in the 
Republic of Ireland and the Czech Republic, 
we were pleased to see improvements in 
proﬁ tability in both markets.
However , sales in our International business 
fell by 2. 1% on a constant currency basis. The 
proﬁ tability of our franchise business was 
impacted by a geopolitically turbulent year 
in a number of our franchise territories. This 
particularly aff ected performance in Russia, 
Ukraine and T urkey, where our franchise 
partner was impacted by political instability 
and local currency ﬂ uctuations which resulted 
in lower shipments. Elsewhere in the Middle 
East region, the macroeconomic situation 
has impacted consumer demand and our 
franchise partners have adapted to the 
challenging environment by managing their 
businesses prudently and ordering less stock.
A review of our international store estate, 
coupled with the adverse euro exchange rates 
and tough consumer environment, resulted 
in writedowns of £3 7 .2m relating to certain 
underperforming stores in Western Europe, 
Ireland and China.
However , with a strong International 
management team and proven overseas 
partners, we remain committed to the longer -
term opportunity which we ﬁ rmly believe 
exists within our international markets.
OUR PRIORITY MARKETS
We are growing in scale and relevance in our 
two key markets of India and China. In India 
we opened 1 2 stores and our store opening 
plan is on track. Sustainable economic 
development, a burgeoning middle class, 
and an instinctive understanding of the 
M&S brand make India a fertile market for 
continued expansion. In Greater China, we 
opened a store in Macau and announced 
our intention to open ﬂ agships in Beijing 
and Guangzhou from next year , and we will 
continue to invest in our existing ﬂ agship 
store portfolio. However , following the 
completion of a review, we are closing ﬁ ve of 
our smaller stores in the Shanghai region as 
we refocus our emphasis on stores in the 
more affl  uent areas. We are also seeing 
signiﬁ cant online growth in China on our 
site on the T mall.com marketplace – sales 
increased by 200% on last year . We launched 
a new dedicated Kidswear store on T mall.com 
and a new clothing store on JD.com. The 
success of our online expansion further 
strengthens our continued commitment 
to China. 
INTERNATIONAL FOOD GROWTH
We have seen tremendous success from the 
roll-out of our Food stores overseas. Around 
the world, grocers are moving closer to the 
consumer and we are tapping into that trend. 
We opened six stores in Paris and four in Hong 
Kong over the year , taking the total number 
of international Food stores to 3 1 . Overall 
sales per square foot are in line with our best 
performing Simply Food stores in the UK. Our 
recipe for success is the same as in our home 
market: we sell good value, delicious food 
from convenient locations. 
NEW OPENINGS
In May 20 1 5, we re-entered Brussels with a 
new 54,000 square foot store at T oison d’Or 
and in November we will open a second store 
in Macau at The Venetian Mall. We have an 
exciting pipeline of openings in the Middle 
East. In February we opened our largest 
international store in Kuwait. The View is a 
72,000 square foot ﬂ agship that is operated 
by our longstanding franchise partner 
Al-Futtaim Group. The store contains our 
largest Clothing, Food, Home and Beauty 
off er in the region and houses a 60-seat café. 
GLOBAL LANDSCAPE  
R
The last year has been volatile economically 
and politically in a number of our territories. 
However , there are two ways that our 
International strategy mitigates any risk 
stemming from events beyond our control. 
Firstly, our geographical diversiﬁ cation means 
that we are not too exposed to any one 
country. Secondly, the growing role of Food 
internationally means that we eff ectively 
have two businesses overseas, giving us a 
broader – and more stable – international 
footprint.
This year , we accelerated the roll-out of our 
Food stores overseas and continued to focus 
on our priority markets.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
One brand, multiple stories. That was our 
mission this year: to speak in unison across 
the GM and Food sides of our business, 
across communication channels, and across 
geographies. By uniting all narratives under 
the ‘Only M&S’ umbrella, we reinforced our 
strengths as a trusted and unique British 
lifestyle brand.
We raised the bar with our advertising, 
gaining strong brand recognition for our 
renewed focus on product. In Food, we 
showed that we are at the forefront of 
discovery and creativity. We remained 
focused on our core strength as a speciality 
retailer – innovation. In Clothing, we 
demonstrated that our ranges are fresh, 
stylish and in sync with the current trends.
A FRESH APPROACH
Our new logo – M&S Est. 1 884 – was 
designed to show our brand heritage in a 
contemporary and relevant way. Through 
the logo, we are expressing our roots but 
also showing that we are a modern brand 
that has inspired the British high street 
for generations. With 1 3 1 years of trading 
under our belts, our heritage is a great 
diff erentiator and we are rightly proud of it. 
We revamped all our publications to reﬂect 
this new look, from our Home catalogue 
to our Food to Order catalogue, and we 
launched Womenswear and Menswear Style 
Guides for the ﬁrst time. The new brand 
handwriting extended to M&S.com and 
its daily publications hub, Style & Living. 
As a modern retailer, we must provide an 
inspiring digital or printed expression of 
who we are on every platform.
THE CONNECTED CONSUMER
Our Christmas marketing campaign – The 
Two Fairies – was a great example of how all 
our channels can come together to tell a 
holistic and believable story. The campaign 
followed two fairies as they spread 
Christmas magic and sparkle across the 
land. It started secretly and quickly went 
viral as we covertly carried out random acts 
of kindness in schools, hospitals and stores. 
Our @TheTwoFairies Twitter tag amassed 
30,000 followers before we revealed that 
M&S was behind it. The TV ad that followed – 
an escapist fantasy that continued the 
random acts of kindness theme – achieved 
recognition of 68%. Customers liked the 
warmth and wit of M&S’s ﬁrst truly social 
campaign.
Today, all our communications start with 
a core idea that gets expressed across all 
the consumer touchpoints: stores, online, 
mobile, social media, print media, billboards 
and TV. Our award-winning ‘Adventures in’ 
Food TV ads harnessed online videos to 
get their message across. Today, a ﬁfth of 
our media budget goes on social media, 
four times more than three years ago. This 
approach reﬂects how people live today 
and how they expect to engage with M&S.
SEASONAL AND FOCUSED
After last year’s Leading Ladies campaign 
re-established M&S’s style credentials, our 
approach to marketing this year has been 
more product focused and richer in digital 
video content. We sought to emphasise our 
leadership in authoritative categories such 
as knitwear, occasionwear and cashmere. 
In Food, our January marketing focused 
on our health ranges while our ‘Adventures 
in Imagination’ campaign highlighted the 
expertise, creativity and passion behind 
our food ranges from around the world. 
Customers will see even more of this 
storytelling next year as our marketing 
becomes more personalised.
STAYING RELEVANT 
R
We may have a broad church of customers 
around the world, but by harnessing 
technology and leveraging the power of 
our Customer Insight Unit, we can talk 
to all 33 million of our customers in a more 
personalised way. There is always a risk 
that brands will lose their relevancy, but 
by engaging with our customers and 
adapting to their needs, we will remain 
pertinent to their everyday lives.
We reinforced our strengths as a trusted and unique 
British lifestyle brand with a new approach that told the 
many stories that make our products diff erent.

OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS
PEOPLE
OVERVIEW
This year we made a number of changes to 
the way we do things to ensure that M&S is a 
collaborative and innovative place to work.
FIT FOR THE FUTURE 
R
From the boardroom to the salesﬂoor, 
every one of our 83,000 employees has a 
direct stake in our future. So this year we 
undertook a Company-wide employee 
engagement programme. ‘Fit for the Future’ 
was designed to ensure that we are in the 
best shape to face the challenges and 
opportunities of a fast -changing retail 
landscape with an environment and 
culture that encourages innovation.
As a result of the programme, we improved 
organisational effi  ciency and simpliﬁed 
our decision-making processes. We also 
introduced a raft of measures to encourage 
entrepreneurialism and a more digital 
mindset. T aken together, these initiatives 
spread a sense of ownership throughout 
M&S. Our people are now equipped to 
challenge behaviour that slows us down 
and champion ideas that will inspire 
our customers.
THE POWER OF 92
An informed workforce is a motivated 
workforce. Last summer we directly 
engaged with the greatest inﬂuencers on 
our store staff : our 3,500 Section Managers. 
These people manage 92% of our salesﬂoor 
colleagues, and our ‘The Power of 92’ 
engagement programme saw us hold 
one-day events in locations across the UK 
including Wembley Stadium. The events were 
designed to inspire these front line managers 
and better inform them about why M&S takes 
the decisions it does. After all, their leadership 
directly impacts our customers’ experiences 
of M&S.
ENGAGEMENT AND EFFICIENCY
Considerable internal change meant that 
our ‘Y our Say’ survey showed a slight fall in 
employee engagement levels this year . 
However we were pleased it remained high 
at 77%. Our ‘Y our Manager’ score rose by 4% 
to 83%, demonstrating the commitment 
of our managers in driving a high 
performance culture.
We implemented numerous new operational 
systems over the year . Our Resource 
Planning System increased our eff ectiveness 
when it came to establishing colleagues’ 
work patterns. And our centralised payroll, 
time and attendance system, which has now 
been in place over a year, won Personnel 
T oday’s Managing Change Award, one of the 
numerous accolades we received this year .
TALENT AND TRAINING
M&S is a very diff erent business to the one 
it was ﬁve years ago. In that time we have 
upskilled our teams in areas such as digital, 
international, logistics and design to ensure 
we have the right capabilities to compete. 
T raining remains key. Our new Customer 
Assistant Induction programme replaced a 
workshop-heavy induction process with a 
largely salesﬂoor -driven one. In the third 
quarter alone, 1 5,000 colleagues took part in 
the new programme. This resulted in our new 
starters becoming operationally eff ective 
40% faster than previously. T echnology is 
a great enabler when it comes to training. 
Around 6,000 employees completed our 
app-based The M&S Way training module 
about in-store presentation. 
PLAN A  
A
In 20 1 4 we celebrated a decade of our 
Marks & Start employability scheme. Along 
with our Make Y our Mark youth scheme, we 
have helped over 1 3,600 people who face 
signiﬁcant barriers to employment take 
their ﬁrst steps into the job market. We plan 
to provide opportunities to another 4,400 
people by 20 1 6. 
We have a duty of care for people all through 
our supply chain. We surveyed over 1 00,000 
workers via text message in countries 
including China, India and Bangladesh. 
Their feedback on issues such as workplace 
health and safety helped us to align our 
strategies with their needs. 
Our people continue to be the most important part 
of our company – they drive the high performance culture 
that is vital for our future success and embrace the values 
that make M&S diff erent.

CHAIRMAN’S
GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW
As I mentioned earlier in this report, this 
has been another year of mixed progress 
for the Company. Our Food business 
delivered another very strong year in a 
diffi  cult market. In Food we continue to 
pursue a clear strategy with a distinct and 
diff erentiated position, remaining true to 
our values and with a well articulated plan 
for future growth. 
We are encouraged by the improved 
performance across the business in the 
ﬁ nal quarter 2014/15, particularly in GM 
and M&S.com. However, our full year 
performance was constrained by a number 
of issues associated with the necessary 
and signiﬁ cant transformation of our 
infrastructure, implemented in the last 
few years, and macroeconomic and 
performance issues impacting delivery in 
a number of key international markets. 
The launch of our new website and our 
distribution centre at Castle Donington 
represented the completion of two 
signiﬁ cant investments, essential for the 
long-term growth of our business. This has 
been a key area of focus for the Board over 
the last two years. Yet, and despite rigorous 
planning and mitigation of potential risks, 
both experienced initial execution issues 
beyond those that we expected. We believe 
these issues are now resolved, or that plans 
are in place to resolve them, and both 
projects continue to be areas of focus 
for the Board. 
This year we have sought to provide insight 
into the scope of the Board’s activities, 
discussions and resulting actions. These are 
provided on pages 38 and 39 of this report.
As a Board we have taken away a number 
of learnings, particularly about our 
management of and approach to risk. 
The Board, supported by the Audit 
Committee, spent time discussing risk 
appetite across the business as well as 
our investment criteria. Whilst deﬁ ning our 
approach to risk appetite remains a work 
in progress, we believe this will improve 
the quality of our investment process, 
the mitigation of associated risks and will 
deliver improved project implementation 
going forward. A greater understanding 
of risk appetite and its management will 
also support our ambition to become a 
more agile, innovative and entrepreneurial 
organisation, as embodied by ‘Fit for 
the Future’ and our updated values, which 
were discussed earlier in this report. 
CULTURE AND VALUES
The scale of investment and transformation 
of the business over the last few years has 
necessitated this shift in our culture and 
behaviours. It will enable us to respond 
to the changing consumer landscape, the 
constant evolution in technologies, and 
our aim to be a leading international, multi-
channel business. But while we adapt and 
move forward, we are clear that staying 
true to the M&S tenet of integrity is 
non-negotiable.
Integrity underpins all of our Board 
discussions, from debate on the 
management of our teams, to the safety 
and integrity of our food supply chain. It 
aff ects the way we implement the changes 
required in our GM supply base to deliver 
our ambitious gross margin targets, 
while staying true to our high sourcing 
standards. It shapes how we operate 
in our international markets, and the 
management of our property assets. 
Integrity has protected the M&S brand and 
supported its reputation for over 1 30 years 
and the Board is focused on ensuring it 
continues to do so for the long term.
Having Integrity as a value also means 
being honest in how we judge our own 
performance as a Board and where we can 
do things better. We are disappointed not 
to have made more progress against our 
Board Action Plan this year. We discuss this 
performance and our Board evaluation 
and Action Plan on page 41 of this report. 
We are clear about how we can be more 
eff ective, and what information we need to 
monitor and challenge our progress and 
ensure proper debate. 
I have highlighted before the importance of 
the Board as being critical friends. We have 
a strong team and we have had a number of 
robust discussions throughout the year on 
our execution issues at Castle Donington, 
the performance of the website and our 
International business, the results of 
unsatisfactory audits, our ﬁ nancial 
performance and progress against our 
targets. We have reﬂ ected, and will continue 
to debate openly the results of our Board 
evaluation and how we ensure we have 
the highest quality of debate, coupled 
with the right planning, information and 
environment to support this. We must do 
this to drive our eff ectiveness as a Board 
and to be ﬁ t for the future.
FIT FOR THE FUTURE
The introduction of ‘Fit for the Future’ 
brings greater focus on high performance, 
our teams, development and succession 
planning, all of which remain a key part 
of our Board and Committee agendas. 
Associated detail on the activities of 
the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are provided on pages 42-43 
and 52-76 respectively. Our Action Plan 
for the 2015/16 year is stretching and sets 
out speciﬁ c objectives to improve our 
performance. The plan aims to support 
and enable greater debate and reﬂ ection, 
We have built a team with the skills and experience to support 
our strategy. In this section we look at their roles and their 
performance, and outline their independence, their eff ectiveness, 
ongoing professional development and succession.

and enhance the quality of our decisions. 
Through the Action Plan, we aim to ensure 
that our values underpin the manner in 
which we operate as a Board at all times. 
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The key themes of the Code form the 
framework for articulating our narrative; 
a model that we have consistently 
adopted for a number of years. As such, 
our approaches to Leadership and 
Eff ectiveness are outlined on pages 34 to 
43, Accountability on page 44 and pages 
23 to 25 within the Strategic Report and 
pages 44 to 50 in the Directors’ Report, 
Engagement and relations with 
shareholders on page 51, Remuneration 
on pages 52 to 76 and the Governance 
of our Pensions Scheme on page 77 .
The required governance and regulatory 
assurances are provided throughout this 
Directors’ Report. Where information that 
would previously have been located within 
the Directors’ Report has instead been 
incorporated into the Strategic Report, 
a list of page references is available within 
the ‘Other disclosures’ section on page 78. 
As in previous years, we have sought to 
provide a genuine understanding of how 
governance supports and protects the 
M&S business and stakeholders in a 
practical way.
Our governance framework is reviewed 
and benchmarked against best practice 
every year. It sets out the roles, 
accountabilities and expectations for 
our directors and our structures. This 
format has been adopted widely across 
the business and can be viewed at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
Governance at M&S is seen as an important 
element of our Board environment, which 
feeds into how we do business and is 
reﬂ ected in our Board eff ectiveness review. 
We hope this report demonstrates how our 
governance helps us test whether we are 
doing the right things in the right way, with 
the right safeguards, checks and balances, 
and whether the right considerations 
underpin every decision we take.
We continue to drive the agenda of 
diversity in its broadest sense across 
gender, experience, ethnicity and age. 
Further insight on this is provided on 
page 43 and in our Plan A Report.
MONITORING RISK
  
R
The Audit Committee has played a key 
role in ensuring that the appropriate 
governance and challenge around risk 
and assurance is embedded throughout 
the business. It is closely monitoring the 
management of the problems generated 
by M&S.com and Castle Donington. 
 Read more on the work of the Audit 
Committee on p46-50.
APPOINTMENTS AND SUCCESSION
2014/15 saw signiﬁ cant changes to the 
Board. Following the resignation of 
Alan Stewart in July 2014 we undertook a 
thorough search process resulting in the 
appointment of Helen Weir, who joined the 
business as Chief Finance Offi  cer on 1 April 
2015. Helen brings considerable retail and 
ﬁ nance experience and we are delighted to 
welcome her to the Board. 
In March 2015, Jan du Plessis retired after 
six years on the Board. Jan has been 
succeeded in his role of Senior Independent 
Director by Vindi Banga, who maintains 
his existing role as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Subsequently, 
I have joined the Remuneration Committee 
and Miranda Curtis has joined the Audit 
Committee. 
As a result of Jan’s retirement, and in 
order to provide the necessary balance, 
Richard Solomons was appointed to the 
Board on 1 3 April 2015. We had a clear 
speciﬁ cation for this appointment and are 
delighted that he has joined our Board, 
bringing his experience as a serving CEO 
with great knowledge of operating an 
international, multi-channel consumer 
business. Information on the inductions 
that both Richard and Helen are 
undertaking is provided on page 40. 
These appointments bring new challenge 
and oversight to the Board. Their skills 
and experience build on our existing 
talent, standing us in good stead for the 
year ahead. 
We are a more capable business following 
a sustained period of investment in our 
infrastructure and people. As outlined on 
page 16, our focus will continue to be on 
delivery of our strategy and improvement 
in shareholder returns.
ROBERT SWANNELL CHAIRMAN
The structure of the Annual Report has been 
updated this year, providing greater focus to 
the key strategic messages within the Strategic 
Report, whilst still including the broader 
information on later pages for those that ﬁ nd 
it interesting. 
These changes have been made to promote 
clear and concise reporting, focusing the report 
on those factors that are most important to 
the long-term prospects of the business and 
ensuring key messages are clear, concise and 
easy to locate. 
We have again focused on ensuring this report 
is fair, balanced and understandable. It is a 
reﬂ ection of how we have done business and 
how the Board has served its stakeholders. 
We believe this practical approach will support 
our performance for the long term and should 
protect the trust and integrity of our values, 
and the M&S brand.
The Governance report provides:
> A clear and honest review of the year;
> The outcome of our externally 
facilitated Board Evaluation;
> Greater disclosure around Board discussions 
and associated actions; and
> Information on our progress towards 
understanding our risk appetite.
As a Board we regularly discuss and debate:
> Strategy and 
Company 
performance
> Culture and 
behaviour
> Succession planning
> Ecommerce
> The M&S brand
> International
> Supply chain
> Risk
> Property
> Plan A 2020
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the 
‘Code’) is the standard against which we were

LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS
OUR BOARD CONTINUED
This section looks at our Board members, 
the role of the Board, its performance and 
its oversight. We provide an overview of 
the induction programme undertaken by 
our two newly appointed directors, 
highlighting the diff erences between 
inductions for non-executive and executive 
directors respectively. We also outline how 
our Board contingency plan was tested 
during the year. 
We provide further transparency on activities 
and discussions undertaken during the year by 
sharing some of the actions arising from the 
discussions and the progress against them.
We also provide insight relating to director:
> Independence Maintaining the right 
balance of independence on the Board;
>  Eff ectiveness The review this year 
was externally facilitated. We update 
on the output and the action plan 
for the year ahead on page 41; and
> Ongoing development Business 
training, engagement and mentoring.
The Board is responsible for ensuring 
leadership through eff ective oversight 
and review. Supported by its Principal 
Committees – Audit, Remuneration, and 
Nomination – the Board sets the strategic 
direction and aims to deliver sustainable 
shareholder value over the longer term. 
Clear terms of reference outline the full 
schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision and that of its key 
committees. These, along with the 
individual roles of the Board members, 
can be found in the Group’s formal 
Governance Framework at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
BOARD MEETINGS 
The Board held eight scheduled meetings 
during the year, and individual attendance 
is set out on the next page. Suffi  cient time 
is provided at the start and end of each 
meeting for the Chairman to meet privately

non-executive directors to discuss any 
matters arising. During the year the Board 
held two meetings away from the offi  ce, one 
of which was its annual two-day strategy 
meeting. A brief overview of the key areas of 
discussion, the actions and the outcomes is 
provided on the following pages.

BOARD COLLABORATION
The work of the Board complements, 
enhances and supports the work of the 
Executive Board. We believe that eff ective 
governance is realised through leadership 
and team work. Collaboration across all 
levels within the Board structure drives 
a culture of continuous improvement 
in standards and performance across 
our business. Working together, all parts 
of the Board structure conduct robust 
interrogation of plans and actions, ensuring 
high-quality decision-making in all areas 
of strategy, performance, responsibility 
and accountability.
 See Board activities on p38-39
BOARD RESPONSIBILITY 
Responsibility for implementing operational 
decisions and the day-to-day management 
of the business is delegated to the Chief 
Executive and the Executive Board. The 
Management Committee supports the 
Executive Board by monitoring the 
development of the Group’s workstreams 
against the Group’s three-year plan and 
inputting annually into the Group’s 
strategic plan. The executive directors 
update the Board at each Group 
Board meeting.
There is clear delegation and oversight 
from the Executive Board to the Executive 
Committees (outlined in our Governance 
Framework at marksandspencer.com/
thecompany), which strengthens decision-
making across key areas of the business. 
In addition, the Audit Committee receives 
a business update at each meeting.

The Board reviews the independence of its 
non-executive directors as part of its annual 
Board Eff ectiveness Review. 
The Chairman is committed to ensuring the 
Board comprises a majority of independent 
non-executive directors who objectively 
challenge management, balanced against 
the need to ensure continuity on the Board.
The Board approved the appointment of 
Martha Lane Fox for a third term in May 201 3. 
At the date of publication, Martha will have 
served on the Board for eight years. Martha 
continues to receive strong support from 
shareholders as can be seen from the 
voting results of the 201 4 AGM. As Martha 
has served more than six years with the 
Company and, as required by the Code, 
her appointment was again the subject of 
particular review and scrutiny and it was 
agreed that she continues to make a strong 
independent contribution to the Board. With 
the exception of Martha, all continuing non-
executive directors have served less than six 
years on the Board. 
 See details and experience of each director 
on p34-35.
The Board considers that all of the non-
executive directors bring strong independent 
oversight and continue to demonstrate 
independence. However , the Board recognises 
the recommended term within the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and is mindful 
of the need for suitable succession. 
 See Board activities overview on p38-39
 See our Risk management and Principal risks on p23-25, and Risk in action on p44-45.
RISK MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT
Protecting the business from operational, 
ﬁ nancial and reputational risk is an 
essential part of the Board’s role. As key 
transformational projects came online 
this year, the Board, supported by the 
Audit Committee, looked to ensure that 
key ﬁ nancial and operational controls 
were robust throughout this change. 
Progress was assessed and challenges 
were managed within the context of the 
Board’s appetite for risk. 
The Group Risk Proﬁ le, owned by the 
Board, is compiled by Group Risk using 
business area risk registers and one-on-
one interviews with Board members and 
business unit directors. Oversight and 
independence is provided in the process 
through the Audit Committee, which 
ensures that the risks included in the 
Group Risk Proﬁ le continue to reﬂ ect the 
business’s strategic objectives. An Internal 
Audit plan is then mapped to the Group 
Risk Proﬁ le demonstrating where assurance 
is provided over the mitigating activities.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS
Progress against the strategy is closely 
monitored by the Executive Board and 
discussed at each Group Board meeting. 
The annual two-day strategy meeting held 
away from the offi  ce continues to provide 
for more relaxed and free-ﬂ owing 
discussion. This year the agenda focused on 
the Castle Donington distribution centre 
and M&S.com, GM, customer engagement, 
our property portfolio and International 
performance. Progress was reviewed 
against the three-year plan and the longer-
term vision for the future. 
The Board debated the priorities and 
the longer-term challenges, identiﬁ ed 
opportunities for improvement and agreed 
an action plan. The non-executive directors 
shared their expertise and provided 
independent oversight to the discussion. 
There has also been increased focus on 
the people implementing the plans with 
key skills and competencies improved 
throughout the business. 
 See People Behind the Plan on p22.
GOVERNANCE IN ACTION
The role of the non-executives is not limited 
to Board attendance. Examples of other 
activities undertaken in the year:
Andy Halford: met with the Groceries 
Code Adjudicator, visited Castle Donington, 
the Mumbai store, and the Hong Kong 
Sourcing Offi  ce and store; and
Alison Brittain: visited Castle Donington 
and undertook a store visit with a multi-
channel fashion retail expert from Boston 
Consulting Group.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
The assessment of the Marks & 
Spencer Board was conducted 
according to the guidance in 
the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and was facilitated by 
Fﬁ on Hague of Independent 
Board Evaluation. Neither 
Fﬁ on Hague nor Independent 
Board Evaluation have any other 
connection with the Company.
The external evaluation 
of our Board is an 
important factor in 
ensuring we are creating 
an open, eff ective 
Board and realising 
our potential.
ROBERT SWANNELL CHAIRMAN
Shortly before the publication of this report, 
two new directors joined the business; 
Helen Weir, Chief Finance Offi  cer, and 
Richard Solomons, Non-Executive Director. 
Both are receiving a tailored induction 
programme led by the Chairman, which 
includes time with each of the executive 
directors, the group secretary , members of 
the Management Committee, a wide range 
of senior management from across the 
business, and the opportunity to meet 
with major shareholders. 
Helen and Richard’s induction 
programmes are comprehensive 
and both cover:
Company structure and strategy, 
including: Our history; strategy (including 
details of all key investment decisions ), 
key people and succession plans; Board 
procedures including the Governance 
Framework, Code of Ethics and Behaviours; 
Board calendar, minutes from previous 
meetings, eff ectiveness reviews and action 
plans; ﬁ nances, performance, operating 
plans, current KPIs and targets, operational 
overview of all business areas; key relationships, 
including suppliers and major contracts; 
Group Risk Proﬁ le and our approach to risk; 
insight into key audits and areas of focus.
Industry and competitive environment, 
including: Customer trends, consumer and 
regulatory environment including governance 
and all relevant consumer and industry 
bodies, Corporate Social Responsibility, 
environment and sustainability.
Sentiment and reputation, including: 
Brand positioning and media proﬁ le; 
marketing campaigns; brand values; analyst 
and investor opinion; review of investor 
surveys; share register and voting history; 
key stakeholder relations including 
employees, customers, suppliers and service 
providers; opinion leaders; an overview of 
our remuneration policy and pensions. 
Richard’s induction as a non-executive was 
supported by one-on-one meetings, and 
aimed to provide a broad learning about 
the business, its operations, its key markets 
and its risks. 
Helen’s induction was supported by a 
greater number of one-on-one meetings 
with the Chairman, the executive and 
the non-executive directors, but also 
management from Strategic Programmes, 
Finance, HR (including visiting our 
employee support team), GM (including our 
overseas sourcing teams), Food, Customer 
Insight, Communications and Investor 
Relations (including some of our larger 
shareholders and our corporate brokers), 
Store operations (including visiting the 
Castle Donington facility), Plan A, Health 
& Safety, Pensions, M&S Bank, Internal 
Audit & Risk, the Company Archive and 
the Governance team.
Given that the two directors joined the 
business within a short space of time, 
we will take this opportunity to obtain 
feedback on their experience of the 
induction process and review the director 
induction programme. Going forward 
we will also seek feedback from Alison 
Brittain, on her induction and her ﬁ rst year 
with the business. Further information 
on our induction can be found in the 
Corporate Governance section of 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
DIRECTOR INDUCTION BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
SUCCESSION
Succession planning and the succession 
pipeline remain a key agenda item for 
the Board. 
During the year, our Board contingency plan 
was tested when, shortly after the AGM, 
Alan Stewart resigned from the Board. Given 
Alan had accepted a role with another food 
retailer, the Board felt it necessary for him 
to leave the business immediately. Until a 
suitable replacement was found for the 
position, Paul Friston, our then Director of 
Group Financial Control, was appointed 
Interim Chief Finance Offi  cer. Paul held the 
position until Helen Weir joined the business 
on 1 April 201 5, at which point Paul took up 
a new role within the business. 
In August 201 4, we also announced that 
Jan du Plessis would be leaving the business 
in the early part of 201 5. Jan had served M&S 
for six years as a non-executive director. 
Having Jan remain with the business until 
March 201 5, and Paul cover the Finance role 
for nine months, allowed the Board to focus 
suffi  cient attention on ensuring the new 
appointments came with the required 
qualiﬁ cations, experience and skills to meet 
the challenges and opportunities ahead. 
 More detail on succession planning 
can be found on pages 42-43.

BOARD REVIEW PROCESS
Stage 1 A comprehensive brief was given 
to the assessment team by the Chairman, 
Robert Swannell, and Group Secretary, 
Amanda Mellor , in December 20 1 4. The 
evaluation team also observed Board and 
committee meetings in December 20 1 4, and 
January and March 20 1 5. Copies of all Board 
papers were provided to the team for brieﬁ ng 
purposes prior to the meeting.
In January and February, detailed interviews 
were conducted with every Board member . 
All participants were interviewed according 
to a clear agenda, tailored for the Board. In 
addition, the team spoke to the Director of HR, 
the Interim Chief Finance Offi  cer, Head of 
Internal Audit & Risk, the Group Secretary, 
the Company’s external remuneration 
consultants, PwC, and the Company’s lead 
Audit Partner from Deloitte.
Stage 2 The report was compiled by the 
evaluation team based on information and 
views supplied by the Board and those 
interviewed. All recommendations were 
based on best practice as described in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and other 
current corporate governance guidelines.
Stage 3 Draft conclusions were discussed 
with the Chairman and subsequently 
discussed with the whole Board at its 
meeting in April, with Fﬁ on Hague present. 
The conclusions of that discussion were 
recorded in the minutes of the meeting. 
Robert Swannell also received a separate 
report with feedback on individual directors. 
Following the Board meeting, Fﬁ on Hague 
gave feedback on the Chairman to the Senior 
Independent Director , and to the Committee 
Chairmen on the performance of each 
committee. The Senior Independent Director 
also met with the non-executive directors to 
review the Chairman’s performance. This 
review was then shared with the Chairman.

As in previous years, the Board’s focus on 
culture, values and people development 
was felt to be strong. However, this year it 
was felt that more could be done to 
facilitate greater informal engagement 
between the Board and the broader 
management team.
After a thorough debate of the review with 
Fﬁ on Hague present, the Board has agreed 
an Action Plan for the year ahead. This plan 
focuses on the quality of information to 
support Board discussions, and broadening 
Board debate and scope around risk. 
Note: The above activities were undertaken by Fﬁ on Hague of Independent Board Evaluation. 
*Fﬁ on Hague also attended the Board discussion.
Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3
BOARD REVIEW INSIGHTS 2014/15
The ethos and culture of the Board is 
positive and remains in line with the last 
independent review in 201 2. 
Overall, the Board rated its performance as 
acceptable in the areas of governance and 
compliance, shareholder accountability 
and relationships, induction, and 
succession planning. However, in other 
areas performance was not considered to 
be as strong, and progress had been slow 
in relation to last year’s Action Plan. As a 
result, this year members were clear that 
there were several key areas that would 
enable the Board to be more eff ective, 
challenge business performance, and drive 
strategic debate. 
The Board review was conducted in 
December 201 4 and January 201 5 when 
M&S’s performance was under particular 
scrutiny, with operational issues aff ecting 
the Castle Donington distribution centre 
and M&S.com. Given this context, members 
were particularly open, objective and 
critical with respect to Board performance 
and the potential changes that should 
be implemented to improve overall 
Board eff ectiveness. A number of these 
improvements have featured in previous 
years and primarily relate to information 
context, content and consistency, and 
debate around business and strategic risk. 
These now form the core of the 20 1 5/1 6 
Board action plan. 
Board Committees Board Committees 
were also reviewed and were all considered 
well run, challenging, structured, trusted 
and eff ective. Members noted that 
committees were improved in terms of 
quality of information and support from 
management. Feedback from each 
Committee meeting to the main Board was 
felt to be full and transparent, particularly 
in relation to Audit and Remuneration.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
REPORT
INTRODUCTION 
We have seen further change to our Board 
composition this year . I am pleased to 
welcome our new Chief Finance Offi  cer, 
Helen Weir . We announced Helen’s 
appointment in November 20 1 4 and she 
formally took up her position on 1 April 20 1 5. 
In August 20 1 4 we announced that 
Jan du Plessis would be stepping down in 
the early part of 20 1 5. He left the business on 
4 March after nearly six years on the Board. 
As part of our Board succession planning 
process, we have established mapping of our 
experience and skills requirements, future 
Board and Committee requirements, and 
director tenure. As a result, following Jan’s 
retirement, we were well placed to appoint 
Vindi Banga as Senior Independent Director , 
in addition to his responsibilities as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
and also appoint Miranda Curtis to the Audit 
Committee, in addition to her membership of 
the Remuneration Committee. Following the 
retirement of Steven Holliday from the Board 
in July 20 1 4, we recognised the beneﬁ ts that 
a serving CEO brings to our Board mix, along 
with international, brand and consumer 
experience. This clear brief underpinned 
the appointment of Richard Solomons to 
the Board in April 20 1 5. 
Vindi Banga succeeded Steven Holliday as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman. Vindi 
and Steve managed an exemplary handover , 
including consultation and meetings with 
investors ahead of the approval of our 
Remuneration Policy at the AGM in July 20 1 4. 
In addition to these Board changes, 
throughout the year , the Committee focused 
on executive director development and 
senior management talent development 
and pipeline. We have continued to support 
executive coaching and mentoring and are 
pleased with the beneﬁ ts and insights these 
initiatives have brought.
Building on initiatives in previous years, our 
non-executive directors continue to engage 
with both senior management and the 
broader business, hosting lunches and 
breakfast presentations. As highlighted in 
our Action Plan, this is something we intend 
to build on in the year ahead.
As a Board we continue to drive diversity 
across the business. We are pleased that 
women now represent almost 40% of our 
Board membership. Our current diversity 
percentage is also reﬂ ective of broader 
senior management, where female 
representation also accounts for almost 40%. 
We have an established mapping of the experience 
and skills requirements for our Board. This allowed us 
to move with clarity on the replacement and succession 
of Jan du Plessis as Senior Independent Director.

Independent review
The Committee’s performance was 
reviewed externally this year by Fﬁ on Hague 
of Independent Board Evaluation. 
Performance was felt to have improved, 
with better support and more professional 
processes coming into eff ect. We intend to 
build on this in the coming year with our 
20 1 5/1 6 Action Plan.
Nomination Committee activity 
We continued to refresh and review non-
executive director tenure and skillset to 
ensure an appropriate mix and diversity 
of experience. As part of this, we agreed 
the process, timetable, shortlist and ﬁ nal 
recommendation for the appointment of 
Richard Solomons and succession planning 
following the departure of Jan du Plessis. 
We continued to support succession and 
development of the executive directors, 
implemented development initiatives for 
senior executives, further international 
business school training, executive coaching 
and non-executive director mentoring. 
Committee members also participated in 
several employee-focused and diversity-
based initiatives, giving increased access to 
the organisation, direct employee feedback 
and greater visibility of high potential talent.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
Our assessment of diversity in terms of 
experience and background is covered in 
further detail below. We also reviewed our 
diversity policy this year to ensure it remains 
ﬁ t for purpose. 
BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY
Since the launch of the Board Diversity Policy 
in 20 1 2, the Board has made progress in 
broadening the diversity of the Board and 
senior management. In 20 1 4, the Board 
reviewed the policy to ensure that it 
continues to drive the beneﬁ ts of a diverse 
Board and workforce across the business. 
The Board agreed that the ambitions and 
objectives set out in the policy remain 
relevant targets against which to measure 
our progress.
 For further information on employee 
diversity, including gender, ethnicity 
and age, see p23 of our Plan A Report 
marksandspencer.com/plana2015.
BOARD DIVERSITY: PROGRESS UPDATE
Maintain a level of at least 30% female 
directors on the Board over the short to 
medium term. 
As highlighted earlier in the report, the Board 
made two appointments during the year 
following one retirement and one resignation. 
The appointments of Helen Weir and Richard 
Solomons increased the female/male 
balance on the Board from 3 1 % female 
membership at the start of July last year 
to 38% in April this year .
The Board remains committed to maintaining 
at least a 30% female representation on the 
Board, whilst ensuring that diversity in its 
broadest sense remains a central feature. 
However , the Nomination Committee will 
continue to recommend appointments 
to the Board based on merit, measured 
against objective criteria and the skills and 
experience the individual off ers.
The Board remains committed to 
strengthening the pipeline of senior female 
executives within the business and has taken 
steps to ensure that there are no barriers to 
women succeeding at the highest levels 
within M&S.
In 20 1 5, M&S was again listed in The Times 
T op 50 Employers for Women for the ﬁ fth 
year running.
Assist the development of a pipeline of 
high-calibre candidates by encouraging a 
broad range of senior individuals within the 
business to take on additional roles to gain 
valuable Board experience. 
During the year , the Board continued to 
focus on strengthening the pipeline of 
executive talent in the Company. It 
committed to learning and building on 
existing programmes while introducing new 
initiatives to broaden and develop the strong 
talent which exists across the business. 
Key initiatives include:
> A comprehensive talent review presented 
to the Board annually, mapping 
successional candidates and opportunities 
across all senior roles within the business.
> The Leadership Development Service has 
been in place for two years and continues 
to identify and partner key senior talent 
across the business, broadening their 
skillsets and experience to prepare them 
for future opportunities. This has been 
supported through greater boardroom 
exposure, non-executive and T rustee 
roles outside of M&S, and participation 
in mentoring schemes.
> Access to International Business 
School T raining.
> Senior management mentoring and 
coaching schemes, including individual 
leadership assessments, and non-
executive director sponsored lunches 
and breakfasts.
Consider candidates for appointment as 
non-executive directors from a wider pool, 
including those with little or no listed 
company board experience.
During the year , the Nomination Committee 
discussed the Board’s successional needs, 
and continues to work closely with executive 
search agency JCA in compiling long and 
short lists of candidates. During the search 
for the most recent appointments, the 
Board identiﬁ ed and interviewed a range of 
candidates from various backgrounds and 
industries, and all candidates were measured 
against criteria agreed at the start of the 
process. The Chairman also meets informally 
with a range of people introduced by third 
parties or through direct approaches. 
Although we do not currently openly 
advertise our non-executive director 
positions, we appreciate the beneﬁ t of this 
approach and will keep this under review.
Ensure long lists of potential 
non-executive directors include 50% 
female candidates. 
The Board remains committed to ensuring 
that high performing women from within the 
business and from a variety of backgrounds, 
who have the requisite skills, are given greater 
exposure to the nomination committees of 
FTSE 1 00 companies. Once again, the Board 
met its commitment, and all non-executive 
director long lists in 20 1 4/1 5 included 50% 
female candidates.
Only engage executive search ﬁ rms who 
have signed up to the voluntary Code 
of Conduct on gender diversity and 
best practice. 
The Board continues to support the nine 
principles of the Executive Search Firms 
Voluntary Code of Conduct on gender 
diversity, demonstrated by remaining 
committed to only engaging executive 
search ﬁ rms who are signatories to this code. 
During the year , we continued to work closely 
with JCA, and maintained our focus on 
the targets and ambitions around female 
representation on the Board. The Board 
conﬁ rms that JCA has no other connection 
with the Company.
Report annually against these objectives 
and other initiatives taking place within the 
Company which promote gender and other 
forms of diversity. 
The Board has made strong progress against 
the key policy objectives during the year , as 
reported above. 
In addition, the business has continued to 
promote diversity with the introduction or 
continuation of key initiatives:
> The annual Board evaluation process 
includes an assessment of the Board’s 
diversity including gender , helping to 
objectively consider its composition 
and eff ectiveness.
> The M&S Inspiring Women’s Network, 
launched in 20 1 4, continues to support the 
progress of women in our business, giving 
access to a range of role models, providing 
informal mentoring and networking 
opportunities, and creating a forum for 
discussion to explore and address the 
career challenges women face.
> T aking part in a number of pilot schemes 
including cross-business mentoring for 
senior women, run by the government -
backed 30% Club, a female only 
development programme. 
> The MBA Leadership Programme is in its 
fourth year , recruiting and developing 
talented MBA graduates from international 
business schools; to date intake into the 
programme has been over 50% women. 
> Partnering with a local school to provide 
one-to-one mentoring support for around 
50 female students between the ages of 
15 and 1 7 .
> A number of programmes to help people 
in our communities, including Marks & Start, 
Marks & Start Logistics, and Make Y our 
Mark, are successfully helping young 
people, the homeless, lone parents and 
those with disabilities, to ﬁ nd work in our 
stores and distribution centre.
Report annually on the outcome of the 
Board evaluation, the composition and 
structure of the Board as well as any issues 
and challenges the Board is facing when 
considering the diverse make-up of the 
Company. 
We continue to regard the Board evaluation 
process as an important means of monitoring 
our progress. Full details of the 20 1 4/1 5 Board 
evaluation and the Action Plan are on page 4 1 . 
We remain committed to getting the right 
balance of internal versus external hires and 
work towards understanding and managing 
some of the challenges we face, such as:
> International management experience 
reﬂ ective of the customers and 
communities we serve; and
> Any main challenges women face in 
reaching regional management positions 
and above, within the business. 44
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
ACCOUNTABILITY
RISK IN ACTION
Internal Audit & Risk comprises both the 
Group Risk function and Internal Audit. 
Group Risk facilitates and manages the risk 
process that is ultimately owned by the 
Group Board. Internal Audit, accountable 
to the Audit Committee, uses a risk-based 
approach to provide independent 
assurance over the adequacy and 
eff ectiveness of the control environment, 
including controls related to key risks 
on the Group Risk Proﬁ le. Management 
actions from all of our audits are tracked 
to completion and the status of these 
actions is reported to the Audit Committee 
to ensure that the risks identiﬁ ed are 
appropriately addressed. This will, in turn, 
further mitigate the risks included in our 
Group Risk Proﬁ le. 
The following examples illustrate how 
Internal Audit supports the business 
through driving improvements to our 
control environment and adding value 
in core business areas.
RISK: INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
In support of the Group’s international 
growth plans, Internal Audit reviewed the 
process to identify and approve new store 
locations, with a focus on Asia. The audit 
conﬁ rmed that we have a well deﬁ ned 
governance structure in place through the 
Property Board, from the review of initial 
new stores proposals, to the formal post-
investment reviews that measure actual 
performance against initial estimates. 
The audit highlighted an opportunity to 
improve the quality and consistency of data 
supporting these initial estimates prepared 
by the in-country teams, including greater 
alignment with the process for UK stores. 
This would support better decision-making 
and enable more eff ective comparison of 
proposals across countries. The audit also 
recommended more robust tracking of 
actions agreed at the post-investment 
reviews through to their completion, to 
drive proﬁ tability.
RISK: GM CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
The continuous improvement of our 
customers’ online experience is an 
important part of driving customer 
engagement. Following last year’s M&S.com 
website launch, Internal Audit reviewed the 
process to maintain product content online, 
including narrative product descriptions, 
photographic images, and the navigation 
paths supporting customer searches. 
Our review conﬁ rmed that robust review 
mechanisms are in place to minimise the 
risk of errors or omissions in product 
information on the website. However, 
in instances where data is missing or 
incorrect, delays in resolution can impact 
the timeliness with which products are 
launched online. The audit recommended 
clearer deﬁ nition of roles and 
responsibilities between the GM teams 
developing and buying the products, and 
the M&S.com team managing the website 
content, and a more structured “critical 
path” for product launches online.
RISK: IT CHANGE
In 201 4/1 5 new agreements were 
implemented with a number of third-party 
IT service providers, covering areas such as 
Infrastructure and Application Support 
and End User Computing. Eff ective 
management of our IT service providers is 
a key element of managing IT change risk, 
ensuring, for example, that IT changes 
are executed in line with M&S IT policies. 
Internal Audit conducted a review to assess 
the eff ectiveness of IT service provider 
management processes. The audit provided 
assurance that signiﬁ cant focus had been 
placed on the successful implementation 
of the new agreements. At  the time of the 
audit there was further work required to 
clearly deﬁ ne vendor management roles 
and responsibilities and to implement 
monitoring against all contractual service 
levels, both of which have subsequently 
been addressed.
RISK AND THE ROLE OF INTERNAL AUDIT
RISK INTERDEPENDENCY
We recognise that there is signiﬁ cant 
interdependency between our key risks.
This diagram, based on our current Group 
Risk Proﬁ le, highlights how changes to one 
risk could impact on those connected to it, 
and therefore on the Group Risk Proﬁ le as a 
whole. By understanding the relationship 
between our key risks, if they were to 
materialise, we are better placed to ensure 
that we are managing them appropriately 
and to understand the entirety of our 
risk exposure. 
The highlighted risks illustrate potential 
interdependent risk scenarios:
The success of our business is highly 
inﬂ uenced by our ability to retain quality 
individuals 10 . The loss of key product 
developers would impact our ability to 
provide a point of diff erence against our 
competitors in terms of quality, value and 
innovation 3 , whilst maintaining expertise 
in our Food technology team enables us to 
maintain high standards of food safety and 
integrity across our products and supply 
chain in an increasingly challenging 
environment 2 . Our customers tell us 
that they trust us to do the right thing. 
By maintaining these high standards of 
food safety and integrity, we continue to 
stand out from our competitors 3 .
Strong GM customer engagement 1 is 
inﬂ uenced by our ability to maximise 
product availability and provide customers 
with an effi  cient and reliable delivery 
proposition 12 . The robustness of the 
online business 7 will also impact this 
supply chain and logistics network, as  well 
as having a direct inﬂ uence on customer 
engagement through the provision of a 
reliable online experience. OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
This year, we have placed signiﬁ cant focus 
on developing our approach to risk appetite 
in line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. By expressing the types and amount 
of risk we are willing to take or accept to 
achieve our plan, we aim to support 
consistent, risk-informed decision-making 
across the Group.
Our starting point has been to deﬁ ne 
draft risk appetite statements for our 
principal risks, and for key decisions made 
by the Board. These statements provide 
parameters within which we typically 
expect the business to operate, facilitating 
structured consideration of the risk and 
reward trade-off  in the decisions we make 
and in how the Group conducts business. 
We have covered a wide range of risks from 
GM ethical sourcing and food safety and 
integrity, through to investment decisions 
and business resilience. Given the varied 
nature and diversity of such risks, there is no 
‘one size ﬁ ts all’ approach to establishing risk 
parameters. We believe that taking the 
time to get this right will yield the greatest 
beneﬁ ts to our business and as such we are 
currently working with management to 
deﬁ ne a draft set of risk statements which 
we will reﬁ ne over time to ensure that they 
best reﬂ ect what the Group stands for.
Providing clear parameters is important; 
however, it is essential that we also foster 
an environment where innovation and 
entrepreneurial activities thrive. At times, 
there may be merit in operating outside 
of these risk parameters but proposed 
exceptions will need to be escalated to 
senior management for debate and 
approval before activities commence, 
ensuring that appropriate mitigating 
controls are in place.
Once ﬁ nalised, our risk appetite statements 
will be incorporated into an operating 
framework, integrated with our existing 
Group Risk process, and used to monitor 
business activities and decision-making. 
We believe we have made good progress 
this year and risk appetite remains a key 
priority for the Board in 201 5/1 6.
Changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which came into eff ect 
in October 201 4, will require companies to 
state whether they believe they will be able 
to continue to operate and meet their 
liabilities, taking into account their current 
position and principal risks. Companies 
will need to state over what period they 
have made their assessment and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate. 
The assessed period must be longer than 
1 2 months and relative to business planning 
processes and how business performance 
is measured. 
On the surface this might appear to be a 
simple statement to make. However, the 
Code changes emphasise the need for an 
interconnected approach to assessing 
viability. The Board must take into account 
the Company’s business model (and the 
inputs which support it) and the strategy, 
ensuring that these are aligned with its risk 
appetite, supporting risk framework and the 
controls and activities in place to mitigate 
risk. The Code requires statements to be 
made as a ‘reasonable expectation’ rather 
than a certainty.
Whilst the Code changes are not applicable 
to M&S until next year’s Annual Report, 
elements of the Code change are aligned 
with the principles of integrated reporting. 
Both require some changes to a number 
of our ways of working and, as part of our 
commitment to producing an integrated 
report next year, we have already made 
progress. We are committed to ensuring 
that our response to the Code change is 
meaningful and adds value both within the 
business and to our stakeholders. The work 
we have in progress means that we are in a 
strong position to meet the requirements 
in next year’s Annual Report.

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT
INTRODUCTION 
The following pages aim to open up the 
doors to the boardroom and provide 
insight into the Audit Committee’s activities 
in the year, as well as provide an update 
on the Company’s new statutory auditor 
(Deloitte), their eff ectiveness and the non-
audit fees they received. It provides the 
Committee’s opinion on the Annual Report 
when viewed as a whole, including how it 
has assessed the narrative reporting in the 
front of the report to accurately reﬂ ect the 
ﬁ nancial statements in the back.
This report also shares some of the insight 
we received from the executive updates 
presented to us from across the business. 
These continue to provide the Committee 
with real insight into our challenges and 
aspirations. These also tell us how the risks 
are being managed and mitigated, as well 
as helping the Committee members 
understand the progress being made 
towards the strategic plan. The updates 
provide us with an opportunity to 
challenge, discuss and debate with the 
presenters whilst sharing our experience 
and providing an independent perspective.
In October 2014, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code was updated. The 
Committee is looking closely at the 
additional requirements introduced by 
the new iteration of the Code to assess 
which of our processes need updating 
and to ensure that we are well positioned 
to report against them in future.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board is satisﬁ ed that one member 
of the Committee, Andy Halford, has 
recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience.
Independent review 
The Audit Committee’s performance 
was reviewed externally this year by 
Fﬁ on Hague of Independent Board 
Evaluation, as part of the Board 
Eff ectiveness Review. The Committee 
received very positive feedback from Board 
members and external participants. It is 
seen as open, transparent and eff ective and 
Board members value the feedback to the 
wider Board. In particular, the Committee is 
seen to have driven some improvement in 
the business response to internal audits 
and the overall quality of information 
provided to members. The Committee 
made good progress against the 201 4/1 5 
Action Plan, establishing good ways of 
working with Deloitte and improving the 
risk oversight in key business areas that 
were critical to performance. 
Audit Committee activity
> Remained focused on the audit, 
assurance and risk processes within 
the business, and maintained oversight 
of ﬁ nancial and other regulatory 
requirements.

assurance following appointment of 
Deloitte as the new Statutory Auditor.
> Updated the process for assessing the 
eff ectiveness of the external auditor.

Action plan 2015/16:
Looking ahead, the Committee will 
remain focused on the audit, assurance 
and risk processes within the business, 
and maintain its oversight of ﬁ nancial 
and other regulatory requirements. 
The action plan for 2015/16 will focus on:
> Providing oversight of key business 
risks with particular focus on 
International retail and ethical sourcing;
> Supporting risk work achieved in 
2014/15 and deﬁ nitions of risk 
appetite across the business; and
> Continuing to support the 
development, design and scope of 
the assurance plan, with particular 
focus on key strategic priorities.
The Committee has covered much ground this year 
with the auditor transition, a wider and enhanced 
assurance scope and greater risk oversight. 
We plan to build on this in the year ahead.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
TENURE OF THE AUDITORS 
At the AGM last year shareholders 
approved the appointment of Deloitte 
as the Company’s new Statutory Auditor.
The proposed change in auditor was 
communicated to shareholders in 
December 201 3. This extended lead time 
provided a smooth handover process from 
PwC, the previous Statutory Auditor, and 
allowed Deloitte to shadow PwC through 
areas of the 2014 year end process, 
giving them a good understanding of 
the business.
In the early part of the year, Deloitte 
underwent a thorough induction process 
to enhance their understanding of the 
business. This included: 
> Meetings with management and 
executives across the business including 
a large number of individuals outside of 
the ﬁ nance function (trading managers, 
buyers, property team, HR and others).
> A number of site visits across the UK 
and International operations; including 
16 UK distribution centres, 27 UK stores 
(including audit partner attendance 
at a stock count), operations in nine 
overseas countries (China, Hong Kong, 
India, Turkey, Greece, Czech, France, 
Netherlands and Ireland).
In addition, Deloitte have participated in 
workshops on material and judgemental 
areas prior to their ﬁ rst half year review. 
The Company and Deloitte adopted a 
collaborative approach throughout 
the year, encouraging ongoing, open 
communication on current matters as 
and when they arose.
NON-AUDIT FEES
A robust auditor engagement policy 
is in place and adhered to. It is 
reviewed annually and disclosed on 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
In the interest of transparency, last year 
we highlighted that business forecasting 
and planning indicated that fees for non-
audit work with Deloitte were likely to be 
impacted by additional items, much of 
which were a direct result of the transition 
between audit ﬁ rms. 
Deloitte had provided several non-audit 
services to the business prior to their 
appointment and, although many of these 
were complete by March 2014, some were 
expected to run over into the 2014/15 
ﬁ nancial year whilst they were tendered 
to another ﬁ rm. Where non-audit work is 
performed by Deloitte, both the Company 
and Deloitte ensure robust processes to 
prevent auditor independence from being 
compromised.
> The non-audit fees to audit fees ratio 
for the year was 0.49:1. Of this £0.5m 
related to services now transitioned 
to other companies (overseas payroll, 
accountancy and tax compliance 
services and two other small one-off  
projects). 
> All non-audit work performed by Deloitte 
was put to the Audit Committee for 
consideration and approval, regardless 
of size.
The Committee believes the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor 
and the eff ectiveness of the audit process 
are safeguarded and remain strong, and 
recommends the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP for the 2015/16 ﬁ nancial year.
The assessment of the eff ectiveness of our 
external auditor is based on a framework 
divided into ten structured components 
setting out the key areas of the audit process 
for the Audit Committee to consider, as well 
as the role that management has contributed 
to an eff ective process. 
The framework provides the Audit 
Committee with a mechanism to encourage 
management to improve standards in a 
number of key areas. These include ensuring 
that information is presented with a culture 
of ‘right ﬁ rst time’, that the quality of 
management papers is high, that robust 
internal systems and controls are maintained, 
that the audit process is respected and 
valued by the management team, and that 
proposed audit adjustments are examined 
seriously. The Committee believes that this 
framework provides a robust process for 
monitoring auditor eff ectiveness now, and 
can be measured against the ﬁ ndings of 
future external auditor eff ectiveness surveys.
For 20 1 4/1 5 we tailored the approach to 
the assessment process enabling senior 
management to answer the detailed 
questions on the Company-wide audit 
process, and provide the Audit Committee 
with suffi  cient detail to establish an informed 
view on the overall effi  ciency, integrity and 
eff ectiveness of the external audit. 
Questionnaires were tailored to the 
following target groups:
1. Chief Finance Offi  cer and Director of 
Group Financial Control A full questionnaire, 
covering all areas of the audit process, was 
completed based on the individual’s close 
knowledge of the audit process, their 
interaction with the audit partner and 
taking consideration of the questionnaire 
completed by the Heads of Finance for Food, 
GM and International.
2. Heads of Finance: Food, GM and 
International Shorter questionnaire, focusing 
on the audit team, planning, challenge and 
interaction with the business. 
3. Audit Committee A high level set of 
questions with speciﬁ c focus on the audit 
partner, planning, execution, value, 
communication and challenge. The 
Committee had access to copies of the 
completed ﬁ nance questionnaires (sections 1 
and 2 above) to assist their considerations. 
WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME?
As this is Deloitte’s ﬁ rst year with M&S, the 
Committee was only able to assess their 
work up until the end of the ﬁ nancial period 
and not the year end audit itself. However, 
the period assessed included the interim 
reporting cycle, providing Committee 
members with early insight into the level of 
challenge and scrutiny Deloitte provide. 
Feedback highlighted:
> A good understanding of the business and 
its values;
> A team that were robustly challenging, 
whilst supportive on technical matters; and
> A joined up approach towards the 
signiﬁ cant issues for discussion.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Last year’s feedback identiﬁ ed:
The Committee Chairman was felt to have 
greater visibility of the overall audit process 
as a result of his one-to-one meetings with 
the audit partner.
The survey itself contained a level of detail 
regarding processes that the Committee 
may not have or need visibility of.
How has this been addressed?
Time has been made available prior to 
each Committee meeting for the Chairman 
to update Committee members, where 
necessary, on his discussions.
The content of the survey has been 
reviewed and updated. An overview of 
the new process is provided above. 48

AUDIT COMMITTEE UPDATES
The Audit Committee has assessed whether 
suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate judgements and estimates.
Throughout the year, the ﬁ nance team has 
worked closely with Deloitte to ensure that 
the business is transparent and provides 
the required level of disclosure regarding 
signiﬁ cant issues considered by the 
Committee in relation to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, as well as how these issues 
were addressed, whilst being mindful of 
matters that may be business sensitive. 
The main areas of judgement that have been 
considered by the Committee to ensure that 
appropriate rigour has been applied are outlined 
in this section. All accounting policies can be 
found in note 1 on pages 94 to 97 . Where 
further information is provided in the notes to 
the ﬁ nancial statements, we have included the 
note reference. 
Each of the areas of judgement below has 
been identiﬁ ed as an area of focus and 
therefore the Committee has also received 
detailed reporting from Deloitte.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, 
BRANDS AND TANGIBLE ASSETS
The Committee has considered the 
assessments made in r elation t o the impairment 
of goodwill, brands and tangible ﬁ xed assets, 
including land and buildings and store assets. 
The Committee received detailed reports 
from management outlining the treatment of 
impairments where we are committed to close 
a store, valuation methodology, the basis for 
key assumptions (discount rate and long-term 
growth rate) and the key drivers of the cash 
ﬂ ow forecasts. The Committee has challenged 
management and is satisﬁ ed that these 
are appropriate. The Committee has also 
understood the sensitivity analysis used by 
management in their review of goodwill and 
brand impairment. In addition, the business 
plans detailing management’s expectations 
of future performance of the businesses are 
Board approved. The Committee is satisﬁ ed 
that no impairment of goodwill or brand is 
required and appropriate impairment of 
tangible assets has been recognised. 
 See notes 14 and 15 on page 110-111
INVENTORY VALUATION 
AND PROVISIONING
Inventory provisions include stock in transit, 
obsolete stock, net realisable value below cost 
and stock loss provisions. The Committee 
has examined in detail management papers 
outlining the judgements made regarding 
provisioning for inventory balances and is 
satisﬁ ed that a suffi  ciently robust process was 
followed to conﬁ rm quantities of inventory 
and that net realisable value of inventory 
exceeds its cost at year end.

PRESENTATION OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee gave consideration to the 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements and in 
particular the presentation of the Non-GAAP 
measures in accordance with the Group 
accounting policy. This policy states that 
adjustments are only made to reported proﬁ t 
before tax where income and charges are 
one-off  in nature, signiﬁ cant, and distort the 
Group’s underlying performance. In the 
current year, management has included 
proﬁ t on property disposal, one-off  pension 
credits, interest income on tax repayments, 
restructuring costs, international store 
review, fair value movement of embedded 
derivatives, strategic programme costs and 
the reduction in M&S Bank income for the 
impact of the ﬁ nancial product mis-selling 
provision within this category . The Committee 
has concluded that this presentation is 
appropriate.  See note 5 on p100
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Committee has reviewed the actuarial 
assumptions such as discount rate, inﬂ ation 
rate, expected return of scheme assets and 
mortality which determine the pension cost 
and the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme valuation, 
and has concluded that they are appropriate. 
The assumptions have been disclosed in the 
ﬁ nancial statements.  See note 11 on p104
REVENUE RECOGNITION IN 
RELATION TO REFUNDS, GIFT CARDS 
AND LOYALTY SCHEMES
Revenue accruals for sales returns and 
deferred income in relation to loyalty scheme 
redemptions and gift card and credit voucher 
redemptions are estimated based on historical 
returns and redemptions. The Committee 
has considered the basis of these accruals, 
along with analysis of historical returns and 
redemption rates and has agreed with the 
judgements reached by management.
SUPPLIER INCOME (NEW DISCLOSURE)
The Committee has considered the 
assessment made by management over the 
accounting for supplier rebate arrangements 
and has been actively involved in reviewing 
the Group’s controls in place in this area. 
The Committee has reviewed in detail 
management’s paper, which set out the 
nature and value of these arrangements 
and the timing of recognition in the ﬁ nancial 
statements, along with the related Internal 
Audit ﬁ ndings reported. The Committee is 
satisﬁ ed with management’s conclusion that 
there is no risk of material misstatement in the 
current and previous period. In addition, 
the Committee decided to enhance the 
disclosures in relation t o supplier inc ome by 
publishing the accounting policy and disclosing 
the eff ects of supplier income on certain 
balance sheet accounts.  See note 17 on p112
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
has considered whether, in its opinion, the 
20 1 4/1 5 Annual Report and Financial 
Statements is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and whether it provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
As the Chairman advised in his opening 
statement, the structure of the report has 
been updated this year to provide greater 
focus on the key strategic messages in the 
Strategic Report. Therefore, it was important 
for the Committee to ensure these changes 
did not dilute the level of transparency 
in disclosure that we know is useful for 
stakeholders, and that the business 
continued to provide a clear message that 
was reﬂ ective of the Company as a whole.
A broad outline of the proposed changes 
to the Annual Report was given to the 
Committee early in the planning process, 
along with a similarly broad indication of 
content. The Committee received a full draft 
of the report some two weeks prior to the 
meeting at which it would be requested 
to provide its ﬁ nal opinion. Feedback was 
provided by the Committee in advance of 
that meeting, highlighting any areas where 
the Committee believed further clarity was 
required. The draft report was then amended 
to incorporate this feedback prior to being 
tabled at the  Audit Committee meeting for 
ﬁ nal comment and approval.
The Committee was provided with a list of the 
key messages included in the Annual Report, 
highlighting which were positive and which 
were reﬂ ective of the challenges from the 
year. A supporting document was also 
provided speciﬁ cally addressing the following 
listed points, highlighting where these could 
be evidenced in the report.
When forming its opinion, the Committee 
reﬂ ected on the information it had received 
and its discussions throughout the year. 
In particular, the Committee considered: 
IS THE REPORT FAIR? 
> Is the whole story presented and has 
any sensitive material been omitted that 
should have been included? 
> Is the reporting on the business segments 
in the narrative reporting consistent with 
those used for the ﬁ nancial reporting in 
the ﬁ nancial statements? 
> Are the key messages in the narrative 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial reporting?
> Are the KPIs disclosed at an appropriate 
level based on the ﬁ nancial reporting? 
IS THE REPORT BALANCED? 
> Is there a good level of consistency 
between the narrative reporting in the 
front and the ﬁ nancial reporting in 
the back of the report, and does the 
messaging reﬂ ected in each remain 
consistent when read independently 
of each other?
> Is the Annual Report properly a document 
for shareholders?
> Are the statutory and adjusted measures 
explained clearly with appropriate 
prominence? 
> Are the key judgements referred to in 
the narrative reporting and the signiﬁ cant 
issues reported in this Audit Committee 
Report consistent with the disclosures 
of key estimation uncertainties and 
critical judgements set out in the 
ﬁ nancial statements? 
> How do these compare with the risks that 
Deloitte plan to include in their report? 
IS THE REPORT UNDERSTANDABLE? 
> Is there a clear and understandable 
framework to the report? 
> Are the important messages highlighted 
appropriately throughout the document? 
> Is the layout clear with good linkage 
throughout in a manner that reﬂ ects 
the whole story?
CONCLUSION 
Following its review, the Committee was of 
the opinion that the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts is representative of the 
year and presents a fair, balanced and

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
ACCOUNTABILITY
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Board assumes ultimate responsibility 
for the eff ective management of risk across 
the Group, determining its risk appetite and 
tolerance as well as ensuring that each 
business area implements appropriate internal 
controls. The Group’s risk management 
systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
 See p23-25 of the Strategic Report for more 
information on our material risks. 
 See p44-45 for further information on our 
risk management processes. 
The key features of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems 
that ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
ﬁ nancial reporting include clearly deﬁ ned 
lines of accountability and delegation of 
authority, policies and procedures that 
cover ﬁ nancial planning and reporting, 
preparing consolidated accounts, capital 
expenditure, project governance and 
information security, and the Group’s 
Code of Ethics and Behaviours.
The Board has delegated responsibility 
for reviewing the eff ectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal control to the 
Audit Committee. This covers all material 
controls including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
systems. The Committee is supported by a 
number of sources of internal assurance 
from within the Group in order to complete 
these reviews, in particular:
1. Internal Audit & Risk The Group’s 
primary source of internal assurance 
remains delivery of the Internal Audit 
Plan, which is structured to align with the 
Group’s strategic priorities and key risks 
and is developed by Internal Audit & 
Risk with input from management. 
Recommendations from Internal Audit & 
Risk are communicated to the relevant 
business area for implementation of 
appropriate corrective measures, with 
results reported to the Committee.
2. Business Presentations Focusing primarily 
on the key risks identiﬁ ed in the Group Risk 
Proﬁ le, management continues to provide 
updates to the Committee on how these 
are managed in individual business areas. 
These are complemented by independent 
reviews conducted by Internal Audit & Risk.
3. Other control agencies Responsible for 
maintaining control over critical areas of 
risk, the processes and controls of these 
agencies are tested by Internal Audit & Risk 
during relevant audits. An overview of these 
agencies and the manner in which they 
provide assurance to the Committee is 
indicated in the table below. 
The Group was compliant throughout 
the year with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code relating to 
internal controls and the FRC’s revised 
Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control. 
No signiﬁ cant failings or weaknesses were 
identiﬁ ed during the Committee’s review 
in respect of the year ended 28 March 2015 
and up to the date of this Annual Report. 
Where the Committee identiﬁ ed areas 
requiring improvement, processes are in 
place to ensure that the necessary action 
is taken and that progress is monitored. 
Further details of these processes 
can be found within our detailed 
Corporate Governance Statement 
which is available to view in the 
Corporate Governance section of

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
ROBERT SWANNELL CHAIRMAN
As indicated earlier in this report, in 2014 we 
refreshed our core business values as part 
of our drive to ensure that our business is 
ﬁ t for the future. These values, Inspiration, 
Innovation, Integrity and In Touch, are not 
in themselves entirely new to M&S; rather, 
we have placed them at the heart of our 
business as the essential behaviours 
through which we aim to make everyday 
life better for customers, employees and 
investors alike. The latter of these four 
values, In Touch, complements our attitude 
towards engaging with our investors as we 
believe that the foundation of our strong 
relationship with them lies in regular, open 
dialogue. Ensuring that we are in touch 
means we are always available to discuss 
particular areas of the business and to 
address any concerns they might have. 
This year, the business had over 566 contacts 
with over 3 1 6 separately identiﬁ able institutions 
via one-to-one or group meetings hosted 
by an executive director or our Investor 
Relations team. Additionally, I hosted the 
annual M&S Governance Event. Details for 
this year’s event are provided in the box on 
the right. 
We held an investor event in Paris, providing 
an update on our International strategy, 
and a seminar on the development of our 
multi-channel capabilities. Presentations 
at these events are made by directors or 
senior managers and off er investors more 
in-depth information on the progress being 
made towards our strategic goals. No new, 
material ﬁ nancial information is disclosed at 
these events and no additional statements 
are made regarding current trading 
performance. The slides from the 
presentations are available to view at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
To understand the views and opinions of 
our private investors outside of the AGM, 
we engage with a number of leading client 
brokers who typically represent our private 
shareholder base. For an independent 
view, Makinson Cowell, the capital markets 
advisory ﬁ rm, continues to provide 
guidance to our Investor Relations team 
and undertake an annual audit of our 
major investors’ views on the Company’s 
management and performance. The 
results are presented to the Board.
AMANDA MELLOR GROUP SECRETARY
In last year’s report, I spoke of the 
importance of maintaining our trusted 
relationship with our shareholders and 
outlined my role, as Company Secretary, 
in engaging with stakeholders on a variety 
of governance matters. These remain as 
intrinsically important as ever and, over 
the course of the year, I have again had 
discussions with a number of investors and 
representative bodies. I am also tasked with 
safeguarding the important relationship 
with our private investors, who are some of 
our most loyal customers, and for whom 
we have introduced a new loyalty scheme 
this year in partnership with our registrar, 
Equiniti.  See more on page p128.
We must also recognise that our unique 
heritage positions us to engage more widely 
beyond the traditional stakeholder group. 
This is well illustrated by our acclaimed 
Company Archive, which was relocated in 
201 2 to a purpose built facility within the 
campus of the University of Leeds and 
houses a collection of over 70,000 items 
from the Company’s past. The facility’s 
award-winning ‘Marks In Time’ exhibition 
opens up our heritage to customers, schools 
and the wider community. It has received 
thousands of visitors, including over 8,000 
school pupils aged between 5 and 1 8, who 
took part in a range of educational sessions. 
Demand from schools is overwhelming and 
is met by our Education Offi  cer who works 
with Heritage Ambassadors across our stores 
to share the history of M&S, Plan A and the 
environment, with their local community. 
The archive’s education programme has 
received the prestigious Sandford Award for 
excellence in heritage education and Visit 
England’s VAQAS award for the quality of its 
visitor off er.
The relocation of the archive laid the 
foundation for a broader partnership with 
the University of Leeds, encouraging close 
collaboration in areas ranging from design, 
food technology and product innovation 
to business management and law. The 
partnership is also a fantastic medium 
through which to articulate our values; for 
example, we have worked with the University 
to produce a free, online educational course 
on innovation, which was a huge success 
and reached almost 1 5,000 people. For my 
part, I am proud to help strengthen this 
partnership as a member of the University 
Council and to promote the importance of 
ethical leadership as a visiting professor of 
the University’s Ethics Centre.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION
REMUNERATION 
OVERVIEW
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration Report for 
201 4/1 5, my ﬁ rst as the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Following the 
new reporting regulations adopted last year, 
this report is split into two distinct sections. 
Although we are not required to include the 
policy report approved by shareholders 
last year, the Committee has decided to 
continue to do so in order to maintain full, 
transparent reporting. For easy reference, 
we have included a ‘summary’ of the 
remuneration policy on pages 54 to 60. 
Information on the policy since its approval 
last year is shown on pages 60 and 6 1.
Our remuneration framework is designed to 
support and drive our strategy, and ensure 
our business is run by high-quality leaders 
with the skills and expertise necessary to 
deliver our long-term business priorities.
The Committee made good progress 
against the action plan it set itself last year. 
As planned, the Committee reviewed and 
retendered the independent external 
advisers to the Committee following the 
appointment of Deloitte as the Company’s 
auditor. After an extensive process, PwC 
was appointed to advise the Committee.
REMUNERATION REVIEW AND 
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
This year, and with PwC’s support, we 
undertook a thorough review of the current 
executive remuneration framework and 
targets to ensure they remained aligned 
with the strategic business priorities and 
were balanced against the Company-wide 
remuneration off ering. The Committee 
was particularly keen to ensure that the 
incentive arrangements remained 
suffi  ciently motivating for management to 
deliver while encouraging the behaviours, 
values and ethics which underpin Fit for the 
Future and the way we do business at M&S.
The timing of this review was also linked to 
our requirement to renew our existing share 
plans, as outlined last year. The Committee 
has reviewed the Plan rules and framework, 
along with changes in market practice and 
feedback from stakeholders. Overall, the 
Committee concluded that while the 
structure of the framework remains 
appropriate, it is time to refresh some 
elements within the Performance Share 
Plan in order to provide an even clearer ﬁ t 
with the business’s current strategic 
priorities, following four years of intensive 
investment and transformation. The Plan 
will continue to retain the metrics of EPS 
and ROCE and their associated weightings 
of 50% and 20% respectively. 
The ﬁ nancial strategic scorecard element 
will retain targets for International and 
M&S.com sales as before as we continue to 
grow these areas of the business, but will 
now include targets for two key business 
priorities of GM gross margin growth and 
the delivery of free cash ﬂ ow, as set out in 
the Company’s key performance indicators. 
While these amendments are within the 
parameters of the remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders at last year’s 
AGM, we value the views of, and input from, 
our shareholders and therefore consulted 
with them on the proposed amendments 
and associated targets for the 201 5/1 6 
awards. As a result, we believe the proposed 
changes and targets are timely and 
appropriate and will ensure the awards 
remain stretching but motivating for the 
senior management team.
CLAWBACK
In updating the associated plan rules, the 
Committee has also taken the opportunity 
to introduce clawback in line with updated 
UK corporate governance guidance. 
Clawback provisions will apply to any 
bonus awards in 201 6 and beyond and 
under any of the Company’s executive share 
schemes from 201 5 onwards. Details of this 
are provided on page 60.
KEY POINTS FOR THE YEAR
Salary review
Executive director salaries were reviewed 
and discussed by the Committee during 
the year. The Committee took into account 
the salary review applicable for the rest of 
the organisation and directors’ individual 
performance when assessing the 
appropriateness of any increase. The 
Committee was also mindful that the 
executive directors had requested not to 
receive an increase last year, despite a 2% 
average pay review for the business. Further, 
the annual salary review date has been 
moved from January to July to ﬁ t better 
with the annual performance cycle. In line 
with previous years, Marc Bolland has again, 
at his own request, not received an increase. 
He has not received a salary increase since 
his appointment in 2010. The highest 
increase has been awarded to Steve Rowe 
in recognition of his strong performance 
over the period. However, while there is 
some variation in salary increase across the 
executive directors, the resulting average 
salary increase awarded to the executive 
directors as a group is in line with the rest 
of the organisation and the market median 
for the same period since the last review. 
Further details of the directors’ salary 
increases are shown on page 63. 
Our new Chief Finance Offi  cer, Helen Weir 
joined the Board on 1 April, after our year 
end on 28  March, and was not eligible for 
this salary review. We provide full details 
of her recruitment arrangement and future 
pay on page  73. 
Our remuneration framework is designed 
to ensure M&S is run with the skills and 
expertise necessary to deliver our 
long-term priorities.

Performance-related payments
The Committee also reviewed the 
performance of both the business and each 
director against targets set at the beginning 
of the year for the Annual Bonus Scheme. 
This year, the business met its corporate 
Proﬁ t Before Tax (PBT) target and a bonus 
was paid across the organisation. 
The bonus payments outlined on page 64 
reﬂ ect both the delivery against corporate 
or business area targets and the progress 
made by each director against their speciﬁ c 
individual objectives. Underlying Group 
PBT at £66 1.2m was above the minimum 
threshold of £650m at which level payments 
against ﬁ nancial targets were triggered 
for directors. Performance against the 
Company’s overall Plan A targets was also 
taken into consideration by the Committee 
in determining the resulting outturn for 
each director. The Committee undertook a 
rigorous review of the achievement against 
ﬁ nancial and individual objectives to ensure 
the level of bonus payment was appropriate 
and fair given the overall business 
performance. The highest bonus payment 
was made to Steve Rowe, Executive 
Director, Food at c.60% of maximum bonus 
opportunity reﬂ ecting strong performance 
in the Food business. The other bonus 
payments range from 1 8% to around 30% 
of maximum. 
The Performance Share Plan awards 
granted in 201 2 were measured for the 
three-year period up to 28 March 201 5 
against challenging Earnings per Share 
(EPS), Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) 
and Revenue targets. As a result of 
performance against these targets, 
executive directors will receive only 4.7% 
of the original award when it vests in 201 5.

This report sets out the Company’s policy 
on remuneration for executive and non-
executive directors, and was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 8 July 201 4. 
The policy remains unchanged from that 
disclosed in recent ﬁnancial years. It took 
eff ect from 8 July 201 4 and may operate 
for up to three years.
The Committee has therefore built in a 
degree of ﬂexibility to ensure the practical 
application of the policy over this period. 
Where such discretion is reserved, the 
extent to which it may be applied is 
described.
The Company’s policy remains to attract, 
retain and motivate its leaders and ensure 
they are focused on delivering business 
priorities within a framework designed to 
promote the long-term success of M&S, 
aligned with shareholder interests.
The directors’ remuneration policy has 
been republished on pages 54 to 60 with 
no alterations, with the exception of the 
remuneration illustrations which have been 
updated to accurately reﬂ ect the directors’ 
remuneration for 201 5/1 6 (see page 6 1 ). In 
addition, further information regarding the 
implementation of this policy which does 
not require shareholder approval is set out 
on page 60.

FIGURE 2: POLICY TABLE
Executive directors may be in receipt of 
awards under share plans outside of the 
current remuneration framework detailed 
on pages 54 to 55; these may have been 
awarded upon recruitment or prior to their 
appointment as an executive director. 
While awards under these plans do not 
form part of an executive director’s annual 
remuneration, for transparency, details of 
the plans are set out in the table below.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Laura Wade-Gery has unexercised RSP 
awards which were made in connection 
with her appointment to compensate her 
for incentive awards that were forfeited on 
cessation from her previous employer.
Steve Rowe has unexercised ESOS awards 
which were made prior to his appointment 
as executive director.
The Committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments 
notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the policy set out above where 
the terms of the payment were agreed 
(i) before this policy was in force or (ii) at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a 
director of the Company and, in the opinion 
of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration of the individual becoming a 
director of the Company. 
For these purposes, payments include the 
Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are 
agreed at the time the award is granted.
Awards granted under the PSP , DSBP and 
RSP can be made in the form of conditional 
share awards, forfeitable shares, options 
or rights with the same economic eff ect. 
In addition, awards may be settled in cash. 
Awards may incorporate the right to receive 
(in cash or shares) the value of dividends, 
including any dividend tax credit, between 
grant and vesting on the shares that vest. 
This amount may be calculated on 
a cumulative basis, assuming the 
reinvestment of dividends into shares.
In the event of a variation of the Company’s 
share capital or a demerger, special dividend 
or other event which in the Committee’s 
opinion may aff ect the price of shares, the 
Committee may alter the terms of awards 
and the number of shares subject to them. 
The terms of awards may be amended in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules 
(which in the case of the PSP and the 
ESOS were approved by shareholders 
on 1 3 July 2005).
Any performance conditions applicable to 
PSP and ESOS awards may be amended by 
the Committee if an event occurs which 
causes it to consider that the performance 
condition would not achieve its original 
purpose and the amended performance 
condition is, in the opinion of the 
Committee, no less difﬁcult to satisfy 
but for the event in question.

FIGURE 3: RECRUITMENT POLICY 
RECRUITMENT POLICY
The table below sets out the Company’s 
policy on the recruitment of new executive 
directors. Similar considerations may also 
apply where a director is promoted within 
the Board.
In addition, the Committee in exceptional 
circumstances has discretion to include any 
other remuneration component or award 
which it feels is appropriate, taking into 
account the speciﬁc circumstances of the 
individual, subject to the limit on variable 
remuneration set out below. The rationale 
for any such component would be 
appropriately disclosed. For example, for 
internal promotional appointments to the 
Board, the Committee would honour any 
pre-existing contractual remuneration 
arrangements; these arrangements 
may be outside of the policy detailed 
on pages 54 to 55.
SERVICE CONTRACTS 
It is the Company’s policy that all executive 
directors have rolling service contracts 
that can be terminated by the Company 
giving 1 2 months’ notice and the employee 
giving six months’ notice. The directors’ 
service contracts are available for 
shareholder inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁce.
TERMINATION POLICY
The Company may terminate the contract 
of any executive director summarily in 
accordance with the terms of their service 
agreement, on payment in lieu of notice of 
a sum equal to salary, beneﬁts and pension 
as per their contractual notice entitlement 
(see page 73). 
The Company can make a series of phased 
payments which are paid in monthly 
instalments and subject to mitigation. 
This mechanism allows for the amount of 
any phased payments to be reduced by 
the income from any alternative position 
secured by the former director during the 
phased payments period.
Service agreements may be terminated 
without notice and without any payments 
in certain circumstances, such as gross 
misconduct. The Company may require the 
individual to work during their notice period, 
or may choose to place the individual on 
garden leave. Such a decision would be 
made to ensure the protection of the 
Company’s and shareholders’ interests 
where the individual has had access to 
commercially sensitive information.
The table overleaf sets out key provisions 
for directors leaving the Company under 
their service contracts and the incentive 
plan rules.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 58
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION POLICY 
CONTINUED
The Company’s policy toward exit payments 
allows for a variety of circumstances 
whereby a director may leave the business. 
In some cases, where deemed suitable, the 
Committee reserves the right to determine 
exit payments, where the director leaves 
by mutual agreement. In all circumstances, 
the Committee does not intend to ‘reward 
failure’ and will make decisions based on the 
individual circumstances. The Committee’s 
objective is that any such agreements are 
determined on an individual basis and are 
in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders at that time, and reﬂect the 
director’s contractual and other legal rights.
CORPORATE EVENTS
In the event of a change of control or 
winding-up of the Company, unvested share 
awards will normally vest on the date that 
the Board notiﬁes participants of such an 
event. The number of shares which may 
vest under awards in these circumstances 
will be subject to any relevant performance 
conditions and, in the case of PSP awards, 
unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, time prorating.
In the event of a demerger, special dividend 
or other event which, in the opinion of the 
Committee aff ects the price of shares, the 
Committee may allow some or all of an 
award to vest.
MALUS PROVISIONS
All share awards granted in 201 3 onwards 
are subject to malus provisions. These 
provisions allow the Committee, in its 
absolute discretion, to determine at any 
time prior to the vesting of an award to 
reduce the number of shares, cancel an 
award or impose further conditions on 
an award in circumstances which the 
Committee considers such action to be 
appropriate. Such circumstances may 
include, but not be limited to, a material 
misstatement of the Company’s 
audited results.
CONSIDERATION OF WIDER 
WORKFORCE PAY
The Committee monitors and reviews the 
eff ectiveness of the senior remuneration 
policy and has regard to its impact and 
compatibility with remuneration policies 
in the wider workforce.
The Committee is provided throughout 
the year with information detailing pay in 
the wider workforce which gives additional 
context for the Committee to make 
informed decisions. The Director of 
Human Resources advises the Committee 
of the approach which will be adopted 
with the forthcoming UK pay review and 
the Committee then considers the 
executive directors’ pay review in line 
with these arrangements.
The Director of Human Resources consults 
on all executive director bonus objectives 
and advises the Committee on how, and the 
extent to which, these may be cascaded 
throughout the Company. In approving 
the budget for the annual bonus, the 
Committee reviews all bonus costs for 
the Company against the operating plan. 
The Committee also reviews and approves 
any PSP awards made to executive directors 
and directors below the Board prior to 
their grant.
The Committee also receives updates on a 
variety of employee engagement initiatives 
which form part of our normal employee 
engagement practices. The annual ‘Your 
Say’ employee survey asks employees 
about the fairness and reasonableness of 
employee pay and beneﬁts. Any comments 
made through this survey or through 
our network of elected employee 
representatives via our Business 
Involvement Groups are taken into account. 
The Head of Reward & Global Mobility 
annually provides these employee 
representatives with an explanation of the 
Company’s reward principles and director 
pay arrangements during the year, and is 
available to answer questions at this time.

Payment will be made up to the termination date in line with relevant contractual notice periods.
There is no contractual entitlement to annual bonus. Should a director be under notice or not in active service at either the 
relevant year end or on the date of payment, awards (including any outstanding unvested deferred bonus shares) may lapse. 
The Committee may use its discretion as described below to make a bonus award, which is normally prorated for time and based 
on performance assessed at the end of the bonus period.
Where a director ceases to be an ofﬁcer or employee of the Group before the end of the relevant period, the treatment of outstanding 
awards is determined in accordance with the plan rules.
In some circumstances, where a director leaves due to retirement, injury, ill-health, death or the sale of the director’s employing 
company or business out of the Group, or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee and in accordance with the plan rules, 
DSBP awards normally vest in full on cessation; PSP and ESOS awards which have been held for at least 1 2 months normally vest 
when the level of performance has been assessed and agreed at the end of the three-year performance period. The Committee 
may determine these awards vest upon cessation as permitted in the plan rules. In either circumstance, any relevant performance 
conditions would still apply to the PSP and ESOS awards and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, would be time prorated.
Where a director has been recruited to the Company from overseas, the Company may pay for repatriation.
The Company may reimburse for reasonable legal fees in the event a director leaves by mutual consent. It may also pay for 
professional outplacement services in these circumstances.

CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee is committed to an 
open and transparent dialogue with its 
shareholders on the issue of executive 
remuneration. Where appropriate, the 
Committee will actively engage with 
shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies, seeking views 
which may be taken into account when 
making any decisions about changes to 
the directors’ remuneration policy.
The Committee seeks the views of the 
largest shareholders when considering 
making any signiﬁcant changes to the 
remuneration policy; this may be done 
annually or on an ad hoc basis, dependent 
upon the issue. The Committee annually 
engages in a process of investor 
consultation, which is typically in written 
format, but may be through face-to-face 
meetings etc., if considered useful. The 
Committee Chairman is available to answer 
questions at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) and the answers to speciﬁc questions 
are posted on our website.
As part of our socially responsible reporting 
strategy, an annual meeting is held and 
the consideration of views on a variety of 
topics, including executive pay, is taken 
into account.
During the year, the Committee consulted 
with shareholders regarding the minor 
amendments made to the implementation 
policy as detailed on page 76.

REMUNERATION POLICY

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
FIGURE 6: RECRUITMENT POLICY
The table opposite sets out the recruitment

AGREEMENTS FOR SERVICE 
All non-executive directors, including the 
Chairman, have an agreement for service 
for an initial three-year term; these are 
available for shareholder inspection at the 
Company’s registered ofﬁce. The Chairman 
has an agreement for service which requires 
six months’ notice by either party. Non-
executive directors’ service agreements 
may be terminated by either party giving 
three months’ notice. In line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all non-
executive directors are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders at our AGM.
Since the approval of the remuneration 
policy at the AGM held on 8 July 201 4, 
a number of changes concerning the 
implementation of the approved policy 
have been made. These amendments do 
not require prior shareholder approval 
and do not change the current approved 
remuneration policy.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN/
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company’s Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) and Executive Share Option Scheme 
(ESOS) were ﬁ rst approved by shareholders 
in 2005. As such, they are due to expire in 
201 5 and will be updated with replacement 
plans if approved by shareholders at the 
201 5 AGM. The terms of the proposed new 
plans are principally in line with those of 
the 2005 Plans and are fully in line with the 
policy approved by shareholders at the 
201 4 AGM. Further details of the proposed 
replacement plans are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting and on page 67 .
CLAWBACK PROVISIONS
M&S is committed to ensuring its 
remuneration arrangements motivate 
participants to strive for exceptional 
performance whilst also protecting 
shareholder value from the Company 
taking unnecessary risks. In line with 
updated guidance in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, clawback provisions will 
be introduced as part of the replacement 
share scheme rules at the 201 5 AGM. Upon 
introduction, these clawback provisions will 
apply to payments made under the 201 5/1 6 
Annual Bonus Scheme and any future 
bonus schemes operated by M&S. Awards 
made under any of the Company’s other 
executive share schemes (including the 
Performance Share Plan) in 201 5 and 
onwards will similarly be subject to clawback 
provisions. These provisions enable the 
Committee, in its absolute discretion, to 
reclaim awards paid to individuals for up to 
three years after the respective vesting or 
payment date (or up to two years in the case 
of PSP awards) where speciﬁ ed events occur. 
The speciﬁ ed events include gross 
misconduct or where a material 
misstatement of the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
statements has occurred. Clawback may be 
eff ected, among other means, by requiring 
the transfer of shares, payment of cash, or 
reduction of awards.
All outstanding share awards made since 
201 3 will continue to be subject to the 
malus provisions which were introduced 
at that time and as reported on page 58 
of this report. These malus provisions will 
be renewed as part of the replacement 
share plan rules.
UNVESTED AWARDS UNDER 
RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN AND 
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
As shown on page 56, Laura Wade-Gery and 
Steve Rowe had unexercised Restricted 
Share Plan and Executive Share Option 
Scheme awards respectively, when the 
remuneration policy was ﬁ rst implemented. 
In both instances, these outstanding awards 
have now been exercised during the year. 
RECRUITMENT 
POLICY
Fees
Beneﬁ ts
The Committee takes into account a number of factors when determining 
an appropriate fee level for the Chairman. The CEO and executive directors 
determine appropriate fee levels for the non-executive directors. This 
consideration includes the time commitment and responsibility of the 
individual role and market practice in appropriate comparator groups.
The Company may off er beneﬁ ts to the Chairman set in line with our policy 
as detailed on page 59.

 BASIS OF CALCULATIONS 
Fixed     Fixed remuneration only. No vesting 
under the Annual Bonus Scheme 
and PSP .
Target     Includes the following assumptions 
for the vesting of the incentive 
components of the package:
  –  Annual Bonus Scheme: 50% of 
maximum; and
  – PSP: 20% of maximum.
Maximum  Includes the following assumptions 
for the vesting of the incentive 
components of the package:
  –  Annual Bonus Scheme: 100% 
of maximum; and
  – PSP: 100% of maximum.
Fixed remuneration
Includes all elements of ﬁ xed 
remuneration:
–  Base salary (eff ective 1 July 201 5, 
as shown in the table on page 63);
–  Pension beneﬁ ts (using the salary 
supplement policy on pages 54 
to 55); and
–  Beneﬁ ts (using the value for 201 4/1 5 
included in the single ﬁ gure table 
on page 62. For Helen Weir, the 
average value of beneﬁ ts of the other 
executive directors has been used 
for the purpose of this calculation.
Annual Bonus Scheme (ABS)
Represents the potential value of the 
annual bonus for 201 5/16. Half of any 
bonus would be deferred into shares 
for three years and this is included in 
the value shown. No share price growth 
is assumed.
PSP 
PSP represents the potential value of 
the PSP to be awarded in 201 5, which 
would vest in 201 8 subject to the 
performance against the targets 
disclosed on page 67 . No share price 
growth is assumed.
KEY ASSUMPTIONS
The charts below provide an illustration 
of what could be received by each of the 
executive directors in 201 5/1 6.
These charts are illustrative as the actual 
value which will ultimately be received will 
depend on business performance in the 
year 201 5/1 6 (for the cash element of the 
bonus scheme) and in the three-year period 
to 201 7 /1 8 (for the PSP), as well as share price 
performance to the date of the vesting of 
the share element of the bonus scheme 
and PSP awards in 201 8.

REMUNERATION
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee annually 
reviews the senior remuneration framework 
and considers whether the existing incentive 
arrangements remain strongly challenging 
in the context of the business strategy, 
current external guidelines and a range of 
internal factors including the remuneration 
policy and pay arrangements throughout 
the rest of the organisation. The table below 
shows the performance measures used in 
the 201 4/1 5 incentive schemes and how 
these align with the key performance 
indicators detailed on pages 1 4-1 5. As 
shown, there is a strong linkage between 
the key performance indicators which 
are integrated in the directors’ incentive 
schemes. This ensures that directors are 
clearly aligned and motivated to deliver 
the strategy.
Looking ahead, for 201 5/1 6, the executive 
directors’ incentive arrangements will 
include objectives against free cash ﬂ ow, 
GM UK LFL sales, GM gross margin, M&S.com 
sales growth and International sales and 
operating proﬁ t. Further details are set out 
on pages 65 and 67 .

1. The amounts shown for 201 3/1 4 reﬂ ect that Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne joined the Board on 10 July 201 3.
2. The amounts shown for 201 4/1 5 reﬂ ect that Alan Stewart resigned from the Board on 10 July 201 4. 
3. Beneﬁ ts include the value of car allowance and intrinsic value of SAYE in addition to the taxable value of car, driver and life assurance, as applicable to each director and as described 
on page 63.
4. Half of any award will be deferred into Company shares for a period of three years. Further details of the 201 4/1 5 Annual Bonus Scheme are shown on pages 64 and 65.
5. The value of awards vesting in 201 3/1 4 has been restated to reﬂ ect the actual value of dividend equivalents and share price at the time of vesting. The value of awards vesting in 201 4/1 5 
has been estimated based on the three-month average share price from 2  January 201 5 – 27 March 201 5 as these awards do not vest until after the end of the ﬁ nancial year. This value also 
includes the anticipated value of dividend equivalents which will be payable in July 201 5 (and January 2016 for Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne). These estimated ﬁ gures will be restated in 
next year’s report.

BENEFITS (audited)
Each executive director receives a car or 
cash allowance and is off ered the beneﬁt 
of  a driver. The Company also provides 
each director with life assurance. Executive 
directors receive employee product 
discount and are eligible to participate 
in  salary sacriﬁce schemes such as 
Cycle2Work in line with all other employees. 
SALARY (audited)
When reviewing salary levels, the Committee 
takes into account a number of internal 
and  external factors, including Company 
performance during the year, external 
market data and the salary review principles 
applied to the rest of the organisation 
to  ensure a consistent approach.
No increases were awarded during the year. 
The Committee also moved the annual pay 
review date from January to July to better 
align pay to year end performance and 
hence these changes are being made after 
18 months.
With eff ect from 1 July 201 5, the following 
salary increases will be made to the executive 
directors, except for Marc Bolland. 
Marc Bolland has, at his own request, 
not  received a salary increase since his 
appointment in 2010. He has again proposed 
not to receive any increase in July 201 5. 
The agreed increases take account of the 
signiﬁ cant performance of Steve Rowe in 
ensuring the continued success of the Food 
business and Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne’s 
excellent progress with marketing and 
embedding the new global M&S brand. 
Neither director has received a salary 
increase since their respective 
appointments to the Board; these increases 
reﬂ ect both this fact in addition to their 
signiﬁ cant contributions to  the increased 
performance of M&S. 
The average increase made to the executive 
directors is 3.0% (excluding Helen Weir) 
which is in line with the average increase 
awarded to the wider UK workforce over 
the same 1 8-month period.
The table below details the executive 
directors’ salaries as at 28 March 201 5 and 
those which will take eff ect from 1 July 20 1 5.
The following sections set out additional disclosure regarding each of the components set out in the previous ‘single ﬁgure’ table.

 All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the current Transfer Value 
Regulations. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of the assets that the pension scheme

ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME FOR 2014/15 (audited)
For 201 4/1 5, directors had the opportunity 
to earn an award of up to 200% of salary, with 
half of any award being payable in deferred 
shares. Performance measures used to 
determine the entitlement to any payment 
were set against challenging proﬁ tability 
targets and individual objectives. 
Proﬁ tability targets formed 60% of any 
bonus award with the remaining 40% 
payable for the achievement of stretching 
measures relevant to each director’s 
individual business accountabilities. For 
those executive directors with business 
unit responsibility, proﬁ tability measures 
were equally split between Group PBT 
and proﬁ t measures for their business 
unit. As a result of his additional 
International responsibilities, from July 
201 4, Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne’s 
corporate element was calibrated to include 
International operating proﬁ t from this time. 
For Marc Bolland, proﬁ tability was wholly 
measured against Group achievement. Each 
director also had three individual objectives, 
together accounting for 40% of the total 
bonus. These objectives were set against 
their key areas of focus and accountability 
which reﬂ ect the primary drivers of short 
and medium-term strategic success of the 
Company. 
 See Figure 12.
Plan A (our environmental and ethical plan) 
is an integral driver of the way we do 
business; success against Plan A targets 
underpinned the entire 201 4/1 5 bonus 
scheme. The Committee assessed 
performance for each executive director 
against all corporate and individual 
measures. The Committee was also satisﬁ ed 
that each director continued to ensure that 
Plan A remained a major focus of the ways 
of working at M&S and that the subsequent 
performance supported this.
 See Plan A Report for more detail.
M&S is committed to transparent 
remuneration reporting within the context 
of operating in a highly competitive 
market. As disclosed in the 201 3/1 4 Report, 
and following feedback from shareholders 
after the publication of last year’s report, 
the Committee has reviewed its disclosure 
regarding annual bonus targets. The 
Committee will continue to assess the 
extent to which speciﬁ c targets are 
commercially sensitive, determining to 
disclose wherever possible. 
Figure 1 3 below illustrates each director’s 
achievement against corporate proﬁ tability 
and individual targets for the 201 4/1 5 
Scheme. As described in last year’s report, 
in order to ensure the aff ordability of the 
Scheme, no bonus payment may be made 
without ﬁ rst achieving a threshold level of 
PBT. Underlying PBT outturn for the ﬁ nancial 
year was £66 1.2m which was above the 
target set to trigger payments under both 
elements of the Scheme. As a result of 
performance, directors’ payments were 
between 1 8% and 62% of maximum bonus 
opportunity. Business unit proﬁ tability 
targets, not being disclosed elsewhere 
in the Annual Report, are deemed too 
commercially sensitive to disclose. An 
indication of achievement against the 
respective targets is shown instead in 
Figure 1 3 below.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME FOR 2015/16
The Annual Bonus Scheme has been 
structured to drive proﬁ tability and 
individual performance with performance 
being measured against Underlying Group 
Proﬁt Before Tax (PBT), business area proﬁ t 
and individual objectives. During the year 
the Remuneration Committee undertook 
a thorough review of the bonus scheme. 
It concluded that a similar approach would 
continue to remain appropriate with only 
minor changes to the 201 5/1 6 Scheme 
being required to ensure that the Scheme 
continues to drive behaviours and 
performance needed in line with the 
priorities for the future success of 
the business.
Maximum bonus opportunity will remain 
unchanged at 200% of salary. Up to 60% of 
an award is payable for achieving stretching 
one-year corporate ﬁ nancial targets and 
up to 40% of an award is measured against 
individual performance.
The achievement of proﬁ tability targets 
remains essential to M&S’s success and so 
30% of any bonus award will be dependent 
upon achievement of Group PBT targets. 
The remaining 30% of the corporate 
element of the Scheme will be set against 
free cash ﬂ ow targets for the CEO and CFO 
and against business unit proﬁ tability 
targets for the remaining executive 
directors. Changes made to the Scheme 
for 201 5/1 6 provide for even greater 
alignment between the remuneration 
framework and the wider strategic priorities 
of M&S. The inclusion of free cash ﬂ ow for 
the CEO and CFO recognises the increased 
importance of cash generation in the 
business post the period of heavy 
transformative capital investment.
Individual performance will continue to be 
measured independently of any ﬁnancial 
targets. Individual objectives will be based 
on three strategic priorities speciﬁ c to each 
director’s business area. These measures are 
set against quantiﬁ able targets which the 
Committee deems to be important in the 
delivery of short and medium-term goals 
which will also provide a robust foundation 
for the long-term sustainable success of 
the business. In setting the individual 
objectives for the forthcoming year, the 
Committee has been mindful of ensuring 
an overarching balance with ﬁ nancial 
targets as well as customer and employee-
focused metrics. 
No individual objective element of the 
bonus can be earned unless a ‘threshold’ 
level of PBT has been achieved, subject to 
the Committee’s overall assessment of the 
Company’s performance during the period. 
This maintains the important principle 
that below a deﬁned level of ﬁnancial 
performance, no bonus will be earned.
The table below shows further details of 
the structure of this Scheme and provides 
examples of the individual objectives which 
each director will be measured against.
As with last year’s Scheme, the Committee 
will judge overall performance against 
our ecological, ethical and behavioural 
achievements to ensure consistency with 
M&S’s values. Success towards Plan A 
targets and the M&S values which all 
employees, including executive directors, 
are required to uphold will underpin the 
entire Scheme. Achievement against these 
will be assessed by the Committee at the 
end of the ﬁ nancial year. The Committee, 
in its absolute discretion may use its 
judgement to adjust overall payments 
accordingly. 
 See Figure 14.
DEFERRED SHARE BONUS PLAN 
(audited)
Currently 50% of any bonus award is 
compulsorily deferred into nil-cost options/
conditional shares. These deferred awards 
vest after three years subject to continued 
employment as well as malus and, for 
awards made from 201 5/1 6 onwards, 
clawback provisions. As no bonus was 
payable last year, no deferred shares were 
awarded during 201 4/1 5.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
“Lorem ipsum dolor sit am consectetur adipist enim ad m culpa qui offi  cia deserunt mollit est laborum.”
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) is the 
primary long-term incentive for executive 
directors and senior managers. 
The Committee believes that long-term 
share awards help retain and reward 
executives for the delivery of long-term 
business goals.
Following the remuneration review 
undertaken during the year , the Committee 
determined that the  current Plan supports 
the delivery of the long-term business 
strategy . Minor amendments to 
the performance measures and targets 
however were felt necessary to better align 
with the delivery of the operating plan. 
These amendments will apply for awards 
made in 201 5/1 6.
As the current Plan was approved by 
shareholders ten years ago, approval for a 
replacement Plan is being sought at the 20 1 5 
AGM. The key rules of the Plan are set out in 
the separate Notice of Meeting with further 
details provided on page 67 of this report. 
Proposed changes under the replacement 
PSP are in line with the remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders on 8 July 20 1 4 
with the addition of clawback provisions as 
outlined on page 60, the introduction of 
which does not require a change to the 
remuneration policy.
PSP AWARDS MADE IN 2014/15 (audited)
In June 201 4, executive directors were 
awarded nil-cost options/conditional shares 
of 250% of salary. These awards vest subject 
to performance measured against EPS, 
ROCE and Revenue, each measured 
independently. Performance is measured 
over the three-year period to the end of the 
201 6/1 7 ﬁnancial year. To the extent to which 
performance is met, awards will vest on 
23 June 201 7 . Further details of PSP awards 
made in 201 4/1 5 are detailed below. 
 
See Figure 15.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN CONTINUED
PSP AWARDS TO BE MADE IN 2015/16 
Subject to shareholder approval of the 
replacement Plan at the forthcoming AGM, 
awards of nil-cost options/conditional 
shares will be made in July 201 5.
As described earlier, following a thorough 
review of the directors’ remuneration 
arrangements during the year, the 
Committee concluded that no signiﬁ cant 
changes to the current Plan were required. 
Awards will continue to be assessed against 
a number of measures and the maximum 
value of awards at the time of grant will 
remain at 300% of salary. 
The Committee will continue to reference 
awards at 250% of salary and it is intended 
that executive directors will receive awards 
in 201 5/1 6 of 250% of salary.
Performance measures have historically 
been set as those which appropriately 
reﬂect the key drivers of the strategic plan 
which takes into account shareholder value 
as well as bottom-line and top-line growth. 
During its review, the Committee 
determined that EPS and ROCE 
performance measures continue to 
appropriately reﬂ ect the key drivers of 
shareholder value for M&S and as such no 
changes to the measures and weightings 
have been proposed; 70% of awards made 
in 201 5/1 6 will continue to be measured 
against stretching EPS and ROCE targets.
The remaining 30% of awards will be set 
against a ﬁ nancial strategic scorecard of 
measures designed to drive growth in key 
areas for the business. Measurement of 
performance against International and 
M&S.com sales will be retained as before, 
as M&S continues to grow these areas of the 
business. This focus will continue to support 
the delivery of the strategy to be a leading 
international, multi-channel retailer. Sales 
growth targets for awards to be made in 
201 5/1 6 have been calibrated to be as 
challenging as the equivalent revenue 
targets for 201 4/1 5.
During the review process, the Committee 
determined that the inclusion of two 
additional, equally weighted performance 
measures would further enhance the 
alignment between the PSP and the 
business’s current strategic priorities. As 
such, three-year cumulative free cash ﬂ ow 
and UK GM gross margin targets are being 
introduced in the 201 5/1 6 Plan. These 
measures reﬂ ect the increased importance 
of cash generation and the desire to return 
cash to shareholders in addition to the 
absolute importance of long-term 
improvements in GM for the sustainable 
success of the Company. The four targets 
of International and M&S.com sales, UK GM 
gross margin and three-year cumulative 
free cash ﬂ ow are consistent with the top 
four strategic priorities communicated to 
shareholders for the coming year.
As with all other PSP measures, targets for 
cash ﬂ ow and gross margin have been set 
such that they are stretching yet achievable 
for the delivery of consistent, ambitious 
long-term performance. 
Measures and targets for the 201 5/1 6 PSP 
awards are disclosed in the table below. At 
this time, targets relating to UK GM gross 
margin are deemed by the Board to be 
too commercially sensitive to disclose. 
All targets, including GM gross margin will 
be fully retrospectively disclosed in the 
report relating to the end of the relevant 
three-year performance period.
At the end of the performance period, 
Committee judgement will be applied in 
determining overall vesting on the four 
measures comprising the strategic 
ﬁ nancial scorecard element of the PSP . 
The Committee, in using its judgement, 
will take into account the extent of 
outperformance or underperformance 
of the targets, their relative importance in 
the circumstances, and any other matters 
it sees ﬁ t.

FIGURE 20: SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS (audited)
All executive directors are required to hold 
shares equivalent in value to a minimum 
percentage of their salary within a ﬁve-year 
period from their date of appointment. 
Shareholding targets were increased last 
year to 250% of salary for the CEO and 1 50% 
of salary for other executive directors. 
Similar guidelines of 100% of salary also 
apply to directors below Board level.
The chart below shows the extent to 
which each director has met their target 
shareholding as at 28 March 201 5.
For the purposes of the requirements, the 
net number of unvested shares awards 
not subject to performance conditions is 
included and is reﬂ ected in the chart below. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the current 
level of shareholding requirements is 
suffi  ciently robust, providing an appropriate 
level of investment in M&S for each director. 
The Committee will continue to keep 
this issue under review and will amend 
accordingly if necessary.

SHARE CAPITAL & DILUTION
Dilution of share capital by employee 
share plans Awards granted under the 
Company’s Save As You Earn scheme and 
the Executive Share Option scheme are met 
by the issue of new shares when the options 
are exercised. 
All other share plans are met by market 
purchase shares. The Company monitors 
the number of shares issued under these 
schemes and their impact on dilution limits. 
The Company’s usage of shares compared 
to the dilution limits set by The Investment 
Association in respect of all share plans (10% 
in any rolling ten-year period) and executive 
share plans (5% in any rolling ten-year 
period) as at 28 March 201 5 was as follows:

1. The number of options/conditional shares shown under the Performance Share Plan is the maximum (100%) number that could be receivable by the executive director if the performance 
conditions are fully met. The 201 1 award vested in July 201 4 at 7.6%. 4.7% of the 201 2 award will vest in June 201 5 (December 201 5 for Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne) as set out on page 66.
2. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne’s awards are structured as conditional shares. His RSP award was made prior to his appointment to executive director.
3. Alan Stewart resigned from the Board on 10 July 201 4 and left the Company on 22  September 201 4. Details of his leaving arrangements are set out on page 73. Awards made in 201 2, 201 3 
and 201 4 and his SAYE award all lapsed on leaving the Company. For transparency, these are shown in the ‘lapsed during the year’ column. PSP and DSBP awards made in 201 1 vested and 
were exercisable until he left the Company. These were exercised after he resigned from the Board (but before he left the Company) and so do not appear in the ‘exercised during the 
year’ column.
4. Laura Wade-Gery’s RSP award was made in connection to her appointment to executive director to compensate her for incentive awards that were forfeited on cessation from her 
previous employer.
 
 The aggregate gains of directors arising in the year from the exercise of options granted under the PSP, DSBP, RSP, ESOS and SAYE totalled £2,976,739.
 
The market price of the shares at the end of the ﬁ nancial year was 530.0p; the highest and lowest share price during the ﬁ nancial year were 542.0p and 383.9p respectively.

received a bonus of £596,000 for 201 4/1 5 which is detailed in full in the single ﬁ gure table on page 62. A bonus was payable

the change in our UK-based employees. 
This group has been chosen as the majority 
of our workforce is UK-based. As can be

increased by 2%, in excess of that provided 
to the CEO.

director to retain any fee. 
The table opposite sets out the details 
for these fees earned up to 28 March 201 5.

date at which he retired from Manpower Inc. 
Board. Marc Bolland joined the Board of The 
Coca-Cola Company on 1 8 February 201 5. 
Fees are paid quarterly in cash and shares

COMMITTEE ADVISERS
In carrying out its responsibilities, the 
Committee is independently advised by 
external advisers. The Committee was 
advised by Deloitte and PwC during the 
year. Both Deloitte and PwC are founding 
members of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and voluntarily operate under the 
code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. 
The code of conduct can be found at 
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
Further, the Committee reviews the advice 
it receives and determines whether it is 
appropriately independent.
1
PwC were appointed by the Committee as 
its independent advisers in 201 4 following a 
rigorous and competitive tender process. 
PwC provides independent commentary 
on matters under consideration by the 
Committee and updates on legislative 
requirements, best practice and market 
practice. PwC’s fees are typically charged on 
an hourly basis with costs for work agreed 
in advance. During the year, PwC charged 
£1 1 9,800 for Remuneration Committee 
matters. Deloitte’s fees were similarly 
charged on an hourly basis. Their fees for 
Remuneration Committee matters for 
the period to 28 March 201 5 were £28,500. 
PwC has provided tax, consultancy and 
risk consulting services to the Group in 
the ﬁ nancial year.
The Committee also seeks internal support 
from the CEO, Group Secretary, Director of 
Human Resources and Head of Reward & 
Global Mobility as necessary. All may attend 
the Committee meetings by invitation but 
are not present for any discussions that 
relate directly to their own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews external survey 
and bespoke benchmarking data including 
that published by New Bridge Street (the 
trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited), KPMG, 
PwC and Towers Watson.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Committee is committed to ensuring 
that executive pay remains competitive, 
appropriate and fair in the context of the 
external market, Company performance 
and the pay arrangements of the wider 
workforce. In collaboration with the Head of 
Reward & Global Mobility, the Committee 
gives employees, through employee 
representatives, the opportunity to raise 
questions or concerns regarding the 
remuneration of the executive directors. 
During the year, the Head of Reward & 
Global Mobility met with employee 
representatives to discuss the directors’ 
pay arrangements. Details of the directors’ 
pay arrangements were discussed in the 
context of the reward framework for the rest 
of the organisation and external factors; no 
concerns were raised. Upon reporting back 
on the discussions and outcome of this 
meeting, the Committee is satisﬁed that the 
pay arrangements for 201 4/1 5 and 201 5/1 6 
remain appropriate for M&S.
SHAREHOLDER CONSULTATION
The Committee is committed to a 
continuous, open and transparent dialogue 
with shareholders on the issue of executive 
remuneration. The Committee held a 
Governance Event in June 201 4 to review 
and debate remuneration with shareholders 
and representative bodies. In addition, 
Vindi Banga met with a number of investors 
as part of the handover process and 
ahead of consulting with the Company’s 
largest shareholders on proposals for 
the 201 5/1 6 remuneration arrangements 
for executive directors.
SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT 
FOR THE 2013/14 DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
At the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 
201 4, 99.1 8% of shareholders voted in favour 
of approving the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 201 3/1 4 with 98.27% of 
shareholders approving the remuneration 
policy. The Committee believes this 
illustrates the strong level of shareholder 
support for the senior remuneration 
framework.

the voting outcomes for the 201 4/1 5

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme (the ‘Scheme’) for 
employees with an appointment date 
prior to 1 April 2002.
The results of the triennial actuarial 
valuation of the Scheme as at 3 1 March 201 2 
revealed a deﬁ cit of £290m. This represents 
a substantial reduction in deﬁ cit from £1.3bn 
as at 3 1 March 2009. The next valuation is 
due as at 3 1 March 201 5. Funding progress 
is closely monitored and the investment 
derisking journey has continued since the 
last valuation. 
The assets of the pension scheme, which are 
held under trust separately from those of 
the Group, are managed by the Board of the 
Pension Trust (‘Trustee Board’). The Trustee 
Board comprises four company nominated 
directors, including the Chairman, Graham 
Oakley; three member nominated directors 
and two independent directors. All directors 
are appointed for a ﬁ ve-year term and 
may stand for a second term. The Trustee 
Board operates three main committees: 
Management and Governance, Investment, 
and Actuarial Valuation, which has been 
convened earlier this year in preparation 
for the 201 5 valuation. 
The Trustee Board has a business plan 
against which progress is measured on an 
ongoing basis in a similar approach to the 
Group Board. There is also an annual Board 
Eff ectiveness Review and both the Trustee 
Board and the Investment Committee 
hold annual strategy days which help drive 
the long-term agenda and the business 
plan priorities.
Each Trustee Board director has an 
individual training plan, which is based on 
the Pension Regulator’s Trustee Knowledge 
and Understanding requirements and 
tailored to address any skill gaps and 
speciﬁ c committee roles. The majority of 
the Trustee Board members hold the 
Pensions Management Institute Award 
in Trusteeship.
All advisers, investment managers and 
suppliers are appointed through a rigorous 
tender process. They are monitored via 
quarterly reports and periodic meetings 
and there is also a rolling programme of 
both informal and formal adviser reviews. 
In addition to six monthly reports from EY 
as covenant adviser, the Trustee Board 
also receives presentations from the Chief 
Finance Offi  cer after the Year and Half 
Year results.
The Scheme is a signatory to the UN 
Principles for Responsible Investment and 
the Trustee has partnered with a specialist 
engagement service, Hermes Equity 
Ownership Services (EOS), to exercise its 
global equity voting rights in accordance 
with a detailed Trustee policy, which 
addresses a range of governance, social 
and environmental issues. EOS has also 
enhanced the Trustee’s stewardship and 
governance oversight of investee 
companies by engaging with companies, 
on a global basis, where management is 
considered not to be acting in the best 
long-term interests of investors. The 
results of these voting and engagement 
activities are published quarterly on the 
M&S Pension Scheme’s website. The Scheme 
is also a signatory to the Financial Reporting 
Council’s UK Stewardship Code.

Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the 
Board may pay interim dividends, and also 
any ﬁ xed rate dividend, whenever the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justiﬁ es its payment.
APPOINTMENT AND 
RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS
The directors may from time to time appoint 
one or more directors. The Board may 
appoint any person to be a director (so long 
as the total number of directors does not 
exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). 
Under the Articles, any such director shall 
hold offi  ce only until the next AGM and shall 
then be eligible for election. The Articles 
also require that at each AGM at least one-
third of the current directors should retire 
as directors by rotation. All those directors 
who have been in offi  ce at the time of the 
two previous AGMs and who did not retire 
at either of them must retire as directors 
by rotation. In addition, a director may at 
any AGM retire from offi  ce and stand for 
re-election. However, in line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 201 2, all 
directors will stand for annual election at 
the 201 5 AGM.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company has procedures in place for 
managing conﬂ icts of interest. Should a 
director become aware that they, or their 
connected parties, have an interest in an 
existing or proposed transaction with 
Marks & Spencer, they should notify the 
Board in writing or at the next Board 
meeting. Internal controls are in place to 
ensure that any related party transactions 
involving directors, or their connected 
parties, are conducted on an arm’s length 
basis. Directors have a continuing duty to 
update any changes to these conﬂ icts.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES 
The Company maintains directors’ and 
offi  cers’ liability insurance which gives 
appropriate cover for any legal action 
brought against its directors. The Company 
has also granted indemnities to each of its 
directors and the Group Secretary to the 
extent permitted by law. Qualifying third-
party indemnity provisions (as deﬁ ned by 
section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) 
were in force during the year ended 
28 March 201 5 and remain in force, in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities 
which the directors (or Group Secretary) 
may incur to third parties in the course of 
acting as directors or Group Secretary 
or employees of the Company or of any 
associated company.  OUR PERFORMANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE OUR BUSINESS

POWERS FOR THE COMPANY ISSUING 
OR BUYING BACK ITS OWN SHARES
The Company was authorised by 
shareholders, at the 201 4 AGM, to purchase 
in the market up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, as permitted under the 
Company’s Articles. No shares have been 
bought back under this authority during 
the year ended 28 March 201 5. This standard 
authority is renewable annually; the 
directors will seek to renew this authority 
at the 201 5 AGM. It is the Company’s present 
intention to cancel any shares it buys back, 
rather than hold them in treasury.
The directors were granted authority at 
the 201 4 AGM to allot relevant securities 
up to a nominal amount of £1 36,089,559. 
This authority will apply until the conclusion 
of the 201 5 AGM. At this year’s AGM,

of 1 64 million ordinary shares and sets the 
minimum and maximum prices which will 
be paid.

VOTING RIGHTS
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting 
of the Company in respect of which the 
business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, 
or in relation to corporate members, by 
corporate representatives. The Articles 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy 
forms of not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the holding of the 
meeting or adjourned meeting. However, 
when calculating the 48-hour period, the 
directors can, and have, decided not to take 
account of any part of a day that is not a 
working day.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – 
CHANGE OF CONTROL
There are a number of agreements to which 
the Company is party that take eff ect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. Details 
of the signiﬁ cant agreements of this kind are 
as follows:
> The £400m Medium Term Notes issued by 
the Company on 30 November 2009, the 
£300m Medium Term Notes issued by the 
Company on 6 December 201 1 and the 
£400m; Medium Term Notes issued by 
the Company on 1 2 December 201 2 to 
various institutions (‘MTN’) and under the 
Group’s £3bn euro Medium Term Note 
(EMTN) programme contain an option 
such that, upon a change of control 
event, combined with a credit ratings 
downgrade to below sub-investment 
level, any holder of an MTN may require 
the Company to prepay the principal 
amount of that MTN.
> The $500m US Notes issued by the 
Company to various institutions on 
6 December 2007 under Section 1 44a of 
the US Securities Act contain an option 
such that, upon a change of control 
event, combined with a credit ratings 
downgrade to below sub-investment 
level, any holder of such a US Note may 
require the Company to prepay the 
principal amount of that US Note.
> The $300m US Notes issued by the 
Company to various institutions on 
6 December 2007 under Section 1 44a of 
the US Securities Act contain an option 
such that, upon a change of control 
event, combined with a credit ratings 
downgrade to below sub-investment 
level, any holder of such a US Note may 
require the Company to prepay the 
principal amount of that US Note.
> The £1.325bn Credit Agreement dated 
29 September 201 1 between the 
Company and various banks contains 
a provision such that, upon a change 
of control event, unless new terms are 
agreed within 60 days, the facility under 
this agreement will be cancelled with 
all outstanding amounts becoming 
immediately payable with interest; and
> The amended and restated Relationship 
Agreement dated 6 October 201 4 
(originally dated 9 November 2004 as 
amended on 1 March 2005), between 
HSBC and the Company and relating to 
M&S Bank, contains certain provisions 
which address a change of control of the 
Company. Upon a change of control the 
existing rights and obligations of the 
parties in respect of M&S Bank continue 
and HSBC gains certain limited additional 
rights in respect of existing customers 
of the new controller of the Company. 
Where a third-party arrangement is in 
place for the supply of ﬁ nancial services 
products to existing customers of the 
new controller, the Company is required 
to procure the termination of such 
arrangement as soon as reasonably 
practicable (whilst not being required 
to do anything that would breach any 
contract in place in respect of such 
arrangement).
Where a third-party arrangement is so 
terminated, or does not exist, HSBC gains 
certain exclusivity rights in respect of 
the sale of ﬁ nancial services products 
to the existing customers of the new 
controller. Where the Company 
undertakes a re-branding exercise with 
the new controller following a change of 
control (which includes using any M&S 
brand in respect of the new controller’s 
business or vice versa), HSBC gains 
certain termination rights (exercisable 
at its election) in respect of the 
Relationship Agreement.
The Company does not have agreements 
with any director or employee that would 
provide compensation for loss of offi  ce or 
employment resulting from a takeover 
except that provisions of the Company’s 
share schemes and plans may cause 
options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest on 
a takeover.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
We remain committed to employee 
involvement throughout the business. 
Employees are kept well informed of the 
performance and strategy of the Group 
through personal brieﬁ ngs, regular 
meetings, email and broadcasts by the Chief 
Executive and members of the Board at 
key points in the year to all head offi  ce and 
distribution centre employees and store 
management. Additionally, many of our 
store colleagues can join the brieﬁ ngs 
by telephone to hear directly from the 
business. These types of communication 
are supplemented by our employee 
publications including ‘Your M&S’ magazine, 
Plan A updates and DVD presentations. 
More than 3,500 employees are elected 
onto Business Involvement Groups (‘BIGs’) 
across every store, distribution centre and 
head offi  ce location to represent their 
colleagues in two-way communication and 
consultation with the Company. They have 
continued to play a key role in a wide variety 
of business changes.
The 20th meeting of the European Works 
Council (‘EWC’) (established in 1 995) will 
take place in September 201 5. This Council 
provides an additional forum for informing, 
consulting and involving employee 
representatives from the countries in the 
European Community. The EWC includes 
representatives from France, The 
Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Greece, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, 
Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, 
the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The EWC 
has the opportunity to be addressed by the 
Chief Executive and other senior members 
of the Company on issues that aff ect the 
European business. This includes the 
Directors of International and Multi-channel 
and the Director of Plan A, who all have an 
impact across the European Community. 
Directors and senior management regularly 
attend the national Business Involvement 
Group (BIG) meetings. They visit stores and 
discuss with employees matters of current 
interest and concern to both employees 
and the business through meetings with 
local BIG representatives, speciﬁ c listening 
groups and informal discussions. The 
business has continued to engage with 
employees and drive involvement through a 
scheme called The BIG Idea. On a quarterly 
basis the business poses a question to 
gather ideas and initiatives on a number of 
areas including how we can better serve 
our customers. Several thousand ideas are 
put forward each time and the winning 
employee receives an award and the 
chance to see how this is implemented 
by the Company.
Share schemes are a long-established and 
successful part of our total reward package, 
encouraging and supporting employee 
share ownership. In particular, around 
24,000 employees currently participate 
in Sharesave, the Company’s all employee 
Save As you Earn Scheme. Full details of all 
schemes are given on pages 70 to 71. OUR PERFORMANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE OUR BUSINESS

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
We have a well established interactive 
wellbeing website designed exclusively 
for M&S employees. It gives any employee 
the opportunity to access a wealth of 
information, help and support. We cover all 
areas of wellbeing, from healthy eating and 
exercise to help in overcoming issues such 
as stress, ﬁ nancial challenges, achieving a 
positive work-life balance and problems 
with sleeping. Using this service, employees 
can access our personal support teams, 
such as counselling, as well as take part in a 
calendar of wellbeing events and initiatives.
Employees are able to interact with one 
another, post information about clubs and 
groups in their area and can gain access 
to information about corporate projects, 
which link to their personal health, via our 
employee social media platform, Yammer.
We maintain contact with retired staff  
through communications from the 
Company and the Pension Trust. Member-
nominated trustees have been elected 
to the Pension Trust board, including 
employees and pensioners. We continue 
to produce a regular Pensions Update 
newsletter for members of our ﬁ nal salary 
pension scheme and have a fully interactive 
website for members of the deﬁ ned 
contribution M&S Pension Savings Plan.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
The Group is committed to an active equal 
opportunities policy from recruitment 
and selection, through training and 
development, performance reviews and 
promotion to retirement. It is our policy 
to promote an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment and 
victimisation, where everyone will receive 
equal treatment regardless of gender, 
colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, 
age, marital status, sexual orientation 
or religion. All decisions relating to 
employment practices will be objective, 
free from bias and based solely upon work 
criteria and individual merit. The Company 
is responsive to the needs of its employees, 
customers and the community at large. We 
are an organisation which uses everyone’s 
talents and abilities and where diversity 
is valued. We were one of the ﬁ rst major 
companies to remove the default 
retirement age in 2001 and have continued 
to see an increase in employees wanting to 
work past the state retirement age. Our 
oldest employee is 88 years old and joined 
the business at age 80. In April 201 5 the 
Company once again featured in The Times 
Top 50 Employers for Women, highlighting 
how equal opportunities are available for 
all at M&S.
EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES
It is our policy that people with disabilities 
should have full and fair consideration for 
all vacancies. During the year, we continued 
to demonstrate our commitment to 
interviewing those people with disabilities 
who fulﬁ l the minimum criteria, and 
endeavouring to retain employees in the 
workforce if they become disabled during 
employment. We will actively retrain and 
adjust their environment where possible to 
allow them to maximise their potential. We 
continue to work with external organisations 
to provide workplace opportunities through 
our innovative Marks & Start scheme and by 
working closely with JobCentre Plus. The 
Marks & Start scheme was introduced into 
our distribution centre at Castle Donington 
in 201 2/1 3, where we work with Remploy to 
support people with disabilities and health 
conditions into work. 
ESSENTIAL CONTRACTS OR 
ARRANGEMENTS 
The Company is required to disclose any 
contractual or other arrangements which 
it considers are essential to its business. 
We have a wide range of suppliers for the 
production and distribution of products 
to our customers. Whilst the loss of, or 
disruption to, certain of these arrangements 
could temporarily aff ect the operations 
of the Group, none are considered to be 
essential, with the exception of certain 
warehouse and logistic operators and 
providers of services relating to the 
Company’s e-commerce platform.
GROCERIES SUPPLY CODE 
OF PRACTICE
The Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) 
Market Investigation Order 2009 (‘Order’) 
and The Groceries Supply Code of Practice 
(‘GSCOP’) impose obligations on M&S 
relating to relationships with its suppliers of 
groceries. Under the Order and GSCOP , M&S 
is required to submit an annual compliance 
report to the Audit Committee for approval 
and then to the Competition and Markets 
Authority and Groceries Code Adjudicator. 
M&S submitted its report to the Audit 
Committee on 1 4 May 201 5 covering the 
period from 1 April 201 4 to 3 1 March 201 5. 
In accordance with the Order, a summary 
of that compliance report is set out below.
M&S believes that it has complied in full 
with GSCOP and the Order during the 
relevant period. No formal disputes have 
arisen during the reporting period. Four 
allegations regarding potential breaches 
of GSCOP were made by suppliers during 
the relevant period, but all complaints have 
been withdrawn/resolved.

policy of not making donations to political 
organisations or independent election 
candidates or incurring political expenditure 
anywhere in the world as deﬁ ned in the 
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums 
Act 2000. 
GOING CONCERN
In adopting the going concern basis for 
preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, the 
directors have considered the business 
activities as set out on pages 1 to 22 as 
well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 23 to 25. 
Based on the Group’s cash ﬂ ow forecasts 
and projections, the Board is satisﬁ ed that 
the Group will be able to operate within the 
level of its facilities for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the Board considers 
it appropriate for the Group to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its 
ﬁ nancial statements.
AUDITOR
Resolutions to reappoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditor of the Company and to authorise 
the Audit Committee to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 
201 5 AGM.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of Marks and Spencer Group plc 
will be held at Wembley Stadium, London on 
7 July 201 5 at 1 1am. The Notice of Meeting is 
given, together with explanatory notes, in a 
booklet which accompanies this report.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board is of the view that the Annual 
Report should be truly representative of 
the year and provide shareholders with the 
information necessary to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
This cannot be achieved by merely 
reviewing the ﬁ nal document at the end 
of the preparation process. The Board 
ensured that its requirements were clearly 
communicated from the outset to each 
of the departments involved in the 
production of the Annual Report. 
The Board has advised that the narrative 
reports should contain the key information 
needed by investors and other users of the 
report and should avoid being promotional 
in nature. Furthermore, the narrative 
reports in the front and the accounting 
information in the back of the report should 
be consistent and the teams involved in its 
production work closely together to achieve 
this. For an independent opinion, the Board 
also requested the Audit Committee review 
the Annual Report and provide feedback. 
The Committee’s opinion on whether the 
report is fair, balanced and understandable 
is on page 49.
The directors are also responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Company law 
requires the directors to prepare ﬁ nancial 
statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under 
that law, the directors have prepared the 
Group and Company ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the EU. Under company law, the directors 
must not approve the ﬁ nancial statements 
unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of aff airs of the 
Group and the Company and of the proﬁ t 
or loss of the Group and the Company for 
that period. In preparing these ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
> Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
> Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
> State whether applicable IFRSs (as 
adopted by the EU) have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the ﬁ nancial 
statements; and
> Prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on a 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
suffi  cient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose, at 
any time and with reasonable accuracy, 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Company and 
the Group and to enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
diff er from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 34 and 35 of 
the Annual Report, conﬁ rm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
> The Group ﬁ nancial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the Group; 
> The Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report contained in this report include 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and
> The Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable , 
and provides the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 
TO AUDITORS
Each director conﬁ rms that, so far as 
he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware and that each director 
has taken all the steps that he/she ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself/ 
herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.

2 Impairment of store assets
3 Inventory valuation and provisions
4  Revenue recognition – gift cards,

The assessed risks of material misstatement 
are those that had the greatest eff ect on 
our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the 
eff orts of the engagement team. 
The Audit Committee has requested that, 
while not required under International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we include in our report any signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ ndings in respect of these assessed 
risks of material misstatement.
The description of risks below should be 
read in conjunction with the signiﬁ cant 
issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on pages 48 and 49.
Our audit procedures relating to these 
matters were designed in the context of 
our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on 
individual accounts or disclosures. Our 
opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements is not 
modiﬁ ed with respect to any of the risks 
described below, and we do not express an 
opinion on these individual matters.
 See tables on p84-87 for more detail.
As required by the Listing Rules we have 
reviewed the directors’ statement contained 
within the ‘Other disclosures’ section on 
page 82 that the Group is a going concern. 
We conﬁ rm that:
>  We have concluded that the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements is appropriate.
>  We have not identiﬁ ed any material 
uncertainties that may cast signiﬁ cant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
In our opinion:
 The ﬁ nancial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent company’s aff airs 
as at 28 March 2015 and of the Group’s 
proﬁ t for the 52 weeks then ended.
 The Group ﬁ nancial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
 The parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs  as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
 The ﬁ nancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The ﬁ nancial statements comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company 
Statements of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
and Company Statements of Cash Flows, 
the reconciliation of net cash ﬂ ow to 
movement in net debt note, and the 
related notes 1 to 27 . The ﬁ nancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

PRESENTATION OF 
NON-GAAP MEASURES 
Risk description
The presentation of income and costs 
within non-GAAP measures (to derive 
‘underlying proﬁ t before tax’) under IFRS is 
judgemental, with IFRS only requiring the 
separate presentation of material items. 
Judgement is required in determining the 
classiﬁ cation of items as non-underlying. 
In calculating the reported non-GAAP 
measures, there are two risks which may 
result in the underlying proﬁ t measure 
being misstated and therefore not being 
reliable to users of the ﬁ nancial statements:
>  Items may be included in the non-
underlying adjustments which are 
underlying or recurring items, distorting 
the reported underlying earnings.
>  Items may be omitted from the non-
underlying adjustments which are 
material and one-off  in nature.
Explanations of each adjustment to derive 
underlying proﬁ t from the reported proﬁ t 
before tax are set out in notes 1 and 5 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We evaluated the appropriateness of the 
inclusion of items, both individually and in 
aggregate, within non-underlying proﬁ ts, 
including assessing the consistency of 
items included year-on-year and ensuring 
adherence to IFRS requirements and 
latest Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) 
guidance. We also agreed these items to 
supporting evidence.
We assessed all items, either highlighted by 
management or identiﬁ ed through the 
course of our audit, which were regarded as 
one-off  but included within underlying 
earnings to ensure that these are not 
material either individually or in aggregate. 
For all adjustments recorded in calculating 
underlying proﬁ ts, we discussed the 
appropriateness of the item with the 
Audit Committee and any disclosure 
considerations.
Findings We are satisﬁ ed that the items 
excluded from underlying earnings and the 
related disclosure of these items in the 
ﬁ nancial statements is appropriate.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT CONTINUED

IMPAIRMENT OF 
STORE ASSETS 2
Risk description
As described in the Accounting Policies in 
note 1 and in note 1 5 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Group held £5,03 1.1 m 
of property, plant and equipment at 
28 March 201 5. There is a risk that the 
carrying value of stores and related ﬁ xed 
assets may be higher than the recoverable 
amount. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount 
is determined based on value in use 
calculations which rely on the directors’ 
assumptions and estimates of future 
trading performance.
The key assumptions applied by the 
directors in the impairment reviews are:
> 
Country-speciﬁ c discount rates.
> 
Future revenue growth.
> 
Trading margin.
>  Store costs, including rent, staff  payroll 
costs and general operating costs.
The directors consider that each retail store 
constitutes its own cash generating unit 
(‘CGU’), with the exception of the outlet 
stores which are used to clear old season 
general merchandise stock at a discount, 
and certain strategic stores. The outlet 
stores are considered to represent one 
CGU in aggregate and strategic stores are 
evaluated as part of a country-wide 
impairment review.
The Group’s accounting policy sets out a 
relevant shelter period for new stores to 
be taken into account when assessing 
indicators of impairment during initial 
years of trading to enable the store to 
establish itself in the market.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We considered the appropriateness of the 
methodology applied by the directors in 
calculating the impairment charges, and 
the judgements applied in determining the 
CGUs of the business.
We assessed the impairment models and 
calculations by:
>   Checking the mechanical accuracy of 
the impairment models.
>   Assessing the discount rates applied to 
the impairment reviews for each country 
and comparing the rates to our internal 
benchmark data.
>   Comparing forecast growth rates to 
economic data.
>  Evaluating the information included in 
the impairment models through our 
knowledge of the business gained 
through reviewing trading plans, 
strategic initiatives, and meeting with 
senior trading managers from key 
categories and our retail industry 
knowledge.
We assessed the appropriateness of the 
shelter period for each store opened within 
that time frame, and compared the original 
investment case for the store against its 
current trading performance. Where stores 
were trading signiﬁ cantly below the original 
case, we considered the evidence available 
to support future improvements in 
performance, speciﬁ cally by assessing the 
trading plans and actions being taken on an 
individual store basis.
Findings We concluded that the 
assumptions applied in the impairment 
models were appropriate, including those 
made around shelter periods and no 
additional impairments were identiﬁ ed 
from the work performed above. GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR PERFORMANCE OUR BUSINESS

SCHEMES, RETURNS AND FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS
Risk description
At 28 March 20 1 5, the Group held 
inventories of £797 .8m. As described in 
the Accounting Policies in note 1 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements, inventories are carried 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
As a result, the directors apply judgement 
in determining the appropriate provisions 
for obsolete stock based upon a detailed 
analysis of old season inventory, net 
realisable value below cost based upon 
plans for inventory to go into sale and stock 
loss based upon the run rate from recent 
inventory counts. 
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We obtained assurance over the 
appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions applied in calculating the 
value of the inventory provisions by:
>  Checking the eff ectiveness of key 
inventory controls operating across the 
Group, including those at 15 distribution 
centres and 26 retail stores.
>  Attending inventory counts at 15 
distribution centres and 16 stores.
>  Checking for a sample of individual 
products that invoiced costs have 
been correctly recorded and that the 
allocation of directly attributable costs 
has been correctly calculated.
>  Comparing the net realisable value, 
obtained through a detailed review of 
sales subsequent to the year end using 
audit analytics, to the cost price of 
inventories to check for completeness 
of the associated provision.
>  Performing audit analytics on stock 
holding and movement data to identify 
product lines with indicators of low stock 
turn or stock ageing.
>  Meeting with buyers to validate the 
assumptions applied by management 
compared to the current purchasing 
strategy and ranging plans.
>  Reviewing the historical accuracy of 
inventory provisioning, and the level of 
inventory write-off s during the year in 
relation to stock loss.
We evaluated consumer trends identiﬁ ed 
through benchmarking and external 
market data to challenge the assumptions 
underlying sales forecasts by category to 
assess the completeness of provisions for 
obsolescence.
Findings The results of our testing were 
satisfactory and we concur that the level 
of inventory provisions is appropriate.
Risk description
As described in the Accounting Policies 
in note 1 to the ﬁ nancial statements, the 
Group’s revenue recognition policies 
require the directors to make a number of 
assumptions in determining the reported 
revenue for the period. The key 
assumptions are:
>  Gift cards, vouchers and loyalty schemes 
– the directors apply an expected 
redemption rate to the total value of 
gift cards, vouchers and loyalty points 
in issue based on historic trends. 
>  Returns – customers are entitled to 
return products up to 35 days after 
purchase, giving rise to a risk that sales 
recognised during the period will be 
reversed in the next ﬁ nancial period. 
The directors apply judgement in 
determining the provision required for 
returns based on the prior ﬁ ve weeks’ 
sales and recent product return rates. 
Returns from online sales are commonly 
at a higher level than traditional store 
retailing, resulting in this judgement 
becoming more signiﬁ cant in 
determining the level of provision 
required.
The Group reported revenues in the 
period from the sale of food and general 
merchandise to international franchise 
partners and the sale of food to UK 
franchise partners.
The complexity of pricing structures 
across franchise relationships, and the 
Group’s expansion into new franchise 
agreements, create a risk that revenue 
may be misstated due to the speciﬁ c 
terms of business agreed with each 
franchise partner. In addition, as explained 
on page 29 of the Strategic Report, 
international franchise markets have 
been particularly challenging due to the 
economic and political environments 
in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine, 
giving rise to a further risk that franchise 
receivables may be irrecoverable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We considered each revenue-impacting 
provision individually, and assessed the 
appropriateness of the assumptions and 
judgements applied.
For the key assumptions used in the 
gift card, voucher and loyalty scheme 
provisions, we assessed the historic rates 
of redemption and compared these to the 
directors’ judgements. 
We assessed the appropriateness of the 
methodology applied in calculating the 
returns provision, and compared the 
calculated provision to the actual level 
of returns recorded subsequent to the 
period end. 
We reviewed a sample of franchise 
agreements, including new agreements 
during the period. Our review speciﬁ cally 
focused on:
>  Assessing the pricing structure and 
determining whether revenue has been 
recognised in line with the terms of the 
agreement including the consideration 
of any rights to return old inventories.
>  
Considering the payment terms and 
comparing them to the payment 
patterns experienced with the 
franchise partner. 
We independently assessed the 
recoverability of franchise receivables 
more than 30 days past due under the 
franchise agreement, and all receivables 
from franchises in the Middle East, Russia 
and Ukraine due to the risks identiﬁ ed 
above. Our assessment included reviewing 
historic payment patterns for selected 
franchises, checking cash received 
subsequent to the reporting date, 
considering correspondence received 
from franchise partners by the Group, 
and challenging management on the 
judgements applied in calculating any 
provision for doubtful debts. For the most 
signiﬁ cant franchises, we obtained external 
conﬁ rmations of key agreement terms, 
and the balance due for payment as at 
28 March 201 5.
Findings We are satisﬁ ed that the key 
assumptions applied in calculating the 
gift card, voucher and loyalty scheme 
provisions are appropriate. The run-rate 
applied to calculate the provision for 
refunds is appropriate and testing 
performed in relation to recognition of 
revenues from franchise partners or the 
recoverability of any amounts outstanding 
at the year end proved satisfactory.
Risk description
As described in the Accounting Policies 
in note 1 to the ﬁ nancial statements, the 
Group recognises a reduction in cost of 
sales as a result of amounts receivable 
from suppliers, primarily comprising 
contributions in relation to promotions 
in the Food business, strategic volume 
moves and some annual volume-based 
rebates. The majority of these 
contributions tend to be small in unit value 
but high in volume and span relatively 
short periods of time, although these can 
be across the ﬁ nancial year end. There are 
a small number of larger arrangements, 
which relate to multi-year periods.
Judgement is required in determining 
the period over which the reduction in 
cost of sales should be recognised, 
requiring both a detailed understanding of 
the contractual arrangements themselves 
as well as complete and accurate source 
data to apply the arrangements to.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We tested that amounts recognised were 
accurate and recorded in the correct 
period based on the contractual 
performance obligations by agreeing a 
sample to individual supplier agreements. 
We circularised a sample of suppliers to 
test whether the arrangements recorded 
were complete and interviewed a sample 
of buyers to supplement our 
understanding of the contractual 
arrangements.
We tested the completeness and accuracy 
of the systematic inputs to the 
calculations for recording supplier rebates 
and discounts by agreement to supporting 
evidence, including volume data and 
promotion dates.
We performed revenue and margin 
analysis to understand detailed trends 
by product category in order to identify 
apparent anomalies which may indicate 
potential rebate income errors. Such 
anomalies were investigated to assess 
whether they were indicative of a mis-
application of contractual terms or other 
calculation errors.
We also tested a sample of invoices and 
debit notes raised post year end to test the 
completeness and accuracy of accrued 
supplier income at 28 March 2015. In 
addition we tested the recoverability of 
the amounts due at the year end.
Findings The results of our testing were 
satisfactory. We consider the disclosure 
given around supplier rebates to provide 
an accurate understanding of the types 
of rebate income received and the impact 
on the statement of ﬁ nancial position as at 
28 March 2015.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
Risk description
As described in the Accounting Policies in 
note 1 and in notes 1 1 and 1 2 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Group has a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension plan for its UK employees, which 
was closed t o new entrants with eff ect from 
1 April 2002, and a funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland, 
where no new beneﬁ ts have accrued since 
31 October 20 1 3.
At 28 March 201 5, the Group recorded a net 
retirement beneﬁ t asset of £449.0m, being 
the net of scheme assets of £8,596.5m and 
scheme liabilities of £8,1 47 .5m. The Group’s 
net retirement beneﬁ t asset has shown 
signiﬁ cant volatility, as the valuation is 
sensitive to changes in key assumptions 
such as the discount rate and inﬂ ation 
estimates. The setting of assumptions 
is complex and an area of signiﬁ cant 
judgement.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We evaluated the directors’ assessment of 
the assumptions made in the valuation of the 
scheme assets and liabilities, and evaluated 
the information contained within the 
actuarial valuation reports for each scheme.
We tested the membership census data used 
in the valuation of the schemes and, with 
support from our own actuarial specialists, 
we considered the valuation process applied 
by the Group’s actuaries, the scope of the 
valuation performed and the key 
assumptions applied, and evaluated their 
expertise. We benchmarked and performed a 
sensitivity analysis on the key variables in the 
valuation model, including:
>  
Salary increases.
>  
Inﬂ ation rates.
>  Mortality rates.
>  Discount rates.
We obtained asset conﬁ rmations or carried 
out other audit procedures to test the 
completeness and accuracy of the 
scheme assets.
Findings From the work performed above 
we are satisﬁ ed that all assumptions applied 
in respect of the valuation of the scheme 
assets and liabilities are appropriate.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT CONTINUED
IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR’S AUDIT REPORT, THE FOLLOWING RISKS WERE ALSO INCLUDED:
Impairment of goodwill and brands; and Management override of controls.
These have not been included as key risks in 
the current year.
Our application of materiality
We determined materiality for the 
Group to be £32.0m.
We reported all audit diff erences 
in excess of £1.0m. 
We deﬁ ne materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the ﬁ nancial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or inﬂ uenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £32.0m, which is approximately 5% 
of pre-tax proﬁ t and below 1 % of equity. 
The materiality used by the predecessor 
auditor in 201 4 was £3 1.0m, which 
represented 5% of pre-tax proﬁ t adjusted 
for non-GAAP performance measures.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to the Committee all audit 
diff erences in excess of £1.0m (201 4: the 
predecessor auditor reported on all 
diff erences identiﬁ ed above £1.5m) as well 
as diff erences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identiﬁ ed when assessing 
the overall presentation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion
>  
The part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
>  
The information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
ﬁ nancial year for which the ﬁ nancial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the ﬁ nancial statements.
Audit components
We performed a full scope audit on 
components representing 99% of 
the Group’s revenue and 95% of the 
Group’s proﬁ t before tax and 76% 
of the Group’s net assets. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the 
consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to conﬁ rm our 
conclusion that there were no signiﬁ cant risks 
of material misstatement of the aggregated 
ﬁ nancial information of the remaining 
components not subject to a full audit.
We visited all signiﬁ cant 
components during the year 
The most signiﬁ cant component of 
the Group is its retail business in the 
United Kingdom, which accounts for 89% 
of the Group’s revenue, 9 1 % of the Group’s 
operating proﬁ t and 50% of the Group’s 
net assets. The Group audit team performs 
the audit of the UK business without 
the involvement of a component team. 
During the course of our audit, the Group 
audit team conducted 1 6 distribution 
centre and 27 retail store visits in the UK 
to understand the current trading 
performance and, at certain locations, 
perform tests of internal controls and 
validate levels of inventory held.
Since this was our ﬁ rst year as the Group’s 
auditor, we visited each of the eight 
signiﬁ cant locations outlined above at 
least once. Each component was visited 
during our transition, planning and risk 
assessment process, in order for a senior 
member of the Group audit team to 
obtain a thorough understanding of the 
operations, risks and control environments 
of each component. For more signiﬁ cant 
or complex components, we conducted a 
second visit during the audit to review the 
component auditor’s working papers and 
attend key meetings with component 
management.
Going forward, we will follow a programme 
of planned visits that has been designed so 
that a senior member of the Group audit 
team visits each of the locations where 
the Group audit scope was focused at 
least once every two years, and the most 
signiﬁ cant of them at least once a year. 
In years when we do not visit a signiﬁ cant 
component we will include the component 
audit team in our team brieﬁ ng, discuss 
their risk assessment, and review 
documentation of the ﬁ ndings from 
their work.
In addition to our visits in these locations, 
senior members of each component 
audit team attended a two-day training 
programme hosted by the Group audit 
team covering topics which included 
understanding the business and its core 
strategy, a discussion of the signiﬁ cant 
risks and workshops on our planned 
audit approach.

Scope of audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. The 
Group has retail operations in 59 countries, 
of which 1 7 are wholly-owned businesses, 
two are joint ventures, and 40 operate 
under franchise agreements (in addition 
to two wholly-owned businesses which 
also operate franchise agreements in 
those territories). 
Based on that assessment, we focused our 
Group audit scope primarily on the audit 
work at eight wholly-owned locations: 
United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Czech 
Republic, Greece, Turkey, India, China and 
Hong Kong. All of these were subject to a 
full audit. These locations represent the 
principal business units and account for 
99% of the Group’s revenue and 95% of 
the Group’s proﬁ t before tax and 76% of 
the Group’s net assets. They were also 
selected to provide an appropriate basis 
for undertaking audit work to address 
the risks of material misstatement 
identiﬁ ed above. Whilst we audit the 
revenues received by the Group from 
franchise operations, which account for 
3% of the Group’s revenue, we do not audit 
the underlying franchise operations.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
>   
We have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit. 
>   Adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited

>  The parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also 
required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not 
in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required 
to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with ten provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.
Our duty to read other information 
in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
>  Materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements.
>  Apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit.
>  Otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identiﬁ ed any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that 
we communicated to the Audit Committee 
which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We conﬁ rm that we have not 
identiﬁ ed any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements and for being satisﬁ ed 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
We also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our 
audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are 
eff ective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review 
team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 1 6 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁ nancial statements suffi  cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of:
>  Whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the 
parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed. 
>   The reasonableness of signiﬁ cant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors.
>   The overall presentation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
In addition, we read all the ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited ﬁ nancial statements 
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 Basis of preparation 
 The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as 
adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors have considered the business activities 
as set out on pages 1 to 3 1 as well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 24 to 25. Based on the Group’s 
cash ﬂ ow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisﬁ ed that the 
Group will be able to operate within the level of its facilities for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason the Group continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its ﬁ nancial statements. 
The following IFRS, IFRS IC interpretations and amendments are 
eff ective for the ﬁ rst time in this ﬁ nancial year:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 1 1 ‘ Joint 
Arrangements’ and IFRS 1 2 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities’ and the amendments to IAS 27 (201 1 ) ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’ and IAS 28 (201 1 ) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’. These have not had a material impact on the Group.
 There are no IFRS, IFRS IC interpretations or amendments that have 
been issued but are not yet eff ective that would be expected to 
have a material impact on the Group.
The Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership has taken 
an exemption under paragraph 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) 
Regulations 2008 for the requirement to prepare and deliver 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with the Companies Act. 
A summary of the Company’s and the Group’s accounting policies 
is given below:  
Accounting convention 
 The ﬁ nancial statements are drawn up on the historical cost basis 
of accounting, as modiﬁ ed by ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value through proﬁ t 
and loss. 
 Basis of consolidation 
 The Group ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial 
statements of Marks and Spencer Group plc and all its subsidiaries 
made up to the year end date. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. 
 Subsidiaries 
 Subsidiary undertakings are all entities (including special purpose 
entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial 
and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of 
more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiary undertakings 
acquired during the year are recorded using the acquisition 
method of accounting and their results are included from the 
date of acquisition. 
The separable net assets, including property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets, of the newly acquired subsidiary undertakings 
are incorporated into the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements on the 
basis of the fair value as at the eff ective date of control. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between Group companies are eliminated.  
Revenue 
 Revenue comprises sales of goods to customers outside the Group 
less an appropriate deduction for actual and expected returns, 
discounts and loyalty scheme vouchers, and is stated net of value 
added tax and other sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when goods 
are delivered and the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the buyer. 
Supplier income
In line with industry practice, the Group enters into agreements with 
suppliers to share the costs and beneﬁ ts of promotional activity 
and volume growth. The Group receives income from its suppliers 
based on the speciﬁ c agreements in place. This supplier income 
received is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales based 
on the entitlement that has been earned up to the balance 
sheet date for each relevant supplier agreement. Marketing 
contributions, equipment hire and other non-judgemental, ﬁ xed 
rate supplier charges are not included in the Group’s deﬁ nition of 
supplier income.
The types of supplier income recognised by the Group and the 
recognition policies are:
A. Promotional contributions: Includes supplier contributions to 
promotional giveaways and pre-agreed contributions to annual 
‘spend and save’ activity. 
Income is recognised as a deduction to cost of sales over the 
relevant promotional period. Income is calculated and invoiced 
at the end of the promotional period based on actual sales or 
according to ﬁ xed contribution arrangements. Contributions 
earned but not invoiced are accrued at the end of the 
relevant period.
B. Volume-based rebates: Includes annual growth incentives, 
seasonal contributions and contributions to share economies of 
scale resulting from moving product supply.
Annual growth incentives are calculated and invoiced at the end of 
the year, once earned, based on ﬁ xed percentage growth targets 
agreed for each supplier at the beginning of the year. They are 
recognised as a reduction in cost of sales in the year to which they 
relate. Other rebates are agreed with the supplier and spread 
over the relevant season/contract period to which they relate. 
Contributions earned but not invoiced are accrued at the end of 
the relevant period.
Uncollected supplier income at the balance sheet date is classiﬁ ed 
within the ﬁ nancial statements as follows:
A. Trade and other payables: The majority of income due from 
suppliers is netted against amounts owed to that supplier as 
the Group has the right to off set these balances. As such the 
outstanding supplier income within trade and other payables 
at year end is immaterial.
B. Trade and other receivables: Supplier income that has been 
earned but not invoiced at the balance sheet date is recognised in 
Trade and other receivables and primarily relates to volume based 
rebates that run up to the period end.
In order to provide users of the accounts with greater understanding 
in this area, additional balance sheet disclosure is provided in note 1 7 
to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Dividends  
Final dividends are recorded in the ﬁ nancial statements in the 
period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are 
approved and paid. 
 Pensions 
 Funded pension plans are in place for the Group’s UK employees 
and some employees overseas. 
For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes, the diff erence between the 
fair value of the assets and the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation is recognised as an asset or liability in the statement 
of ﬁ nancial position. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is actuarially 
calculated using the projected unit credit method. 
The service cost of providing retirement beneﬁ ts to employees 
during the year, together with the cost of any beneﬁ ts relating to 
past service, is charged to operating proﬁ t in the year.  95

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
 Pensions continued
The net interest cost on the net retirement beneﬁ t asset/liability is 
calculated by applying the discount rate, measured at the beginning 
of the year, to the net deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset/liability and is included 
as a single net amount in ﬁ nance income. 
Remeasurements being actuarial gains and losses, together with 
the diff erence between actual investment returns and the return 
implied by the net interest cost, are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.  
Intangible assets  
A. Goodwill  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the 
excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the 
identiﬁ able assets and liabilities (including intangible assets) of the 
acquired entity at the date of the acquisition. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and assessed for impairment annually or as triggering 
events occur. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.  
B. Brands  Acquired brand values are held on the statement of 
ﬁ nancial position initially at cost. Deﬁ nite life intangibles are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
Indeﬁ nite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually or as 
triggering events occur. Any impairment in value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  
C. Software intangibles  Where computer software is not an 
integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software 
is treated as an intangible asset. Capitalised software costs include 
external direct costs of goods and services, as well as internal 
payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated 
with the project. 
Capitalised software development costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected economic lives, normally 
between three and ten years. Computer software under 
development is held at cost less any recognised impairment 
loss. Any impairment in value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
 Property, plant and equipment 
 The Group’s policy is to state property, plant and equipment at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
loss. Property is not revalued for accounting purposes. Assets in 
the course of construction are held at cost less any recognised 
impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying 
assets, borrowing costs. 
Depreciation is provided to write off  the cost of tangible non-
current assets (including investment properties), less estimated 
residual values, by equal annual instalments as follows: 
>  Freehold land – not depreciated.
> Freehold and leasehold buildings with a remaining lease term 
over 50 years – depreciated to their residual value over their 
estimated remaining economic lives.
> Leasehold buildings with a remaining lease term of less than 
50 years – depreciated over the remaining period of the lease.
>  Fixtures, ﬁ ttings and equipment – three to 25 years according 
to the estimated life of the asset.
 Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually. 
Depreciation is charged on all additions to, or disposals of, 
depreciating assets in the year of purchase or disposal. 
Any impairment in value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Leasing 
 Where assets are ﬁ nanced by leasing agreements and the risks and 
rewards are substantially transferred to the Group (ﬁ nance leases) 
the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright, and 
the corresponding liability to the leasing company is included as 
an obligation under ﬁ nance leases. Depreciation on leased assets 
is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned 
assets, unless the term of the lease is shorter. Leasing payments 
are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the 
interest is charged to the income statement. 
All other leases are operating leases and the costs in respect of 
operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The value of any lease incentive received to take on 
an operating lease (for example, a rent free period) is recognised 
as deferred income and is released over the life of the lease. 
 Leasehold prepayments 
 Payments made to acquire leasehold land and buildings are 
included in prepayments at cost and are amortised over the life 
of the lease. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents includes short-term deposits with banks 
and other ﬁ nancial institutions, with an initial maturity of three 
months or less and credit card payments received within 48 hours. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories are valued on a weighted average cost basis and carried 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct 
expenditure and other attributable costs incurred in bringing 
inventories to their present location and condition. All inventories 
are ﬁ nished goods. Certain purchases of inventories may be subject 
to cash ﬂ ow hedges for foreign exchange risk. The Group applies a 
basis adjustment for those purchases in a way that the cost is initially 
established by reference to the hedged exchange rate and not the 
spot rate at the day of purchase.
 Provisions 
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to present value 
where the eff ect is material. 
Share-based payments 
 The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is 
measured at the date of grant. The Group measures the fair value 
of each award using the Black-Scholes model where appropriate. 
The fair value of each award is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate 
of the share awards that will eventually vest. The level of vesting is 
reviewed at each reporting period and the charge is adjusted to 
reﬂ ect actual and estimated levels of vesting. 
 Foreign currencies 
 The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the weighted 
average of monthly exchange rates for revenue and proﬁ ts. The 
statements of ﬁ nancial position of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated at year end exchange rates. The resulting exchange 
diff erences are dealt with through reserves and reported in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting 
period are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. The resulting 
exchange gain or loss is recognised within the income statement, 
except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying 
cash ﬂ ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. 96

 Taxation 
 Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised 
in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using a temporary diff erence 
approach, and is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on temporary diff erences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities in the statement of ﬁ nancial position and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t. 
Deferred tax is calculated based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, applying tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary diff erences. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
for taxable temporary diff erences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the 
reversal of the temporary diff erence can be controlled by the 
Group and it is probable that the diff erence will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary diff erences 
that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which the deductible 
temporary diff erences can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
suffi  cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of 
temporary diff erences that arise on initial recognition of assets 
and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. 
 Financial instruments 
 Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of ﬁ nancial position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 A. Trade and other receivables  Trade receivables are recorded 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
As such, this results in their recognition at nominal value less any 
allowance for any doubtful debts. 
 B. Other ﬁ nancial assets Other ﬁ nancial assets consist of 
investments in debt and equity securities and short-term 
investments, and are classiﬁ ed as either ‘available-for-sale’ or ‘fair 
value through proﬁ t or loss’. Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets are 
initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the ﬁ nancial asset. Financial assets 
held at fair value through proﬁ t or loss are initially recognised at fair 
value and transaction costs are expensed. 
Where securities are designated as ‘fair value through proﬁ t or loss’, 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in 
proﬁ t or loss for the period. For ‘available-for-sale’ investments, 
gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
in comprehensive income, until the security is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in comprehensive income is included 
in the proﬁ t or loss for the period. Equity investments that do not 
have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value 
cannot be reliably measured by other means are held at cost. 
 C. Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial liabilities and equity  Financial 
liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed according to the 
substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
 D. Bank borrowings  Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
initially recorded at fair value, which equals the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. They are subsequently held at amortised 
cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for using an 
eff ective interest rate method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise. 
 E. Loan notes  Long-term loans are initially measured at fair value 
and are subsequently held at amortised cost unless the loan is 
hedged by a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument in which case hedge 
accounting treatment will apply. 
 F. Trade and other payables  Trade and other payables are recorded 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Generally this results in their recognition at their nominal value. 
 G. Equity instruments  Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recorded at the consideration received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging activities 
 The Group primarily uses interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
currency contracts to manage its exposures to ﬂ uctuations in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These instruments 
are initially recognised at fair value on the trade date and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of the 
reporting period. The method of recognising the resulting gain 
or loss is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as 
a hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either: 
>  A hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in 
the cash ﬂ ows of a recognised asset or liability (a cash ﬂ ow hedge). 
> A hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability (a fair value hedge).
> A hedge of the exposure on the translation of net investments in 
foreign entities (a net investment hedge). 
At inception of a hedging relationship, the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item are documented and prospective eff ectiveness 
testing is performed. During the life of the hedging relationship, 
eff ectiveness testing is performed to ensure the instrument 
remains an eff ective hedge of the transaction. Changes in the fair 
value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise. 
 A. Cash ﬂ ow hedges  Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments that are designated and eff ective as hedges of future 
cash ﬂ ows are recognised in other comprehensive income and any 
ineff ective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. If the ﬁ rm commitment or forecast transaction that is 
the subject of a cash ﬂ ow hedge results in the recognition of a non-
ﬁ nancial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is 
recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in comprehensive income are included 
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
 For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a 
liability, amounts deferred in comprehensive income are recognised 
in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged 
items aff ect proﬁ t or loss.  97

Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging activities 
continued
 B. Fair value hedges The changes in the fair value of a derivative 
instrument designated in a fair value hedge, or for non-derivatives 
the foreign currency component of carrying value, are recognised in 
proﬁ t or loss. The hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry 
in proﬁ t or loss. 
 C. Net investment hedges  Changes in the fair value of derivative 
or non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that are designated and 
eff ective as hedges of net investments are recognised in 
comprehensive income in the hedging reserve and any ineff ective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. 
 D. Discontinuance of hedge accounting  Hedge accounting is 
discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in comprehensive income is retained in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in comprehensive income is transferred to proﬁ t or loss 
for the period. 
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge income statement 
translation exposures. 
 Embedded derivatives 
 Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts 
and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded 
derivatives are carried in the statement of ﬁ nancial position at fair 
value from the inception of the host contract. 
Changes in fair value are recognised within the income statement 
during the period in which they arise. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
 The preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements requires 
the Group to make estimates and assumptions that aff ect the 
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and 
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may diff er from these estimates. The estimates and 
assumptions which have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are: 
 A. Impairment of goodwill and brands  The Group is required to 
test annually or as triggering events occur, whether the goodwill 
or brands have suff ered any impairment. The recoverable amount 
is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this 
method requires the estimation of future cash ﬂ ows and the choice 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of 
these cash ﬂ ows. Where there is a non-controlling interest, goodwill 
is tested for the business as a whole. This involves a notional increase 
to goodwill, to reﬂ ect the non-controlling shareholders’ interest. 
Actual outcomes could vary from those calculated. See note 1 4 
for further details. 
 B. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and computer 
software  Property, plant and equipment and computer software 
are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a 
review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the 
basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. See notes 1 4 
and 1 5 for further details. 
 C. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and 
amortisation of computer software  Depreciation and 
amortisation is provided so as to write down the assets to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives as set out above. 
The selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires 
the exercise of management judgement. See notes 1 4 and 1 5 for 
further details. 
D. Post-retirement beneﬁ ts  The determination of the pension 
cost and deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes depends on the selection of certain assumptions 
which include the discount rate, inﬂ ation rate, salary growth, 
mortality and expected return on scheme assets. Diff erences 
arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions 
will be reﬂ ected in subsequent periods. See note 1 1 for further 
details of assumptions and note 1 2 for critical judgements 
associated with the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme interest 
in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership. 
 E. Refunds, gift cards and loyalty schemes  Accruals for sales 
returns, deferred income in relation to loyalty scheme redemptions 
and gift card and credit voucher redemptions are estimated on the 
basis of historical returns and redemptions. These are recorded so as 
to allocate them to the same period as that in which original revenue 
is recorded. These balances are reviewed regularly and updated to 
reﬂ ect management’s latest best estimates. However, actual returns 
and redemptions could vary from those estimates. 
 F. Inventory valuation  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value, on a weighted average cost basis which 
requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to 
customers in the future.
 Non-underlying items
 The directors believe that the underlying proﬁ t and earnings 
per share measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. 
These measures are consistent with how underlying business 
performance is measured internally. The underlying proﬁ t before 
tax measure is not a recognised proﬁ t measure under IFRS and may 
not be directly comparable with adjusted proﬁ t measures used by 
other companies. The adjustments made to reported proﬁ t before 
tax are to exclude the following: 
>  Proﬁ ts and losses on the disposal of properties or impairments of 
properties where commitment to close has been demonstrated.
> One-off  pension credits arising on changes to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
schemes’ rules and practices.
> Interest relating to signiﬁ cant and one-off  repayments from tax 
litigation claims.
> Restructuring costs. 
> Signiﬁ cant and one-off  impairment charges and provisions that 
distort underlying trading. 
> Fair value movement in ﬁ nancial instruments.
> Costs relating to strategy changes that are not considered 
normal operating costs of the underlying business.
> Adjustment in income from HSBC in relation to M&S Bank due to a 
non-recurring provision recognised by M&S Bank for the cost of 
providing redress to customers in respect of possible mis-selling 
of M&S Bank ﬁ nancial products.
> Ex-gratia payment received from HSBC in relation to the mis-
selling of ﬁ nancial products. 98

2 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
 IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identiﬁ ed on the basis of internal reporting on components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identiﬁ ed as the executive directors. The executive directors review the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment. The operating segments are UK and 
International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations. The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer 
owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating proﬁ t. This measurement 
basis excludes the eff ects of non-underlying items from the operating segments. Central costs are all classiﬁ ed as UK costs and presented 
within UK operating proﬁ t. The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments and gross proﬁ t within the UK segment. 
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure, analysing revenue within the reportable 
segments by subcategory and gross proﬁ t within the UK segment by subcategory. 
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and results by reportable segment:

 5 NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
 The adjustments made to reported proﬁ t before tax are income and charges that are one-off  in nature, signiﬁ cant and distort the Group’s 
underlying performance. These adjustments include:
>  The Group has an economic interest in M&S Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, by way of a Relationship Agreement that entitles 
the Group to a 50% share of the proﬁ ts of M&S Bank after appropriate deductions. The Group does not share in any losses of M&S Bank and 
is not obliged to refund any fees received from M&S Bank although future income may be impacted by signiﬁ cant one-off  deductions. 
  Since the year ended 3 1 December 201 2 M&S Bank has recognised an estimated liability for redress to customers in respect of possible 
mis-selling of ﬁ nancial products in its audited ﬁ nancial statements. The Group’s fee income from M&S Bank has been reduced by the 
deduction of this estimated liability (under the Relationship Agreement) in both the current and prior years. The total charge to date for 
the deduction in the Group’s fee income is £1 39.2m. The deduction in the period is £53.7m. This has been treated as a non-underlying 
adjustment to reported proﬁ t before tax, in line with previous periods. 
  On 26 September 201 4 the Group reached agreement with M&S Bank and HSBC over a number of issues in connection with the 
Relationship Agreement (including the extent of historical mis-selling charges). This resulted in an ex-gratia payment of £40.0m by HSBC 
which was recognised as a non-underlying credit in the period (net of £0.1 m legal fees), consistent with the deduction to the Group’s fee 
income. On the same basis as previous periods, any future increase in the liability recognised by M&S Bank will result in a further reduction 
in the Group’s fee income.
> Restructuring costs relating to the Group’s strategy to transition to a one tier distribution network and the closure costs of the legacy 
logistics sites (current period cost of £10.2m). To date, £72.7m has been expensed in relation to this programme. Restructuring costs 
have been incurred in Ireland in previous periods following a thorough commercial review of the Ireland business. In the current period, 
resolution has been reached on a number of employee matters in Ireland resulting in the recognition of a net credit of £5.6m.
> IAS 39 fair value movement of the embedded derivative in a lease contract based upon the expected future RPI versus the lease contract 
in which rent increases are capped at 2.5%, with a ﬂ oor of 1.5%.
> A small number of stores have been closed or are committed to close at year end resulting in a charge of £6.9m in the year from loss on 
disposals (£2.3m) and asset impairments (£4.6m). The proﬁ t on property disposal in the prior year relates to the sale of a warehouse site 
and mock shop in White City on 26 July 201 3 to St James Group Ltd for a total consideration of £100m, £25m received on completion and 
the remaining consideration to be deferred over three years.
> International store review in the current year relates to the impairment of assets (£34.9m) and onerous lease provisions (£2.3m) in 
underperforming stores in Western Europe, Ireland and China. The prior year charge relates to the impairment of assets (£1 3.6m) and 
onerous lease provisions (£8.3m) in underperforming International stores in non-strategic locations in China and the Czech Group.
> Pension credit recognised in the prior year as a result of changes to the Marks and Spencer Ireland deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme rules (£1 7 .5m) 
whereby the discretions for post-retirement pension increases were removed and prior year pension credit arising from the cessation of 
the practice of granting pension increases to transferred-in pensions for all members in the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme (£10.0m).
> Strategic programme costs relating to the strategy announcements made in November 2010, including the costs associated with 
the initial Focus on the UK plans. These included asset write-off s and accelerated depreciation. These costs were not considered normal 
operating costs of the business. We do not anticipate incurring any further cost in relation to this programme.
> Interest income (and related fees incurred) in the prior year on tax repayment relating to the successful outcome of litigation in relation 
to the Group’s claim for UK tax relief of losses of its former European subsidiaries. 
The adjustments made to reported proﬁ t before tax to arrive at underlying proﬁ t are:

 8 EARNINGS PER SHARE
 The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year.
The underlying earnings per share ﬁ gures have also been calculated based on earnings before items that are one-off  in nature, signiﬁ cant 
and are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business (see note 5). These have been calculated to allow the 
shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. The Group has four classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees 
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year, unvested shares 
granted under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, unvested shares granted under the Restricted Share Plan and unvested shares within 
the Performance Share Plan that have met the relevant performance conditions at the end of the reporting period.

11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
 The Group provides pension arrangements for the beneﬁ t of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme (a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t arrangement which was closed to new entrants with eff ect from 1 April 2002) and Your M&S Pension Saving Plan (a deﬁ ned 
contribution arrangement which has been open to new members with eff ect from 1 April 2003).
The deﬁ ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund, such 
contributions are based upon a ﬁ xed percentage of employees’ pay. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid. Members’ beneﬁ ts are determined by the amount of contributions 
paid by the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each 
individual’s chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement. As a result, actuarial risk (that beneﬁ ts 
will be lower than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations) fall on the employee. 
The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t arrangement operates on a ﬁ nal salary basis and at the year end had some 1 2,000 active members (last year 1 3,000), 
54,000 deferred members (last year 55,000) and 5 1,000 pensioners (last year 5 1,000). At the year end, the deﬁ ned contribution arrangement 
had some 38,000 active members (last year 38,000) and some 6,000 deferred members (last year 5,000). The scheme is governed by a 
Trustee board which is independent of the Group. 
The Group also operates a small funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland. This scheme closed to future accrual 
from 3 1 October 201 3. Retirement beneﬁ ts also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement beneﬁ ts. 105

Within the total Group retirement beneﬁ t cost of £7 4.9m (last year £53.5m), £33.7m (last year £27 .0m) relates to the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
scheme, £36.4m (last year £39.2m) to the UK deﬁ ned contribution scheme and £4.8m (last year £1 2.7m) to other retirement beneﬁ t schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the UK Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Pension Scheme was carried out at 3 1 March 201 2 and showed a deﬁ cit of 
£290m. As a result, a funding plan of £1 1 2m cash contributions was agreed with the Trustees. The Group contributed payments of £28m to 
the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme in March 201 4 and March 201 5 in the current ﬁ nancial year, and expects to contribute an additional £28m 
each year until March 201 7 . The diff erence between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by better than expected 
investment returns on the scheme’s assets. Future contributions to meet the cost of accruing beneﬁ ts to the UK scheme are made at 
the rate of 23.4% of pensionable salaries up to the next full actuarial valuation. 
By funding its deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than 
anticipated. This could occur for several reasons, for example:
>  Investment returns on the schemes’ assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar 
falls in the value of the schemes’ liabilities.
> The level of price inﬂ ation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes.
> Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to unanticipated advances in medical healthcare. Members may 
also exercise (or not exercise) options in a way that leads to increases in the schemes’ liabilities, for example through early retirement 
or commutation of pension for cash.
>  Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes’ liabilities.
 In addition, the Group has an obligation to the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme via the interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership (refer to 
note 1 2), through which the Group is exposed to additional risks. In particular, under the legal terms of the Partnership, a default by the 
Group on the rental payments to the Partnership or a future change in legislation could trigger earlier or higher payments, or an increase 
in the collateral to be provided by the Group.

The asset recognised for the UK Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Scheme is based on the assumption that the full surplus will ultimately be available to the 
Group as a future refund of surplus.
 B. Financial assumptions
 The ﬁ nancial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been 
updated by independent qualiﬁ ed actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 1 9 ‘Employee Beneﬁ ts’ in order to assess the 
liabilities of the schemes and are as follows:
2015
%
2014
%
Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0
Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service 1.9–3.0 2.2–3.3
Discount rate 3.10 4.45
Inﬂ ation rate 3.1 3.4
Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.1 7.4
The inﬂ ation rate of 3.1% reﬂ ects the Retail Price Index (RPI) rate. Certain beneﬁ ts have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) as the inﬂ ationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.1 % (last year 2.4%) has been used.  106

C. Demographic assumptions
 Apart from post-retirement mortality, the demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of 
the scheme performed as at 3 1 March 201 2. The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality 
trends under the scheme for the period to March 201 2 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent 
years. The speciﬁ c mortality rates used are based on the VITA lite tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners. 
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows:
2015 2014
Current pensioners (at age 65)  – males 22.7 22.4
 – females 24.4 24.1
Future pensioners (at age 65)  – males 22.4 21.8
 – females 25.1 24.6
Deferred pensioners (at age 65)  – males 23.2 22.6
  – females 26.0 25.4
D. Sensitivity analysis
The table below summarises the estimated impact of changes in the principal actuarial assumptions on the pension scheme surplus:
2015 
£m
2014 
£m
(Decrease)/increase in scheme surplus caused by an increase in the discount rate of 0.25% (last year 0.5%) (70.0) 50.0
Increase/(decrease) in scheme surplus caused by an increase in the inﬂ ation rate of 0.25% 30.0 (50.0)
Increase in scheme surplus caused by a decrease in the average life expectancy of one year 330.0 230.0 
The sensitivity analysis above is based on a change in one assumption while holding all others constant. Therefore interdependencies 
between the assumptions have not been taken into account within the analysis.
E. Analysis of assets
 The investment strategy of the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme is driven by its liability proﬁ le, in particular its inﬂ ation-linked pension 
beneﬁ ts. In addition to its interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership (refer to note 1 2), the scheme invests in diff erent types of bonds 
(including corporate bonds and gilts) and derivative instruments (including inﬂ ation, interest rate, cross-currency and total return swaps) in 
order to align movements in the value of its assets with movements in its liabilities arising from changes in market conditions. Broadly the 
scheme has hedging that covers 90% of interest rate movements and 85% of inﬂ ation movements, as measured on the Trustee’s funding 
assumptions which use a discount rate derived from gilt yields.
  The fair value of the plan assets at the end of the reporting period for each category are as follows:
2015

Cash and cash equivalents 306.2 444.1 
Other (9.8) 12.7 
8,596.5 6,729.4
 The fair values of the above equity and debt investments are determined based on publicly available market prices wherever available. 
Unquoted investments, hedge funds and reinsurance funds are stated at fair value estimates provided by the manager of the investment 
or fund. Property includes both quoted and unquoted investments. The market value of the Scottish Limited Partnership interest is based 
on the expected cash ﬂ ows and benchmark asset-backed credit spreads. It is the policy of the Scheme to hedge a proportion of interest rate 
and inﬂ ation risk. The Scheme reduces its foreign currency exposure using forward foreign exchange contracts.
At year end, the UK scheme indirectly held 1 99,032 (last year 1 99,523) ordinary shares in the Company through its investment in UK Equity 
Index Funds. 107

 12 MARKS AND SPENCER SCOTTISH LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
 Marks and Spencer plc is a general partner and the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme is a limited partner of the Marks and Spencer 
Scottish Limited Partnership (the Partnership). As such, the Partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group. 
The Partnership holds £1.6bn (last year £1.6bn) of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates. The 
Group retains control over these properties, including the ﬂ exibility to substitute alternative properties. The limited partnership interest 
(held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme) entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of £71.9m from the proﬁ ts 
of the Partnership earned from rental income. 
The Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK pension scheme of £5 1 2.9m (last year £568.7m) is valued at the net present value 
of the future expected distributions from the Partnership.
During the year to 28 March 201 5 an interest charge of £1 6.1 m (last year £1 7 .8m) was recognised in the income statement representing 
the unwinding of the discount included in this obligation. 
Under IAS 1 9, the Partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued 
at £53 1.3m (last year £57 4.7m), refer to note 1 1 E.
 13 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
This year a net credit of £1.1 m was recognised for share-based payments (last year charge of £2 1.3m). The total balance comprises a credit 
of £1 5.0m (last year charge of £4.1 m) relating to Performance Share Plans off set by a charge of £9.0m (last year charge of £9.6m) relating to 
the Save As You Earn Share Scheme. The remaining £4.9m charge is spread over the other schemes. Further details of the option and share 
schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 76. 
 A. Save As You Earn scheme 
Sharesave, the Company’s Save As You Earn scheme, was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM.  Under the terms of the scheme, 
the Board may off er options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each ﬁ nancial year to those employees who enter into 
Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved Save As You Earn (SA YE) savings contract. The price at which options may be off ered is 
80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the off er date. The options may normally be exercised 
during the six-month period after the completion of the SA YE contract.

For SA YE share options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 471.8p (last year 448.1 p).
The fair values of the options granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs

Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Company’s share price over a three-year period.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that 10% (last year 10%) of options will lapse 
over the service period as employees leave the Group. 109

B. Performance Share Plan* 
 The Performance Share Plan is the primary long-term incentive plan for approximately 1 50 of the most senior managers and was ﬁ rst 
approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM. Under the Plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be off ered. The extent 
to which an award vests is measured over a three-year period against a balanced scorecard of ﬁ nancial measures which currently include 
Earnings Per Share (EPS), Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and Revenue. The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during 
the three years will also be paid on vesting. Further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 68. Awards under this 
scheme have been made in each year since 2005. 
During the year, 7 ,338,609 shares (last year 7 ,1 1 3,690) were awarded under the Plan. The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded 
was 439.3p (last year 440.7p). As at 28 March 201 5, 1 8,805,388 shares (last year 2 1,1 70,536) were outstanding under the scheme. 
As set out on page 66 of this Annual Report, the Company’s existing Performance Share Plan expires in 201 5. The Company is therefore 
seeking shareholder approval in 201 5 for a replacement Plan, the rules and operation of which are substantially the same as the current Plan. 
Further details of the replacement Performance Share Plan can be found in the Notice of Meeting 201 5.
 C. Deferred Share Bonus Plan* 
 The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005/06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 550 of the most senior 
managers. As part of the scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three 
years. There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends 
earned during the deferred period will also be paid on vesting. 
During the year, 20,882 shares (last year 1,658,1 33) have been awarded under the Plan in relation to the annual bonus. The fair value of the 
shares awarded was 437 .0p (last year 437 .0p). As at 28 March 201 5, 2,487 ,477 shares (last year 5,024,1 49) were outstanding under the scheme. 
 D. Restricted Share Plan* 
 The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who 
are vital to the success of the business. The Plan operates for senior managers below executive director level. Awards vest at the end 
of the restricted period (typically between one and three years) subject to the participant still being in employment of the Company on 
the relevant vesting date. The value of any dividends earned during the restricted period will also be paid at the time of vesting. 
During the year, 1,001,076 shares (last year 798,1 96) have been awarded under the Plan. The weighted average fair value of the shares 
awarded was 450.5p (last year 479.2p). As at 28 March 201 5, 1,963,1 39 shares (last year 2,271,826) were outstanding under the scheme.
 E. Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn scheme 
 Sharesave, the Company’s Save As You Earn scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a ten-year period, 
after approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM. The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving 
to €500 per month. The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of €320 per month to align the maximum savings amount 
allowed within the UK scheme. When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total 
savings will buy when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme. The price at which the options may be 
off ered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the off er date. Options cannot normally be exercised 
until a minimum of three years has elapsed. 
During the year, 1 2 1,086 (last year 62,734) options were granted, at a fair value of 90.8p (last year 105.1 p). As at 28 March 201 5, 288,1 62 options 
(last year 25 1,545) were outstanding under the scheme.
 F. Marks and Spencer Employee Beneﬁ t Trust 
 The Marks and Spencer Employee Beneﬁ t Trust (the Trust) holds 3,9 1 2,1 20 (last year 2,595,343) shares with a book value of £1 9.1 m 
(last year £8.6m) and a market value of £20.7m (last year £1 1.8m). These shares were acquired by the Trust in the market and are shown as 
a reduction in retained earnings in the consolidated statement of ﬁ nancial position. Awards are granted to employees at the discretion 
of Marks and Spencer plc and the Trust agrees to satisfy the awards in accordance with the wishes of Marks and Spencer plc under senior 
executive share schemes. Dividends are waived on all of these plans. 
 * Nil cost options. For the purposes of calculating the number of shares awarded, the share price used is the average of the mid-market price for the ﬁ ve consecutive dealing days 
preceding the grant date. 110

  Impairment testing
 Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use 
calculations. Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) which include 
the combined retail and wholesale businesses for each location. 
Brands include the per una brand cost of £80.0m (net book value £24.2m) and the M&S Mode brand cost of £32.4m. The per una brand is a 
deﬁ nite life intangible asset and is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 1 5 years and is only assessed for impairment where 
such indicators exist. The M&S Mode brands have been attributed an indeﬁ nite life as they give the Group the future right to use the ‘M&S’ 
brand across Europe. This is consistent with the Group’s expansion plans in Europe and existing M&S brand recognition from its current 
presence. Similar to goodwill, the M&S Mode brands are assessed for impairment annually based on their value in use. The M&S Mode brands 
have been allocated for impairment testing across the European business. 
The value in use calculations use cash ﬂ ows based on detailed ﬁ nancial budgets prepared by management covering a three-year period. 
These budgets have regard to historical performance and knowledge of the current market, together with management’s views on the 
future achievable growth and the impact of committed initiatives. The cash ﬂ ows which derive from the budgets include ongoing capital 
expenditure required to maintain the store network. Cash ﬂ ows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a long-term 
growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate. The long-
term growth rate has been determined with reference to forecast GDP growth for the territories in which these businesses operate. 
Management believes this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available. The long-term growth rate used 
is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill and brands under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ and does not reﬂ ect long-term planning 
assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments. These growth rates do not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the Groups’ retail businesses. The pre-tax discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which speciﬁ c market-related premium adjustments are made. 111

The M&S Mode brands are tested based on the regions operating in the European business which are covered under the brand rights 
acquired. The discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 9.3% to 27 .9% (last year 1 3.1 % to 28.9%). Cash ﬂ ows beyond the 
three-year period have been extrapolated at long-term growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 4.0% (last year 1.0% to 2.5%).
  Sensitivity analysis
  Whilst management believes the assumptions are realistic it is possible that an impairment would be identiﬁ ed if any of the above key 
assumptions were changed signiﬁ cantly. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables 
held constant. Management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumptions that would cause the 
carrying amount of goodwill or brands to exceed the value in use.

3.  Interest on these bonds is payable semi-annually.
 Finance leases 
 The minimum lease payments under ﬁ nance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page. It is the Group’s policy to lease 
certain properties and equipment under ﬁ nance leases. The average lease term for equipment is six years (last year ﬁ ve years) and 1 24 years 
(last year 1 25 years) for property. Interest rates are ﬁ xed at the contract rate. All leases are on a ﬁ xed repayment basis and no arrangements 
have been entered into for contingent payments. The Group’s obligations under ﬁ nance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the 
leased assets.
 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 Treasury policy
 The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Group’s funding requirements and ﬁ nancial risks in line with the Board 
approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities. 
The Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade 
receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these ﬁ nancial instruments is to ﬁ nance the 
Group’s operations. 
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward 
currency contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations and ﬁ nancing. 
It remains the Group’s policy not to hold or issue ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes, except where ﬁ nancial constraints 
necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments. The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage 
in speculative trading.
 Financial risk management 
 The principal ﬁ nancial risks faced by the Group are liquidity and funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks. The policies 
and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages.
  (a) Liquidity and funding risk 
 The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due: 
>  The Group’s funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources off ering suffi  cient headroom, maturity and ﬂ exibility and cost 
eff ectiveness to match the requirements of the Group. 
> Marks and Spencer plc is ﬁ nanced by a combination of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated 
bank facilities. 
> Operating subsidiaries are ﬁ nanced by a combination of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings and intercompany loans.
 At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of £1.325bn set to mature on 28 September 201 8. This 
facility contains only one ﬁ nancial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, rents payable 
and exceptional items : to interest plus rents payable. The covenant is measured semi-annually. The Group also has a number of undrawn 
uncommitted facilities available to it. At year end, these amounted to £100m (last year £80m), all of which are due to be reviewed within 
a year. At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of £225m (last year £234m) was drawn under the committed facilities and £nil 
(last year £23m) was drawn under the uncommitted facilities. 
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of £3bn, of which £1.1 bn (last year £1.1bn) 
was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.  114

 (b) Counterparty risk 
 Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suff er ﬁ nancial loss through default or non-performance by ﬁ nancial institutions with 
whom it transacts. 
Exposures are managed in accordance with the Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved 
counterparty to minimise the risk of loss. The minimum long-term rating for all counterparties is long-term Standard & Poor’s(A-)/Moody’s 
(A3). Credit ratings quoted on the following page are in line with Standard & Poor’s equivalent. In the event of a downgrade by one rating 
agency and not the other, reference will be made to Fitch to determine the casting vote of the rating group. In the abscence of a Fitch rating 
the lower rating will prevail. Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management. The credit risk of these ﬁ nancial instruments is estimated 
as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts. 115

4.  Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to Treasury policy.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables £1 29m (last year £1 28m), other receivables 
£1 10m (last year £1 36m), cash and cash equivalents £206m (last year £1 82m) and derivatives £1 94m (last year £54m).
 (c) Foreign currency risk 
 Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import 
of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers. 
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out 
to 1 8 months. Where appropriate, hedge cover can be taken out for longer than 1 8 months, with Board approval. The Group is primarily 
exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro. 
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 
£1,59 1 m (last year £1,600m) with a weighted average maturity date of seven months (last year six months). 
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 28 March 201 5 will be released to the income statement at various 
dates over the following 1 6 months (last year 1 6 months) from the balance sheet date. 
The Group also holds a number of cross-currency swaps to re-designate its ﬁ xed rate US dollar debt to ﬁ xed rate sterling debt. These are 
reported as cash ﬂ ow hedges.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures. As at the balance 
sheet date €1 44m of currency debt (last year €1 62m of derivatives) and HK$ 1,398m (last year HK$698m) of derivatives were hedging 
overseas net assets. 
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist. Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the 
hedging of the Group’s foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised 
in the income statement. The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall £nil impact on the 
income statement. As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was £4 1 2m (last year £4 1 7m).  116

 The ﬂ oating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR. These rates are for periods between one and 
six months. 
As at the balance sheet date and excluding ﬁ nance leases, the ﬁ xed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.3% (last year 5.3%) 
and the weighted average time for which the rate is ﬁ xed is eight years (last year nine years). 
 (d) Interest rate risk 
 The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar and euro variable rate ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. 
The Group’s policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate borrowings to manage this risk. 
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash ﬂ ow 
hedges as appropriate. 
At the balance sheet date, ﬁ xed rate borrowings amounted to £1,321.2m (last year £1,233.1 m) representing the public bond issues and 
ﬁ nance leases, amounting to 66% (last year 59%) of the Group’s gross borrowings. 
The eff ective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows:

 The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to re-designate its sterling ﬁ xed debt to ﬂ oating debt. These are reported as fair value 
hedges. The ineff ective portion recognised in the proﬁ t or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to £0.3m (last year £0.5m) as 
the loss on the hedged item was £33.5m (last year £33.7m gain) and the gain on the hedging instrument was £33.8m (last year £34.2m loss). 
The Group also holds a number of cross-currency swaps to re-designate its ﬁ xed rate US dollar debt to ﬁ xed rate sterling debt. These are 
reported as cash ﬂ ow hedges.  117

 Sensitivity analysis 
 The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange 
and interest rates in relation to the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments. The directors consider that a 2% +/- (last year 2%) movement in interest 
rates and a 20% +/- (last year 20%) weakening in sterling against the relevant currency represents a reasonable possible change. However 
this analysis is for illustrative purposes only. 
The table excludes ﬁ nancial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged 
with another ﬁ nancial instrument. Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign 
exchange risk is hedged.
Interest rates: the impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reﬂ ects the eff ect on the Group’s ﬂ oating rate debt as 
at the balance sheet date. The impact in equity reﬂ ects the fair value movement in relation to the Group’s cross-currency swaps. 
Foreign exchange: the impact from foreign exchange movements reﬂ ects the change in the fair value of the Group’s transactional foreign 
exchange cash ﬂ ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date. The equity impact shown for foreign exchange 
sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments hedging net investments. This value is expected to be fully off set 
by the re-translation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.

Fair value hierarchy
 The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments by valuation technique:
> Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
> Level 2: not traded in an active market but the fair values are based on quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable 
levels of price transparency. The Group’s Level 2 ﬁ nancial instruments include interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. Fair value is 
calculated using discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology, future cash ﬂ ows are estimated based on forward exchange rates and interest rates 
(from observable market curves) and contract rates, discounted at a rate that reﬂ ects the credit risk of the various counterparties for 
those with a long maturity.
> Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁ cant eff ect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data. The fair value of the embedded derivative is calculated using an option valuation model based on the present value of a 35-year 
lease with annual lease payments increasing by Retail Price Index (RPI), capped and ﬂ oored at 1.5% and 2.5% respectively and then 
discounted back to the valuation date. The valuation is sensitive to changes in RPI.
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group held the following ﬁ nancial instruments at fair value:

 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers out of Level 3 fair value measurements in 
the current or prior reporting period. In addition to the above, the Group has £3.0m (last year £3.0m) in unlisted equity securities measured 
at cost.

£m
Opening balance 22.4 25.9 
Gains and losses recognised in the income statement 1.3 (3.5)
Closing balance 23.7 22.4
 The gains recognised in the income statement relate to the valuation of the embedded derivative in a lease contract. The fair value 
movement of the embedded derivative of £1.3m gain (last year £3.5m loss) is treated as adjustment to reported proﬁ t (see note 5).
 Fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments
 With the exception of the Group’s ﬁ xed rate bond debt and the Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme, there were 
no material diff erences between the carrying value of non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities and their fair values as at the 
balance sheet date. 
The carrying value of the Group’s ﬁ xed rate bond debt was £1,697 .7m (last year £1,605.9m), the fair value of this debt was £1,883.6m (last year 
£1,780.3m). The carrying value of the Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension scheme is £5 1 2.9m (last year £568.7m) and the 
fair value of this liability is £501.3m (last year £555.7m).
 Capital policy
 The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns 
for shareholders and to maintain an effi  cient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Group’s strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating, to operate within a 
net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.0x-1.5x and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure ﬁ nancial stability and ﬂ exibility. To achieve 
this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash ﬂ ow to net debt (see note 27) and ﬁ xed charge 
cover to maintain this position. In addition, the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom 
with a diverse and balanced long-term debt maturity proﬁ le. As at the balance sheet date the Group’s average debt maturity proﬁ le was 
eight years (last year nine years). During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 (stable) with Moody’s and 
BBB- (stable) with Standard & Poor’s.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 119

Property provisions relate to onerous lease contracts and dilapidations primarily arising as a result of the closure of stores in the UK, 
China and the Czech Group (see note 5). These provisions are expected to be utilised over the period to the end of each speciﬁ c lease. 
Restructuring provisions relate to the estimated costs of several strategic programmes including the closure of four stores in Ireland in the 
prior year and the current restructure of the logistics network (see note 5). These provisions are expected to be utilised within seven years.
 23 DEFERRED TAX
 Deferred tax is provided under the balance sheet liability method using a tax rate of 20% (last year 20%) for UK diff erences and local tax rates 
for overseas diff erences.

 Other short-term temporary diff erences relate mainly to employee share options and ﬁ nancial instruments. 
The deferred tax liability on land and buildings temporary diff erences is reduced by the beneﬁ t of capital losses with a tax value of £48.4m 
(last year £46.5m). Due to uncertainty over their future use, no beneﬁ t has been recognised in respect of unexpired trading losses carried 
forward in overseas jurisdictions with a tax value of £43.5m (last year £38.7m).
No deferred tax is recognised in respect of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless a material liability is 
expected to arise on distribution of these earnings under applicable tax legislation. No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect 
of undistributed earnings of £1 7 .5m with a tax value of £4.4m (last year £1 3.0m with a tax value of £3.3m) on the basis the distribution can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary diff erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The Company’s accounting policies are the same as those set out in note 1 of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, except as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. The Company grants share-based 
payments to the employees of subsidiary companies. Each period the fair value of the employee services received by the subsidiary 
as a capital contribution from the Company is reﬂ ected as an addition to investments in subsidiaries.
Loans from other Group undertakings and all other payables are initially recorded at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received. 
They are then subsequently carried at amortised cost. The loans are non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.
The Company’s ﬁ nancial risk is managed as part of the Group’s strategy and policies as discussed in note 2 1 of the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements.
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income 
statement or statement of comprehensive income.

ANALYSIS OF SHARE REGISTER
Ordinary shares
As at 28 March 201 5 the Company had 1 8 1,607 registered holders of ordinary shares. Their shareholdings are analysed below. It should be 
noted that many of our private investors hold their shares through nominee companies, therefore the percentage of private holders is

MANAGING YOUR SHARES ONLINE
Shareholders can manage their holdings 
online by registering with Shareview, the 
internet based platform provided by 
Equiniti. Registration is a straightforward 
process and allows shareholders to:
> Sign up for electronic shareholder 
communication.
> Receive trading updates by email.
> View all of their shareholdings in 
one place.
> Update their records following a 
change of address.
> Have dividends paid into their bank 
account.
> Vote in advance of company general 
meetings.
M&S encourages shareholders to sign up 
for electronic communication as the 
reduction in printing costs and paper 
usage makes a valuable contribution to our 
Plan A commitments. It is also beneﬁ cial to 
shareholders, who can be notiﬁ ed by email 
whenever we release trading updates to 
the London Stock Exchange, which are not 
mailed to shareholders.
To ﬁ nd out more information about the 
services off ered by Shareview and to 
register, please visit shareview.co.uk.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2015
This year’s AGM will be held at Wembley 
Stadium, Wembley, London HA9 0WS on 
Tuesday 7 July 201 5. The meeting will 
start at 1 1am and registration will be open 
from 9.30am.
DIVIDENDS
Paid in January and July each year (subject 
to Board and shareholder approval). We 
encourage shareholders to have their 
dividends paid directly into their bank 
account to ensure effi  cient payment and 
that cleared funds are received on the 
payment date. Shareholders who receive 
their dividend payments in this way receive a 
single, consolidated tax voucher annually in 
January, covering both dividend payments 
made during the tax year. We are able to 
send separate tax vouchers if preferred.
Shareholders can change their preferred 
dividend payment method online at 
shareview.co.uk or by contacting Equiniti.
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 128
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 
CONTINUED
SHAREHOLDER SECURITY
CHANGING YOUR ADDRESS
You should inform Equiniti of your new 
address as soon as possible to avoid missing 
important correspondence relating to your 
shareholding. If you hold 1,500 shares or 
fewer and reside in the UK, this can be done 
quickly over the telephone. Holdings of 
more than 1,500 shares will require a written 
instruction quoting your full name, 1 1-digit 
shareholder reference number (if known) 
and both your previous and new addresses.
DUPLICATE DOCUMENTS
Around 10,000 shareholders have more 
than one account on the share register and 
receive duplicate documentation from us 
as a result. If you fall into this group, please 
contact Equiniti to combine your accounts.
CORPORATE WEBSITE
You can access the corporate website at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
The M&S corporate website provides a wealth 
of useful information for shareholders and 
should be your ﬁ rst port of call for general 
queries relating to the Company and your 
shares. Shareholders are also encouraged 
to sign up to receive news alerts by email. 
These include all of the ﬁ nancial news 
releases throughout the year that are 
not sent to shareholders by post.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the ﬁ nancial 
information on our website. This information 
has been prepared under the relevant 
accounting standards and legislation.
NEW SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME
201 5 saw the launch of the Equiniti Payment 
Plus Scheme, a new loyalty scheme for private 
invest ors developed by Equiniti in collaboration 
with M&S. The scheme enables M&S 
shareholders to apportion anything up to a 
maximum of £900 of their dividend payment 
to purchase credit on an M&S Shareholder 
Card, which can be used to shop in our stores 
and online. This is similar to an M&S gift card, 
however the credit is off ered to shareholders 
at a 10% discount. So, a shareholder who 
allocates the full £900 would receive £1,000 
credit on their card. Our private investors are 
some of our most loyal customers and we are 
pleased to be able to introduce this fantastic 
new scheme that directly rewards their level 
of investment in the Company.
The scheme is not currently available for 
investors whose shares are held in nominee 
accounts. However, we will work with both 
Equiniti and nominee companies to seek 
a solution that will allow those whose 
shares are held in this way to participate 
in future years.
Further information on the scheme 
and a detailed FAQ can be found at 
shareview.co.uk/info/paymentplus.
SHAREGIFT
If you have a very small shareholding 
that is uneconomical to sell, you may 
want to consider donating it to ShareGift 
(Registered charity no. 1052686), a charity 
that specialises in the donation of small, 
unwanted shareholdings to good causes.

or by calling +44 (0)207 930 3737 .
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
For the purpose of Capital Gains Tax, the 
price of an ordinary share on 3 1 March 1 982 
was 1 53.5p, which when adjusted for the 
1 for 1 scrip issue in 1 984, gives a ﬁ gure of 
76.75p. Following the capital reorganisation 
in March 2002, HMRC has conﬁ rmed the 
base cost for CGT purposes was 372.35p 
(8 1.43%) for an ordinary share and 68.75p 
(1 8.75%) for a B share.

An increasing number of shareholders 
have been contacting us to report 
unsolicited and suspicious phone calls 
received from purported ‘brokers’ who 
off er to buy their shares at a price far in 
excess of their market value. It is unlikely 
that ﬁ rms authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) will contact you 
with off ers like this. As such, we believe 
these calls are part of a scam, commonly 
referred to as a ‘boiler room’. The callers 
obtain your details from publicly available 
sources of information, including the 
Company’s share register, and can be 
extremely persistent and persuasive.
Shareholders are cautioned to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, off ers to 
buy shares at a discount, sell your shares 
at a premium or requests to complete 
conﬁ dentiality agreements with the 
callers. Remember, if it sounds too good 
to be true, it probably is!
More detailed information and guidance 
is available on our corporate website.

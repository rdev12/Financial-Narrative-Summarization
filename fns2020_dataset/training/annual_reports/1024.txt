Section A
Overview
“I am pleased to report a good set of results for the year.
These were achieved against the background of a
global recession and the changes we made to the
business during 2008/2009.”
Clay Brendish
Chairman
Introduction
I am pleased to report a good set of results for the year. These were
achieved against the background of a global recession and the
changes we made to the business during 2008/2009. The sale of
our Public Sector Division in October 2008 was the latest, and most
signiﬁcant, step in our strategy of transforming the Company into
a more tightly-focused software business.
We now operate two divisions. Our Wireless business is a global
leader in both handset and air interface testing and is ﬁrmly
positioned at the heart of our Company. Our Travel business is
the market leader for travel technology solutions in the UK and
northern Europe. Both operations have a strong international
presence and the Company now derives 72% (2008: 67%) of
revenues from international markets (Wireless 95% (2008: 92%),
Travel 30% (2008: 19%)).
Further details of the Company’s performance are in the Chief
Executive’s review on page 6 and the ﬁnancial review on page 11.
Acquisitions and disposals
The sale of Public Sector for a gross consideration of £56.8m (net
proceeds £44.8m) resulted in a net proﬁt on the disposal of £27.6m.
Since 2004, the Company has raised £90.6m by disposing of
11businesses and has invested £65.4m in acquiring two businesses.
The disposal programme has enabled us to sharpen the focus of
the Company further, and to return value to shareholders, while
making selective acquisitions to strengthen our position in our
chosen markets.
Strategy
Our strategy is to position Anite as a global leader in wireless test
software. The disposal of Public Sector was a major step in our
strategy of transforming Anite into a more focused company and
of improving its long-term prospects for growth, higher margins
and greater international exposure. The Board believes that wireless
is a long-term growth market, which has high barriers to entry
and limited competition in those areas in which Anite operates.
This makes it possible to achieve good margins and to add value
by making selective acquisitions. In Travel, following the various
one-off customer changes over the past year and the strengthening
of the management team, the Board believes the best strategy
is to optimise the business’s long-term value by continuing to
strengthen and improve its market position.
In the Board’s view these factors together with operational success,
tempered by a reduction in the predictability and visibility of earnings,
should ultimately improve the rating of Anite’s shares.
Results
Adjusted revenue from continuing operations was £90.1m (2008:
£91.6m). Adjusted operating proﬁt was £20.0m (2008: £18.7m)
and the adjusted operating margin was 22.2% (2008: 20.4%).
The adjusted operating proﬁt is stated before disposed businesses,
share-based payments charge, amortisation of acquired intangible
assets, and restructuring costs.
Revenue and proﬁt beneﬁted from a £2.3m early settlement of part
of our contract with MyTravel. Proﬁtability was, however, affected
by a one-off £0.8m increase in legacy, non-operating property costs.
The effect of currency movements during the year was to improve
revenue by £7 .5m and operating proﬁt by £3.9m (based on this year’s
result at last year’s average exchange rates). Net amortisation of
research and development costs (R&D) in the year reduced proﬁts
by £1.0m (2008: £nil).
Adjusted proﬁt before tax from continuing operations was £18.1m
(2008: £16.7m) after net ﬁnance charges of £1.9m (2008: £2.0m),
giving basic earnings per share (after tax) of 4.4p (2008: 3.3p).
Proﬁt for the year, including proﬁt from discontinued operations of
£31.4m (2008: £6.5m), was £36.3m (2008: £13.2m).This gives basic
earnings per share of 11.3p(2008: 3.8p).
Dividend and share buyback
The Board has declared a ﬁnal dividend of 0.65p per share
(2008: 0.6p), making a total dividend for the year of 0.95p per share
(2008: 0.875p). This dividend will be payable on 20 October 2009
to shareholders on the register at 18September 2009.
Following the disposal of Public Sector, the Board returned £9.9m
in cash to shareholders in February 2009 by means of the payment
of a special dividend of 3.0p per ordinary share. This was combined
with an eight for nine share consolidation that reduced the number
of shares in issue to 298.6 million (2008: 338.0 million). The Board
has also committed to continuing a share buyback programme worth
up to £10.0m, subject to market conditions. l Wireless £11.7m l Travel £8.5m l Wireless £14.0m l Travel £9.5m

Overview
Balance sheet and cash
Anite has a strong balance sheet, ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and good
cash resources.
Net cash of £27.3m (2008: net debt £15 .4m) at the year end
included the net cash proceeds of £45.5m from the disposal of Anite
Public Sector, enabling us to reduce our term loan by £25.0m, the
£9.9m cost of the special dividend, and an £8.9m part settlement of
a currency swap.
Given the current macroeconomic conditions, the Board believes
it prudent to retain a strong cash balance. In addition, in order
to provide the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to enable us to consider
acquisitions, we retain total bank facilities of £45.0m, of which
£25.0m remains undrawn.
The Board, management and people
During the year, a number of Board and senior management changes
reﬂected the continuing development of the Company. Christopher
Humphrey, the Group’s Finance Director since 2003, was appointed
Chief Executive on 1January 2009. He replaced Steve Rowley, who
had been Chief Executive since 2003.
Steve led Anite’s transformation from a troubled and fragmented
IT services’ company to a focused international software company,
culminating in the sale of Public Sector and the return of signiﬁcant
shareholder value. We thank him for his major contribution to the
Company and wish him well in his new role at Torex.
The Board is making progress with the recruitment of a new Group
Finance Director and will announce an appointment as soon as
possible.
Nigel Clifford, Chief Executive at Symbian Limited (a subsidiary of
Nokia), was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1April 2009.
Nigel’s global experience and knowledge in the mobile handset and
wireless operator industries will be invaluable as we continue to
progress our wireless strategy. Peter Bertram, a Non-Executive
Director since 2004, has decided to step down from the Board during
the current year once a new Finance Director has been appointed.
He is Chairman or a Non-Executive Director of a number of listed
companies and has made a valuable contribution as Chairman of
the Audit Committee. The Board intends to appoint another
Non-Executive Director in the near future.
During the year we also made a number of important senior
management changes in our Wireless and Travel businesses to
strengthen the teams in place and to take Anite through the
next phases of its development.
On behalf of the Directors, I thank all our staff for their hard work
and support during such an important year.
Summary
We expect proﬁts for 2009/2010 as a whole to be lower than in
2008/2009. This will be more marked in the ﬁrst half as a result of
the re-basing of our Travel business and an increased customer-led
one-off investment in LTE (4G).
We now have the strategy and the team in place to take us into the
next phase of our transformation. We also have the ﬁnancial platform
and market positions from which to consolidate, invest and develop
our two strong businesses in these challenging economic times.

Section B
Review
Overview of the year
In my ﬁrst review as Chief Executive, I am delighted to be able to
report that Anite is in a robust condition. In what was an extremely
challenging economic environment, our Wireless and Travel Divisions
both performed well in the year, while the sale of our Public Sector
Division was a further demonstration of our commitment to
refocusing our business.
The divisional results were achieved despite the ongoing
consolidation among our customers in the travel industry and the
long development phase of 4G – the next-generation mobile phone
technology – having an impact on our revenue. In addition, the sale
of our Public Sector Division enabled us to reduce our bank
borrowings, to focus our resources on our core businesses, and to
pay a special dividend to our shareholders. As a result of the sale the
Group now employs fewer people and has lower sales, but margins
and proﬁts are higher than they were ﬁve years ago and our balance
sheet is much stronger.
Our revenue and operating proﬁt beneﬁted from signiﬁcant currency
movements during the year, volatility which directly resulted from the
global economic crisis. Currency and interest changes also, however,
had an impact on the value of the Company’s investments and
hedging liabilities. In short, the sterling value of our underlying
euro-denominated asset – represented by our Network Testing
business – increased, but was matched by a rise in the total value of
our derivative ﬁnancial liabilities taken out at the time of its purchase.
Delivering shareholder value continues to be imperative: during the
year we returned cash to shareholders through a special dividend,
increased the ordinary dividend, cancelled shares through a share
consolidation and began buying back shares.
Our markets
Anite is structured into two market-facing divisions: Wireless and
Travel. Wireless is further structured into two operations: Handset
Testing and Network Testing. Handset Testing provides specialist
systems and software to enable mobile phone manufacturers to
bring new handsets and data cards to market quickly. Network Testing
provides a range of systems which enable mobile phone operators
to test the efﬁciency and effectiveness of their networks, as well as
of different makes of handset, in live situations. Travel provides
industry-leading reservation systems to tour operators, airline
consolidators, and cruise, ferry and rail companies.
Wireless
Handset Testing
Our Handset Testing business, based in Fleet, Hampshire, provides
customers with a single expandable platform to test new handsets’
viability, conformance with industry standards and ability to
interoperate with multiple networks and other devices.
The main drivers of growth in Handset Testing are the constant
changes and improvements in mobile phone technology and the
number of new handset models which are launched each year.
These, combined with the different conﬁgurations used by network
operators, mean that before mobile phones are ready to be sold they
must go through development testing to ensure functionality;
conformance testing to ensure they meet industry standards; and
interoperability testing (IOT) to ensure they are able to communicate
with multiple networks and other devices. Older technologies do not
become redundant when new generations are introduced and any
new testing regime must also incorporate the means to test them.
Our strongest market has historically been in conformance testing,
but we have recently strengthened our position in IOT and are
working with our hardware partner, Agilent, on the development of
our new system for 4G (LTE) testing. Our initial system, which has
secured early market position with key LTE customers, will be
replaced by an Agilent hardware-based system in due course.
Full functionality will be progressively introduced during 2009
and enhanced during 2010. In common with all our competitors,
the very nature of this leading-edge development programme
means that risks remain around the timing and delivery of the
completed products.
Performance
We achieved a growth in proﬁts this year, despite a minor decline in
revenue from legacy products and an increase in development costs
for our 4G testing solutions. Since a large proportion of Handset
Testing’s revenue is in US dollars and euros – while the majority of its
cost base is in sterling – the business beneﬁted from the appreciation
of the US dollar and the euro against sterling.
During the year, we made good progress in the development of
our software for testing 4G devices and are already supplying key
customers with our own initial systems. We also restructured the
business: new management and sales executives have resulted in the
business becoming more market facing and we have now established
regional Directors in each major geographic area: Europe and the
Middle East, Asia and the Americas.
“We continue to execute our strategy and I am confident
that the work we will undertake during the current financial
year will help us to build foundations for future growth,
to ride out the prevailing economic storm and to deliver
shareholder value.”

Review
Our wireless
customers include:
LTE (Long Term Evolution)
The introduction of next-generation devices (such as smart
phones and data dongles) has created a rapidly increasing demand
for data services: it is predicted that over the next ﬁve years mobile
data trafﬁc will increase 100-fold. Network operators face a limit
on how much trafﬁc existing networks can support, yet competition
from WiFi hotspots and wired broadband limits their ability to
charge for data transmission at rates comparable to those for voice
calls. This clearly represents a long-term threat to their proﬁtability.
As a result, the network operators are constantly seeking faster,
more efﬁcient, and cheaper ways to deliver data.
By the end of 2007 , it was clear that 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution)
had gained wide acceptance as the most effective and universal
technology to deliver the high data capacity that is needed.
LTE enables network operators to support more subscribers on
their spectrum allocations at a reduced cost per bit. To date,
31 major operators around the globe, including industry giants
AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone, have committed to LTE for their
4G networks from 2010.
Anite has backed LTE since its inception and continues to invest
strongly in products to support its introduction. Working with key
mobile equipment manufacturers, our initial LTE testing solution is
already being used to test around ten devices. We expect to be able
to supply our customers with our proprietary testing system during
the current ﬁnancial year and for LTE to begin to make a signiﬁcant
impact on our revenue during 2010/2011.

Section B
Review
We also strengthened the Handset Testing management team with
a number of senior appointments, including Mike Bonin, formerly
Managing Director of TEMS, the network testing division of Ericsson,
as Managing Director.
Strategy
Our objective is to complete our basic products for testing 4G
devices and to supply customers with a common platform which has
been customised to their particular needs for development testing,
conformance testing and interoperability testing.
Outlook
The current year will be affected by the continuing cyclical lull
between testing different generations of handsets and by a one-off
customer-led additional £4m investment that we are making in our
LTE solutions. Following the strong take-up of smart phones and the
consequent growth of data revenues there is undoubtedly a very
strong case for LTE rather than any other technology and, by the end
of the current ﬁnancial year, we expect to have made further
signiﬁcant progress in the development of our offer and to have
generated additional revenues from LTE in the ﬁnal quarter.
It is currently not possible to predict the rate of growth and
customers’ take-up of next-generation devices, but we are conﬁdent
that our proprietary testing equipment will be in demand. While we
do not expect to see a signiﬁcant return on our investment in the
technology until 2010/201 1,it will ultimately broaden our market and
will conﬁrm our position as one of the leaders in testing 4G devices.
Network Testing
Our Network Testing business (Nemo), based in Oulu, Finland, provides
the measurement tools to enable mobile network operators to verify,
test and improve coverage and quality; to test the effect of new services
on existing networks; and to compare the performance of different
manufacturers’ mobile phones in the same environments to enable
mobile network operators to choose the best handsets to endorse.
Performance
In a challenging market, we deﬁed the general trend and improved
our market position and proﬁtability by winning new customers.
The introduction of 3G in China brought new business, and we also
increased our market share elsewhere in Asia and in other emerging
markets. Nevertheless, following the general decline in economic
conditions, the second half of the year was characterised by
customers reducing their operating budgets and making short-term
deferrals of expenditure.
We ﬁnished the year with an increase in proﬁts, which, as elsewhere in
Anite’s business, was helped by the translation of euro-denominated
proﬁts into sterling.
Strategy
We focus on winning and retaining customers by being ﬁrst with
new technology, by providing excellent after-sales service and
technical support, and by maintaining strong relationships direct
with customers or through local distributors on three continents.
Outlook
In the short term, we predict that the visibility of sales and
customers’ budgets will become more uncertain and this, combined
with the recent trend of a weakening euro, is likely to result in the
current ﬁnancial year being more challenging than that of 2008/2009.
In the longer term, we expect growth to continue in developing
countries, particularly in the emerging markets of Africa, India and
Latin America.
In common with Handset Testing, each evolution of technology
creates a demand for new testing and, as mobile phone use
expands around the world and technology continues to develop, the
longer-term prospects for our Network Testing business are positive.
Travel
Our Travel Division, based in Slough, Berkshire, is a leading supplier
of reservation, content management and Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) software for holiday companies, airline
consolidators and packaged holiday operators.
Performance
We continued to make good progress in our relationship with TUI
Germany, now Europe’s leading travel group, during the year. We are
putting into live operation the second phase of our contract with the
company – implementing @comRes reservations software across
its operations in central Europe – and have recently been contracted
by TUI to build the third phase. In addition, since the year end we
have signed an initial contract for @comRes with REWE, Germany’s
third-largest tour operator.
Signiﬁcant projects in this business tend to come in uneven
blocks and our results for the year should be viewed against the
exceptionally high value multi-year orders taken in the previous year.
Revenue and proﬁt in 2008/2009 were better than expected, but
were inﬂuenced by a number of one-off events. Balkan Holidays has successfully completed its
migration to Anite’s @comRes booking platform.
“We believe the system offers us the ﬂexibility to
further grow our business in the challenging and
changing market that faces us. The transactional
cost structure of Anite’s @com bureau service also
allows us to accurately manage costs and relate
them to our actual business volumes.”

Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009

Review
@comRes
Anite’s browser-based @comRes software is redeﬁning
technology for the travel market and supporting two
key developments.
First, the change in the way people take and book their holidays
which means that travel operators need a technology platform
which can offer both the traditional package holidays and support
the trend towards bespoke short breaks.
As a result, travel companies are demanding an increasingly
sophisticated technology platform which can deliver personalised
offers with relevant up-sell and cross-sell capabilities consistently
delivered across a range of their distribution channels, including
travel agents, call centres and, increasingly, the internet.
Many consumers now use the internet to seek a wide range
of offers, comparing prices and creating their own holidays
on-line. These changes have placed increasing pressure on travel
operators’ margins which, in turn, has led to recent
consolidation across the industry.
Now, the combination of the economic downturn and high
fuel costs is encouraging holidaymakers to return to the
security of holidays, organised by the major ATOL
licensed holiday brands. This supports Anite’s strategy of
positioning @comRes for the mid to upper tier of global
travel companies.
Second, the major vertically-integrated groups (VIGs),
who own their own ﬂights, accommodation and
distribution need to reduce costs by streamlining their
end-to-end process from product contracting through to
distribution. Anite has invested heavily in this area in the
last 12months tightly integrating @comRes with its
mobile contracting (MCS) and Brochure Pricing (BPS)
solutions. This combination of technology is increasingly
supporting the business case for change in these VIGs.
TUI Travel plc’s Central European Source
Market is undertaking a three-year
migration programme onto the Anite
Travel @comRes platform. It is being
implemented in three phases for a
number of countries, including Germany,
Switzerland and Austria.

We believe we have secured a market-leading position in
terms of functionality, performance and scalability, allowing
lower cost mainstream technology hardware and power to
be deployed, while enabling access to computer resources over
the internet (cloud computing) and charging for software on a
usage basis (SaaS). This has been borne out by our system’s
enthusiastic take-up by leading travel operators, including
Europe’s largest travel group, TUI.
We continue to design reﬁnements to the software and, in looking
at travel as part of a larger leisure market, are considering what
other types of transactional based opportunities might beneﬁt
from our technology and its ﬂexibility. “I expect the current trading year to be challenging,
particularly in the first half, given the impact of our additional
investment in LTE and the effect of customer changes in
Travel. The longer-term outlook for our new travel system
and its international market, and for the growing adoption
of LTE technology is, however, very positive.”

Review
The economic climate put pressure on end consumers’ disposable
incomes with the result that travel operators were also under
pressure. In September 2008 our customer XL, which had been
the UK’s third-largest tour operator, went into administration.
In 2007, major consolidation took place in the UK when Thomson
(TUI) and First Choice merged, and Thomas Cook acquired MyTravel.
TUI achieved synergies by bringing Thomson and First Choice
together and moving them onto the reservations system which was
already in use at Thomson, and Thomas Cook moved the MyTravel
business to the Thomas Cook system. Since First Choice and MyTravel
were both our customers these changes had an impact on our results.
The termination of the MyTravel contract added £2.3m to proﬁt, but
the loss of the two companies as clients will affect future revenues.
Since 2004 the Travel business unit had supplied managed IT services
to Norwich Union (NU) for one of its ﬁnancial services products; this
was non-core business for us which had grown from a small, initial
contract. At the end of the ﬁnancial year, NU moved this product
platform to another ﬁnancial services provider. This, too, will reduce
revenue and proﬁt in 2009/2010.
We re-energised our Travel business when we strengthened its
management team during the year and appointed Mike Kingswood,
formerly Managing Director of our Public Sector business,
as Managing Director. This has not only improved leadership,
but has also revitalised the division’s strategic direction.
Strategy
Over the past three years we have invested heavily in @comRes,
our comprehensive and versatile browser-based reservations system.
Our objective is to capitalise on its ability to handle ﬁxed and ﬂexible
packaging, component-based travel, dynamic packaging and all
specialist operations from a single system, to enable us to continue
our overseas expansion. In the short term, we foresee our growth
as being in Germany, and central and eastern Europe. We already
operate a sales ofﬁce in Cologne, Germany, and are strengthening
our resources in that country.
In addition, we plan to migrate customers who use our legacy ATOP
system to @comRes, and also to change our revenue model to one
in which we license the system to customers on an annual basis. This
will have beneﬁts on both sides: it will reduce the initial capital cost
for customers and will augment our recurring revenue in the future.
Outlook
Business failures and consolidation are undoubtedly putting the travel
industry under pressure. On a pro-forma basis, we estimate that the
effect of the one-off customer events detailed above has reduced
Travel’s revenues by £11m,and operating proﬁts by £6m on an
annualised basis. We aim partly to mitigate this reduction through
new business and the migration of existing customers from ATOP
to @comRes.
In the medium term we are conﬁdent that we will be able to
accelerate the installation rate of our increasingly conﬁgurable
and feature-rich @comRes product at customers in the UK and
overseas. It is scalable and robust, and we have a proven reputation
for developing and installing software that works. We believe that
customers’ increasing conﬁdence in our @comRes software will
enable us to maximise the shareholder value that is inherent in
this product.
Group strategy
Our longer-term strategy is unchanged – to put Wireless at the heart
of our business – but we are currently committed to operating two
successful divisions: Wireless and Travel. We will continue to look at
world markets for the organic growth of both businesses, to improve
margins and to maintain strong operational cash ﬂow.
Equally, we will continue to invest in the development of our market-
leading software, and will take advantage of our strong balance sheet
and ﬁnancial position to invest in carefully-considered complementary
acquisitions, particularly in the network testing market.
Group outlook
I expect the current trading year to be challenging, particularly in the
ﬁrst half, given the impact of our additional investment in LTE and the
effect of customer changes in Travel. The longer-term outlook for our
new travel system and its international market, and for the growing
adoption of LTE technology is, however, very positive.
We continue to execute our strategy and I am conﬁdent that the work
we will undertake during the current ﬁnancial year will help us to
build foundations for future growth, to ride out the prevailing
economic storm and to deliver shareholder value.

Chief Executive
30 June 2009 The Group continued to progress its strategy
to improve the quality of its earnings.
The disposal of its Public Sector business provided the
funds to reduce its borrowings, to pay a special dividend
to shareholders and to focus on its core Wireless and
Travel businesses.

Overview
We reported good underlying margins in our businesses, strong cash generation and a reduction in debt. The Group disposed of its Public Sector
business in October 2008 for a total consideration of £56.8m in cash, including additional consideration from a ﬁnal working capital
adjustment of £2.5m, generating a proﬁt on disposal of £27.6m after costs. As a result, the Group reduced its bank borrowings (term loan) by
£25m, returned £9.9m to shareholders by way of a special dividend and share consolidation and part-settled a cross-currency swap for £8.9m,
further details of which are shown below.
The adjusted results for the continuing operations (excluding disposed businesses, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based
payments and restructuring costs) were as follows:
> Revenue fell by 1.6% to £90.1m (2008: £91.6m).
> Operating proﬁt increased by 7% to £20.0m (2008: £18.7m) beneﬁting from the one-off MyTravel contract settlement in Travel,
strong cost control and the general weakness of sterling in the period.
> Proﬁt before taxation improved by 8.4% to £18.1m (2008: £16.7m).
Currency effect
During the year there were signiﬁcant movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The average rate for the US dollar strengthened 16.4%
against sterling from £1 = US$2.01 to £1 = US$1.68 and the average rate of the euro strengthened by 15.0% from £1 = €1.40 to €1.19 both of
which had a favourable transactional effect on our trading results. The effect of these changes was to improve revenue by £7.5m and operating
proﬁt by £3.9m on a constant currency basis. Also on a constant currency basis, revenues were £82.6m and operating proﬁts were £16.1m.
The impact on divisional results is shown in the divisional overviews below. In the current ﬁnancial year, we have budgeted using the following
average exchange rate: £1 = US$1.50 and £1 = €1.15.

Overall Wireless orders were down 12.0% in the year reﬂecting an anticipated reduction, resulting from weaker market conditions in the
wireless market. In addition, a number of three-year maintenance contracts, totalling £6.4m, which were won in 2007/2008 were not repeated
this year. Revenues were marginally down by 2.3% although operating proﬁts, helped by the weaker pound, were up 19.7 %.
The effect of capitalisation of R&D under IAS 38 had the effect of reducing proﬁts by £1.0m (net amortisation), compared with the previous
year, in which net capitalised R&D had no net effect.
The currency effect of exchange rate ﬂuctuations in the US dollar had the effect of improving overall Wireless revenues by £6.7m and operating
proﬁts by £3.3m on a constant currency basis.
Handset Testing
In Handset Testing, as anticipated, fewer new system sales were achieved, as customers generally now have sufﬁcient 2G and 3G testing
capability but maintenance revenues with existing customers remained robust. The consolidation among chip set manufacturers reduced the
scale of that customer base, which is being replaced in part by manufacturers of new smart devices. There was a recovery in sales in North
America, but European and Asian performance was weaker.
To mitigate the impact of these trends on proﬁtability, while at the same time taking our partnership with Agilent Technologies into
consideration, we made a number of changes to the business to increase focus and reduce costs.
Network Testing (Nemo)
In Network Testing, technology upgrades and a growing amount of business coming from emerging markets contributed to revenue growth as
did the effect of US$/€ exchange rates. In mature markets, the launch and take-up by consumers of new smart devices that use more data is
resulting in operators needing to upgrade their infrastructure.
The network testing market continues to be extremely competitive and order book visibility is generally very short, but the business has
excellent products – on which investment continues – and improved routes to market. Overall, Nemo’s market position has improved during
the year and we believe we can increase our network test presence further, both organically and through acquisition.

The Travel Division performed reasonably well in the year beneﬁting from some one-off revenue and proﬁt and a good underlying performance.
During the year, part of the MyTravel (Thomas Cook) contract was settled early, resulting in a one-off £2.3m beneﬁt to revenue and proﬁt,
but against this there were some management restructuring costs in the second half year. Excluding these, but including a very small bad debt
as a result of XL Leisure going into administration, divisional operating proﬁt was approximately 14% down compared with the same period
last year, with revenue 7.7%down. The reduction in ongoing work from MyTravel and the loss of work from XL Leisure had an impact on our
proﬁtability, this was, however, improved by the strength of the euro, which increased overall revenue by £0.8m and proﬁts by £0.6m. The
divisional order intake was reduced by some £1.7mas a result of the XL Leisure administration and is down compared with the previous year’s
record order intake. The total order book at the year end stood at £43.2m (2008: £50.4m).
As anticipated, the managed services contract with Norwich Union has not been renewed, as a result of a change in its business strategy.
Five new contracts, including three international customers, were signed during the period for @comRes, our market-leading solution for
tour operators. Continued good progress was achieved on our large contract with TUI Germany: delivery of Phase Two of the contract has been
completed and a series of brands went “live” as planned in June 2009. An additional order for Phase Three was also taken in May 2009. We still
have a long-term relationship with MyTravel, despite the early settlement of part of the original contract, including a commitment to provide
a modiﬁed service for a minimum of ﬁve years.
During the period under review, @comRes revenues exceeded ATOP revenues for the ﬁrst time. There continues to be good interest in and a
strong international order pipeline for @comRes set against a difﬁcult trading background for the sector and tough comparatives. Customers’
investment in their reservation systems is being driven by the need to reduce costs and to take advantage of opportunities provided by the
internet, while the number of holiday transactions has a minor direct impact on our revenues.
Good progress with TUI Central Europe and other customers has resulted in 30% (2008: 19%)of our revenue now being derived from
international customers. This is expected to rise in the future. We see further opportunities within the TUI Group and the German market
as a whole.
Although overall Travel proﬁtability will be reduced next year by the one-off customer issues referred to above, its underlying performance
is stable and its prospects are good.

Overhead costs
Group overhead costs (excluding research and development, amortisation, share-based payments and restructuring costs) reduced from
£34.7m to £33.4m (note 2.5) in the year. Restructuring costs included a £4.9m provision required for our Slough property which is now more
than 50% empty, following the disposal of Public Sector. We are actively marketing the empty ﬂoor to try to mitigate our costs although this
is likely to be challenging in the current economic climate.
Divisional performances are stated before unallocated corporate costs which include head ofﬁce staff costs, Directors’ remuneration,
professional and ofﬁce costs, and non-operational costs. During the period unallocated corporate costs totalled £2.7m (2008: £1.6m) and
included higher professional fees and increased bonus provisions (nil in 2008). Unallocated share-based payments totalled £1.3m (2008:
£1.2m). Following the disposal of Public Sector, central staff numbers, including shared services such as IT and HR, reduced from 37 to 29.
During the year we paid £2.6m to exit an onerous property lease within our legacy portfolio and our overall non-operational property costs
increased to £0.8m (2008: net surplus £0.1m). We continue to manage an orderly and low-risk run-down of this portfolio which comprises
properties previously occupied by Group businesses. We take the opportunity to exit from non-operational property leases, where economically
advantageous to do so, although it creates ﬂuctuations in our costs and cash ﬂows from time to time. 16

Total IH.P H.Q (I.Q) (I.H) Q.P 12.7 2.3 (2.3) – 12.7
Total development spending (excluding the effect of capitalisation/amortisation) reduced in the year to £9.8m (2008: £12.7m). £10.8m (2008:
£12.7m) was expensed in the year, including net amortisation of £1.0m (2008: nil). The amount of capitalised development costs, which are
principally in respect of test cases, declined in the year to £0.9m (2008: £2.3m). Development spending is wholly focused on the Wireless
division in which there will be increased investment in LTE (4G) in the coming year.
Group ﬁnance costs
Net ﬁnance costs (note 5) were £1.9m (2008: £0.7m – included a one-off exchange gain of £1.3m on the translation of the escrow account
(euro denominated) held for the Nemo earnout). The Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on
bank borrowings incurred at the time of the acquisition of Nemo. As a result of this and of the cross-currency swap taken out at the same time,
the Group has an effective ﬁxed rate of borrowing on its term loan and swap against which ﬂoating rate Libor (sterling) and Euribor (euro)
interest rates are received. Full details are set out in note 22 of the ﬁnancial statements.
Taxation
The tax rate for the continuing operations for the year was 22.7% (2008: 28.9%). The charge for the year amounted to £1.4m (2008: £2.7m).
The cash payment for the year amounted to £3.4m (2008: £3.9m). The tax rate decreased in the year, as a result of adjustments to the
provisions made for deferred tax in prior years. As Wireless continues to widen its geographic spread of proﬁts in higher tax regimes,
the Group tax rate is expected to show some volatility as the proﬁt mix between high-tax and low-tax locations changes from year to year.
Shareholder returns and dividends
> Adjusted basic earnings per share was 4.4p (2008: 3.3p).
> The Company returned £9.9m to its shareholders through a special dividend and share consolidation of 3.0p per share following
the disposal of Public Sector.
> The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 0.65p per share (2008: 0.6p) making a total for the year of 0.95p (2008: 0.875p) –
covered 4.6 times by adjusted earnings.
> Retained earnings attributable to equity holders were £36.3m (2008: £13.2m) for the year.
At 30 April 2009, the number of shares in issue had decreased by 39.43m to 298.61m (from 338.04m at 30 April 2008). In total 37.33m shares
were cancelled as part of the share consolidation in February 2009, 2.56m shares were bought back and cancelled at an average price of 25.8p
per share and for a total cost of £0.7m; 0.46m new shares were issued to settle SAYE and grant/award maturities. The weighted average
number of shares in issue used to calculate basic earnings per share was 321.7m (2008: 344.53m). This does not include the dilutive effect
of share option and grant/award schemes.
Disposals
On 31 October the Group disposed of its Public Sector business for a gross consideration of £56.8m (including ﬁnal working capital adjustment
of £2.5m) and £44.8m net of costs (£3.7m) and cash disposed (£8.3m). This generated a proﬁt on disposal of £27.6m.
Derivative ﬁnancial liabilities
When Anite purchased Nemo in November 2006, it entered into a number of swaps designed to hedge against movements in interest and
foreign exchange rates, and to protect the value of both the investment and reserves of the Group. As a result of signiﬁcant movements in
interest rates and £/€ exchange rates, since that date, the sterling value of the underlying euro-denominated assets has increased, but has been
matched by a rise in the value of the derivative ﬁnancial liabilities. The latter has risen to a total liability of £24.5m at 30 April 2009, after
having paid £8.9m in April 2009 to settle one of the cross-currency swaps.
The Group continues to have a fully effective hedge against the net investment in Nemo with all effective foreign exchange movements being
taken directly to reserves. The maturity date of all derivative instruments is 31 October 2011 and the value of any ﬁnal settlement will be
dependent on the interest rates and exchange rates at that time. 17

Cash management
The Group achieved strong cash conversion from operating proﬁts during the year with the beneﬁt of the cash proceeds from the Public Sector
disposal. The key movements in the year were as follows:
> Net proceeds from disposals – £45.5m (2008: £7 .9m).
> Tax paid – £3.4m (2008: £3.9m).
> Capital expenditure – £3.7m (2008: £3.9m).
> Shares bought back for cancellation – £0.7m (2008: £7 .5m).
> Shares bought for employee trust – £0.2m (2008: £4.3m).
> Dividends paid – £3.0m (2008: £3.7m).
> Special dividend paid of 3.0p per share – £9.9m (2008: nil).
> Earnout paid for Invenova and Nemo acquisitions – £nil (2008: £2.3m).
> Part repayment of cross-currency swap – £8.9m (2008: £0.4m).
> Term loan repayment – voluntary repayment £25.0m (2008: scheduled repayment £5.0m).
Balance sheet and cash
The Group had a net cash position on 30 April 2009 of £27.3m (2008: net debt £15.4m).This includes the cash consideration of £56.8m from
the sale of Anite Public Sector in October 2008. The Company used some of the proceeds to repay £25m of its term loan, reducing it to £20m.

Annual report and accounts 2009 Report of the Directors
Section C
Management and governance
The Directors present their report on the affairs of the Group, together with the audited ﬁnancial statements, for the year ended 30 April 2009.
Principal activities
The Group is a leading worldwide provider of IT solutions, software, systems integration and managed services within its core markets of
Wireless and Travel. Analyses of turnover, proﬁt on ordinary activities and net assets are given in note 2 on pages 49 to 53.
Business review and future developments
The Company is required by the Companies Act to include a business review in this report. The information that fulﬁls the requirements of the
business review can be found in the review of the year’s operations, key risks, trading outlook and future developments that are contained in the
Chairman’s statement on page 4, the Chief Executive’s review on page 6, the ﬁnancial review on page 11 and the corporate governance report
on page 23 of this report.
Where the Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information
available to them at the time of their approval of this report. Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent
uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information.
Results
The audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 30 April 2009 are set out on pages 38 to 93. The Group proﬁt for the year, after taxation,
was £36.3m (2008: £13.2m).
Dividends
The Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 0.65p (2008: 0.60p) per ordinary share which, if approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM, will
be due for payment on 20 October 2009 to holders of ordinary shares on the register at the close of business on 18 September 2009. Excluding
the special dividend referred to below, this, together with the interim dividend of 0.3p per ordinary share paid on 20 February 2009, will make a
total dividend for the year of 0.95p (2008: 0.875p) per ordinary share.
Special dividend
On 27 January 2009, shareholders approved a proposal to pay a special dividend to all shareholders of 3p per share. This dividend was paid to
shareholders on 20 February 2009.
Research and development
The total expenditure in the year within continuing operations was £9.8m (2008: £12.7m) of which £10.8m was expensed in the income
statement (2008: £12.7m) including net amortisation of £1.0m (2008: net capitalisation £nil). This expenditure was incurred on product
development and enhancement.
Acquisitions and disposals
On 31 October 2008, the Group completed the sale of Anite Public Sector Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries for a total consideration of
£56.8m payable in cash on completion. Details can be found in note 4 on page 54.
There were no acquisitions during the year.
Share capital and share consolidation
During the year, the Company allotted 460,124 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 10p each.
At a general meeting of the Company held on 27 January 2009, shareholders approved the payment of the special dividend referred to above.
In addition, shareholders also approved a proposal to implement a share consolidation exercise by exchanging eight new ordinary shares for every
nine existing ordinary shares that were held. The share consolidation was completed on 30 January 2009 and 37,326,231 ordinary shares of 10p
each in the Company were cancelled. Following the share consolidation, the Company’s authorised ordinary share capital comprised 355,555,555
new ordinary shares of 11.25p each and the issued ordinary share capital comprised 298,609,840 new ordinary shares of 11.25p each. Details
are set out in note 26 on page 77.
Purchase of own shares
During the year the Company purchased 2,560,698 of its own shares for a consideration of £0.7m under the authority granted by shareholders
at the 2008 Annual General Meeting held on 11 September 2008 to purchase up to 33,809,948 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 10p
each (being 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 17 July 2008). This authority was replaced under the authority that
was granted by shareholders at a general meeting of the Company held on 27 January 2009 to purchase up to 29,860,984 ordinary shares with
a nominal value of 11.25p each (being 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 30 January 2009). A resolution to renew
the authority will be put to shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
All purchases of own shares by the Company were carried out in the market, and the shares were subsequently cancelled. The highest price paid
was 25.25p and the lowest price paid was 24.89p.
In the circular to shareholders dated 2 January 2009, the Company advised shareholders that it intended to complete an on-market buyback
programme of up to £10m, subject to market conditions.
Directors
Details of the persons who were Directors during the year can be found in the report on corporate governance which starts on page 23.
Full biographical details of the Company’s Directors at the date of this report are given on pages 18 to 19. Steve Rowley resigned as a Director
on 31 December 2008. 21
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009
Section C
Management and governance
Mr Nigel Clifford was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 April 2009. Having been appointed since the last general meeting of the
Company, Mr Clifford will retire at the AGM in accordance with Article 64 and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one-third of the Directors must retire at each AGM and that each Director must offer
themselves for re-election at least once every three years. At the 2009 AGM, Mr Humphrey and Mr Peter Bertram will retire by rotation under
Article 66 and, being eligible, they offer themselves for re-election. Mr Bertram, a Non-Executive Director since 2004, has decided to step down
from the Board during the current year following the appointment of a new Finance Director.
The Board considers that the performance of those Directors proposed for re-election continues to be effective and that they demonstrate a
strong commitment to their role. In addition, the Board considers that the performance of the Director proposed for re-appointment will be
effective and that he too demonstrates the necessary commitment.
Directors’ interests
The beneﬁcial interests of the Directors holding ofﬁce at 30 April 2009 and their immediate families in the capital of the Company are as set
out in the remuneration report which starts on page 29. No Director has, or had during the period under review, any interest in any contract of
signiﬁcance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than their own employment contracts.
Directors and ofﬁcers of the Company and its subsidiaries beneﬁt from directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance cover in respect of legal actions
brought against them. In addition, Directors of the Company are indemniﬁed in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the
maximum extent permitted by law. All Directors have deeds of indemnity that are in force as at the date of this report. These indemnities are available
for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities provide cover where the relevant Director or ofﬁcer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Articles of Association
Company law has undergone substantial change since January 2007 when the phased implementation of the Company’s Act 2006 commenced.
The Articles of Association in their present form no longer fully reﬂect current legislation and best practice and it is therefore proposed that the
Company should adopt new Articles of Association at the AGM. Details of the key changes from the current Articles of Association, together
with details of where a copy of the proposed new Articles of Association can be inspected, are contained in the separate Notice of Meeting.
Major shareholders
As at the date of this report, the Company has been notiﬁed of the following holdings of 3% or more of the total voting rights attaching to its
issued share capital:

Aberforth Partners LLP OS.NP
BT Pension Scheme Trustees Ltd OO.QN

Corporate social responsibility
Environmental policy The Company supports the protection of a sustainable environment. The Group’s activities do not produce harmful waste
or emissions and the Ethical Investment Research Service grades Anite as “low impact”. Whilst our operations are, by their nature, of minimal
impact on the environment, we do recognise our responsibilities in this respect.
Anite is therefore committed to:
> complying with the relevant environmental legislation, regulations and industry standards of the countries in which it conducts business;
> reducing the output of emissions that may adversely impact on the environment;
> minimising the consumption of energy and water used in its facilities;
> reducing waste and, wherever practicable, re-using and recycling consumables (e.g. paper, toner cartridges and computer equipment) and
disposing of non-recyclable items in an environmentally acceptable manner; and
> where practicable, purchasing environmentally sound goods and services.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Company is building awareness and promoting initiatives to encourage employees to become
fully engaged.
Corporate governance
A report on corporate governance is contained on pages 23 to 28.
Charitable contributions and voluntary initiatives
Contributions by the Group during the year for charitable purposes amounted to £3,200 (2008: £1,000). The Group does not make any
political donations.
Financial instruments
Details of the ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of the Group are set out in note 23 on page 70. 22

Management and governance
Employees
The energy, commitment and passion of our employees are vital to our business. The Company strives to create a working environment which
encourages people to be individuals and develop their full potential within a framework of shared values and goals. To achieve this, Anite is
committed to a policy which provides all employees and potential employees with equality of opportunity for selection and development
regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, creed, disability or sexuality.
In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Company continues and that
appropriate training is arranged for them.
Employees are provided with information through Myanite, the Group’s global intranet, roadshows and other internal communications.
The views and ideas of employees are sought through discussion, line management and focus groups.
The Company operates a range of employee share schemes for Executive Directors and a small number of senior executives, and they are more
fully described in the remuneration report contained on pages 29 to 34. Since August 2005, the Company has offered employees an enhanced
Share Incentive Plan, which currently matches on a one-for-one basis the number of shares purchased monthly by employees. On 29 June
2009, the Board approved a new Anite UK Sharesave Plan 2009 (the “Plan”) which has also been approved by HM Revenue & Customs. The
Plan is an all employees’ share scheme which currently only provides for options to be granted over shares that are purchased in the market.
The Board will seek approval of shareholders at the AGM to amend the rules of the Plan to enable the Company to operate the Plan using new
issue shares or treasury shares as well as market purchase shares in respect of future grants.
Signiﬁcant contracts
On 1 November 2007, Anite Telecoms Limited entered into a ﬁve-year development and marketing agreement with Agilent Technologies Inc.
This strategic partnership is working to deliver market-leading test solutions for LTE customers. As stated in the Chief Executive’s review on page 6,
the very nature of the leading-edged development programme means that risks remain around the timing and delivery of the completed products.
Change of control
All of the Company’s employee share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid.
Under these provisions, a change of control of the Company would normally be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise or transfer of awards,
subject to any relevant performance conditions being satisﬁed or waived at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Other than contracts in the normal course of business, the Company is not party to any other signiﬁcant agreements that take effect, alter or
terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid other than with regard to the Company’s bank facility agreement, which provides
that, on a change of control, the majority lenders have the ability to cancel and seek repayment of all outstanding loans.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree with all suppliers, where practicable, appropriate terms of trade and to operate within those terms. Trade creditors
at 30 April 2009 represented on average 43 days’ credit (2008: 45 days) for the Group and 29 days’ credit for the Company (2008: 40 days).
Going concern
The Directors acknowledge the latest guidance on going concern. Despite the current volatility in the ﬁnancial markets and uncertain economic
outlook, the Directors believe that the Group has a robust business model as evidenced by the trading of the business over the past six months,
strong free cash ﬂow generation, and is compliant with all its banking covenants. In making their assessment of going concern, the Directors consider
the budgets, including the Wireless research and development commitments, cash forecasts for the following 18 months together with the forecast
covenant positions. In addition, the Directors take into account the current strong net cash position, the availability of banking facilities (as set out in
note 19) and the maturity proﬁle of debt obligations (detailed in note 23). After considering the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Anite continues to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who were Directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:
> so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are not aware; and
> each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
> This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provision of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Re-election of auditors
The Board has considered and recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors. Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to
continue in ofﬁce as auditors, and a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM of the Company will be held at 12pm on Tuesday 15 September 2009 at 353 Buckingham Avenue, Slough, Berkshire SL1 4PF.
The Notice setting out details of the business to be considered at the meeting is sent to shareholders with this Annual Report.

Section C
Management and governance Corporate governance report
The Company is committed to the principles of good corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued
by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the “Code”). This report sets out the Company’s compliance with the Code.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has applied the principles set out in section 1 of the Code, throughout the accounting period including both the main and
supporting principles, by complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanations of how principles and supporting principles have
been applied are set out below and in the remuneration report and the report of the Audit Committee.
The Board
The Board of Directors is the body responsible for corporate governance, for establishing policies and objectives and for the stewardship of
the Group’s resources. It is the Group’s policy that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities
clearly divided and recorded. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. He also
ensures that communication with shareholders is effective and facilitates the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive
is responsible for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board as a whole and for managing the Group. Currently, the Board is made up
of the Non-Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive and three Non-Executive Directors. The Company is currently engaged in the process of
seeking to appoint a Group Finance Director. Peter Bertram is the Senior Independent Director. The biographies of the Directors as at the date
of this report are given on pages 18 to 19.
The Chairman was considered to be independent on his appointment to the Board. It is the opinion of the Board that the three Non-Executive
Directors are independent of management and have no business or other relationship which could interfere materially with the exercise of their
judgement in relation to the business of the Company or the Group.
The Directors believe it is essential that the Company has an effective Board. The Board operates formally through regular Board meetings and
there is also frequent communication between the Directors outside these meetings. During the period under review the Board met 16 times.
Details of attendance at these meetings are given in the table on page 25. During the year the Board also received detailed strategy
presentations from the divisional Managing Directors.
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the management and control of the Group’s activities, its strategic objectives,
governance, internal controls, and the stewardship of its resources. The regular and timely provision of information to the Board is ensured
through the monthly preparation and circulation to all Board members of the Chief Executive’s report, which reports on operational matters;
the Group Finance Director’s report, which provides the monthly management accounts and other relevant ﬁnancial information; and the
Company Secretary’s report, which covers corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and matters concerning the Company’s shares,
share schemes and shareholders. Other matters are tabled on a regular basis at Board meetings or are reported to the Board as appropriate.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further meetings when required. In addition, Directors meet as members of
relevant committees. The Board has delegated the normal operational management of the Company to the Executive Directors, who have
direct responsibility for all operations and activities. The Company currently has only one Executive Director who is supported by an Executive
Team which comprises the Managing Directors of each division, plus the Group Human Resources Director, Group Financial Controller and the
Company Secretary.
The Board has agreed a formal schedule of matters reserved speciﬁcally for its decision which include:
> strategy and objectives;
> business risks;
> business plans and budgets;
> changes in capital and corporate structure;
> accounting policies and ﬁnancial reporting;
> internal controls and business risk factors;
> major contracts;
> capital projects;
> acquisitions and disposals;
> communications with shareholders; and
> Board membership.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without Executive Directors present at least annually.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable
rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed procedure for Directors to obtain independent professional advice, paid for by the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year and each Director
must offer himself for re-election once every three years. In addition, any Director appointed during the year will stand for election at the next
General Meeting, ensuring that each Board member faces re-election at regular intervals. Details of the Directors due to retire at the 2009
Annual General Meeting are shown on page 21. 24

Committees of the Board
The Board’s Committees meet regularly to enable them to discharge their responsibilities. Each Committee has terms of reference which are
reviewed regularly by the Board. Copies are available on request from the Company Secretary or on the Group’s website www.anite.com.
Following formal decision making the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a committee consisting of any two Directors to approve
the detailed execution of an agreed course of action within strict parameters.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Mr Bertram, Mr Brendish and Mr Hurst-Brown. It is chaired by Peter Bertram. The Committee’s role is to assist
the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for ﬁnancial reporting and internal control.
The report of the Audit Committee on page 35 includes details of the Audit Committee and its work.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the three Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive. It is chaired
by David Hurst-Brown. The Committee may invite others, including external advisers, to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Company
Secretary is the secretary to the Committee. The Nomination Committee met ﬁve times during the year. Details of attendance at each meeting
are shown in the table on page 25. Nigel Clifford was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the Company on 1 April 2009. Biographical
details of Nigel are contained on page 19. The Committee is currently engaged with the search for a new Group Finance Director and additional
Non-Executive Director.
The principal role of the Nomination Committee is to advise and make recommendations to the Board with regard to the size, structure and
composition of the Board, the appointment of new Directors and the re-appointment of existing Directors. The Committee follows formal,
rigorous and transparent procedures when appointing new Directors, which include the preparation of a job description, the use of external
advisers to facilitate the search and the evaluation of candidates according to objective criteria. All shortlisted candidates are interviewed
by at least two members of the Committee.
Remuneration Committee

Terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for a term of three years. The terms and conditions of the appointment of the Non-Executive
Directors are available for inspection by any person at Ancells Business Park, Harvest Crescent, Fleet, Hampshire GU51 2UZ or the Company’s
Registered Ofﬁce during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Board performance evaluation and training
The Board, as part of its commitment to ensure its effectiveness and evaluate its performance, completed a full evaluation of its performance
and that of its Directors during the year. This evaluation consisted of a questionnaire being completed by all Board members. In addition,
questionnaires were completed by members of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee in connection with a formal evaluation
of each Committee’s assessment of its performance and effectiveness.
The Non-Executive Directors have met alone to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The evaluation of Board performance will continue to be conducted annually and the Company may engage external help from time to time to
ensure that the process is robust.
Induction and development of directors
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction to the Company.
Individual Directors are expected to take responsibility for identifying their training needs and to take steps to ensure that they are adequately
informed about the Company and their responsibilities as a Director. In addition, the Company has a continuing professional approach to assist
the Directors in discharging their responsibilities effectively. This is achieved through brieﬁngs on business issues, as well as legal, accounting
and changes in corporate governance. Directors also have the ability to attend external seminars on topics that are of interest.
Non-Executive Directors meet regularly with Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team and also receive regular business updates
via scheduled presentations.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Group uses a range of performance measures to measure and manage the businesses within the Group. In addition, the divisions have
established their own performance indicators that are speciﬁc to their individual businesses.
The Group KPIs monitor order intake, revenue, margins, research and development costs, overhead costs, cash ﬂow, capital expenditure and
headcount. In addition to these Group KPIs, other measures indicating speciﬁc divisional measures such as product development, loss-making
projects, manpower utilisation and working capital are used.
The Group changes and reﬁnes the KPIs regularly dependent on the major issues that are identiﬁed in the businesses.
Internal control and risk
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide them with
reasonable assurance that all information used within the business and for external publication is adequate, including ﬁnancial, operational
and compliance control and risk management, and for ensuring that assets are safeguarded and therefore that shareholders’ investment is
protected. There are limitations in any system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group continues to enhance its project management procedures to ensure that good practice is applied consistently across the Group. 26
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009 Corporate governance report
Section C
Management and governance
In line with past practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control system in place during the year and until the date of the approval of this
report to ensure that it remains effective. Where signiﬁcant weaknesses are identiﬁed as a result of the reviews, new procedures are put in place
to strengthen controls.
The Board has in place risk assessment processes across the Group’s divisions, and procedures have been established to implement best
practice. There is an ongoing process for identifying, managing and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by the businesses. This process
has been in place throughout the year under review, and continues. It operates under the direction of the Board and is reviewed by the
Audit Committee.
The key procedures that the Board has established and which are designed to provide effective internal control for the Group are:
> The Board sets out the Group authority procedures, which are adopted by all the subsidiary companies.
> The issue of a Group accounting and procedures manual which sets out the Group’s accounting practices, revenue recognition rules,
accounting under IFRS and bid approval processes.
> The Board continues to review the progress of major contracts.
> The Director of Projects and Programmes oversees project management standards and procedures across the Group and the education
of all divisional project managers in best practice for the management of bids and the execution and status reporting of projects.
> The application of a rigorous annual budgeting process following a detailed divisional and Group strategy review. All budgets are subject to
approval at Board level.
> The Executive Team is responsible for reviewing the operational results, communicating and applying Group-wide polices and procedures,
and strategy on operational matters which is communicated both to the Board and to the operating units.
> The formal monthly operational review by Executive Directors together with the divisional management teams to assess the ﬁnancial and
operating performance and discuss the ongoing development of each business unit and the comparison of detailed monthly management
reports against budgets, forecasts and prior years. In addition, the Chief Executive and Group Financial Controller (in the absence of a Group
Finance Director) prepare a monthly report for the Board on key developments, performance and issues in the business.
> The maintenance of local operating boards and divisional management teams, enabling the Board to delegate appropriate levels of
authority to a small number of subsidiary company directors and managers, all of whom are directly accountable to the Board.
> The identiﬁcation and mitigation of major business risks is the responsibility of operating company management. Each operating company
maintains internal controls and procedures appropriate to its structure and business environment, whilst complying with Group policies,
standards and guidelines. The Managing Director and Finance Director of each business unit are required to complete a self assessment
checklist half yearly. This provides assurance that the business unit has complied with internal controls, ﬁnancial controls and reporting
requirements of the Group and has brought to the attention of Group management any instances of fraud or other matters relating to
their business.
> Insurance cover is maintained for all the major risk areas of the Group based on the scale of the risk and the availability of cover in the
external market.
> The use of external professional advisers to carry out due diligence reviews of potential acquisitions.
> The operation of a small internal review function to carry out internal control reviews of the operating divisions on a rolling basis,
reporting to the Audit Committee.
> The periodic detailed objective review of each business and its future direction by management and the Audit Committee.
The Board, with the advice and recommendations of the Audit Committee, will continue to review the effectiveness of all internal systems of
control through independent reports where appropriate, and by internal formal monthly review meetings in all main operating companies and
divisions to test the validity of the internal reporting process.
Internal review function
The Board has established a Group internal review function which reports to the Audit Committee. The function is not an independent audit
function but nevertheless it is an important part of the Group’s overall system of internal control.
Risk management
Anite has undergone signiﬁcant change over the past few years. Anite is now an international software and solutions company focused on the
provision of test and operational systems in the wireless market and reservations and e-commerce solutions to the leisure and travel industry.
These markets provide signiﬁcant challenges as well as rewards and management have progressively improved the Group’s approach to risk
management.
The combination of robust and well-deﬁned central direction, strong divisional management and effective processes and controls enable the
Group to identify and deal with key risks at the earliest opportunity.
The Group operates rigorous processes and controls to ensure that for each division there is a detailed annual operating plan and budget with a
monthly operational review by senior management to ensure the businesses are making progress against those plans, taking the appropriate corrective
actions throughout the course of the year should issues arise. The progress of each division is reported regularly to the main Board meetings.
The principal risk factors that may affect Anite Group’s business are outlined below. These are not all within the Group’s control; other factors
beside those listed may also affect the Group. 27

Section C
Management and governance
Business asset risk
The Group increasingly operates in global markets and failure to manage its portfolio of businesses effectively could have a serious impact.
The Group conducts regular reviews of its business portfolio; it may, however, still be exposed to risks such as increased taxation, regulations
and threats to its market leadership.
Political climate risk
The Group recognises that in some countries in which it operates, speciﬁc country risks exist that could have an effect on its business and such
risks may include volatility of national currencies, unexpected changes in local laws, regulations or standards and changes in local customs and
business practices.
Project delivery risk
The successes of many of the Group businesses are dependent on the successful completion of development projects within budget, cost and
speciﬁcations. The delivery of these projects is subject to certain technical, commercial, legal, contractor and economic risks.
Strategic and operational risks
Within Wireless
> The highly technical and fast-changing nature of the marketplace.
> Ensuring the business realises continued growth in network testing.
> The ability to identify and maintain effective relationships with key suppliers and strategic partners.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
Within Travel
> The changing nature of the customer market resulting from increasing use of the internet.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
> Delivery of projects and contracts to our clients within agreed budgets and timescales.
> Ensuring the business is ﬂexible enough to accommodate the changing structure of the travel industry.
> Ensuring that the division has common robust systems and back-up processes in place to mitigate problems of external infrastructure
failures that might have an impact on the division’s performance.
Human resource and organisation risks
Anite’s performance and its ability to mitigate signiﬁcant risks within its control depend on its employees and management teams.
Future success will depend to a large extent on the Group’s ability to attract, retain and motivate its people.
If the Group loses the services of key people or is unable to attract and retain employees with the right capabilities and experience, it would
be likely to have an effect on the Group’s business and operations.
Financial risks
The Group has several ﬁnancial risks, including costs, the nature of commercial contracts, interest rates, exchange rates, insurances and other
ﬁnancial risks. Some of these are covered in the Group treasury management section below.
The Group also recognises that the continued change in the Group’s portfolio and geographic spread requires new risk mitigation techniques
which enable the Group to:
> manage bank debt in compliance with banking covenants.
> identify and mitigate the effect of currency, interest rate and cost changes.
> mitigate the increase in the Group’s tax rate as sales and proﬁts expand in higher tax areas.
Group treasury management
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise borrowings, derivatives, cash and liquid resources, and various items such as trade debtors and
trade creditors that arise directly from, and ﬁnance, operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis. The Group’s
head ofﬁce ﬁnance function is responsible for ensuring that the policies approved by the Board are adopted throughout the Group.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is subject to a cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside each operating company’s functional
currency. Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge. Any surplus cross-border transactional
exposure is not hedged. The policy is that any surplus foreign currency is converted into sterling at the earliest opportunity.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc and whose revenues and
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group currently partly hedges its investment in overseas subsidiaries through ﬁnancial
instruments and natural hedges. Further details are set out in note 23(f) on page 72. 28
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009 Corporate governance report
Section C
Management and governance
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained reserves and bank borrowings. The Group seeks to minimise
overall net interest expense, and where there are surplus funds to obtain a fair market rate of return. The Group operates a cash-pooling
arrangement for all its UK operating companies and endeavours to balance liquidity requirements with achieving a market rate of return on
cash through the use of short-term money market deposits or other term deposits. Appropriate ﬁnancial instruments are used to mitigate the
impact of changes in interest payable in respect of signiﬁcant borrowings. Further details are set out in note 23(e) on page 71.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain a balance of available facilities to fund the Group’s liquidity requirements, further details of which are set out in
note 23(k) on page 73.
The Group has strong operating cash inﬂows and has focused efforts on managing its working capital.
Credit risk
The Group’s policy on credit risk is set out in note 23(j) on page 73.
Relations with shareholders
Communications
The Board considers effective communication with its investors, whether institutional, private or employee shareholders, to be extremely important.
The Company reports formally twice a year, with the half-year results announcement and the preliminary announcement of the full-year
results. Shareholders are issued with an Interim Report and Accounts in December and with the full-year Report and Accounts in July.
Additionally, as required under Article 6 of the Transparency Directive, the Company issues an interim management statement during each
half year. These reports are posted on www.anite.com.
The Company makes other announcements from time to time, which can also be found on www.anite.com.
Members of the Board meet institutional investors on a regular basis, providing an opportunity to discuss, in the context of publicly available
information, the progress of the business. Institutional investors and analysts are also invited to attend brieﬁngs by the Company following the
announcements of the annual and interim results.
During the year the Non-Executive Directors met a number of major shareholders individually.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are available to shareholders on all matters relating to governance.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on 15 September 2009 at the Company’s registered ofﬁce in Slough. The notice of meeting is sent to
shareholders at least 20 working days before the AGM. The Directors encourage the participation of private shareholders at the AGM and are
available for questions both formally during the meeting and informally afterwards. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees are normally available to answer questions at the AGM.

Management and governance Remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and associated regulations as inserted by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”) and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the
Company at which the ﬁnancial statements will be presented for approval.
The Regulations require the independent auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders on certain speciﬁed matters and this report has
therefore been split into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management
and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee); Peter Bertram, Clay Brendish and
Nigel Clifford who was appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 April 2009. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met eight times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance
report on page 25.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is also
responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Chief Executive’s direct reports,
and for monitoring and approving the operation of all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines the terms and
conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company’s website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses Hewitt New Bridge Street as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee share schemes. Hewitt
New Bridge Street provide no other services to the Company.
The Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director provide the Committee with information and assistance. The Chief Executive
also regularly attends Committee meetings to provide his own insights on business objectives and the individual performance of his direct
reports. However, no Executive Director or senior manager is present when their own remuneration is being speciﬁcally discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company’s objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
> total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and their direct reports
benchmarked regularly against the market;
> incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director’s total remuneration and are designed to drive and reward
exceptional performance; and
> long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the
shareholders and to support the Company’s business strategy.
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and
employment elsewhere in the Group, liaising with the Group Human Resources Director where appropriate.
The Committee will ensure that the incentive structures for Executive Directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or
governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures,
there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters, nor do these
remuneration structures encourage inappropriate operational risk taking.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors’ total remuneration packages consist of:
> base salary;
> annual performance bonus;
> long-term incentive arrangements; and
> other beneﬁts and allowances.
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect. 30
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009 Remuneration report
Section C
Management and governance
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software and
computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability include market sector, size and business complexity.
On 31 December 2008, Mr Humphrey was appointed as Chief Executive. To reﬂect his new responsibilities, the Committee reviewed
Mr Humphrey’s salary and agreed that it would be right to increase his base salary to £310,000.
Annual performance bonus
The Company operates an Annual Bonus Plan (“the Plan”) for Executive Directors. Under the terms of the Plan, a bonus of up to 100% of salary
can be earned. For the year under review, bonuses were paid by reference to performance against (i) a sliding scale of challenging Group proﬁt
growth targets (calculated excluding fair value write downs, amortisation of acquired business, gains or losses on business disposals and
deduction of share-based payments) (ii) pre-agreed stretching personal objectives and (iii) delivery of key strategic business objectives.
For the ﬁnancial year 2009/10 the Plan will place greater emphasis on the achievement of speciﬁc quantiﬁable objectives, together with
challenging ﬁnancial targets all of which are set with the primary objective of enhancing returns to shareholders. This change in policy is
regarded as appropriate due to the number of recent senior management appointments coupled with the Committee’s view that realistic and
highly targeted incentivisation is important at a time of major change in a number of the business units.
In reviewing the performance of the whole year, the Committee has made an annual bonus payment of £238,631 which reﬂects Mr Humphrey’s
split of executive roles and increased responsibility during the year and the successful over performance of the Company against the targets
that were agreed.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans:
> the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and
> the Share Matching Plan (SMP).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of their salary per annum (although in exceptional
circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). The awards that have been granted to date have been made as
conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. As originally structured,
participants were allowed to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which were then matched on a two-for-one
(gross) basis.
In 2007, shareholders approved a change to the investment level under the SMP. Pursuant to this change, whilst the effective average annual
level of co-investment in the SMP remained unchanged at 30% per annum, executives were provided with a “one-off” opportunity over the
three ﬁnancial years from 1 May 2007 to 30 April 2010 to invest a higher amount annually (up to 90% of base salary) in the SMP. However, any
investment is subject to the effective current overall aggregate limit of 90% of salary over this three-year period. The original two-for-one gross
matching ratio was retained. With effect from 1 May 2010 it is currently intended that the SMP will revert to the normal 30% per annum
investment limit.
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. The awards made during 2006 under both PSP and
SMP were subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition which measures the Company’s TSR performance against a
comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector over a single three-year
performance period commencing on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year in which the award is made.
In respect of the PSP and SMP awards made in 2006, a total of 25% of the award was available to vest if the Company was ranked at the
median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of the award vesting if the Company is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-
line vesting in between). The performance of the 2006 awards made under the PSP and SMP have been measured against the comparator
group for the period ended 30 April 2009 and the result was below median. Therefore, none of these awards will vest and the award will lapse
on the third anniversary of grant.
The PSP and SMP awards made in 2007 and 2008 are subject to the following performance conditions:
> half of awards are subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This will continue to be measured relative to the FTSE Software and
Computer Services Sector, with the same median to upper quartile vesting schedule as has applied to past awards; and
> half of awards are assessed by reference to Anite’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. For compound annual EPS growth of at least RPI
plus 4% per annum, 25% of awards subject to this part of the condition will vest, and for full vesting, compound annual EPS growth must be
at least RPI plus 12% per annum. Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
The EPS ﬁgure used for PSP and SMP measurement in 2007 was 5.2p being basic EPS before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, gains
and losses on the disposal of operations, the effect of net capitalisation/net amortisation on research and development costs, results from
discontinued/disposed operations and share-based payments. 31
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009
Section C
Management and governance
The EPS ﬁgure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2008 was 3.3p being proﬁt from continuing businesses before disposed businesses,
other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs.
However, before any awards vest, the Committee must have satisﬁed itself that the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance over the
performance period warrants the level of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition. The extent to which the
performance condition is satisﬁed will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the appropriate level of third-party veriﬁcation.
The change in performance conditions for the 2007 awards onwards compared to earlier awards was made by the Committee as it believes
that, whilst TSR is an important indicator of shareholder value creation, it is also advisable to focus the Company’s senior executives on driving
Group proﬁtability.
The Committee intends to apply broadly similar performance conditions to any PSP or SMP awards that may be made in the forthcoming year.
The Committee will continue to regularly review the operation of the Company’s share incentive arrangements to ensure that they take due
account of market practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
TSR performance graph
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are required to retain
in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they have built up a shareholding equal
to 100% of base salary.
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company’s Sharesave Plan 2009 and the Share Incentive Plan which are available
to all employees.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year period.
The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders’ views in connection with this matter, continues to take
active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company’s share incentives and is currently working under an informal dilution limit of 10%.
The actual dilution is currently 8.7%.
Other beneﬁts and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with
reasonable business expenses.
Other share plans
In 2007, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and all
awards are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 8 on page 57.
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is that all Executive Directors’ service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year’s duration. Other than in the case of
dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of Mr Humphrey’s service contract will be honoured in full. Information regarding the Executive
Directors’ service contracts who served during the year is summarised in the table below.

2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
3 Steve Rowley resigned as a Director of the Company with effect from 31 December 2008.
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reﬂect a departing Director’s
obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that
is payable in the event that an Executive Director’s service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders’ interests that the
maximum obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates Mr Humphrey’s employment without cause, the Remuneration Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion it
has under the terms of any share incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this recommendation,
he shall be entitled to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of ofﬁce with six months’ notice of termination required by either party. Peter Bertram, David Hurst-Brown
and Nigel Clifford each have a three-year term of ofﬁce with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of ofﬁce.
Further details of the Non-Executive Directors’ terms of employment can be found on page 24.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors’ fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive
Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the
Board and its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration.

Management and governance Report of the Audit Committee
Membership
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board which comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management and free
from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: Peter Bertram (Chairman); Clay Brendish; and David Hurst-Brown.
Both Peter Bertram and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be “independent” as deﬁned by Provision A.3.1 of the Combined Code.
Clay Brendish was considered to have met the independence criteria on his appointment as Chairman of the Company on 4 October 2005.
The Board considers that Mr Bertram has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Group provides an induction programme for new Audit Committee members.
The Committee invites others, including the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the Chief
Executive, to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
Meetings
During the period under review the Committee met twice. Details of attendance at each meeting are shown in the table in the corporate
governance report on page 25.
The Committee meets with the external auditors without any Executive Directors present at least annually and more often if this is
considered appropriate.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for ﬁnancial reporting and internal review.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
> reviewing the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements and results announcements of the Company, and any other formal announcements
relating to the Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
> reviewing the Company’s accounting policies;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s systems of internal control and risk management;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s “whistleblowing” procedures;
> monitoring and reviewing the requirement for an internal audit function;
> considering the appointment of the Company’s external auditors, overseeing the process for their selection and making recommendations
to the Board in relation to their appointment; and
> overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including approval of their remuneration, agreeing the scope of the audit engagement,
assessing their independence, monitoring the provision of non-audit services, and considering their reports on the Company’s ﬁnancial
statements and systems of internal control and risk management.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which can be found on the Company’s website.
Internal audit
The Committee agreed in July 2006 to create an internal review function, headed by a member of the Group ﬁnance team, who, under the
control of the Audit Committee, carries out a plan of detailed reviews throughout the operating companies. Where additional resource is
required, this is sourced either from an external professional ﬁrm or by selecting divisional staff who carry out peer reviews in divisions other
than their own. This internal review function does not represent an independent internal audit function as deﬁned by professional internal audit
standards, but has been a signiﬁcant enhancement in the Group’s internal control framework.
Independence of external auditors
The Committee keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors including:
> the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, taking into account the relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements
and the relationship with the auditors as a whole, including the provision of non-audit and consulting services; and
> the consideration of audit fees and any fees for non-audit and consulting services.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, International
Accounting Standard 1requires that Directors:
> properly select and apply accounting policies;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
> make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
> the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
> the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Anite plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc for the year ended 30 April 2009 which comprise consolidated income statement,
the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes
1 to 30. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements:
> give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
> have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
> have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent
with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
> certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
> we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
> the Directors’ statement contained within the report of the Directors in relation to going concern; and
> the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined
Code speciﬁed for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc for the year ended and on the information in the
Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

for the year ended 30 April 2009
Section D
Financial statements 42
1 Statement of accounting policies
a) General information
Anite plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company
for the year ended 30 April 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The principal activities of the
Company and its subsidiaries are described in note 14.The ﬁnancial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 1 July 2009. The ﬁnancial
statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
b) Basis of preparation
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. Therefore the Group ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of EU IAS regulations.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial instruments.
The Directors acknowledge the latest guidance on going concern. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis as set out on page 22 in the Report of the Directors.
i) Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas requiring a higher degree of
judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, are discussed in the relevant
accounting policies under the following headings:
1 Goodwill (note1(e));
2 Intangible assets (note 1(f)(ii and iii));
3 Revenue recognition (note 1(k));
4 Taxation (note 1(l));
5 Employee beneﬁts – share-based compensation (note1(m)); and
6 Provisions (note 1(p)).
ii) IFRIC Interpretations and amendments/new IFRS
The IFRIC interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective in 2009 and those that are not yet effective are discussed
in section 1(s) below.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
c) Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company, all of which are
made up to 30 April each year. The results of companies acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on
which control passed. Control is achieved where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the ﬁnancial and operating
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The results of subsidiaries
disposed in the year are included in the consolidated income statement up to the effective date of disposal.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁcit in the cost
of acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in
the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those
used by the Group. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
d) Foreign currency
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange at the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of
exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary
assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations and on foreign currency
borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are recognised directly in the hedging and translation
reserve account (“other reserves”).

Section D
Financial statements 43
1 Statement of accounting policiescontinued
d) Foreign currency continued
Any differences that have arisen since 1 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are included in the retained earnings account. Such translation
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-
denominated assets and liabilities.
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included
in determining the proﬁt or loss on disposal or closure.
Goodwill arising prior to the transition to IFRS has been recognised and measured in accordance with UK GAAP, but no longer amortised.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash-generating
units (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future ﬁnancial performance
of the cash-generating units, including management’s estimates of long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates. The carrying amount
of goodwill and the key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use of CGUs to which goodwill is attributed are disclosed in note 11.
f) Intangible assets
i) Software licences
Software licences are initially measured at cost. Cost includes the purchase price of the assets and the directly attributable costs of bringing the
asset into its intended use. After initial recognition, the intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation less any accumulated
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged evenly over the assets’ estimated useful life.
ii) Separately identiﬁable intangible assets arising on business combinations
Separately identiﬁable intangible assets such as customer relations, technology and in process R&D are recognised only when the assets meet
the following conditions:
a) meet the separately identiﬁable criteria below;
b) are controlled by the acquiring company;
c) provide a probable source of future economic beneﬁts; and
d) the fair value can be measured reliably.
The criteria to be separately identiﬁable are met when the intangible asset:
i) is capable of being separated from the acquired business; and
ii) arises from contractual or legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired company or other
rights and obligations.
The amortisation period ranges from ﬁve to ten years and is based on equal annual instalments over the assets’ estimated useful life.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment of the future economic beneﬁts generated by these separately identiﬁable intangible assets and the determination of its
amortisation proﬁle involve a signiﬁcant degree of judgement based on management estimation of future potential revenue and proﬁt and the
useful life of the assets. Reviews are performed regularly to ensure the recoverability of these intangible assets.
iii) Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities as deﬁned in IFRS is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on internally generated intangible assets arising from the Group’s development activities is recognised only when both the
identiﬁcation and recognition criteria as deﬁned in IAS38 for an intangible asset and the following six criteria are met:
1 the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use has been achieved;
2 the Group has the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it;
3 the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset;
4 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic beneﬁts;
5 adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
6 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
If these conditions are not met, such development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

f) Intangible assets continued
iii) Research and development expenditure continued
The qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. This expenditure is capitalised
from the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the product is in use. Internally generated intangible assets
including capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives which management estimate to be
no more than three years.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment that the internally generated assets will generate future economic beneﬁts relies on the management’s estimation of future cash
ﬂow streams of these assets. The technical feasibility of the assets involves a degree of management’s judgement as to when this is achieved.
Management’s assessment regarding the useful lives of capitalised development costs is based upon the typical product life cycle for similar
assets in the market adjusted by the risks associated with each capitalised development project.
g) Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Land and buildings, ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings, computer equipment and vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets and freehold properties, at rates calculated to write off the cost over the estimated useful
lives, on a straight-line basis, as follows:
Freehold properties 2% per annum of cost excluding land
Short leasehold properties Length of lease
Ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 10% to 50% per annum of cost
Vehicles 25% per annum of cost
Computer equipment 33% per annum of cost
Costs relating to short leasehold properties, ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings and vehicles are included in the “plant, ﬁxtures,
equipment and motor vehicles” category (see note 13).
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Any tangible or intangible asset
with an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as
income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a
revaluation increase.
i) Other investments
Other investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
j) Inventories and work in progress
Inventories and short-term work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include materials and, where
relevant, direct labour and appropriate overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their present
location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

k) Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with the right to use the Group’s products.
Where any associated services are not essential to the functionality of the software then the software revenue is recognised when the following
conditions are met:
> persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;
> the Company’s fee is ﬁxed or determinable; and
> collection is probable.
Revenue is recognised on delivery with a retention to be recognised on acceptance or otherwise as performance is deﬁned in the relevant
customer contract.
Revenue generated from ﬁxed price contracts, including relevant licence fees where service essential to the functionality of the software is
being performed, is recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract. Provision is made for any expected losses on
uncompleted contracts. Amounts recoverable on ﬁxed price contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at the net sales value of the
work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. Excess progress payments are included in creditors as payments on
account. Cumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provisions for contingencies and anticipated future losses
on contracts, are included as ﬁxed price contract balances in work in progress.
Contracts which meet the deﬁnition of construction contract, are disclosed separately as “amount due from construction customers” in “trade
and other receivables” or “amount due to construction customers” in “trade and other payables”, as required under IAS 11 “Construction
Contracts”. See note 21 for more details.
Revenue generated from time and material contracts is recognised in line with when the work is performed.
Maintenance revenue is generally recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, taking into account any free
maintenance periods.
Managed services revenue is recognised over the life of the contract. Costs incurred on a contract from third parties, which are directly related
to the contract, are capitalised and recognised over the life of the contract. Contract proﬁtability is regularly reviewed and, if necessary,
provision for any forecast loss arising is made. Sales, operational and administrative costs are written off as incurred.
All ﬁnance income is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The revenue and proﬁt of ﬁxed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be
estimated reliably. Management exercises judgement in determining whether a contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably. Management
also makes estimates of the total cost of professional services, or, in some instances, total contract costs which are used in determining the
value of amounts recoverable on contracts and any related provisions required for onerous contracts. Estimates are continually revised based
on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
The carrying amount of amounts recoverable on contracts is disclosed in note 21.
Management has exercised a degree of judgement in formulating a set of criteria used for determining when revenue that involves several
deliverable elements should be recognised on a bundled or unbundled basis.
l) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or
deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the balance sheet
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009
Section D
Financial statements 46
1 Statement of accounting policiescontinued
l) Taxation continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on
transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where the ﬁnal outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be
different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded
in the period in which such a determination is made. The carrying values of current tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed
separately in the consolidated balance sheet.
m) Employee beneﬁts
i) Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed
retirement beneﬁt schemes are dealt with as payments to deﬁned contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are
equivalent to those arising in a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme. The Group has no deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
ii) Share-based compensation
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based payments plans for its employees. The fair value of shares determined at the grant date
of the equity-settled share-based payment is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme (“SAYE scheme”), which allows employees the ability to
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value. The Group records an expense, based on its best estimate of the
fair value of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group has granted executive options, which include approved option plans and long-term incentive plans. The grant price is normally equal
to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally three to ten years. If the options
remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee
leaves the Group before the options vest, unless the employee meets certain “good leaver” conditions.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The fair value of the SAYE scheme and executive option scheme is measured by using the Black-Scholes and a stochastic model, namely the
Monte-Carlo pricing model, respectively. The total amount of this fair value to be expensed rateably over the vesting period is determined by
reference to the fair value of the options at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (such as proﬁt targets).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable or the
number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. This estimate is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is charged or
credited to the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Market vesting conditions such as TSR targets are factored into the fair value of the option and, therefore, no subsequent adjustments will be
made if performance conditions are not met.
The proceeds received on exercise of the options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity.
For more details on the assumptions made in the valuation, see note 8.
n) Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.

Section D

1 Statement of accounting policies continued
n) Financial instruments continued
ii) Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including
transaction costs.
Investments are classiﬁed as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net proﬁt or loss for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net
proﬁt or loss for the period.
iii) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
iv) Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
o) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group does
not enter into speculative derivative contracts and all such instruments, if used by the Group, are for hedging purposes to alter the risk proﬁle
of an existing underlying exposure to the Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the
use of ﬁnancial derivatives.
Cash ﬂow hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash ﬂow hedge of a ﬁrm commitment
or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement
in the same period in which the hedged item affects net proﬁt or loss.
Fair value hedge
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk
being hedged with the corresponding entry in proﬁt or loss. Gains or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives the foreign
currency component of its carrying amount, are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement
as they arise.
Discontinued hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred
to net proﬁt or loss for the period.
Anite
Annual report and accounts 2009
Section D
Financial statements 48
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
o) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting continued
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the hedging and translation reserve account (“other reserves”);
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss under the heading of “other gains and losses”.
Gains or losses deferred in the foreign currency translation reserve are recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss on disposal of the foreign
operation.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains
or losses reported in the income statement.
p) Provisions
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts, vacant properties with outstanding leases to settle, restructuring costs and legal claims are
recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events. This is where, in management’s view, it is more
likely than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring
provisions comprise unexpired future lease payments, employee termination payments and removal costs. Provisions for restructuring costs
are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Deferred consideration provision is management’s best estimate of the contingent consideration payable to vendors, which may be subject to
change as this is dependent on the fulﬁlment of certain performance targets of the businesses acquired.
Property provisions are established on a property-by-property basis to meet the estimated liabilities, including dilapidations. The provision
covers all ongoing unavoidable costs net of rental income. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
q) Operating proﬁt from continuing operations
Operating proﬁt from continuing operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before ﬁnance income or charges and before other
gains or losses.
r) Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable
to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see above).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

2.6 Restructuring costs
As a result of the disposal of Anite Public Sector, the head ofﬁce property at 353 Buckingham Avenue, Slough, will be underutilised due to the
relocation of Anite Public Sector staff. In light of the current market conditions for ofﬁce space, there is uncertainty over whether the Group will
be able to utilise or sublet the empty space in the near future although management are actively seeking to mitigate this. A provision has been
established in the current period in accordance with IAS37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”.
The provision in the prior period relates to the restructuring of the Wireless division. This provision includes the impact of both asset write-
downs of the own-platform development costs and other costs of restructuring and redundancy.

† Expected life for other share-based payments is 100% of the options that are exercised after three years if a gain of 10% is available. If this gain is not available, options are held until
such a gain can be achieved. Any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing that they are “in the money”. For LTIP (proﬁt element only) – 5% p.a. leavers in the ﬁrst three
years was assumed. Under the PSP, SMP and MIP awards, the expected life is equal to the vesting period of three years. However, for MIP, depending on performance, annual vesting
is possible.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the following periods (expected
life) up to grant date: other share-based schemes – three years and SAYE three, four and ﬁve years for three, four and ﬁve year contracts
respectively.
The period of exceptional volatility for the period from 30 September 1999 to 24 July 2002 was removed from the volatility calculations.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise
restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The Group earns its proﬁts in the UK and overseas. The tax rate used for tax on proﬁt on ordinary activities is 28%, reduced from 30%
in periods to 31 March 2008, being the standard rate for UK corporation tax, as the Group’s head ofﬁce is in UK.
Some components of the Group’s overseas proﬁts are likely to be taxed at an effective rate that is higher than the UK rate. Other components,
due to the availability of losses brought forward in certain countries, are likely to be taxed at a lower rate.

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment tests
The cash generating unit (CGU) is typically the combination of a group of assets acquired which cannot be separately identiﬁed, within each
primary segment of the Group. The carrying amounts, basis of determination and key assumptions for the goodwill impairment calculations are
as follows:
Wireless Nemo Wireless other Travel other
Carrying amount of goodwill £000 52,913 5,302 6,200
Basis on which the CGU’s recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use
Key assumptions:
Discount rate % 10.6 10.6 10.0
Includes a risk factor of % 0.6 0.6 –
Long-term growth rate % 0.0 0.0 0.0
Period over which cash ﬂows are projected years 33 3
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group as adjusted for risk. The WACC is derived by taking the
average of the results from calculations using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and dividend growth model, using data from leading
market data providers.
The risk adjustments relate to management’s view of the sensitivity to technology risk within the Wireless segment and are based on past
experience.
The period over which the cash ﬂows are projected is set at three years. The cash ﬂow projections are based on the budgets, strategic plans,
knowledge of the market, performance of the sector and management’s view of the recoverable amount based on observable market prices for
the CGU.
The long-term growth rate has been set at zero for each CGU. Management are sensitive to the technology risk within the software industry
and do not deem it appropriate to forecast growth for products more than three years into the future.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Wireless Nemo – Management has based its determination of the unit’s recoverable amount on the key assumptions listed above. At 30 April
2009, the recoverable amount of Wireless Nemo exceeded its carrying amount by £4.9m. A 1% perpetual reduction in the operating margin
would reduce its recoverable amount by £0.8m.

The amounts presented in the table above are net of provision for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that all credit trade customers are subject to credit veriﬁcation procedures and where appropriate, parent
guarantee and letters of credit, especially for overseas customers, are used so that the Group is exposed to a minimum level of bad debts.
The credit risk for trade receivables by business segments for 2009 and 2008 is as follows (2008 percentages based on the larger Group
receivables balance that included Anite Public Sector):
In Travel, the top four customers represent 8% (2008: 9%) of the Group’s trade receivables.
In Wireless, the top four customers represent 27% (2008: 7%) of the Group’s trade receivables.
Overall, the Group has no customer that accounted for 9% or more of the accounts receivable at 30 April 2009 (2008: 3%, (excluding Anite
Public Sector, 6%)) and, therefore, there is no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated
counterparties.
The average credit period for trade receivables is 79 days (2008: 54 days, (excluding Anite Public Sector: 68 days)). In the United Kingdom trade
receivables are typically on 30 days’ credit terms whilst, in certain cases, a schedule of payments or extended payments have been agreed. In
other geographical areas, especially Europe, trade receivables can be based on longer credit terms of up to 90 days before the debt falls due for
payment. Interest may be charged on any outstanding balance that is 30 days overdue. At 30 April 2009 and 2008, the trade receivables were
non-interest bearing.
The Group has provided for all debts that are deemed doubtful at their estimated irrecoverable amount and for all receivables that are more
than three months overdue except in certain cases where monies have been received after the reporting date or the revenue has not been
recognised. The reason for the policy is because receivables more than three months overdue carry an increased risk of not being recoverable.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables:

There is no known reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course. Of the debts past due but not impaired, revenue has not
been recognised on 14% (2008: 51%) of those debts greater than three months overdue.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Cash at bank and in hand was invested on a ﬂoating rate basis and is therefore subject to cash ﬂow interest risk. The Group has the legal right of
set-off for certain of its overdraft and cash balances under an offsetting arrangement within its banking facilities.
Term and overnight deposits comprise money market deposits, which attract interest rates based on market rates, ﬁxed for periods of up to
three months. The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate to their fair values.

costs being amortised over the period of the loan.
The loan was taken out on 30 November 2006 under a borrowing facility (see note 23(k) for more details) maturing on 30 November 2011.
This loan is secured by a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge on the Group’s assets.
This loan carries a weighted average ﬂoating interest rate of 5.52% (2008: 6.57%) and exposes the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. This
interest rate risk was partly hedged by the Group using derivative ﬁnancial instruments (note 22).
The bank loans are initially measured at fair value and net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The average effective interest rate for this loan was
5.87% (2008: 7.34%)

Cash ﬂow hedges – interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
At 30 April 2009, the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totalling £20m (2008: £20m) have ﬁxed interest rate payments
at an average rate of 5.535% and have ﬂoating interest receipts at LIBOR rate for periods up until 31 October 2011.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as shown above are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash ﬂow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity. The net
amount of the swaps that has been expensed against hedged interest payments made in the period is £250 (2008: £3,000).
Net investment hedges – cross-currency swaps
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc and whose revenues and
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group has hedged part of its net investment in overseas subsidiaries through natural
hedges and utilisation of cross-currency swaps.
At the balance sheet date, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of cross-currency swaps and forward exchange contracts that denote
the net investment hedge, including the exchange of principals was €92.9m (£83.5m) (2008: €136.6m (£109.5m)) and £61.4m (2008:
£92.2m). The ﬁxed interest rates on the cross-currency swap elements, range from 4.64% to 5.19% (2008: 4.64% to 5.19%) and the ﬂoating
interest rates are based on LIBOR (sterling) and EURIBOR (euro). The combined hedging instruments of cross-currency swaps and forward
exchange contracts were used to hedge the euro-denominated net investment of Wireless Nemo.
The fair value change on the cross-currency swaps which is approximately 99% effective against the hedged item is recognised in the hedging
and translation reserve. An amount of £1,057,000 (2008: £43,000) of ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement during the year.

23 Financial risk management
a) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising
the returns to the shareholders through the optimisation of the net debt and equity balance.
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
2009 2008
Note £000 £000
Net debt 20 – 15,450
Total equity OJ,PHG 62,544
Capital employed OJ,PHG 77,994
Under the credit facility agreement, the Group is subject to certain ﬁnancial covenants relating to leverage, cash ﬂow and interest cover
and also the requirement that the maximum pre-agreed level of overdrafts and ancillary facilities granted to the Group companies that are
guarantors of the credit facility are not exceeded. The Group has complied with these covenants and requirements.
b) Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Details of the signiﬁcant accounting policies and methods adopted, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses
are recognised, in respect of each class of ﬁnancial asset, liability and equity are disclosed in note 1.
c) Categories of ﬁnancial instruments

d) Financial risk management
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities mainly comprise bank borrowings, cash and liquid resources, derivative ﬁnancial instruments,
deferred consideration for acquisitions and various items, such as trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency
risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

23 Financial risk management continued
e) Market risk – interest rate
The Group ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is reviewed
from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at ﬂoating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk by selectively
using interest rate swaps and caps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market and bank deposits at
the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
The ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Group to interest rate risk are as follows.
i) Cash and equivalents (note 17). The weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for these ﬁnancial assets which were based on sterling market
rates, ﬁxed for periods up to three months was 3.0% (2008: 5.5%). The weighted average ﬂoating euro interest rate received on the cash
deposit held in escrow in 2008 was 4.1%.
ii) Bank borrowings (note 19). The weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for bank borrowings was 5.52% (2008: 6.57%). This is linked to
LIBOR plus a margin for bank loans. The margin varies between 0.60% and 1.05% dependent on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, reviewed
annually. During the year, the margin remained constant at 0.60% (2008: 0.60%).
The contractual interest rate on the overdrawn balance is based on 1% per annum over the bank’s base rate for its sterling accounts and
1% per annum over the bank’s relevant short-term offered rate for any other currency accounts.
iii) Interest rate swaps and caps. These derivatives are used to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk on its bank borrowings above.
See note 22 for details of the interest rate.
iv) Cross currency swaps. These derivatives were used to hedge the net investment of an overseas subsidiary. See note 22 for details of the
interest rate.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, both
including derivative instruments, as listed above at the balance sheet date and adjustments have been made particularly where some of the
signiﬁcant derivatives only existed for part of the year.
With all other variables held constant, the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates applied to the major
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 1% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible
change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

f) Market risk – foreign currency
The Group has overseas subsidiaries and branches which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc and whose
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group currently partly hedges its investment in overseas subsidiaries
through ﬁnancial instruments and natural hedges.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below is based on a 10% appreciation/depreciation of the euro and US dollar against sterling, applied to the net
monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

10% appreciation JO 30 ON 398 PL 1,708
10% depreciation (JH) (25) (NH) (326) (NN) (1,405)
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date and, therefore, does not
reﬂect the exposure during the year.
With all other variables held constant, the effect of a 10% depreciation and appreciation of the euro against sterling applied to the euro-leg
liability of the cross-currency swap of £88.4m (2008: £109.7m) will be a gain (after tax) of £8.0m (2008: £7.2m) and a loss (after tax) of
£8.8m (2008: £8.8m) in the hedging and translation reserve, respectively. The swap is a net investment hedge ( note 22) and therefore we
expect this gain or loss to be approximately 100% offset by the amount of foreign exchange difference arising on both the translation of the
euro-denominated net investment of Wireless-Nemo and the related forward exchange contract that forms part of the net investment hedge.
g) Other price risks
The Group is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk, disclosed above.
h) Forward foreign exchange contracts
Anite’s strategy is to hedge a proportion of the forecast future cash ﬂows for a period of three to ﬁve months, creating a cash ﬂow movement to
offset the translational movement. The proportion of forecast cash ﬂows that will be hedged is reviewed periodically in the light of experience.
Excluding the forward exchange contract that forms part of the net investment hedge, at 30 April 2009 (2008: £13,000), the Group had the
following outstanding contracts:

i) Interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts
See note 22 for details of the interest rate swaps/caps and cross-currency swaps.
j) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a ﬁnancial loss to the Group.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:
2009 2008
Note £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents 17 KN,HNN 29,374
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 22 NL 13
Trade receivables 16 HP,OJK 40,942
MN,GOM 70,329
The credit risk on cash and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated ﬁnancial
institutions. In addition, the Group has further mitigated this risk by spreading cash deposits over a range of ﬁnancial institutions, with no more
than £5m being deposited with any one counterparty.
The Group’s policy to mitigate potential credit risks and the concentration of credit risks of trade receivables are detailed in note 16 – trade and
other receivables.
k) Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank
syndicated facilities.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year and as a result of the disposal of Anite Public Sector reduced to £5m (net),
(2008: £10m (net)). The net amount drawn down under these facilities at 30 April 2009 and 2008 was £nil.
In October 2006, the Group entered into a ﬁve-year syndicated facility which was underwritten in full by Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. This facility
consists of a term loan of £50m repayable at £5m per annum until 30 November 2010, with the balance due on 30 November 2011, and a
revolving credit facility of £40m. On 31 October 2008, the Group made a one-off voluntary repayment under the term loan of £25m, reducing
the amount outstanding under the facility to £20m. On the same date, the Group’s revolving credit facility was reduced to £20m. The amount
of undrawn facilities at 30 April 2009 was £20m (2008: £40m) and total undrawn facilities including the overdraft facility were £25m (2008:
£50m). The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes for the Group including working capital requirements.

Deferred tax assets in respect of future goodwill amortisation and losses carried forward in certain companies have not been recognised
because at present it is not envisaged that there will be sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts in those companies from which future reversal of these reliefs
can be deducted. The unutilised reliefs may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of
certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required since the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these differences
and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax is payable on the reversal.

The deferred consideration balance of £0.4m (US$0.6m) represents the ﬁnal element of the cash earnout consideration payable following
the acquisition of Invenova Corporation in January 2007. This was settled in full in May 2009.
The warranty provision has been made to cover any potential claims made by disposed businesses during the contractual warranty period.
It is expected to be utilised in one to six years.
The property provision is in respect of all properties surplus to business requirements and dilapidation provisions for properties currently in
use. The provision is calculated in accordance with IAS 37 as disclosed in note 1 to the accounts. It is expected to be utilised in one to 13 years.
The established provision in the year includes an amount of £4.9m in relation to the empty space within the Group’s corporate ofﬁce in Slough
resulting from the disposal of Anite Public Sector in October 2008 and is included within restructuring costs in the income statement. The
property provision of £3.4m utilised during the year includes £2.6m in respect of the cost of exiting a non operational property during the year.
Additional dilapidation provisions for properties were established during the year amounting to £0.5m (2008: £0.9m). These were capitalised
in “property, plant, and equipment” and will be charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the
relevant property lease.
Other provisions include provisions for contractual items expected to be utilised within one year.

Annual report and accounts 2009 Five-year summary
Section D
Financial statements 80
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc for the year ended 30 April 2009 which comprise the balance sheet, the
cash ﬂow statement, the statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 17. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent company ﬁnancial statements:
> give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2009;
> have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
> have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
> the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the
parent company ﬁnancial statements.

Company in respect of subsidiary contracts with third parties. The nature of these performance guarantees is such that they would only come
into effect in the case of a major default of a subsidiary in performing these contracts. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the liability.
Anite plc is a guarantor of the overdraft and syndicated facilities of the Group, totalling £45m (2008: £95m) of which £20m (2008: £45m) was
drawn down at 30 April 2009. Details of the borrowings are set out in note 19 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

d) Financial risk management
The Company’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and
payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in the interest rate and
foreign currency risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are
summarised below.
e) Market risk – interest rate
The Group ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is reviewed
from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at ﬂoating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk by selectively
using interest rate swaps and caps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market and bank deposits at
the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
The ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Company to interest rate risk are as follows:
i) Cash and cash equivalents (note 8). The weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for these ﬁnancial assets which were based on the sterling
LIBOR or equivalent market rates, ﬁxed for periods up to three months was 3.0% (2008: 5.5%).
ii) Interest bearing intercompany debtors and creditors. The weighted average of these interest rates (net) are 6.7% (2008: 6%). These rates
are linked to LIBOR plus margin. The margin is 0.85% as stipulated in the loan agreement.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, both
including derivative instruments, as listed above at balance sheet date.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, applied to the major
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 1% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible
change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

f) Market risk – foreign currency
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Company’s currency exposures in the proﬁt and loss account arising from the monetary assets and monetary
liabilities of the Company that are not denominated in sterling, its functional currency. The sensitivity analyses below are based on a 10%
appreciation/depreciation of euro against sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in this currency at reporting
date. The sensitivity analysis includes amounts owed by the Group undertakings.

£000 £000
Proﬁt before tax – gain/(loss)
10% depreciation K,LLO 3,003
10% appreciation (L,MGJ) (3,670)
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date and it therefore does not
fully reﬂect the exposure during the year. A euro-denominated cash amount of €12.2m (£9.6m) was transferred from a subsidiary at 30 April
2008 which results in the higher euro cash balance for that year.
g) Other price risks
The Company is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
h) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a ﬁnancial loss to the Company.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:
2009 2008
Note £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents 8 KI,JHJ 30,219
Trade receivables 6 HIP 140
Amounts owed by Group undertakings JO,PMH 40,510
OH,KGJ 70,869
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated ﬁnancial institutions.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of amounts owed by Group undertakings:

The credit quality of those debts owed by Group undertakings that are past due but not impaired has been assessed at the reporting date and
has not signiﬁcantly changed. There is no reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course.
i) Liquidity risk
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank
syndicated facilities. Working capital requirements are mainly funded through dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year and as a result of the disposal of Anite Public Sector reduced to £5m (net),
(2008: £10m (net)). The amount drawn down under these facilities at 30 April 2009 and 2008 was £nil.
The Company is a guarantor of the Group’s overdraft and syndicated revolving credit facilities of £45m (2008: £95m) of which £25m (2008:
£50m) was undrawn at 30 April 2009. The Company is also a party to an unlimited omnibus set-off arrangement to secure the liability of the
Company and certain group companies with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements “We concentrate on what we are good at” 
Chairman’s statement
A trusted partner for our clients
Overview
Slower global growth, rising unemployment 
in many countries, the eurozone crisis – all 
weighed on markets in 201 2. Although 
Henderson performed reasonably well, we 
fell short of our growth ambitions. We have 
slimmed down the business to protect the 
interests of our shareholders and focus on 
our key areas of expertise to meet clients’ 
needs. By simplifying and streamlining our 
business, we were also able to make a 
number of investments which will result in 
Henderson being a more global business 
with stronger investment teams and 
distribution channels.
Our strategy
Our central goal is to be a trusted partner  
for our clients, providing a service that meets 
or exceeds their expectations. We are 
committed to organic growth, although  
we also see strategic alliances and smaller 
acquisitions as an attractive way to 
strengthen and diversify the business so that 
it is less exposed to Europe. Let me mention 
a few examples from the recent past: we 
bought a 50% interest in Northern Pines 
Capital LLC, a US long/short equity hedge 
fund manager; we hired a team of US-based 
credit specialists, enabling us to extend our 
strong European credit record to a global 
scale; through acquiring Horizon Investment 
Management France SAS, we strengthened 
our position in the French property market; 
and in response to the Retail Distribution 
Review in the UK, we formed a strategic 
alliance with Sesame Bankhall Group, the 
country’s largest IFA network. More detail  
on these and other initiatives are in the  
Chief Executive’s review.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for 201 2 of 5.05 pence per share, bringing 
the total dividend to 7 .15 pence per share, 
2% up on the 201 1 total. This final dividend 
will be paid on 31 May to shareholders  
on the register on 10 May. We continue to 
apply our dividend formula so that (always 
provided the money is there) the interim 
dividend is 30% of the total dividend for  
the previous year.
The Board
Gerry Aherne left the Board in May 201 2 
and Sarah Arkle joined in September;  
each has had a successful career in  
asset management. 
In December we announced a change  
in the Company’s tax residency from the 
Republic of Ireland to the UK. With all 
strategic decision-making now back in 
London, we were able to reduce the number 
of Executive Directors and David Jacob and 
James Darkins stood down. Many thanks  
to both of them and to Gerry Aherne for 
their valuable contributions to the Board. 
I also announced that I will be leaving  
the Group at the Annual General Meeting  
on 1 May 2013, after almost nine years  
as a Director. Henderson has come a  
long way since the demerger from AMP  
in 2003 and I have much enjoyed my time 
as your Chairman. 
Richard Gillingwater was recently appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
Designate. Henderson will be well served  
by a person of Richard’s standing, and his 
extensive boardroom experience will be  
a great asset to the Company. He will 
become Chairman after the AGM in May. 
Outlook
Although the global growth outlook is still  
a cause for concern, financial markets had  
a strong start to 2013, encouraged by signs 
of progress in tackling the challenges of  
the eurozone and the US budget. Provided 
inflation remains low, the pressure on real 
incomes will ease, which will have a positive 
impact on economic growth. Whatever 
happens in the wider world, Henderson is 
committed to delivering the products and 
services our clients need and investing 
where we see potential for growth. 
Thank you
The Board would like to thank all our staff 
for their hard work and we also thank you, 
our shareholders, for your support.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 “Markets ended the year strongly despite political 
and economic uncertainty”
Chief Executive’s review
Well positioned to grow
Review of 2012
It was another year that started optimistically 
but was soon overshadowed by political 
and economic uncertainty leading to a 
slide in markets in the second quarter. A 
combination of bank bailouts, quantitative 
easing and ‘Operation Twist’ in the US 
provided some relief, and markets climbed 
again after Mario Draghi, president of the 
European Central Bank, pledged to preserve 
the euro. Against this volatile and uncertain 
backdrop, it is encouraging that equity 
markets ended the year higher than 201 1. 
We also witnessed a changing political 
landscape with leadership changes in 
France and China and of course the noise 
surrounding the US elections. 
All this uncertainty, combined with our 
relatively high exposure to both Europe 
and equities, meant we faced a challenging 
sales environment. Despite this, the Group’s 
underlying profit was down only 8% as we 
matched the percentage fall in revenues 
with a similar percentage decline in costs. 
As the Chairman mentions, we made good 
progress in our key strategic objectives, 
including strengthening our retail business 
and expanding global and absolute return 
products, adding to our presence outside 
of Europe. 
Strengthening our retail business 
T o address the implications of the Retail 
Distribution Review (RDR) in the UK, 
we launched ‘unbundled’ share classes. 
These share classes (often referred to as 
‘clean fee’ share classes) will comply with 
the changes outlined in the RDR where 
investment managers are no longer allowed 
to pay commission to financial intermediaries 
for bringing in new business. 
especially pleased with the success we 
have achieved in our fixed income funds. 
For example, the Henderson Horizon Euro 
Corporate Bond Fund reached €1bn in 
AUM in less than three years from launch 
– and it returned 30.6% over that period, 
outperforming the IBOXX EUR Corp 
benchmark by over 1 2%. Building on 
this strength, we launched the offshore 
Henderson Horizon Euro High Yield Bond 
Fund and look to offer a Horizon Global 
Corporate Bond Fund shortly. 
Globalising our fixed income 
franchise
We have moved ahead in globalising our 
fixed income franchise with the appointment 
of senior credit analysts both in Europe 
and in the US, to help sustain our excellent 
performance record and to meet increasing 
client demand. 
The US team, credit specialists based 
in Philadelphia, is headed by Kevin Loome 
who was formerly employed by Delaware 
Investments where he managed over 
US$6bn of predominantly high yield 
investments. The team will be integrated 
with our UK-based credit team headed by 
Stephen Thariyan and be a vital component 
of our global offering. The two teams share 
a similar investment philosophy and style 
and have managed portfolios across the 
entire credit spectrum. 
We strengthened our UK retail business by 
entering into strategic alliances, including 
Sesame Bankhall Group, and launched a 
range of multi-asset, multi-manager funds 
under the ‘Optimum’ banner. Multi-asset 
investment strategies are increasingly 
demanded by our clients and it is important 
that we have the products and strength 
of talent in our teams to provide the best 
possible investment outcomes and service. 
We hired Paul O’Connor, from Mercer 
Investment Consulting, and James de 
Bunsen, from Armstrong Investment 
Managers. Both have extensive experience 
in asset allocation and the now 1 2-strong 
team has around £5.4bn in AUM. 
We have significantly rationalised our fund 
range, to help us present a clearer product 
line-up to our clients. Our closed-ended 
business, with its well-established range 
of investment trusts, should also be a 
natural beneficiary in a post-RDR world. 
T o provide advisers with a range of 
lower-cost funds that generate income 
and keep their clients within defined risk 
parameters, we launched Henderson 
Core Solutions. These funds, managed by 
the multi-asset team, do not have specific 
income targets or benchmarks but are 
intended to deliver a competitive level 
of income within clearly defined risk 
parameters. They complement Henderson’s 
existing multi-manager fund range, which 
invests primarily in third party active funds 
and are an attractive alternative in a 
persistently low interest rate environment.
We have an excellent European retail 
franchise, with strong performing funds 
and improving fund flows and it remains 
an important part of our business. We are

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements relative returns. The Hedge Fund Executive 
Management Committee, representing  
the equity managers, is investing in and 
expanding our product offering. We recently 
acquired a 50% interest in Northern Pines 
Capital LLC (Northern Pines), a US long/
short equity hedge fund manager launched 
three years ago. Northern Pines is based  
in Boston and was founded by Pat Dunn 
and Dan Schiff. The fund has a similar 
investment strategy to that of our AlphaGen 
range. Strengthened by our infrastructure 
and distribution, we expect to grow this  
fund as we promote it to our clients in the 
US, Europe and Asia.
More diverse product offering  
in the US
We have diversified our fund offerings in the 
US to reduce our dependency on European 
equities and we successfully launched our 
All Asset and Dividend and Income Builder 
Funds. Both funds draw on the expertise 
and successful investment track records  
of our existing fund managers. Our Global 
Equity Income Fund was our main source  
of net inflows in the US, its assets growing 
by just over 30%, and it was in the top 3% 
selling funds in the Lipper Equity Income 
category in 201 2. 
As already mentioned, we hired the 
US-based credit specialists team. This is a 
significant step forward in the globalisation 
of our fixed income business and is in direct 
response to increasing client and consultant 
demand for global credit products. 
New hires to expand our presence 
in Australia and Asia 
In little more than eight months, we have 
made significant progress in moving ahead 
with our ambitions in Australia. Rob Adams, 
who was appointed in May as Head of  
our Australian business and charged with 
developing and directing the strategy, has 
secured Board approval for a three tier 
approach to expanding in this important 
market for us. The first step is to build a 
distribution hub in Sydney; we have hired 
Matt Gaden to head it up. In the future  
we plan to have both funds managed and 
products launched locally. 
We also recruited two senior distribution 
professionals in Asia. In October,  
Shiro Tsubota joined as the new Chief 
Executive of our Japanese business and 
Mabel Chan joined as Head of Retail 
Distribution, Asia ex Japan.
Chief Executive’s review continued
Restructured teams in Equities
In Equities, we have restructured our teams 
under four key business areas: 
(1) European Equities. Although these 
equities were out of favour for most of 201 2, 
our managers, led by John Bennett, have 
outstanding investment records and believe 
current conditions offer attractive returns  
for the patient investor. 
(2) Global Equities. We have recently 
consolidated our activities in this area under 
the leadership of Stephen Peak. We are 
already well known for our Global Equity 
Income products, as well as our specialist 
products such as T echnology and Property 
Securities, and have strengthened our team 
with the appointment of Matt Beesley,  
a highly respected fund manager who is 
spearheading our global equity and EAFE 
proposition. We have also brought together 
our Asian and Emerging Markets teams  
to create a unified Global Emerging  
Market offering. 
(3) Multi-Asset. As explained on the previous 
page, we have developed innovative new 
products for UK retail clients to suit the  
post RDR world. Bill McQuaker has been 
expanding his team to support him in our 
asset allocation investments.
(4) Absolute Return. We recognise that 
clients increasingly want lower volatility

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Property remained resilient
Our Property business remained resilient. 
We raised equity for new and existing  
funds and took advantage of opportunities 
to expand our business and widen our 
distribution platform. 
We continued our strict discipline of choosing 
only the best investments to meet our clients’ 
objectives. Given the shortage of quality 
properties, we also made extensive use of 
our in-house development team to pursue 
more value-add projects.
Last year, we also extended two of our 
funds, the UK Shopping Centre Fund  
and our AUB French Logistics Fund. We 
continue to engage with clients in order  
to determine the best solution for them  
as funds approach their expiry dates.
We have expanded our European 
distribution through partnering with Investire 
Immobiliare SGR in Italy, opening an office in 
Stockholm and acquiring Horizon Investment 
Management France SAS. We also want  
to expand our brand and presence in Asia, 
and have become investment adviser to  
a Singapore joint venture – Silk Road – to 
invest and develop designer outlet malls in 
China together with our partner RDM Asia 
and an existing client. This is an exciting 
development and our first move into the 
Chinese property market. It will form the 
cornerstone of growth for Property in the 
Asia Pacific region.
Good progress in Private Equity
Our Private Equity business made good 
progress in the year, with the exception  
of Henderson PFI Secondary Fund II L.P .  
(Fund II). Our Asian private equity funds  
and Fund of Funds businesses continue  
to perform well, as did our Henderson PFI 
Secondary Fund I (Fund I). As for Fund II,  
the most notable development was resolving 
its litigation issues. This is in the best 
interests of all our stakeholders and we 
continue working hard to increase the  
value of Fund II.

Annual Report 201 2
 Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Chief Executive’s review continued
We simplified and streamlined  
the business
Our various initiatives last year all cost 
money, so we had to redeploy resources 
from other parts of our business. Although 
we increased our overall gross sales 
following the acquisitions of New Star and 
Gartmore, our net sales remained negative 
last year, so we conducted a detailed review 
of our business structure. 
This identified problems with some legacy 
products and structures and (in a few areas) 
poor investment performance. 
T o tackle these weaknesses, we needed  
a simplified business structure. We have 
therefore removed the role of Chief 
Investment Officer, with the Heads  
of Equities and Fixed Income joining  
the Executive Committee (ExCo). In 
addition, we centralised all of our support 
functions under Shirley Garrood, Chief 
Financial Officer. 
These changes have strengthened our 
commitment to delivering quality investment 
expertise, performance and service to  
our clients.
Outlook for Equities
Overall, we feel optimistic about the outlook 
for equities this year while recognising that 
investors still need to be convinced that the 
worst of the economic crisis is behind them. 
Clearly, there are risks in 2013: the ‘debt 
ceiling’ debate in the US, the well-publicised 
issues in the eurozone and continued unrest 
in the Middle East. However, we should not 
lose sight of the fact that the vast majority  
of companies are generating cash and have 
made great strides in strengthening their 
balance sheets. The equity income investor 
is being rewarded with the yield on equity 
markets globally expected to be 3.3% in 
2013 and dividends are forecast to grow  
by 8%, well above inflation. Furthermore,  
if growth improves in the first quarter,  
the demands for more deleveraging will 
abate. Much would follow from this: greater 
confidence in equity earnings should prompt 
a move out of cash into risk assets. 
All said, we continue to believe that 
European equities offer compelling value 
and that concerns around Europe, which  
are well known, are at least partly priced  
in already. 
It is impossible to say whether, based on 
recent market movements, the bear market 
has come to an end. I am strongly of the 
view however, that so long as investors 
adopt a medium-term investment horizon 
and are willing to take a longer-term view  
on European equities, they will be rewarded 
with solid total returns from this asset class.
With the re-election of President Obama, 
Ben Bernanke is likely to remain  
Chairman of the US Fed until January 201 4, 
thus ensuring monetary policy remains 
stimulative. Although US equities have  
been out of favour for some time with 
domestic investors, we think this is now 
likely to change. 
The outlook for Asia is good: valuations  
are attractive, corporate fundamentals  
remain solid and balance sheets are  
strong. Evidently, uncertainty over the 
macroeconomic backdrop remains and in the 
short term at least, it is going to be difficult for 
Asian markets to disconnect from what is 
going on in the global economy. We remain 
confident that this is an attractive time to 
invest in Asia for the medium to long term. 
We expect companies to become increasingly 
upbeat about their prospects as the growth 
outlook for the region improves as we move 
through 201 3. In terms of opportunities, 
China is the market with the most investment 
appeal from a valuation perspective and  
its current position in the growth cycle.  
As politics plays a critical role in driving the 
business cycle, the peak year of China’s 
investment growth is likely to come in 201 3 
as the new leaders begin to implement their 
growth plans. 
Despite the opportunities, risks remain. 
Should there be an inflationary spike, 
domestic interest rates could be driven 
higher and governments may become less 
accommodative in implementing measures 
to boost growth, though this is far from our 
central case.
Outlook for Fixed Income
Bond spreads – sovereign and corporate – 
have widened and narrowed markedly all in 
the same year. We do not believe that the 
returns delivered in 201 2 will be followed  
by further double digit returns. 
The much talked about potential for a  
“great rotation” out of bonds into equities 
could damage sentiment in the fixed income 
markets in 2013. In fact, the positive start  
to the year by equities may be in anticipation 
of such a shift. Whilst long-dated 
government bonds are likely to come  
under selling pressure, not only as a result  
of the potential for rotation but also given 
their absolute yield levels, we believe that 
corporate bond markets still offer the 
potential for positive returns. 
Our fixed income clients benefit from  
a choice of products which offer many 
different active investment strategies.  
One of our favoured investment areas is 
“double core” bonds – bonds from core 
companies in core countries. 
Furthermore, our fixed income portfolio 
managers oversee a host of strategies,  
many of which should deliver positive  
returns in the 4% to 7% range during 2013.
Increasingly we are seeing client demand  
for ‘total return’ structures which allow our 
managers to asset allocate across all of our 
fixed income strategies.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Outlook for Property
Globalisation has had a significant impact  
on international capital flows in all asset 
classes. Property is no exception; investors 
are adapting their allocations globally in 
order to enhance their potential risk adjusted 
returns and achieve diversification. 
In Europe, it is hard to envisage 2013 being 
significantly different from 201 2, with 
performance relying on income security and 
active asset management. Depending on 
developments in the eurozone, there could 
be a sell-off of exposures in the periphery 
with hopes for a strong recovery waning; but 
equally, investors could well make their first 
commitment back into the region on the 
back of encouraging economic numbers. 
In the US, which is buoyed by more 
favourable growth assumptions, pricing has 
generally levelled off. However, mirroring 
both Europe and Asia, the market continues 
to have pricing disparities across real estate 
types and markets. The speed of recovery 
across occupier markets differs considerably 
between geographies, sectors and quality  
of product, a trend likely to persist. A return 
to employment growth has supported an 
improvement in retailer performance, though 
rentals and valuations remain challenging. 
The major US markets should resume  
their recovery as confidence improves,  
but investors would do well to focus on 
primary markets. 
In Asia, a number of developments will have 
a significant impact on the region’s capital 
and real estate markets. China’s new 
leadership will provide support for economic 
growth prospects, whilst new governments 
in Japan and South Korea are already 
affecting fiscal and monetary policy. These 
socio-political events could lead to revised 
growth forecasts which will in turn mean 
investors need to time their entry and exit 
points in tandem with the projected real 
estate cycles.
Regulatory outlook
Governments and regulators continue  
to drive regulatory change to improve  
the operation, security and ultimately  
the reputation of global wholesale and  
retail markets. 
In the UK, the approach to the supervision  
of regulated retail firms continues to move 
towards a greater consideration of business 
strategies, firm governance and outcomes 
for consumers. Rule changes such as the 
RDR emphasise the regulatory commitment 
to the fair treatment of customers and the 
avoidance of conflicts. 
Regulatory bodies within the EU continue  
to initiate and enact new regulations aimed 
at harmonising the EU financial services 
industry. The EU Alternative Investment 
Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) will 
change the landscape for diversified asset 
managers operating regulated and 
alternative funds. 
Increasingly, US and other international 
regulations are impacting the environment  
in which we operate, leading to new and 
challenging obligations to address as  
our business develops. We are strongly 
committed to meeting these challenges. 
The outlook for the Group
Looking ahead, I am positive about the 
outlook for the Group. We have made many 
changes to our structure and operations 
over the past four years, and they have  
put us in a stronger position to capitalise  
on the opportunities in the market. 
I am confident that we are now in a position 
to deliver the products and level of service 
our clients need. Delivering on clients’ 
investment objectives, and providing them 
with the service they deserve and expect,  
is at the heart of everything we do. 
Establishing their trust and working with 
them in partnership is paramount. 
Achieving this will result in organic business 
growth which will enable us to continue 
investing in areas for future growth.
Ongoing changes in the regulatory 
environment will add costs to our 
organisation. However, this is a small  
price to pay to deliver a better and trusted 
governance structure which should improve 
clients’ confidence in how their investments 
are being managed.
Thank you
I would like to thank Rupert for his 
outstanding contribution to the Board.  
I have greatly appreciated his guidance  
and support as we positioned Henderson  
for future growth. 
In Richard Gillingwater, we are pleased to 
have found such a high calibre replacement. 
I very much look forward to working closely 
with him and benefiting from the significant 
experience he brings to the Board.
I would also like to thank our staff for all 
their hard work to ensure that we deliver 
excellence to our clients.

At Henderson, our clients are at the  
centre of everything we do. From designing 
products for them, to managing their money 
and providing after-sales service, all our 
activities are centred around meeting  
or exceeding their expectations.
This client centric approach is founded  
on our robust governance structures  
to ensure that we comply with various 
regulatory requirements and manage our 
risks within acceptable risk parameters.
At the heart of our approach to investing 
client money, are teams of talented people 
who, by sharing their knowledge and insight, 
actively manage our clients’ investments  
to achieve or exceed the outcomes  
clients seek. 
We are an active investment manager

talented people and providing our clients 
with an overall experience that exceeds  
their expectations.

traditional and alternative products,  
with transparent investment processes,

Our business model and strategy continued
The improvements we made 
in 2012 will provide the platform 
we need for success
In my first year at Henderson, we have 
accomplished a great deal across our 
distribution function to embed a client 
centric culture. It is clear that we will achieve 
success not only through product quality but 
also by being a truly professional, responsive 
and efficient sales and marketing team. 
The progress we made and the changes 
we implemented around people, processes 
and product in 2012, whilst also improving 
our efficiency, will provide the platform we 
need to grow the business. 
Understanding our clients’ needs
It is important that we understand our clients’ 
changing needs so that we can provide them 
with both the service and products that are 
important to them. 
We have increased the number of client 
events we hold globally to enable us 
to share our ideas and views and allow 
us a greater level of feedback on what is 
important to our clients. One of our most 
prestigious events, now in its fourth year, 
is our annual investment conference 
for UK wealth managers. The theme of 
this year’s conference was ‘New Y ear, New 
Perspectives’. It allowed us to showcase a 
range of investment themes we believe will 
be key drivers of markets in 201 3. Similarly, 
we have taken our successful hedge fund 
conference we hold for UK clients to the US 
for the first time, as we believe institutional 
investors there can benefit from opportunities 
in Europe that our European long/short 
products exploit.
Over the course of 201 3, this trend will 
continue and will form a core part of our 
distribution strategy. We will access key 
clients and share ideas in all the markets 
we operate in and we will do this in a way 
that clients value.
With the implementation of the RDR in 
January, we have made a number of changes 
to the way we price our products and, in 
particular, for retail clients receiving advice 
from advisers where the advice has to be 
charged for separately. I am pleased to say 
all these changes were completed on time 
and communicated to advisers well ahead 
of the implementation of the RDR.
Our new advertising strategy
As much as we endeavour to understand 
clients’ needs, having an identifiable brand 
and culture recognised by clients is vital for 
our future success.
Our new UK advertising strategy, launched 
at the start of 2013, seeks to promote the 
wealth of investment knowledge and 
expertise we have at Henderson and the 
benefits our clients will receive from sharing 
in this knowledge. By inviting our clients 
to engage and share their views with us, 
we will develop an inclusive brand which 
will, over time, build trust and loyalty.
This advertising creative also gives us the 
platform to rebrand the business globally, 
taking the Henderson brand to where it 
belongs with a more sophisticated image 
that spans all channels.
Our advertising and marketing spend is 
directed towards investment marketing 
and promoting our mobile client information 
delivery programmes, highlighted on the next 
page. We want to make it easier for clients 
to interact with us and we want clients to 
better understand who Henderson is and 
what we do. Having reorganised the 
business and making it easier for clients 
to identify our core product categories 
will certainly help in this regard.
Extending client service globally
By forming key business partnerships and 
hiring distribution talent around the world, 
we have been able to extend the quality 
of service we offer our clients. 
A great strength of our distribution model 
is the breadth of our product offering 
by geography and by client type. In order 
to improve client focus, service and 
relationships, we have specific teams 
dealing with retail and institutional clients 
and clients invested in absolute return funds, 
with client service teams in place for each 
client type. 
Local support across key markets in Europe, 
Asia and the US enables us to deliver local 
service to a wide variety of clients. This has 
been further enhanced by senior hires in a 
number of the Asian offices.
Clients at the centre of everything we do

“Success will not only be achieved through product 
quality but also by being a professional, responsive 
and efficient client centric team”
Phil Wagstaff
Global Head of Distribution We made some changes to our global 
distribution model, designed to allow us to 
capture the best ideas in each channel and 
share and develop them across all markets. 
A culture of co-operation, sharing, teamwork 
and client focus will strengthen our global 
client offering significantly. 
Excellent service levels delivered 
notwithstanding many changes
In a year where we made extensive 
changes to our product line-up and 
infrastructure, our IT and operations teams 
and service providers maintained excellent 
service delivery. We track and measure 
our operational performance on a regular 
basis through detailed metrics and key 
performance indicators. There are also 
many external measures; one of these 
compiled by a leading UK fund platform, 
placed Henderson first out of 136 asset 
managers in terms of overall operational 
performance at the end of 201 2. This rating 
measures processing accuracy and 
timeliness across a range of key operational 
categories: pricing; settlements; distributions; 
dealing; and reconciliations.
Helping globalise the business
In 201 2, one of our key objectives was to 
enable the business to be more integrated 
and function better globally. 
Our support teams have been reorganised 
in such a way that we are more focused 
on delivering an end-to-end service from 
providing and managing data to fund 
management support. We also implemented 
systems architecture that allows us to 
operate across different time zones and 
this has particularly improved the ability 
of our US business to access and utilise 
our broader infrastructure.
Delivering better information 
in an easy-to-access way 
Another key objective was to invest in data 
and information quality and improve the 
client experience. 
We understand the importance of being 
able to share knowledge with our clients 
and, to this end, we vastly improved our 
systems to make information or knowledge 
‘mobile’ and therefore easier to access.
The first success as part of our ‘Client 
Information Delivery’ programme, was 
implementing a new client reporting platform 
in Property. In the next phase of this 
programme we plan to deliver a new platform 
for both retail and institutional client reporting 
and introduce new factsheet technology. 
This programme will have a visible impact 
on what clients see and experience.
In an increasingly digital and mobile 
world, we successfully delivered a number of 
new initiatives as part of our ‘Digital Future’ 
programme. The aim was to ensure that we 
maximise the use of digital communication 
to positively influence investment decision-
making at every opportunity. 
In 201 2, we completed a global roll out of 
HGi – our online presence that offers clients 
a direct link to the latest thinking from 
influential experts on global investment 
regions, asset classes, economics and 
markets. Our clients can follow the fund 
managers, funds, asset classes and topics 
relevant to them and they are able to 
connect to HGi on their desktop, mobile, 
or tablet device. Once a client follows our 
experts, funds and topics, they will receive a 
tailored stream of information that includes 
the latest videos, articles and updates that 
they are most interested in. 
We also upgraded our Client Relationship 
Management system to allow our teams to 
access the information they need on clients 
and products, wherever they are.
Working with our partners
We work in close partnership with our 
third party administrators to ensure that our 
service levels are of the highest standard. 
We also continuously look at ways in which 
we can be more efficient and, in so doing, 
reduce the costs that the Group and our 
clients incur. 
In 2013, we will continue to focus on 
accurate and efficient delivery of information 
to our clients, ensuring that we have quality 
systems and processes so that we deliver 
the best possible service to our clients.
We are confident that we have the right 
team and the right partners in place to keep 
delivering a solid service to the business and 
our clients around the world.

“ Our people are ambassadors for Henderson”
At Henderson, our efforts are focused on 
delivering excellent investment performance 
and service to our clients. 
Our employment practices are designed 
to create a workplace where all our people 
are encouraged to be ambassadors for the 
Group by delivering on our shared values: 
excellence, focus, conviction, collaboration 
and responsibility. 
We take a real interest in the careers of our 
people. We provide a series of learning and 
development courses to help them improve 
their skills, performance and future career 
prospects. Our reward system creates a 
culture aligned with the interests of our 
clients and shareholders. 
Progression and recognition of 
our people 
As part of being a high performing organisation, 
we encourage all of our people to fulfil their 
potential. Individuals set their own objectives 
each year for their roles and responsibilities 
and managers ensure that these are aligned to 
our Group strategic priorities. These objectives 
are reviewed formally on an annual basis. 
This annual review also allows for succession 
planning and ensures that we retain talented 
people and develop their careers.
One way in which we align the interests of 
our clients, shareholders and people is the 
ability for our people to participate in share 
plans. This has turned out to be successful 
with around 10% of the Company owned 
by our people, assuming all share plans vest. 
Attracting and retaining talent 
In order to attract, retain and motivate 
our people, we believe in clear and 
open communication channels and flat 
management structures to encourage 
free thinking, enabling decisions to be 
made with speed and accuracy. 
Our people work in an innovative and 
autonomous environment that encourages 
responsibility and accountability for actions 
and decisions taken. We strive to be the 
best and this has been recognised by a 
number of industry awards and independent 
accreditations we have received for 
innovation, technology, products and 
performance.

An engaged workforce benefits 
our clients
We believe that an engaged workforce 
delivers outstanding client service and  
helps drive business performance. 
In our most recent staff survey, we achieved 
an 82% response rate. In general, the 
results were substantially ahead of the 
industry benchmark, specifically Customer 
Focus, Commitment/Engagement and  
My Job. 
Regular communications about 
business developments 
T o help our people understand our business 
strategy, goals and objectives better and to 
make clear their role in achieving our growth 
ambitions, regular, consistent and clear 
communication across the firm is essential. 
It starts from the top. Andrew Formica  
holds an annual conference where people 
from all parts of the business get together to 
discuss, challenge and review the business 
performance and cultural development of 
the organisation. At the conclusion of the 
conference, all managers are tasked with 
communicating key findings, messages  
and action points to their teams. This results 
in a firm-wide understanding of how we  
are progressing as a business and what 
each person’s role is in achieving a 
successful outcome. 
Throughout the year, members of the ExCo 
will brief staff on the financial results of the 
Group and other important developments. 
There are global weekly newsletters and 
regular employee forum meetings where 
people can raise issues or ask questions. 
We offer a comprehensive range  
of benefits and performance-based 
compensation. Our remuneration philosophy 
is to provide a competitive total reward 
package. This encompasses a number  
of monetary and non-monetary benefits. 
We continue to develop our Trainee 
Programme which attracts young people 
with high potential to perform. This 
programme offers them a chance to  
develop their skills with both formal and 
on-the-job training through a nine to 
1 2-month contract, during which they  
can apply for or be offered a permanent  
role if a suitable opportunity exists. 
Over the last two years we have  
recruited 83 trainees across the business,  
of which approximately 80% have become 
permanent employees. 
Of the trainees who have left Henderson, 
two thirds were successful in finding 
permanent jobs elsewhere. We are 
developing this programme by partnering 
with other firms in our industry to encourage 
entry level recruitment and widen 
opportunities for graduates, school leavers 
and apprentices across the industry.
We employ a diverse group  
of people
Employing a diverse group of people  
helps us deliver better products and  
better service for our clients. We provide  
a work environment where everyone is 
treated equally. 
Henderson employs around 1,000 people in 
1 7 countries, represented by 40 nationalities. 
At 38% of the Group, women account for a 
significant proportion of our workforce and 
the proportion of women in senior roles has 
remained broadly consistent during 201 2. 
Where possible, we monitor diversity rates  
Additionally, Andrew Formica regularly writes 
to everyone and we hold business spotlight 
seminars where anyone in the business  
can educate and update us on their specific 
areas. Employee communication is also 
placed on our intranet so that any updates 
can be accessed no matter where each 
person is located.

Product governance at Henderson
We are always looking to align our business 
objectives with our clients’ best interests. 
Increasingly, clients are seeking solutions 
rather than an investment product that is 
simply linked to a benchmark. This is 
embedded into how we incorporate the 
FSA’s TCF principles (see page 21). 
Our Strategic Product Group (SPG), which 
consists of representatives from the product, 
distribution and investment teams, ensure 
that our product range is appropriate for 
clients’ current and future investment needs. 
It provides a framework which allows us to 
manage our products which currently spans 
over 90 strategies and around 200 equity 
and fixed income funds. 
The SPG also focuses on ensuring that 
products are scalable across distribution 
channels and geographies. 
The SPG continuously reviews industry 
trends against our target product portfolio 
and existing product range to identify  
where we have gaps and responds  
where appropriate. 
There are currently five trends which have 
informed the investments we are making  
in our capabilities and the talent we have 
hired (see pages 7 and 8). These include:
 •
the shift by clients from investing in 
domestic equities to investing in global 
and emerging market products; 
 •
clients’ demand for income and yield  
in a low interest rate environment; 
 •
the clients’ need for capital preservation 
which is driving the demand for outcome 
orientated, absolute return and multi-
asset products; 
 •
the shift in wealth to clients in emerging 
markets; and 
 •
the shift in pension schemes from 
defined benefit to defined contribution 
which means that clients will increasingly 
need to take more responsibility for their 
own savings and future incomes. 
At a more detailed level, the SPG  
also conducts product lifecycle reviews  
on existing funds to ensure that they 
continue to meet clients’ needs and 
expectations; filters the new product  
ideas to a shortlist of ideas which meet  
our clients’ needs and our strategic 
priorities; and monitors the progress  
of inflight product development. 
A second group, the Product Implementation 
Committee, supports and directs product 
delivery and implementation including 
monitoring capacity levels in funds, stress 
testing of new products, approving product 
specifications and implementing changes 
resulting from the product lifecycle reviews.
Rationalising our fund range
We significantly reduced our fund range to 
approximately 1 70 funds at the end of 201 2. 
In so doing, we have simplified our fund 
range, making it much easier for our clients 
to understand our diversified offering and 
also do business with us.
Given the extent of the activity over  
the past couple of years, both in terms of  
rationalising our fund range and expanding 
our capabilities, we believe we are now in a 
better position to meet our clients’ needs.
As part of our product monitoring we will 
continue to amend our capabilities, either  
for tactical client driven reasons or simply 
tidying up our product offering.
A diversified product range with 
core capabilities at the centre
We have amended our product offering  
by merging certain funds or changing their 
investment objectives and also invested  
in capabilities. 
As can be seen on the table opposite, our 
product range is centred around a number 
of core investment capabilities.

Annual Report 201 2 Our priorities for 2013
We will continue to review our fund range  
to ensure that we are meeting clients’ needs. 
In recent years we have focused on 
integrating and consolidating our fund 
ranges to focus our resources on a number 
of core capabilities. We expect less activity  
in 2013 and will focus more on building  
on our core capabilities and recent 
investments, but against a background  
of significant regulatory and technical 
changes in our industry – for example,  
the AIFMD and Foreign Account T ax 
Compliance Act (FATCA). 
Importantly, in the UK investment managers 
are no longer allowed to pay commission  
to financial intermediaries for new business 
post 1 January 2013 (as a result of the 
RDR). We see this as the start rather the 
conclusion of changes in the UK retail 
market (see below). 
Overall, in 2013 we will focus on our core 
growth capabilities and build on the areas 
we have recently invested in.
Our response to RDR
In common with other UK retail fund 
managers, we have made changes to  
our systems, terms of business and share 
classes to reflect the removal of commission 
from new business transacted after 
31 December 201 2. 
However, we believe that the more profound 
impact will not be the technical changes, but 
their impact in accelerating several existing 
trends in the advisory market. These are 
likely to continue through 2013 and into 
201 4, and focus on:
 •
a reduction in independent advice  
in favour of restricted advice;
 •
an increased separation of financial 
planning and investment management;
 •
an increase in demand for multi-asset 
products which are more closely  
aligned to adviser and client suitability 
processes; and
 •
an increase in demand for income 
orientated funds in all portfolios to  
fund advisory and platform fees.
Accordingly, we have responded to these 
trends by establishing joint ventures with 
some major distributors with dedicated 
products and launching Henderson Core 
Solutions, a growing suite of multi-asset 
income focused solutions.
Further changes are expected as our 
regulator, soon to be the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), clarifies its intentions  
about fund manager rebates provided  
to fund platforms.
The Global Product Committee  
in our Property business
Early in 201 2 we established a Global 
Product Committee (GPC) in our Property 
business. The GPC acts as a forum for 
reviewing new product ideas. It ensures  
that sound investment and research 
fundamentals underpin every investment 
opportunity we offer to our clients and that 
the rationale for these opportunities is stress 
tested at an early stage. 
Through this the GPC, alongside the 
business development team in Property, 
decides which new opportunities to prioritise.
The benefits of the GPC include:
 •
offering clients a clearer view of our 
products and in-house expertise; 
 •
bringing together client investment 
objectives and feedback with our 
investment and product opportunities; and
 •
ensuring that the product development 
and investment process is underpinned 
by strong research fundamentals.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Against a challenging backdrop, the majority 
of our equities and fixed income funds 
delivered strong performance over one and 
three years. This strong performance did not 
necessarily result in positive net flows and 
the increase in total AUM for Investment 
Management of just more than £1.0bn to 
£45.5bn, was due to positive market and 
foreign exchange rate movements of
£4.4bn offsetting net outflows of £3.4bn. 
Equities
In our Equity funds, performance improved 
significantly in the second half of 201 2, 
resulting in an improvement in both our one 
and three year numbers. Although flows 
generally were negatively impacted by 
eurozone issues, we saw positive net sales 
across a number of funds, in particular some 
of our European funds – a pleasing result 
given the strong performance we have and 
the strategic importance we place on this part 
of our business. The funds that delivered the 
best growth over the year included our 
T echnology Fund, the Global Equity Income 
Fund in the US and a number of our SICAVs 
including European Special Situations, 
European Property Equities, Global Property 
Equities and the European Focus funds. 
Notwithstanding some good growth across 
these funds, we saw continued redemptions 
as clients continued to favour fixed income 
over equity funds.
We simplified the structure of our Equities 
investment management teams where we 
reorganised from 1 8 teams into four key 
business areas. These four areas reflect our 
existing strong franchises and where we 
intend to strengthen and grow the business. 
This new structure is simpler and makes it 
easier for our clients to understand what 
we do. The four areas are European Equities, 
Global Equities, Multi-Asset and Absolute 
Return (also see pages 5 and 8).
European Equities is led by John Bennett. 
We have outstanding performance across 
a number of products and channels and 
by bringing three teams together, we have 
greater cohesion in our offering. Our UK 
Equity team, a core strength with a significant 
amount of AUM, forms part of John’s 
broader team. 
Global Equities is led by Stephen Peak. There 
has been increasing client demand for Global 
Equity products and to capitalise on this, and 
develop our product range, we brought 
together our well-established global sector 
teams, T echnology and Property Securities, 
and the Emerging Market and Asian teams. 
The Global Equity Income team and the 
predominantly long/short Japanese equity 
teams will also be part of this business area. 
Multi-Asset is led by Bill McQuaker. Over the 
past year, we have launched a number of 
multi-asset products, such as our All Asset 
US Mutual Fund and a number of “low-cost” 
funds in the UK retail market, as clients 
increasingly focus on investment solutions. 
Under Bill’s leadership, we expect to rapidly 
grow this business area. 
Absolute return is governed by the Hedge 
Fund Executive Management Committee, 
chaired by Paul Graham with David Elms 
representing the equity managers. We discuss 
this business area in more detail on the 
next page. 
Fixed Income
We have had excellent performance in our 
fixed income products over all periods and 
we have seen significant growth in products 
such as our Horizon European Corporate 
Bond, T otal Return Bond, Multi-Asset Credit, 
All Stocks Credit and Credit Alpha funds. 
That said, several of our long standing 
institutional clients redeemed their 
investments as they adopted a buy-out 
model for their investment portfolio, despite, 
or maybe because of, having had excellent 
returns from their investments with us. 
We discuss Institutional in more detail on 
the next page.
At the end of last year, we launched the 
European High Yield Fund. Given our 
existing strengths in corporate bonds, 
we believe we can meet client needs in 
offering access to the high yield market. 
The structure of our fixed income teams has 
remained broadly unchanged and grouped 
into four core areas. Global Credit, led by 
Stephen Thariyan; Diversified Fixed Income 
and Rates, led by Phil Apel; Secured Credit, 
led by Colin Fleury; and Retail Fixed Income, 
led by John Pattullo. Phil Apel has been 
appointed Chair of the Investment Strategy 
Group which oversees the asset allocation 
of our core fixed income funds.
We have moved ahead in globalising our 
fixed income franchise and hired a US credit 
specialists team. Based in Philadelphia, the 
new team, formerly employed by Delaware 
Investments, will develop US credit products, 
and be integrated with our UK-based credit 
team, becoming a vital component of our 
global offering. Hiring this team allows us

to satisfy increasing client needs for global 
credit products, from high yield to investment 
grade. This also now provides US domestic 
product to distribute through our existing 
US team (see page 7).
Retail
In our UK retail funds, performance has 
improved over one year and in our European 
SICAV fund range, performance continues to 
be strong over all periods. The performance 
in our US Mutual fund range has picked up 
significantly over one year as performance 
in the International Opportunities Fund 
improved, finishing the year in first quartile. 
Despite our best ever year of gross sales 
across our retail business, net sales in UK 
retail were hampered by the impact of the 
RDR as advisers repositioned their clients’ 
portfolios ahead of its implementation on
1 January 2013. As mentioned on page 19, 
we have taken a number of steps to protect 
and grow our UK retail business. Although 
it is hard to predict exactly how regulatory 
change will impact business models, we are 
well placed by forming alliances with key 
decision-makers and the adjustments we 
have made to our fund range over the year. 
Our US Mutual fund range was negatively 
impacted by eurozone concerns, resulting 
in net outflows for the year. That said, we 
are confident that flows will improve as the 
outlook for the eurozone improves. 
Flows in our European retail SICAV range 
ended the year strongly, resulting in this fund 
range recording net inflows for the year. 
Although these inflows were predominantly 
into fixed income products, it is encouraging 
to see that our equity funds are starting to 
benefit from improved market sentiment 
towards Europe and equities more generally. 
We remain one of the leading investment 
trust managers in the UK and the trust range 
has delivered excellent performance over 
one and three years with all of our 
investment trusts, except one, outperforming 
on a one year view. We have therefore been 
disappointed by the recent loss of two trusts. 
The Henderson Asian Growth T rust has 
replaced Henderson as manager of the trust 
and Henderson Fledgling T rust have decided 
to merge with another trust to achieve scale. 
Encouragingly, we were recently appointed 
as manager on the SVM Global T rust, a 
£1 60m specialist private equity and 
alternatives trust. 
In order to focus on the needs of investment 
trust clients, we have raised awareness of 
the merits of investing in investment trusts 
in a post-RDR world. 
Again, focused on our clients, we have made 
extensive use of social media and launched 
HGi, which offers our clients a direct link to 
the latest thinking from influential experts 
on global investment regions, asset classes, 
economics and markets (see more on 
page 1 5). 
Institutional
The Institutional business, particularly 
in Fixed Income, continued to perform 
strongly in 201 2. It is therefore disappointing 
that we had net outflows in the year as 
explained on the previous page. That said, 
we are encouraged by our ongoing strong 
investment performance and the positive 
consultant ratings in our Institutional 
business. This, together with additional 
capabilities we now have in place, or are 
in the process of establishing, means we 
are well placed to meet our clients needs. 
Absolute return funds
Along with the industry, our absolute return 
funds were tested by the volatility in markets.
Outflows continued in 201 2 due to some 
underperformance and in particular the lower 
demand for equity long/short strategies. 
Encouragingly, performance improved 
in the second half of the year as markets 
recovered, resulting in our absolute return 
fund range being modestly positive for 
the year. 
We continue to see a shift in demand from 
relative return to absolute return investing 
and as such, absolute return remains an 
important part of our growth strategy. The 
acquisition of Gartmore strengthened our 
absolute return proposition and we aim to 
build on this by growing and improving the 
management of our existing hedge funds 
as well as expanding our product range. This 
is supported by our acquisition of a 50% 
interest in Northern Pines which will extend 
and diversify our absolute return product 
range and provides further solutions for our 
clients (see page 6).

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Property
201 2 was a tough year for the real  
estate industry with changes in regulation, 
refinancing and fundraising challenges,  
short supply of good quality properties and 
increasing pressures for landlords to respond 
to a rapidly changing world. However, we 
seized many opportunities through the year 
to grow and strengthen our business.
We continued to find value for clients in 
traditional core markets, such as Germany, 
while offering innovative new products  
in new territories, such as outlet mall 
developments in China. 
Property AUM grew by £1 15m from £1 2.4bn 
to £1 2.5bn as net inflows of £276m were 
partially offset by negative market and 
foreign exchange rate movements of 
£1 61m. We started the year with £1.4bn of 
uninvested client commitments. Aggregate 
transactions for the year totalled £1.7bn  
and, as a result of selective investments, we 
ended the year with £0.9bn of uninvested 
client commitments. We plan to deploy these 
commitments in the US and Europe over the 
next few years.
A key priority was to develop our distribution 
channels so that we can deliver our existing 
product strengths and expertise to new 
clients. Given the considerable demand for 
property investments in Sweden and the 
wider Nordic region, we opened an office  
in Stockholm. T o further boost our 
development and distribution of property 
funds in Italy, we formed a joint venture with 
Investire Immobiliare SGR, a leading Italian 
property funds asset management company 
owned by Banca Finnat Euroamerica Group. 
With the acquisition of Horizon Investment 
Management France SAS (Horizon), a 
privately owned French asset management 
business we nearly doubled our French 
AUM across the retail, offices and logistics 
sectors. These two businesses complement 
each other as Horizon’s primary capability  
is in the office sector whilst our existing 
expertise lies within the retail sector. 
In keeping with changing client needs, we 
also developed new products. For example, 
the Henderson German Logistics Fund, 
aimed at German and Austrian institutional 
investors. This is a partnership between our 
German property business and Palmira 
Capital Partners, a renowned specialist in the 
logistics sector. The fund focuses exclusively 
on existing, high quality logistics assets  
in prime locations throughout Germany.  
We believe there is significant opportunity  
in this relatively untapped sector, especially 
considering the structural changes as a  
result of the growth of e-commerce. We  
also entered the commercial real estate  
debt space and our foray into the Asia Pacific 
region where we became investment adviser 
to a Singapore joint venture – Silk Road.
As a closed-ended pooled fund operator,  
we inevitably face fund termination dates. 
We engage with clients to determine the 
best solution for them and factors we 
consider include current and forecast 
market conditions and fund performance 
and asset values. We successfully extended 
our flagship UK Shopping Centre Fund  
by seven years. We are confident that this 
presents us with an opportunity to further 
drive returns for existing investors, whilst 
providing an opportunity for new investors  
to enter the fund. We also secured a three 
year extension for our AUB French Logistics 
Fund. This extension has enabled the fund 
to improve its debt facility and will facilitate 
the active disposal programme in order  
to optimise exit pricing.
We raised further capital for our German 
Retail Income Fund and for our CASA 
Partners V Fund (the latest fund in 
Henderson’s North American multi-family 
housing series). In addition, further capital 
was raised for a number of the Warburg 
Henderson products including Warburg 
– Henderson Österreich Fonds Nr. 2  
(the second in a series of funds investing  
in Austrian real estate). This closed its 
investment period in July 201 2, having 
raised €180m from German and Austrian 
investors, providing it with approximately 
€360m of capital to deploy in the Austrian 
property market.
201 2 saw us leverage our multi-sector  
real estate underwriting experience to enter 
the UK commercial real estate debt space. 
We look forward to developing this platform 
further in 2013, with the development and 
marketing of new fund concepts including 
the High Income Real Estate Debt Fund.
Regulatory changes are also impacting  
the Property business and preparing for  
the implementation of the AIFMD and its 
impact is important as it will bring real estate 
business into a tighter regulatory framework.

Annual Report 201 2  Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements
Looking to 2013 and beyond, we are 
optimistic about the outlook for property  
as an asset class. Backed by traditional 
fundamentals of strong income return, 
relatively low correlation with other asset 
classes and the potential to hedge inflation, 
property is attracting increasing interest as 
investors turn to ‘real assets’. The current 
environment continues to require us to 
adapt, and our business is well placed to 
meet clients’ needs.
Private Equity
T otal AUM decreased from just over £1.0bn 
to £918m as a result of net distributions to 
investors of £66m and market and foreign 
exchange rate movements of £63m.
In the Infrastructure business, we continued 
to progress strategic and business initiatives 
at John Laing. It achieved strong new 
investment volumes including an investment 
in the UK Department for Transport’s £4.5bn 
Intercity Express Programme for the delivery 
of a new fleet of high speed trains. 
The valuation for Fund I has continued to 
improve during the year. Notwithstanding  
the good progress in the John Laing 
business, we expect that the difficult market 
conditions, particularly the banking market, 
will have a meaningful negative impact on 
the valuation for Fund II as at 31 December 
201 2. We continue to work hard to improve 
the value of Fund II.
As previously announced, in December 
201 1, two subsidiaries and Fund II were 
served with legal proceedings by a majority 
of investors which principally alleged breach 
of mandate and misrepresentation. This 
matter was resolved in January 2013 and, 
under the terms of the agreement reached, 
we paid the costs of the proceedings and  
in return the proceedings were withdrawn 
without any admission of liability.
The Asian private equity funds have 
performed well. The first fund has delivered 
a net IRR of 1 4.6% per annum over 1 2 
years. The fund’s remaining investment is 
expected to be realised in 2013, following 
the realisation of the penultimate investment 
at the beginning of 2013, which generated  
a gross multiple of cost of 1.9 times. The 
second fund has commenced processes  
to consider realisation opportunities in the 
portfolio. During the first half of 201 2, the 
Asian private equity business suspended 
fundraising efforts for its India focused  
fund primarily due to a change in investor 
sentiment towards the region resulting from 
increased regulatory uncertainty surrounding 
proposed retrospective tax changes.
The Fund of Funds business has had 
another strong year. The listed Fund of 
Funds vehicle, Henderson Private Equity 
Investment Trust plc, almost completed  
its realisation strategy, selling another five 
unlisted funds and six listed holdings during 
the year. The trust’s discount to net asset 
value decreased from 20% to 9%, and it 
made cash distributions totalling £47 .5m  
to shareholders during the year. 
The unlisted global Fund of Funds vehicle 
continued to perform well and has now 
delivered a net IRR of 1 2.9% per annum 
over 1 1 years.
We are focused on maximising the value  
of our existing portfolio companies for our 
clients in 2013.

flow in 2012”
Financial review
Strengthening financial 
performance
Financial performance
Underlying profit before tax decreased by 
8% to £1 46.5m. This was primarily due to 
lower performance and transaction fees, 
partially offset by a decline in variable staff 
compensation and continued cost control. 
As a result, the operating margin saw only a 
slight decline from 36.3% to 36.0% and the 
compensation ratio reduced from 41.6% to 
41.1%. Underlying profit post tax was stable, 
but an increase in the average number of 
shares in issue resulted in lower diluted 
earnings per share of 1 1.7 pence from  
1 2.4 pence. 
Total income and fee margins
Management fee income decreased by 1% 
to £355.2m, mainly due to net fund outflows 
in 201 1 and 201 2 offsetting the additional 
quarter of Gartmore revenue in 201 2. 
Transaction fees decreased by 1 4% to 
£43.7m, primarily due to the sale of Hermes 
private equity JV and other one-off fees in 
201 1. Performance fees decreased by 48% 
to £33.9m as performance fees earned from 
absolute return funds and SICAVs were 
substantially lower. The main contributors  
to performance fees are shown in the chart 
on this page. 
These decreases in income impacted the 
total fee margin which decreased 6% to 
66.6bps as a result of lower performance 
and transaction fees, whilst the management 
fee margin increased by 2% to 54.6bps, 
largely due to a higher proportion of the 
outflows being lower margin institutional 
business and an additional quarter of 
Gartmore revenue.
Total operating expenses
Operating expenses decreased by 9% to 
£277 .0m. Employee compensation and 
benefits decreased by £20.0m to £1 79.9m. 
Variable staff costs fell by 25% and 
contributed £25.7m of this decrease as 
performance fee bonuses and other staff 
incentive plans reduced reflecting business 
performance. Fixed staff costs increased  
by £5.7m, primarily due to an increase  
in pension costs following the decision  
by the trustee of the Henderson Group 
Pension Scheme to switch more of the  
asset allocation from return seeking to  
risk reducing, which has resulted in a lower 
than expected return on assets. However, 
underlying fixed staff costs remained flat as 
the actions taken at the end of 201 1 offset 
the cost of an additional quarter of Gartmore 
staff and the additional hires supporting our 
growth initiatives. Other operating expenses 
decreased by £6.7m or 6% reflecting the 
Group’s continued cost control. 
Finance income and expenses
Finance income increased by £1.7m  
to £5.0m as the Group recognised profits  
on the disposal of certain seed investments.
Finance expenses decreased by £2.9m to 
£1 4.3m, mainly due to the repayment of the 
Group’s £1 42.6m 201 2 Notes in May 201 2, 
reducing the Group’s interest charge. This 
was partially offset by an additional quarter 
of interest on the £150.0m 201 6 Notes 
issued on 24 March 201 1.
Non-recurring items
The non-recurring items recognised in  
201 2, resulted in a net post-tax credit of 
£1 8.5m. The Group recognised £26.6m  
net management fees on Fund II following 
the resolution of matters in dispute. This  
was partially offset by a £9.1m restructuring 
charge to simplify certain parts of the  
Group’s business and reduce headcount to 
lower staff costs. The FSCS has increased 
the one-off levy in relation to 2010/201 1 
resulting in the Group recognising an 
additional charge of £2.5m. In addition,  
the Group has increased its void property 
provision by £1.2m. More details are provided 
in note 7 to the financial statements.
Tax
The tax charge on underlying profit for the 
year was £1 9.5m resulting in an effective  
tax rate of 1 3.3%. The effective tax rate on 
underlying profit is less than the pro rata UK 
corporation tax rate of 24.5%, primarily as a 
result of the difference in tax rates on earnings 
generated overseas and the utilisation and 
recognition of previously unrecognised tax 
losses. We expect our effective tax rate to  
be closer to 20% in the future.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2  Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements
In December we announced a change in the 
Company’s tax residency from the Republic 
of Ireland to the UK.
AUM and fund flows
T otal AUM at 31 December 201 2 was 
£65.6bn, an increase of £1.3bn from  
31 December 201 1. During 201 2, the Group 
had net fund outflows of £3.9bn as market 
volatility and uncertainty impacted clients’ 
demand for risk assets. The Institutional 
business saw net outflows of £1.9bn,  
Retail net outflows of £1.2bn and Phoenix 
net outflows of £0.8bn. Market and FX 
movements added £5.2bn as market levels 
improved, particularly in the latter stages  
of 201 2.
Investment performance 
Investment performance of the Group’s 
funds remained strong. Overall, 73% and 
69% of funds exceeded their benchmarks 
over one and three years respectively. 
Looking at the asset classes, 81% and 72% 
of equity funds and 79% of fixed income 
funds were either achieving or beating their 
benchmarks over one year and three years. 
The property funds achieved 34% and 47% 
for one year and three years respectively.
In our UK retail funds, performance over  
one year has improved. Our SICAVs continue 
to perform strongly over all periods. The 
performance in the US mutual fund range 
has picked up significantly over one year  
as performance in the International 
Opportunities Fund improved, finishing the 
year in the first quartile. Our investment 
trusts had another good year with all but one 
of our trusts outperforming their benchmark. 
Along with the industry, our absolute  
return funds were tested by the volatility  
in markets. However, performance picked  
up in the second half of the year with the 
vast majority of our funds being positive  
for the year. 
The Institutional business continued to 
perform strongly with our fixed income 
range, in particular, having delivered 
excellent performance for our clients.
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s business continued to generate 
strong operating cash flows during 201 2 
with net cash flows from operating activities, 
totalling £1 66.8m. The Group repaid in full 
the £1 42.6m of the 201 2 Notes in May 
201 2 from its existing cash resources. 
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 
201 2 were £196.9m. After deducting the 
manager dealing accounts of £29.0m, 
unrestricted cash stood at £1 67 .9m.  
Gross debt, at par, amounted to £150.0m  
at 31 December 201 2. Therefore, the Group 
ended 201 2 in a net unrestricted cash 
position of £1 7 .9m, compared to a net debt 
position of £28.0m at 31 December 201 1.
The Group cancelled its remaining £200m 
multicurrency term facility and its £75m 
revolving credit facility on 3 February 201 2 
and 15 January 2013 respectively. The 
Group’s focus remains, subject to external 
factors, to repay the 201 6 Notes and to 
strengthen the Group’s capital position.
Pension schemes
The Group has five pension schemes.  
A defined benefit scheme and a defined 
contribution scheme, together forming the 
Henderson Group Pension Scheme (HGPS), 
the Gartmore Pension Scheme (GPS) and 
three smaller unapproved pension top-up 
schemes for former executives.
There was a net surplus in HGPS of 
£1 25.4m, after tax deducted at source,  
at 31 December 201 2. The decrease in  
the surplus was mainly due to a reduction  
in the discount rate used to value the 
scheme liabilities. 
In April 201 2, the trustee of GPS, entered  
into a buy-in insurance agreement with 
Pension Insurance Corporation that covers 
the accrued pension of all members of the 
scheme. As a result, the Group has reduced 
its exposure to the risks associated with the 
scheme. GPS, which is closed to future 
accrual, had a net surplus of £4.8m, after tax 
deducted at source, as at 31 December 201 2.
The liability in respect of the Group’s 
unapproved pension schemes amounted  
to £7 .2m at 31 December 201 2.
Regulatory requirements
The Group is subject to regulatory  
oversight and inspection by the FSA and 
other international regulatory bodies. 
Consequently, the Group’s internal controls, 
governance, procedures and capital are 
reviewed on a continuous basis. Both 
management and the Board ensure that  
the Group is compliant with its regulatory 
obligations at all times. In 201 1, as part of 
the Gartmore acquisition process, the Group 
was granted a new waiver from consolidated 
supervision which is valid until April 201 6.
The regulatory capital surplus of the Group 
under the parent financial holding company 
test increased to £954m as at 31 December 
201 2 (201 1: £623m) following the corporate 
restructure carried out as part of the change 
in tax residency from the Republic of Ireland 
to the UK announced on 1 3 December 201 2.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for 201 2 of 5.05 pence per share which  
will bring the total dividend for 201 2  
to 7 .15 pence per share, an increase of  
2%. The proposed final dividend will be paid 
on 31 May 2013 to shareholders on the 
register on 10 May 2013.
The Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy and will continue to apply  
a dividend formula where the next interim 
dividend will be 30% of the total dividend  
for the previous year, assuming the Group 
has the resources to fund the dividend.

Annual Report 201 2 Risk management
Managing risk at all levels
“We meet our business objectives within acceptable 
risk parameters” 
Our risk management framework helps  
us meet our business objectives within 
acceptable risk parameters and it is 
reviewed regularly so that new and 
emerging risks are identified early on. 
Our culture embeds the management of risk 
at all levels within our organisation. The 
framework we operate under also ensures 
that we meet our business objectives 
without exceeding our risk appetite and it  
is subject to continuous review to ensure  
it recognises both new and emerging risks 
in the business.
Risk management
The Board considers risk assessment and 
the existence of effective controls to be 
fundamental to achieving the Group’s 
corporate objectives within an acceptable 
risk and reward profile. Throughout 201 2, 
there has continued to be an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating, managing 
and mitigating risks within the Group’s 
control which accords with the guidance set 
out in the “T urnbull Report – Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code – October 2005”. No 
significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified during this period by this process. 
A summary of the Group’s risk policy can be 
found on our website (www.henderson.com) 
and the key risks and their mitigation are 
outlined under Risk management on pages 
30 and 31. 
The responsibility for managing risk lies  
with the ExCo. There are also a number of 
management committees chaired by, and 
consisting of, senior managers that have 
responsibility for specific areas of risk. These 
provide a forum for resolving and managing 
risk and regulatory issues. Day-to-day 
responsibility for the management of risk  
is delegated to line management who work 
closely with the Risk function to maintain  
an effective system of control and oversight.
Our framework utilises a ‘three lines of 
defence’ approach to managing risk: the first 
line is represented by business management 
managing risk and having in place effective 
controls; the second line comprises an 
independent Risk function which monitors 
the operation of those controls and ensures 
risks are not overlooked and a Compliance 
team which monitors regulatory risks. The 
third line is provided by Internal Audit which 
operates and reports independently of 
management to the Audit Committee and is 
responsible for assessing the effectiveness 
of controls and, where necessary, making 
recommendations for improvements and 
monitoring management action plans to 
implement such improvements.
Quarterly risk reports provided to the Board 
Risk Committee (BRC) include material 
business risks such as credit, market and 
operational risks and the Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) provides regular reports to the BRC 
on these topics. The Risk function also 
maintains an incident management process 
and reports regularly to the ExCo.
The Board considers the scope of the 
activities of the BRC and the reporting 
framework set out above gives it sufficient 
information upon which to assess the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and to assess the actual 
and potential risks facing the Group. 
BRC’s principal activities  
during 2012
The BRC received regular risk management 
reports which addressed both significant 
strategic and operational issues which 
occurred during the year as well as 
emerging risks. Reports on aggregated 
credit risk were provided to each meeting 
which included matters such as the 
monitoring of credit risks related to countries 
within the eurozone and counterparty risks. 
The assessment of risks arising from the 
potential break-up of the eurozone was 
presented and updated throughout the year.
During 201 2, the pace of regulatory change 
has continued unabated and the BRC was 
regularly updated on developments and 
implications for risk management. The BRC 
was briefed on the G30 paper on 
Governance, the FSA’s Annual Retail 
Conduct Risk Outlook and the results  
of industry surveys undertaken on asset 
managers’ risk management practices and 
current themes. Other matters considered 
included issues relating to the derivative  
risk management framework in light of all 
the regulatory and other changes occurring 
in that area. The BRC also approved the 
updated CRO’s and Risk function’s priorities 
and objectives for 201 2 and 2013.
The BRC reviewed and approved the 
updated Group Risk Management 
Framework and Policy Statement, an 
abbreviated copy of which can be found  
on the Group’s website. It also approved the 
updated Credit Risk Policy at the beginning 
of the year.

The reverse stress test was reviewed and 
updated; this requires the Group to identify 
explicitly the scenarios most likely to render 
the business unviable and then assess  
them. As part of this exercise, an overview  
of possible significant events and mitigating 
management actions was considered. 
Semi-annually, the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process document is updated 
by the Risk function in conjunction with the 
relevant business areas. The BRC then 
reviewed, challenged and recommended  
its approval to the Board following approval 
by the ExCo. The BRC also reviewed the 
risks relating to litigation matters. 
Further information on the BRC’s role  
in monitoring and assessing the Group’s 
management of risk is set out in the

Annual Report 201 2 Risk management continued
Key risks and their mitigation
Acquisition Credit Foreign currency Key personnel Liquidity Investment 
performance
Market Operational Regulatory/legal Reputational
Description
The risk of organisational 
stress through the potential 
demands made on staff  
and resources through the 
need to integrate acquired 
businesses. This risk is 
aligned to the Group’s 
long-term strategy that 
involves willingness to 
consider the acquisition  
of businesses.
The risk of a counterparty  
to the Group defaulting  
on funds deposited with  
it or the non-receipt of  
a trade debt.
The risk that the Group  
will sustain losses through 
adverse movements in 
exchange rates.
The risk of losing either  
a member of the ExCo  
or one of the Group’s key 
investment or distribution 
professionals. This could 
have an adverse effect  
on both the growth of the 
business and/or the 
retention of existing 
business.
The risk that the Group  
may be unable to meet  
its payment obligations  
as they fall due.
Description
The risk that funds fail  
to achieve performance 
hurdles or benchmarks.  
This might cause clients to 
redeem their investments, 
which in turn would result  
in a reduction in revenue 
earned by the Group.  
Poor fund performance  
will also result in lower 
performance fees.
The risk that market 
conditions lead to a decline 
in the value of Group 
available-for-sale financial 
assets and/or a reduction  
in the value of clients’ AUM, 
which would result in a 
reduction in the level of the 
revenue that is based on the 
value of clients’ AUM.
The risk that the Group  
will sustain losses through 
inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people, systems 
and external events. This 
includes the risk arising from 
failing to manage key 
outsourced service providers 
and also the risk arising  
from business disruption 
(the occurrence of events 
which could have a material  
impact on the operations  
of the business).
The risk that a change  
in laws and regulations  
will materially affect the 
Group’s business or markets 
in which it operates. The 
Group’s business is subject 
to many regulations in 
different jurisdictions and 
currently the pace of change 
is significant and may affect 
the business either directly 
or indirectly by reducing 
investors’ appetite for our 
products, increasing capital 
requirements or in some 
other way.
The risk that negative 
publicity regarding the 
Group will lead to a loss  
of revenue or litigation.  
The risk of damage to  
the Group’s reputation  
is more likely to result  
from one of the risks 
materialising rather than  
as a standalone risk.
Mitigation
We only consider 
acquisitions which fit with 
our strategic goals and meet 
our financial criteria such 
that we can realise value for 
our shareholders. Thorough 
due diligence is performed 
before any acquisition is 
made and this includes 
assessing the ability  
of the Group to integrate 
successfully the acquired 
business. There have been 
no material acquisitions 
during the year and the 
Gartmore businesses 
acquired in 201 1 have been 
successfully integrated.
We have an established 
Credit Risk Policy to  
ensure credit risk arising 
from transactions with 
counterparties is assessed, 
managed and monitored  
in line with the Group’s risk 
appetite. Furthermore, the 
Credit Risk Committee 
meets regularly to approve, 
review and set limits  
for all new and existing 
counterparties. As a result  
of the continuing eurozone 
issues, there has been 
heightened focus on 
monitoring counterparties 
during 2012 and limits  
have been changed  
as appropriate.
We mitigate this risk through 
either the effect of natural 
hedges i.e. holding financial 
assets and liabilities of equal 
value in the same currency, 
and by limiting the net 
exposure to an individual 
currency or by hedging 
exposure arising from 
available-for-sale financial 
assets. A Hedge Committee 
oversees the risk and 
reports to the Board monthly. 
As a result of the market 
conditions during 2012, 
there has continued  
to be heightened focus  
on monitoring euro 
denominated assets.
We operate competitive 
remuneration structures 
designed to recognise  
and reward performance.  
We also have succession 
planning to ensure that  
there is cover for key roles 
should they become vacant. 
In addition, staff surveys 
identify any issues which 
could adversely impact  
staff retention and 
comprehensive training is 
offered ensuring skills and 
knowledge reside in more 
than one individual.
We manage liquidity  
on a daily basis within the 
Finance function, to ensure 
the Group has sufficient 
cash and/or highly liquid 
assets available to meet  
its liabilities. The Group 
ensures that it has access  
to funds to cover all forecast 
commitments for at least  
the following 12 months. 
During the year, the 2012 
Notes were repaid. 
Henderson does not bear 
any liquidity risk associated 
with our clients’ funds and 
has no obligation to provide 
short-term liquidity to  
our clients. 
Mitigation
We mitigate this risk through 
a robust investment process 
which includes detailed 
research. We also have  
a clearly articulated 
investment philosophy  
and analyse our funds  
by comparing their 
performance against 
appropriate benchmarks.  
We maintain a broad range 
of funds to reduce the 
probability of multiple funds 
underperforming at the 
same time. An independent 
Investment Risk function 
monitors risk and 
performance against 
appropriate benchmarks  
and works closely with  
fund managers and senior 
management to review  
the monitoring reports.
We mitigate the risk on the 
Group’s available-for-sale 
financial assets by investing 
in a diversified range of 
assets and mitigate a fall  
in the value of clients’ AUM 
by having a broad range  
of clients by distribution 
channel, product, asset class 
and region. In addition, the 
Group actively seeks fee 
bases which are not solely 
related to the market value 
of AUM and makes a 
significant amount of its 
expense base variable. 
We operate a system of 
controls which is designed 
to ensure operational risks 
are mitigated to an 
acceptable level. The 
operation and effectiveness 
of the controls are regularly 
assessed and confirmed 
through the work of the 
Group’s assurance functions: 
Risk, Compliance and 
Internal Audit. Outsourced 
service providers are 
overseen by the relevant  
line function and, for key 
relationships, their controls 
are also reviewed by the 
Group’s assurance functions. 
We maintain and test 
business continuity plans 
which are designed to 
ensure that, should an  
event occur which disrupts 
business activity, we are able 
to maintain our operations 
without irreparable damage 
being done to the business.
We continuously monitor 
regulatory developments,  
via a dedicated team in 
Compliance. Where there  
is likely impact on our 
business, we have working 
groups in place to implement 
the changes. The broader 
Compliance team monitors 
ongoing regulatory 
obligations and engages  
in regular dialogue with  
our regulators. In 2012,  
this included AIFMD,  
RDR and derivatives.
We believe that reputational 
risk is mitigated through  
the effective mitigation  
of the other key risks.  
In addition, we regularly 
communicate with clients 
and the market and,  
in doing so, help to  
mitigate the risk of 
reputational damage.
The key risks faced by the Group fall into a number of distinct categories and  
the means adopted to mitigate them are both varied and relevant to the nature  
of the risk concerned.

Acquisition Credit Foreign currency Key personnel Liquidity Investment 
performance
Market Operational Regulatory/legal Reputational
Description
The risk of organisational 
stress through the potential 
demands made on staff  
and resources through the 
need to integrate acquired 
businesses. This risk is 
aligned to the Group’s 
long-term strategy that 
involves willingness to 
consider the acquisition  
of businesses.
The risk of a counterparty  
to the Group defaulting  
on funds deposited with  
it or the non-receipt of  
a trade debt.
The risk that the Group  
will sustain losses through 
adverse movements in 
exchange rates.
The risk of losing either  
a member of the ExCo  
or one of the Group’s key 
investment or distribution 
professionals. This could 
have an adverse effect  
on both the growth of the 
business and/or the 
retention of existing 
business.
The risk that the Group  
may be unable to meet  
its payment obligations  
as they fall due.
Description
The risk that funds fail  
to achieve performance 
hurdles or benchmarks.  
This might cause clients to 
redeem their investments, 
which in turn would result  
in a reduction in revenue 
earned by the Group.  
Poor fund performance  
will also result in lower 
performance fees.
The risk that market 
conditions lead to a decline 
in the value of Group 
available-for-sale financial 
assets and/or a reduction  
in the value of clients’ AUM, 
which would result in a 
reduction in the level of the 
revenue that is based on the 
value of clients’ AUM.
The risk that the Group  
will sustain losses through 
inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people, systems 
and external events. This 
includes the risk arising from 
failing to manage key 
outsourced service providers 
and also the risk arising  
from business disruption 
(the occurrence of events 
which could have a material  
impact on the operations  
of the business).
The risk that a change  
in laws and regulations  
will materially affect the 
Group’s business or markets 
in which it operates. The 
Group’s business is subject 
to many regulations in 
different jurisdictions and 
currently the pace of change 
is significant and may affect 
the business either directly 
or indirectly by reducing 
investors’ appetite for our 
products, increasing capital 
requirements or in some 
other way.
The risk that negative 
publicity regarding the 
Group will lead to a loss  
of revenue or litigation.  
The risk of damage to  
the Group’s reputation  
is more likely to result  
from one of the risks 
materialising rather than  
as a standalone risk.
Mitigation
We only consider 
acquisitions which fit with 
our strategic goals and meet 
our financial criteria such 
that we can realise value for 
our shareholders. Thorough 
due diligence is performed 
before any acquisition is 
made and this includes 
assessing the ability  
of the Group to integrate 
successfully the acquired 
business. There have been 
no material acquisitions 
during the year and the 
Gartmore businesses 
acquired in 201 1 have been 
successfully integrated.
We have an established 
Credit Risk Policy to  
ensure credit risk arising 
from transactions with 
counterparties is assessed, 
managed and monitored  
in line with the Group’s risk 
appetite. Furthermore, the 
Credit Risk Committee 
meets regularly to approve, 
review and set limits  
for all new and existing 
counterparties. As a result  
of the continuing eurozone 
issues, there has been 
heightened focus on 
monitoring counterparties 
during 2012 and limits  
have been changed  
as appropriate.
We mitigate this risk through 
either the effect of natural 
hedges i.e. holding financial 
assets and liabilities of equal 
value in the same currency, 
and by limiting the net 
exposure to an individual 
currency or by hedging 
exposure arising from 
available-for-sale financial 
assets. A Hedge Committee 
oversees the risk and 
reports to the Board monthly. 
As a result of the market 
conditions during 2012, 
there has continued  
to be heightened focus  
on monitoring euro 
denominated assets.
We operate competitive 
remuneration structures 
designed to recognise  
and reward performance.  
We also have succession 
planning to ensure that  
there is cover for key roles 
should they become vacant. 
In addition, staff surveys 
identify any issues which 
could adversely impact  
staff retention and 
comprehensive training is 
offered ensuring skills and 
knowledge reside in more 
than one individual.
We manage liquidity  
on a daily basis within the 
Finance function, to ensure 
the Group has sufficient 
cash and/or highly liquid 
assets available to meet  
its liabilities. The Group 
ensures that it has access  
to funds to cover all forecast 
commitments for at least  
the following 12 months. 
During the year, the 2012 
Notes were repaid. 
Henderson does not bear 
any liquidity risk associated 
with our clients’ funds and 
has no obligation to provide 
short-term liquidity to  
our clients. 
Mitigation
We mitigate this risk through 
a robust investment process 
which includes detailed 
research. We also have  
a clearly articulated 
investment philosophy  
and analyse our funds  
by comparing their 
performance against 
appropriate benchmarks.  
We maintain a broad range 
of funds to reduce the 
probability of multiple funds 
underperforming at the 
same time. An independent 
Investment Risk function 
monitors risk and 
performance against 
appropriate benchmarks  
and works closely with  
fund managers and senior 
management to review  
the monitoring reports.
We mitigate the risk on the 
Group’s available-for-sale 
financial assets by investing 
in a diversified range of 
assets and mitigate a fall  
in the value of clients’ AUM 
by having a broad range  
of clients by distribution 
channel, product, asset class 
and region. In addition, the 
Group actively seeks fee 
bases which are not solely 
related to the market value 
of AUM and makes a 
significant amount of its 
expense base variable. 
We operate a system of 
controls which is designed 
to ensure operational risks 
are mitigated to an 
acceptable level. The 
operation and effectiveness 
of the controls are regularly 
assessed and confirmed 
through the work of the 
Group’s assurance functions: 
Risk, Compliance and 
Internal Audit. Outsourced 
service providers are 
overseen by the relevant  
line function and, for key 
relationships, their controls 
are also reviewed by the 
Group’s assurance functions. 
We maintain and test 
business continuity plans 
which are designed to 
ensure that, should an  
event occur which disrupts 
business activity, we are able 
to maintain our operations 
without irreparable damage 
being done to the business.
We continuously monitor 
regulatory developments,  
via a dedicated team in 
Compliance. Where there  
is likely impact on our 
business, we have working 
groups in place to implement 
the changes. The broader 
Compliance team monitors 
ongoing regulatory 
obligations and engages  
in regular dialogue with  
our regulators. In 2012,  
this included AIFMD,  
RDR and derivatives.
We believe that reputational 
risk is mitigated through  
the effective mitigation  
of the other key risks.  
In addition, we regularly 
communicate with clients 
and the market and,  
in doing so, help to  
mitigate the risk of 
reputational damage.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 A sustainable approach 
to business
   Marketplace
Aims and objectives
We operate high standards  
of corporate governance and take  
an active approach to voting in  
investee companies.
Our adoption of the UN Principles  
for Responsible Investment creates  
a framework for considering 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) issues that have the potential to 
add value to our investment decisions.
As well as managing Sustainable and 
Responsible Investment (SRI) funds 
where ESG issues are proactively 
considered, we have a Responsible 
Investment Policy that outlines our 
commitment to integrate ESG in our 
non-SRI equity funds. 
The management of our property 
assets adhere to our Responsible 
Development and Investment Policies. 
Progress in 2012
 •
 The Investment Management Responsible 
Investment Committee, which oversees the 
implementation of our policy, was further 
expanded to include representatives from 
all fund management teams, across our 
Equity and Fixed Income teams, as well  
as from our Investment Risk function.
 •
We put in place a process for screening 
all our major company holdings for 
compliance with the Global Compact,  
a set of 10 principles in the areas of 
human rights, labour, the environment  
and anti-corruption. This process is  
now being used to identify potential 
engagement issues.
 •
We established a new initiative to screen 
companies for material ESG issues 
ahead of company meetings. External 
specialist research on corporate 
governance and environmental and social 
issues is used to identify key engagement 
issues for fund managers to raise at 
meetings with company management.
 •
Our Property team is a founder 
participant in the new IPD/Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
initiative EcoPAS, designed to enable 
investors and valuers to understand  
the potential environmental risks  
in a property portfolio by focusing  
on the environmental variables thought 
likely to impact asset value and 
investment performance.
 •
We also had our first ‘A’-rated property 
asset in the UK following the recent 
installation of solar photovoltaics (PV) 
panels, as part of our policy to provide 
on-site renewable energy to tenants  
and reduce carbon emissions.
 •
We were again awarded four ‘Green 
Stars’ in the 2012 Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark for our 
Shopping Centre Fund, Central London 
Office Fund and UK and European Outlet 
Mall Fund. This year over 430 companies 
responded to the survey, an increase  
of 30% on 201 1.
2013 plans
 •
Maintain high standards of client service 
and explore ways to integrate ESG 
factors across all our asset classes.
 •
Integrate ESG risk measures into  
monthly investment risk reports. Reports 
will identify the highest risk companies  
in portfolios as rated by specialist 
research firms and performance relative 
to the benchmark.
 •
Further improve the availability and 
integration of specialist ESG research  
for our fixed income fund managers  
and analysts.
 •
Improve data collection processes for 
measuring fund level performance on 
stewardship and responsible investment 
related issues.
 •
 Review extending the external  
verification of our corporate governance 
work to include engagement as well  
as voting, in line with the revisions  
to the UK Stewardship Code announced 
in September 2012.
 •
Lead one of the Better Building 
Partnership’s outreach programmes, 
including London-wide energy 
benchmarking, sector education 
programmes, forward procurement 
strategy with the Institute for 
Sustainability and pioneering Landlord 
Energy Rating certification.
   Workplace
Aims and objectives
We aim to ensure that all our policies 
meet best practice and comply with 
relevant employment legislation and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
creating a working environment free 
from discrimination and harassment.
We have learning and development 
programmes and solutions to  
develop, attract and retain talent  
(see more on page 1 6). We are 
committed to building staff share 
ownership and creating a reward 
approach that consists of both financial 
and non-financial elements when 
recognising individuals’ performance.
Progress in 2012
 •
We completed the roll out of a new 
learning and development platform  
with 37% of staff attending one session 
or more.
 •
We took on 34 trainees into our  
Trainee Programme, see page 17  
for further details.
Corporate responsibility
We are committed to interacting responsibly with our stakeholders and our report 
covers four areas as summarised below.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2  Overv i ew P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements
 •
Our employee share schemes remain  
well supported with 90% of staff involved 
in one or more schemes. We continue  
to be recognised as one of the UK’s 
leading companies for fostering 
employee share ownership. 
 •
 We held interactive workshops for  
all of our staff worldwide in response to 
the 201 1 staff survey, which highlighted 
employee desire for increased 
communication on strategy.
2013 plans
 •
Continue to use the feedback from  
2012 staff survey results to identify  
areas for improvement. 
 •
 Encourage employees to make  
further use of our learning and 
development courses.
 •
 Build on our Trainee Programme  
success and encourage more 
apprenticeships, school leavers and those 
from diverse backgrounds. We have also 
partnered with other firms to develop  
the programme.
   Environment
Aims and objectives
We follow responsible environmental 
practices for all Group operations and 
aim to minimise any adverse impact on 
the environment.
We continue to measure our emissions 
and carbon footprint for all energy 
consumption, business travel and waste 
generation and aim to retain our status 
as a CarbonNeutral Company by 
procuring credits through verified carbon 
offset schemes.
Progress in 2012
 •
We maintained our status as a 
CarbonNeutral Company by offsetting 
our net emissions of 3,275 tonnes CO
²
e. 
 •
We have committed to extend our 
CarbonNeutral Company status until the 
end of 2015 by procuring credits from a 
wide range of emission reducing projects 
in Europe, America and Asia.
 •
Our gross emissions increased by 8% 
from the previous year, due primarily to 
business travel as we extend our global 
reach in the US and Asia. 
Notwithstanding this, we continue to 
focus on delivering our business in the 
most efficient way possible. Our efforts 
have resulted in an improved Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) score and 
performance band.
 •
Our CDP ranking was sixth out  
of 22 for lowest emissions per  
employee for Comparable Capital  
Market CDP respondents.
 •
Our environmental initiatives at our 
London office were recognised with  
the building winning the top award  
of the Chairman’s Cup in the Clean  
City Award Scheme.
 •
We participated in a government funded 
study to evaluate the environmental 
performance of our London office  
against the intended design outcomes. 
The results of the study will be published 
in 2013.
 •
We continue to be active members of the 
Broadgate Environmental Working Group.
2013 plans
 •
Maintain our status as a CarbonNeutral 
Company and focus on our energy 
reduction programme in our  
London office.
 •
Maintain and develop our  
waste management, re-use  
and recycling programme.
 •
Complete an environmental study,  
publish results and progress any 
agreed-upon recommendations to 
improve environmental performance.
 •
Focus on the avoidance of travel between 
international offices through increased 
use of video conferencing.
    Community and 
supply chain
Aims and objectives
We foster positive relationships  
with the local London community,  
as this is where the majority of our 
employees work. Activities focus on 
employee involvement and charitable 
donations, and we encourage everyone 
to participate by matching money 
raised, pound for pound as well as 
offering time off for community and 
charitable activities.
We also aim to ensure that our 
suppliers and service providers operate 
responsible labour and environmental 
practices, and have practices in line 
with our Corporate Responsibility Policy. 
Progress in 2012
 •
We launched the Henderson Foundation 
to bring greater focus and clarity to our 
corporate responsibility objectives. We 
donated a total of £1 62,213 to community 
and charitable purposes, compared with 
£1 49,532 in 201 1. The majority of this 
donation came from matching employees 
fundraising for over 50 charitable causes 
local, national and international. In addition 
to staff related fundraising, we continued 
our sponsorship of £50,000 to the Isaac 
Newton Institute, a leading mathematics 
institute, and £10,055 to Community 
Links, our preferred charity since 1987 . 
This is an inner city charity running 
community-based projects in East  
London, close to our London office. 
 •
 We substantially increased the number  
of UK staff using the Give as Y ou Earn 
scheme to 12% of staff.
2013 plans
 •
Encourage a better take-up in  
employee volunteering and look to 
improve links with local schools and 
charitable organisations to source 
candidates for the Henderson  
Trainee Programme.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Governance
Strong governance
Chairman’s introduction
201 2 was another busy time for the Board, 
during which the Company changed its tax 
residency from the Republic of Ireland to  
the UK following the UK government’s 
Controlled Foreign Company reform.  
We also restructured our Board in light  
of the change in residence. I would like  
to thank David Jacob and James Darkins  
for the effort, commitment and valuable 
contributions made to the Board.
As previously announced, I will be stepping 
down from the Board at the AGM in May 
2013 after serving as a Director for almost 
nine years. I welcome Richard Gillingwater 
who will be succeeding me as Chairman 
immediately following the AGM.
Increased regulatory change, difficult 
markets and a growing emphasis on 
corporate governance are all features of  
the world in which we operate. I believe  
that Henderson has the right governance 
structures in place to meet these challenges.
A description of our business model and our 
strategy for achieving our goals is set out on 
pages 1 2 and 13.
UK Corporate Governance Code 
and ASX Principles
The Directors embrace, and are subject to, 
the high standards of corporate governance 
contained in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the FRC in June 2010  
(UK Code) and the Corporate Governance 
Principles and Recommendations with 2010 
Amendments issued by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council in June 2010 (ASX 
Principles). Compliance with the new UK 
Corporate Governance Code, published in 
September 201 2, which applies from the 
financial year commencing on 1 January 
2013 will be disclosed in the 2013 Annual 
Report and Accounts. The UK Code and  
the ASX Principles can be found on the 
websites of their respective organisations  
at www.frc.org.uk and www.asx.com.au.  
The Company’s corporate governance 
policies can be found on our website. 
The Company complied with the UK Code 
and the ASX Principles in 201 2 except in 
regard to the setting and disclosure of 
gender diversity targets. We recognise that 
the principles of equality and diversity are 
fundamental to our success and that this  
will continue to add value to the way in 
which our business operates in the future. 
While we do not have formal diversity 
targets, as we believe that appointments 
should be based on merit and objective 
criteria, we are committed to promoting 
equality and diversity in the workplace and 
recognise the need for, and benefits of, 
diversity in helping us attract and retain  
high potential employees. We have policies, 
employee benefits and business practices  
in place to support a diverse workforce. 
This statement, together with the Report  
on Directors’ remuneration, describes how 
we applied the ‘main principles’ set out in  
the UK Code and complied with the ASX 
Principles. Further details can be found in 
the corporate governance section of our 
website. The ASX Principles also encourage 
companies that are not subject to the 
Australian Corporations Act 2001 to adopt 
practices and make disclosures to achieve 
the aims of the provisions contained in 
certain sections of that Act. We achieved the 
aims of some of those provisions, although 
not fully on senior executives’ remuneration. 
Our disclosure of individuals’ remuneration is 
limited to the Executive Directors who were 
members of the Board in 201 2. Disclosure 
of the remuneration of non-directors is not a 
requirement in the UK and we consider this 
information to be commercially sensitive. 
However, we have disclosed the aggregate 
annual remuneration of Code Staff (as 
defined on page 62 in the Report on 
Directors’ remuneration) on page 62. 
The Board’s structure
The Board comprises a Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and six 
other Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Chairman Designate). Biographical details of 
the Directors are set out on pages 42 and 43.
Although the Chairman, Rupert Pennant-Rea, 
met the independence criteria on appointment, 
the UK Code provides that the test of 
independence is not appropriate thereafter. 
We consider all the other Non-Executive 
Directors – Sarah Arkle, Kevin Dolan, 
Duncan Ferguson, Richard Gillingwater,  
Tim How and Robert Jeens – to be 
independent, as they do not have any 
interest or business or other relationship 
which could, or could reasonably be 
perceived to, interfere materially with their 
ability to act in the best interests of the 
Company. We have considered the criteria 
proposed by the UK Code and the ASX 
Principles in assessing the independence  
of the Directors. Materiality, as referred to in 
the ASX Principles, has been assessed on  
a case-by-case basis by reference to each 
Director’s individual circumstances rather  
than general materiality thresholds. We are 
satisfied that the independent Directors  
meet a quantitative materiality threshold for 
independence, which is that no Director has  
“We favour high standards of corporate governance, 
and we try to meet them ourselves”
Rupert Pennant-Rea
Chairman
34
Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 a relationship with the Group which 
generates or accounts for more than 5% of 
the Group’s revenue or expenses. Accordingly, 
the Board (excluding the Chairman) has a 
majority of Directors who are independent. 
Tim How is the Senior Independent Director.
There is a division of responsibility between 
the Chairman, who is responsible for leading 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, 
and the Chief Executive who is responsible 
to the Board for the overall management 
and performance of the Group. The 
Chairman’s other significant commitments 
are shown in the Board of Directors section 
on page 42.
Non-Executive Directors are initially 
appointed for a fixed term, normally of  
three years, and any subsequent terms are 
considered by the Board. If a Non-Executive 
Director is reappointed after having served 
six years, such reappointment, and any 
subsequent reappointment, will normally be 
for a period of 1 2 months. The remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors is shown  
on page 50. The terms and conditions  
of their appointment are on our website,  
as is the process for their appointment  
and reappointment.
At our AGM held on 2 May 201 2, 
shareholders reappointed James Darkins, 
Kevin Dolan, Duncan Ferguson, Andrew 
Formica, Shirley Garrood, Tim How, David 
Jacob, Robert Jeens and Rupert Pennant-
Rea as Directors. Our next AGM is due to 
take place on 1 May 2013, when all 
Directors on the Board at that date, apart 
from Rupert Pennant-Rea, will be seeking 
reappointment in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Code. 
Diversity
Our Human Resource policies and staff 
benefits aim to attract and retain a diverse 
and flexible workforce. In order to assist  
us in monitoring our progress on gender 
diversity, senior management review 
statistics on numbers and proportions of 
men and women in the workplace generally 
and broken down by: working patterns; 
status; length of service; turnover; region; 
division; and salary band.
We apply the same principles at Board level. 
Candidates for appointment to the Board 
are identified taking into account:
 •
the current composition of the Board, 
with due regard for the benefits of 
diversity on the Board, including gender;
 •
the need for independence;
 •
the strategic direction and progress of 
the business; and
 •
the geographic spread and diversity of 
the Group. 
Shirley Garrood was the only woman on the 
Board until the appointment of Sarah Arkle 
in September. The composition of the  
ExCo was recently reviewed. The women 
representation on the Board is now 22%. 
The addition of the General Counsel, Jacqui 
Irvine, and the Chief Operating Officer, 
Lesley Cairney, in January 2013, means  
the proportion of women on the ExCo has 
increased to 33%.
Responsibilities and operation of 
the Board
The Board met 1 6 times in 201 2, of which 
seven were scheduled meetings. The Board, 
the Board Risk Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee met in Paris in 
January 201 2 and the Board, Remuneration 
Committee and Board Risk Committee met 
in Frankfurt in October 201 2. All other Board 
and standing Board Committee meetings 
were held in Ireland, until December 201 2, 
when the Company changed its tax 
residency from the Republic of Ireland to the 
UK by means of a corporate restructuring. 
The number of meetings held by the standing 
Committees during the year are set out later 
in this statement.  We are scheduled to meet 
at least seven times in 2013. 
Additional meetings will be held as required, 
or at the request of a Director. 
During each meeting, Directors are given the 
opportunity to question and challenge any 
initiatives and proposals from management. 
The Board held two meetings dedicated  
to strategy, in addition to considering  
regular strategy updates from management 
during the year. Some of the Non-Executive 
Directors also attended the senior 
management conference held in May 201 2.
T o enable us, as a Board, to perform our role 
effectively, we are provided with the means 
and information necessary for us to make 
informed decisions and to follow best 
corporate governance practices. In addition, 
the Chairman, Chief Executive and  
Chief Financial Officer hold agenda-setting 
meetings before each Board meeting to 
review the items of business, the likely  
time to be spent on each agenda item,  
who should present particular items and to 
ensure that appropriate papers are provided.
We receive detailed reports on the various 
aspects of the business and of any major 
issues affecting it, which includes a monthly 
performance report. An overview of the 
matters considered by the Board in 201 2  
is on page 37 .
We reviewed and approved our corporate 
governance policies and manual in 201 2. 
These include, but are not limited to, an 
overview of the Company’s corporate 
governance procedures, a policy on trading 
in the shares of the Company by Directors 
and employees and the Code of Conduct 
which sets out our values and standards.  
We have a Market Disclosure and 
Communication Policy designed to ensure 
compliance with our disclosure obligations 
and a Chief Disclosure Officer to oversee 
this. T ogether, these corporate governance 
policies set a framework within which the 
Directors and employees are expected to 
protect the interests of shareholders, clients, 
employees and suppliers. These policies and 
other corporate governance documents are 
on our website.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary and the 
General Counsel. The Company Secretary 
can be appointed or removed only with  
the approval of the Board. Ms Jacqui Irvine  
was appointed as Company Secretary with  
effect from 1 2 December 201 2, replacing 
Ms Fionnuala Hanrahan. The Directors are 
entitled to seek independent professional 
advice, at the Company’s expense, where 
they judge it necessary for them to 
discharge their responsibilities.
Training
T o ensure that the Directors continually 
update their skills and knowledge, all 
Directors receive regular presentations on 
different aspects of the Group’s business 
and on financial, legal and regulatory matters 
affecting our sector. For example, during 
201 2, the Directors received training 
regarding Convertible Bonds and Group  
and subsidiary FSA Matters, Market Abuse 
and Insider Dealing and Treating Customers 
Fairly. At the meeting in Frankfurt, the 
Directors received overviews on European 
macro concerns and European and Latin 
America retail businesses as well as an 
update on the future of the euro.
Evaluation of the Board’s 
performance
Following the external Board evaluation in 
201 1, we conducted an internal evaluation  
in 201 2. 
The evaluation of the Board and Board 
Committees involved Directors completing  
a questionnaire about Board composition, 
Board process, Group strategy and 
interaction with shareholders with a  
similar approach being followed for  
each Committee.

 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Governance continued
The results of the evaluation were collated 
and presented to the Board, which  
included a small number of non-material 
enhancements to the Board process.
T o evaluate individual Directors, the 
Chairman held a formal evaluation meeting 
with each Director, taking into account the 
views of the Directors who had all completed 
a questionnaire about the skills and 
experience of the members of the Board. 
The Chairman’s own performance evaluation 
was led by Tim How, the Senior Independent 
Director. For this, the Directors completed  
a questionnaire which focused on the 
Chairman’s performance and the Chairman 
also conducted a self-evaluation which was 
shared with the Senior Independent Director. 
After taking account of the results of these 
questionnaires, the Senior Independent 
Director met with the other Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding the Chairman) and 
evaluated the Chairman’s performance. He 
then met with the Chairman to discuss the 
outcome of the evaluation.
A report was presented to and considered  
by the Board following the evaluation 
process, at which it was agreed that both  
the Board and its Committees continue to 
operate effectively.
The performance of Andrew Formica, Chief 
Executive, was evaluated by the Chairman 
and the Remuneration Committee. The 
evaluation of the members of the ExCo was 
undertaken by the Chief Executive and the 
Remuneration Committee. 
The performance evaluations were conducted 
in accordance with the processes disclosed 
on our website.
Delegations of authority
A schedule of matters reserved for approval by 
the Board is reviewed annually and is also on 
our website. The Board has granted specific 
delegated authorities (with financial limits 
approved by the Board) to the Chief Executive, 
the Chief Financial Officer and senior 
executives in respect of financial, accounting, 
treasury, regulatory and other matters relating 
to the Group’s business and these were 
reviewed and updated during 201 2. 
The delegations of authority are based on the 
Chief Executive’s authority from the Board. 
The delegations cover three levels: the Chief 
Executive’s delegations (level one), the 
delegations of the Chief Executive’s direct 
reports (level two), and the delegations of 
matters to senior executives (level three). A 
list of persons to whom these three levels of 
delegations apply and the authority to 
sub-delegate is set out in these delegations. 
ExCo
The Chief Executive along with the other 
ExCo members are responsible for 
developing business strategy and, once 
approved by the Board, for ensuring that the 
strategy is implemented in accordance with 
the approved operating plan and complies 
with internal policies and controls.
Other operating committees have been 
appointed, or, following a review, are in the 
process of being constituted, to manage 
aspects of our business, which include the:
 •
Investment Performance & Risk Committee;
 •
Operating Risk & Performance;
 •

Responsibilities
The Board Risk Committee is responsible for 
overseeing, managing and assessing the 
Group’s key risks through a mixture of 
qualitative guidance and quantifiable limits. 
The Board Risk Committee is forward 
looking and advises the Board on the 
Group’s risk profile and risk appetite in 
setting its future strategy. It also advises the 
Board on the amount of surplus regulatory 
capital that should be held and oversees the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and procedures. Responsibilities 
include the monitoring of both regulatory 
compliance and the principal risks and 
uncertainties relating to the Group. It reviews 
the work and reports prepared by the Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO) (who reports directly to 
the Chairman of the Board Risk Committee) 
and oversees the effectiveness of the 
CRO’s role.
Board Risk Committee’s principal 
activities during 2012

Annual Report 201 2 Audit Committee continued
Financial Position, Statement of Changes in 
Equity and Statement of Cash Flows with

matters being highlighted. 
Internal controls 
The Audit Committee received an internal 
controls report each quarter which contained 
an update from each of the Internal Audit, 
Legal and Compliance functions.
The Internal Audit section of the report 
contained an update of outstanding audits in 
accordance with the Internal Audit Plan and 
the results of audits undertaken throughout 
the business, together with any findings and 
outstanding actions. The Audit Committee 
also received a list of auditable activities 
ranked in priority of risk. 
The Legal section set out a summary of 
significant known or potential claims made 
by or against the Group. 
The Compliance section set out a summary  
of any significant compliance issues facing 
the Group including priority areas relating to  
a combination of business as usual, and other 
regulatory developments including the Bribery 
Act, Retail Distribution Review arrangements, 
UK and overseas regulatory matters such as 
the Dodd-Frank Act, the US Commodity 
Futures T rading Commission, the European 
Short Selling Regulations, the AIFMD, the 
review of a Conflicts of Interest Policy for the 
Group, and updates regarding contact and 
meetings with the FSA. Where necessary, the 
updates included actions undertaken or those 
recommended to be undertaken by the Group.
The Audit Committee also received the 
Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s 
report and received various tax updates.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee reviewed Internal 
Audit in 201 2 and was satisfied with the 
performance of the function. 
External auditors and auditor 
independence
The external auditors are Ernst & Y oung LLP. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the external auditors’ remuneration 
and engagement letter and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external auditors during 
201 2 and agreed that the services provided 
by the external auditors were satisfactory. 
The audit engagement partner and senior 
audit team members are rotated every five 
years and no contractual obligations exist to 
restrict the choice of auditors of the Group 
and the Company.
The Charter of Statutory Auditor 
Independence was also reviewed, which 
requires both the Company and the 
external auditors to take measures to 
safeguard the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditors. The Charter takes 
into account the FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees. The policy includes those 
services which are deemed to be pre-
approved, those which need prior approval 
and those which are prohibited. These 
measures include a prohibition regarding 
any non-audit services in respect of specific 
areas (e.g. secondments to management 
positions) or which could create a conflict 
or perceived conflict. It also includes 
information on the procedures for the 
selection, appointment and rotation of the 
external audit engagement partner. The 
Charter is on our website.
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
authorised details of the non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors during the 
year (refer to note 4.2 to the financial 
statements for a summary of the fees paid) 
and agreed that the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors did  
not compromise their objectivity or 
independence. The Audit Committee 
considered the risk and contingency plan  
in the event of the withdrawal of the 
external auditors from the market. 
The external auditors will be asked to 
attend the Company’s AGM on 1 May 2013 
and will be available to answer questions 
from shareholders about the conduct of the 
audit and the preparation and content of 
the Independent Auditors’ Report as shown 
on page 64.
The internal and external auditors attended 
all Audit Committee meetings during the 
year and, on one occasion, met the 
Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Outside the framework of formal meetings, 
Robert Jeens meets and has regular contact 
with the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Head of Finance, the Head of 
Internal Audit (with a new Head of Internal 
Audit being appointed in 201 2), the Head of 
Compliance and the senior engagement 
partner of our external auditors.
Oversight of internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls is reviewed at least annually 
by the Board in order to safeguard the 
Group’s assets as well as clients’ and 
shareholders’ interests. For 201 2, this review 
covered all material controls including 
financial, operational, compliance controls 
and risk management systems. As part of its 
review, the Board received assurances from 
the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer that the statement provided on page 
63 is founded on a sound system of risk 
management and internal controls and that 
the system is operating effectively in all 
material respects in relation to financial 
reporting risks. In addition, the ExCo reported 
positively to the Board on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
the mitigation of any material business risks.
Our system of internal controls requires line 
managers to confirm regularly that controls 
in their respective areas have operated 
effectively. These controls, and the risks 
which they are designed to mitigate, are 
maintained within the Group’s operational 
risk database, which in turn reflects the risk 
profiles of each part of the Group’s business.

Internal controls over financial 
reporting
Our financial reporting process has been 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of the financial 
reporting and preparation of financial 
statements, including consolidated financial 
statements, for external purposes, in 
accordance with IFRS. This process is under 
the supervision of the Chief Executive and 
the Chief Financial Officer and has 
appropriate internal controls to ensure its 
effectiveness. The internal controls include 
policies and procedures that: 
 •
relate to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and disposals of 
the Group’s assets; 
 •
provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial 
statements, and that the receipts and 
expenditures of the Group are being 
made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and 
Directors; and
 •
provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal  
of Group assets that could have a material 
effect on the Group’s financial statements.

Membership
Rupert Pennant-Rea is the Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee. All the other 
Non-Executive Directors are members of 
the Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee met five times in 201 2. 
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee has responsibility 
for considering the size, composition, 
expertise, experience and balance of the 
Board, and the appointment and retirement  
of Directors and making recommendations  
to the Board on these matters. 
Nomination Committee’s 
principal activities during 2012
In 201 2, the Nomination Committee 
instructed an external search consultancy, 
Ridgeway Partners, to identify suitable 
candidates for an additional Non-Executive 
Director. The brief provided to Ridgeway 
Partners was to compile a list of candidates 
with direct fund management industry and, 
ideally, distribution experience. A list of 
candidates was circulated to the Board, 
following which the Chairman met with the 
Senior Independent Director. A shortlist of 
two candidates was prepared for interview 
and they were considered by the Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Director and the 
Chief Executive following which a 
recommendation was made to appoint 
Sarah Arkle to the Board as a Non-
Executive Director. In 201 2, the Nomination 
Committee also instructed an external 
search consultancy, The Zygos Partnership, 
to identify suitable candidates to succeed 
Mr Pennant-Rea as Chairman. Led by  
the Senior Independent Director, five 
candidates were interviewed in total, after 
which the search was narrowed down to 
two individuals with final interviews held. 
Following further meetings with each of the 
Senior Independent Director, certain of the 
other Non-Executive Directors, the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer,  
a recommendation was made to the Board 
in 201 3 to appoint Richard Gillingwater  
to the Board as a Non-Executive Director  
and Chairman Designate. An induction 
programme was arranged and held for 
Sarah Arkle in 201 2 and Richard 
Gillingwater in 201 3 following their 
appointments to the Board. This included 
receiving presentations from the business 
areas and meeting key individuals within  
the Group to ensure that they have an 
appropriate level of knowledge of the 
Group, its business, regulatory aspects  
and the risks facing it.
Ridgeway Partners and The Zygos 
Partnership have no other connection with 
the Company. The Nomination Committee 
also reviewed the mix of diversity, skills and 
experience on the Board and succession 
planning for the Board.

Tim How
Membership
Tim How was appointed as the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee on 2 May 
201 2. The other current members are 
Sarah Arkle, Kevin Dolan and Duncan 
Ferguson. The Remuneration Committee 
met five times in 201 2. 
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee has 
responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s remuneration 
plans, policies and practices and for 
determining, within agreed terms of 
reference, specific remuneration packages 
for the Executive Directors and other 
members of the ExCo. These include 
pension rights, compensation payments 
(if any) and the implementation of 
executive incentive schemes. The 
Remuneration Committee operates on the 
principle that members of the ExCo should 
be provided with incentives to encourage 
superior performance and should, in a 
fair and responsible manner, be rewarded 
for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Group. The Remuneration 
Committee also agrees, maintains and 
periodically reviews a list of Code Staff to 
ensure the correct individuals are identified 
and their remuneration structures are 
reviewed for compliance with the FSA 
Remuneration Code.
Remuneration Committee’s 
principal activities during 2012
The Report on Directors’ remuneration 
(refer to pages 48 to 62) provides details 
on how the Remuneration Committee 
exercised its responsibilities during 201 2 
and also contains a statement on whether 
externally appointed remuneration 
consultants have any other connection 
with the Company.
Financial reporting and going 
concern
The Directors have acknowledged 
their responsibilities in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement in relation to 
the consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 201 2 (refer 
to page 63).
Our business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s review on pages 7 to 1 1. 
The financial position of the Group, and its 
cash flow and liquidity position are described 
in the consolidated financial statements and 
notes. In particular, note 28 to the financial 
statements summarises the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its financial risk management 
objectives, details of financial instruments 
used and hedging activities and its 
exposures to market, liquidity, credit, price, 
interest rate and foreign currency risks.
The Group has sufficient financial resources 
together with diverse revenue streams. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
The Directors closely monitored the material 
uncertainties inherent in current and 
expected market conditions, the trading 
performance of the Group and the debt 
instruments issued by the Group in 201 1. 
After thorough examination, the Directors 
are satisfied that the Company has and 
will maintain sufficient financial resources 
to enable it to continue operating in the 
foreseeable future, and therefore, continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Directors’ report
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group was the 
provision of investment management services.
Future developments and  
business review
The Group’s results for the year  
are shown in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 66. The Business 
Review, which is set out on pages 2 to 33,  
is incorporated into and forms part of this 
Directors’ Report. Future developments are 
included in the Chairman’s statement on 
page 6 and the Chief Executive’s review  
on pages 7 to 1 1. The Financial review  
and KPIs are set out on pages 26 and 27 
and pages 20 and 21 respectively.
Corporate governance
The Governance statement appears on 
pages 34 to 41 and forms part of this 
Directors’ report.
Branches
The Group continues to operate a number  
of overseas branches.
Reporting
Shares in Henderson Group plc are listed  
on both the LSE and the ASX (in the form  
of CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs)) and 
therefore the Company is required to comply 
with both sets of disclosure requirements.
Events after the reporting date
The Board has not received, as at 26 
February 2013, being the date on which the 
Annual Report and Accounts were approved, 
any information concerning significant 
conditions in existence at the reporting  
date which have not been reflected in the 
financial statements as presented. The 
Board has, however, given due regard  
to the events which occurred after the 
reporting date as described in note 35  
to the financial statements.
Directors
Details of the Board members who served 
during the year and at the date of this report 
are set out on pages 42 and 43. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, one third of the Directors of the 
Company are required to retire by rotation at 
each AGM. The retiring Directors are eligible 
to stand for reappointment by shareholders. 
The Board may appoint Directors to the 
Board without shareholder approval. Any 
Director so appointed must stand for 
reappointment by the shareholders at the 
next AGM in accordance with the Articles  
of Association. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all Directors, 
other than Rupert Pennant-Rea who is 
stepping down, will offer themselves for 
reappointment at the AGM on 1 May 2013.
Pursuant to the Articles of Association, 
shareholders may remove a Director before 
the end of his or her term by passing an 
ordinary resolution at a meeting. An ordinary 
resolution is passed if more than 50% of  
the votes cast, in person or by proxy, are in 
favour of the resolution.
Directors’ remuneration and 
interests
A report on Directors’ remuneration appears 
on pages 48 to 62, including details of 
Directors’ interests in shares and share 
options or any right to subscribe for shares 
in the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Directors have put in place procedures 
to deal with conflicts of interest and these 
have operated effectively throughout 201 2. 
A Register of Conflicts of Interest is 
maintained by the Company and reviewed 
by the Board on an annual basis. Any 
Director who is considering accepting a  
new external appointment must provide full 
details of the appointment to the Chairman 
and Company Secretary. In some cases,  
the interest or duty of someone who is 
connected with a Director may give rise to  
a potential conflict of interest and details of 
that must also be provided to the Chairman 
and Company Secretary. The Chairman  
will then decide whether the relevant 
appointment causes a conflict or potential 
conflict of interest and should therefore be 
considered by the Board. If it is considered 
and approved by the Board, such interest or 
potential interest is added to the Register  
of Conflicts of Interest.
Indemnification and insurance of 
Directors and officers
The Company provides an Instrument of 
Indemnity to Directors to the extent permitted 
by Jersey law, including (i) indemnification 
against any liabilities incurred in defending 
any proceedings in which judgment is given 
in that Director’s favour or the Director is 
acquitted; (ii) against liabilities incurred 
otherwise than to the Company, if the 
Director acted in good faith with a view  
to the best interests of the Company;  
and (iii) against any liabilities incurred in 
successfully applying to the Court for  
relief where the Director acted honestly.
In addition, the Instrument of Indemnity 
provides that Directors will have access  
to Board and Committee papers of the 
Company for the period of their office  
and for seven years after ceasing to be a 
Director for the purpose of defending legal 
proceedings, and that the Company will 
maintain Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance cover for the Directors to the 
extent permitted by law for the period of 
their office.
During, or since the end of the financial  
year, the Company has paid or agreed to pay 
premiums in respect of a contract insuring 
all of the officers (including all Directors)  
of the Group against certain liabilities. The 
insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the 
nature of the liability, the amount of the 
premium and the limit of liability.
Financial instruments
Information regarding the risk management 
objectives, policies and related matters in 
respect of the use of financial instruments, 
including policies for hedging and the 
exposure to price, interest rate, liquidity, 
foreign currency and credit risks, can be 
found in note 28 to the financial statements.

Share capital and structure
Details of movements in the allotted share 
capital during the year are given in note 25 
to the financial statements. 
The share capital of the Company, issued 
and unissued, consists entirely of ordinary 
shares of 1 2.5 pence each. Each share 
ranks equally and carries the same right to 
receive dividends and other distributions 
declared, made or paid by the Company. No 
restrictions exist on the transfer or holding of 
securities in the Company under its Articles 
of Association and there are no shares 
carrying special rights with regard to the 
control of the Company.
Substantial shareholdings
At 26 February 2013, in accordance with  
the provisions of Rule 5 of the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the Company had 
received notification of direct and indirect 
holdings in the Company’s issued share 
capital as set out in the table below.
Employee share schemes
The Company has a number of employee 
share schemes. The rights attached to the 
shares of several of the share schemes are 
not exercisable directly by employees. The 
trustees of such share schemes have an 
obligation to act in the best interests of the 
beneficiaries of the share schemes and, 
although the trustees may consider any 
recommendations made by the Company, 
where applicable, the discretion to vote 
remains with the trustees with two 
exceptions: firstly, in cases of takeover or 
reconstruction, the employees do have a 
right to vote via the trustees and secondly, 
the trustee of the Henderson Group plc Buy 
As Y ou Earn Share Plan, and its international 
equivalent, does not have discretion on how 
to vote. For these plans, the trustee seeks 
instructions from the employees beneficially 
entitled to the shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote 
at Company meetings are also entitled to 
appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote  
on their behalf. A member may appoint  
more than one proxy. Proxy forms must be 
received not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for holding a meeting, as  
set out in any notices concerning a general 
meeting or in any proxy form sent by or  
on behalf of the Company in relation to  
a meeting. In addition, the Companies 
(Uncertificated Securities) (Jersey) Order 
1999 provides for a time to be specified  
in the notice of meeting for determining 
attendance and voting entitlements. This 
time may not be more than 48 hours before 
the meeting. Further details are set out in 
any Notice of Meeting issued by the 
Company from time to time.
Amendment to the Articles of 
Association of the Company
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company may only amend its Articles of

is passed if two thirds or more of the votes 
cast, in person or by proxy, are in favour of 
the resolution.

Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Directors’ report continued
New issues of share capital 
and disapplication of  
pre-emption rights
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Directors of the Company 
are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot 
any ordinary shares without express 
authorisation which cannot last more than 
five years. The Company follows best 
practice and asks shareholders to grant 
such authority on an annual basis. Under  
the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Board may not allot ordinary shares for cash, 
other than pursuant to an employee share 
scheme, without first making an offer to 
existing shareholders to allot such shares  
to them on the same or more favourable 
terms in proportion to their respective 
shareholdings, unless this requirement is 
waived by a resolution of the shareholders 
passed by a majority of at least three 
quarters of the holders of the shares  
who vote in person or by proxy in favour  
of the resolution.
The Directors have been authorised by 
shareholders to allot the Company’s 
unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £45,800,000, or £91,600,000 
when in connection with an offer of equity 
securities by way of a rights issue to 
shareholders in proportion to their existing 
holdings. The former amount represented 
less than one third of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 31 December 
201 2. As at 26 February 2013, the Company 
has authority to allot shares up to a nominal 
value of £45,800,000, or £91,600,000 
when in connection with an offer of equity 
securities by way of a rights issue to 
shareholders in proportion to their existing 
holdings. Shareholders will be asked  
to renew this authority up to a limit of 
£46,000,000, or £92,000,000 when in 
connection with an offer of equity securities 
by way of a rights issue to shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings, at the 
AGM on 1 May 2013. The latter allotment 
ceiling of up to two thirds of the nominal 
value of the issued shares is in accordance 
with guidelines issued by the Association  
of British Insurers.
The Directors have authority to allot equity 
securities for cash or sell ordinary shares 
held in treasury (treasury shares) for cash  
on a non-pre-emptive basis: (a) pursuant  
to a rights issue; or (b) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £6,875,000. This 
empowers the Company to make limited 
allotments of unissued equity shares of the 
Company or certain rights to acquire such 
shares (equity securities) and to sell treasury 
shares for cash other than in accordance 
with the pre-emption rights in the Articles of 
Association. This amount represents less 
than 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. Shareholders will be asked to renew 
this authority up to a limit of £6,950,000 at 
the AGM on 1 May 2013.
Purchase of own share capital
Subject to authorisation by a special 
resolution passed by shareholders, the 
Company may purchase its own shares in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Any shares which have been 
bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, would be cancelled, thereby 
reducing the amount of issued share capital. 
The Directors have shareholder authority to 
buy back up to 1 10,000,000 ordinary shares 
during the period up to the forthcoming 
AGM. The maximum number of ordinary 
shares authorised to be purchased is 
1 10,000,000 minus the number of shares 
purchased pursuant to any purchases of 
CDIs made under a Contingent Purchase 
Contract (CP Contract). The minimum price 
(exclusive of expenses) which may be paid 
for an ordinary share is 1 2.5 pence (being 
the nominal value of an ordinary share).  
The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) 
which may be paid for each ordinary share  
is the higher of: (a) an amount equal to 
105% of the average of the middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share as derived 
from the LSE Daily Official List for the five 
business days immediately preceding the 
day on which the share is contracted to be 
purchased; and (b) an amount equal to the 
higher of the price of the last independent 
trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary 
share as derived from the LSE Trading 
System. No ordinary shares were bought 
back by the Company during 201 2.
The Directors consider that it may be 
advantageous for the Company to buy  
back interests in its own CDIs in certain 
circumstances. However, because CDIs  
are interests in shares, rather than shares 
themselves, the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 provisions which provide for a buy 
back of shares do not apply to CDIs. The 
Company, therefore, cannot buy CDIs 
pursuant to the above authority.
The Company achieves a similar result by 
entering into a CP Contract with Credit 
Suisse (Australia) Limited and certain of its 
affiliates (Credit Suisse) as identified in the 
CP Contract. Credit Suisse would buy the 
CDIs in Australia and then convert the CDIs 
into shares (Converted Shares). The 
Company would then have an obligation  
to buy any Converted Shares from Credit 
Suisse up to a maximum amount.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 provides 
that a CP Contract must be approved by 
shareholders by special resolution. No 
Converted Shares were bought back by  
the Company during 201 2.
The maximum number of Converted  
Shares which could be bought back by  
the Company, together with the number of 
shares bought back by the Company under 
the authority to purchase its own shares set 
out above, is limited to 1 10,000,000, which 
represented under 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital at 26 February 2013. 
Shareholders will be asked to renew these 
authorities up to a limit of 1 10,000,000 
ordinary shares at the AGM on 1 May 2013.
Significant agreements
HGI Group Limited (a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company) repaid the 
outstanding £1 42,592,000 201 2 Notes on 
2 May 201 2 in accordance with the terms  
of their issue. Henderson UK Finance plc  
(a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) 
has in issue £150,000,000 201 6 Notes 
maturing on 24 March 201 6 and listed on 
the LSE. Condition 7 .3 of the terms and 
conditions of the 201 6 Notes gives each 
noteholder the option to require Henderson 
UK Finance plc to redeem or (at Henderson 
UK Finance plc’s option) to purchase that 
201 6 Note at its principal amount together 
with accrued interest in the event of a 
‘Change of Control’. A ‘Change of Control’ 
will be deemed to have occurred if any 
person or persons acting together come(s) 
to own more than 50% of the share capital 
of Henderson Group plc (or more than 50% 
of the voting rights attached to the share 
capital of Henderson Group plc) save  
in circumstances where the ultimate 
shareholders remain the same. In the event 
that 80% or more in the nominal amount of 
the 201 6 Notes then outstanding has been 
redeemed or purchased in accordance with 
this condition, Henderson UK Finance plc 
may redeem, at its option, the remaining 
201 6 Notes as a whole at their principal 
amount plus accrued interest.
On 15 January 2013, the Group cancelled  
its £75.0m revolving credit facility.
Independent auditors
Ernst & Y oung LLP have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and a 
resolution that they be reappointed will  
be proposed at the 2013 AGM.

executive reward strategy”
Report on Directors’ remuneration
Rewarding performance
Dear Shareholders,
As the newly appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee,  
I am pleased to present our 201 2 report on Directors’ remuneration 
for your approval at the Annual General Meeting on 1 May 2013 in 
the UK and Australia. 
The report is designed to provide you with information to 
demonstrate the link between the Group’s strategy, its performance 
and executive remuneration. 
This year, we have introduced a new format to the remuneration 
report. This includes disclosures on the levels of executive pay and 
the links between pay and business performance. 
We operate in an increasingly regulated and competitive pay 
environment which means it is essential that we strike the right 
balance on levels of executive pay and reporting. I have summarised 
the key points on remuneration in 201 2 on the next page. 
About the report
This report is in accordance with applicable legislation and corporate 
governance guidance in the UK, Australia and Jersey. With the 
majority of our shareholders in Australia and the UK, we have taken 
voluntary steps to improve the disclosure in this report.
Furthermore, in striving to comply with both UK and Australian 
legislation, this report includes:
 •
a description of the membership and role of the Group’s 
Remuneration Committee; 
 •
a summary of the remuneration policy of the Group including  
a statement of the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration; 
 •
details of the terms of the service agreements and the 
remuneration of each Director for the preceding financial year; 
 •
details of the share options and awards under long-term incentive 
schemes, held by the Directors; and 
 •
details of each Director’s interest in shares.
The report also meets the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority. It sets out how the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the ASX Principles relating to 
Directors’ remuneration are applied by the Group. In addition, it 
outlines our compliance with the FSA Code on Remuneration.

 See page 51 
Long-term incentives – share plans vesting
Awards made under the 2009 L TIP vested in full in April 201 2 
reflecting the Company’s TSR performance compared to companies 
in the FTSE All Share General Financial Services Index for the three 
years 2009 to 201 1.
Andrew Formica and Shirley Garrood chose not to exercise their 
awards that vested in April 201 2 and have until April 201 7 by which 
to do so. 
The 2010 L TIP awards made to Andrew Formica and Shirley 
Garrood, due to vest in March 2013 lapsed as the plan did not 
achieve the performance conditions. 
An RSP award made to Andrew Formica in March 2008 in his role 
as the Head of Equities and prior to his appointment to the Board 
and Chief Executive vested in March 201 2. The final tranche of the 
award vested fully having achieved the TSR performance hurdles. 
 See pages 50 and 51
Long-term incentives – new awards
New L TIP awards in the form of nil priced options were made to  
the Executive Directors in March 201 2. The eventual value of the 
award will depend on the Company’s performance during the years 
201 2 to 201 4 against the financial and non-financial measures in  
the scheme and the prevailing share price when any options are 
exercised. T ypically, we would expect about 42% of the award  
to vest.
 See page 51 
Shareholding interests
Executive Directors are required to maintain a personal target 
shareholding equivalent to 1 times their base salary. At the end  
of 201 2:
 •
Andrew Formica’s personal holding was equivalent to 19 times 
his base salary; and
 •
Shirley Garrood’s personal holding was equivalent to 5 times  
her base salary. 
Over and above their personal holding, they have interests in  
shares and options in the Company share plans as follows:
 •
Andrew Formica had interest in 5.07m shares; and 
 •
Shirley Garrood had interest in 2.09m shares.

Annual Report 201 2 Executive Directors’ remuneration
This section summarises the 201 2 remuneration for Andrew Formica 
and Shirley Garrood as Executive Directors throughout 201 2. The 
narrative includes details of the key elements of remuneration and  
a summary of total remuneration for 201 2.
Andrew Formica, Chief Executive
Base salary is reviewed annually, with reference to underlying Group 
and individual performance, global economic conditions and an 
assessment against relevant peer group pay and base salary 
budgets applying to the broader employee population. The Board 
determined that Andrew Formica’s base salary would remain 
unchanged in 2013.
In determining his discretionary short-term-incentive (STI) award for 
201 2, the Board considered a variety of factors such as his personal 
performance and leadership, achievement of objectives set by the 
Board, overall business results and the need to ensure his total 
remuneration is competitively placed against the market.
The following table details his 201 2 and 201 1 remuneration and 
shows the percentage change year on year. 
The Board awarded him a STI award of £900,000 which was 
subject to the Company’s mandatory deferral policy.
The Board also granted him 1,400,000 nil priced options under the 
201 2 L TIP. The aggregate market value of ordinary shares capable 
of being acquired at the date of award as a percentage of base pay 
was 460% (against a maximum of 500%). The eventual value of the 
award will depend on the performance of the plan over the plan 
performance period and the prevailing share price when the options 
are exercised.
Shirley Garrood, Chief Financial Officer
Base salary is reviewed annually, with reference to underlying  
Group and individual performance, global economic conditions  
and an assessment against relevant peer group pay and base salary 
budgets applying to the broader employee population. The Board 
determined that Shirley Garrood’s base salary would remain 
unchanged in 2013.
In determining her discretionary STI award for 201 2, the Chief 
Executive and Board considered a variety of factors such as her 
personal performance and leadership, achievement of objectives, 
overall business results and the need to ensure her total 
remuneration is competitively placed against the market. 
The following table details her 201 2 and 201 1 remuneration and 
shows the change year on year. 
The Board awarded her a STI award of £355,000 which was  
subject to the Company’s mandatory deferral policy. 
The Board also granted her 600,000 nil priced options under the 
201 2 L TIP. The aggregate market value of ordinary shares capable 
of being acquired at the date of award as a percentage of base pay 
was 230% (against a maximum of 300%). The eventual value of the 
award will depend on the performance of the plan over the plan 
performance period and the prevailing share price when the options 
are exercised.

 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
Chairman and other Non-Executive  
Directors’ remuneration
This section summarises the 201 2 remuneration for the Non-
Executive Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee and the other 
Non-Executive Directors and, for other Non-Executive Directors, is 
determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors, both on 
the basis of external independent advice. The Chairman and other 
Non-Executive Directors serve the Company under letters of 
appointment that are terminable by the Company on one month’s 
written notice without liability for remuneration; they do not have 
service agreements. 
It is the Company’s policy that the Chairman and other Non-
Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, 
incentive or pension schemes, nor are they entitled to any retirement 
benefits. Under their respective letters of appointment:
 •
the annual fee payable to each Non-Executive Director (other 
than the Chairman and the Audit, Remuneration and Board Risk 
Committee Chairmen) is £60,000, of which £5,000 is paid in the 
form of Company shares; 
 •
the annual additional fee payable to the Audit, Remuneration and 
Risk Committee Chairmen is £20,000, of which £5,000 is paid in 
the form of Company shares; 
 •
Rupert Pennant-Rea is Non-Executive Chairman of the Group. 
His fees are £180,000 per annum, of which £20,000 is paid in 
the form of Company shares; and 
 •
Tim How, the Senior Independent Director, is entitled to an 
additional fee of £10,000 per annum. 
The Chairman, together with the Executive Directors, determined  
in 201 1 that after the annual increase on 1 January 201 2, the 
Non-Executive Directors’ annual fee would next be reviewed in 2013 
with any change effective from 1 January 201 4. The annual fees for 
2013 will therefore remain unchanged. The additional fees for the 
Senior Independent Director and the Audit, Remuneration and Board 
Risk Committee Chairmen will also remain unchanged in 2013. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other 
Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) reviewed the fees 
payable to the Chairman and determined that they would remain 
unchanged at £180,000 per annum in 2013.
Richard Gillingwater joined the Group on 6 February 2013 as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman Designate of the Group.  
He will replace Rupert Pennant-Rea with effect from 1 May 2013. 
Until he takes up his Chairman appointment, he will receive fees  
in line with the Non-Executive Director base annual fee.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and approves, where 
appropriate, the Group’s remuneration plans and overall Human 
Resources (HR) policies and practices. Its duties are to:
 •
review and recommend to the Board the Group’s remuneration 
protocols and HR practices, which are performance based and 
aligned with the Group’s strategy and overall business objectives; 
 •
determine annually the remuneration of the Chairman, the  
Chief Executive and the ExCo; 
 •
approve the policy and terms of the Group’s employee and 
executive share incentive schemes; 
 •
approve the Group’s Remuneration Policy Statement and the 
remuneration terms and arrangements for Code Staff in 
accordance with the FSA Code on Remuneration; and 
 •
consider pay levels and employment conditions for all employees. 
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are 
available on our website. 
No Director or member of the ExCo is involved in any decision  
on their own remuneration.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. At the start of 201 2, it consisted of Gerald 
Aherne (Committee Chairman), Tim How and Kevin Dolan. In May 
201 2, Gerald Aherne stepped down, Tim How was appointed to the 
chair and Duncan Ferguson rejoined the Committee. Sarah Arkle, 
appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 5 September 201 2, joined 
the Committee on 1 6 October.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive may attend Committee 
meetings by invitation, save that they may not attend if their own 
remuneration is under consideration.
Meetings
The Remuneration Committee meets regularly and takes advice on  
a range of matters, including the scale and composition of the total 
executive remuneration package payable in comparable financial 
institutions to people with similar qualifications, skills and experience. 
In 201 2, the Committee also took advice on the development and 
forthcoming regulatory requirements in respect of the FSA Code on 
Remuneration, AIFMD and Department for Business Innovation & 
Skills to ascertain the impact on remuneration policies and practices. 
In 201 2, the Committee was supported by the Chief Financial 
Officer, the General Counsel, the Managing Director, Corporate 
Services and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). 
The Remuneration Committee Chairman and the Chief Executive 
make remuneration recommendations for the ExCo which reports  
to the Chief Executive. The Chairman is also consulted about the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met five times in 201 2. 
Role, membership and responsibilities of the 
Remuneration Committee
Advisers
During 201 2, the Remuneration Committee received advice  
from external, specialist consultants (T owers Watson, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Lane Clark & Peacock LLP)  
on technical aspects of remuneration. T owers Watson and PwC 
provided advice on a variety of remuneration matters and in 
particular the FSA Code on Remuneration and other regulatory 
matters. In addition, McLagan Partners also provide remuneration 
data and advice.
None of T owers Watson, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP or McLagan 
Partners has any connection with the Group other than to provide 
data and information on remuneration and on pension matters and 
developments. PwC provide other consultancy or specialist advice 
and services to the Group on an ad hoc basis and act as auditors  
to certain Henderson funds but have no other connection with  
the Group. The Committee appoints advisers following a panel  
selection process. 
Policy statement
Remuneration policy
The Committee views a successful remuneration policy as one  
that is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in  
the Group’s business environment and remuneration practice and, 
therefore, the Group’s policy is also subject to change.
We have established a remuneration framework, which is designed 
to be market competitive and motivate employees to improve 
individual and business performance, retain key employees and  
align employee actions with the interests of shareholders and  
clients. Our remuneration policies are also designed to address risk 
management and compliance issues. The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion and authority to make recommendations on matters 
of remuneration where they consider it appropriate to do so 
especially relating to Code Staff. 
Our remuneration framework is based on a total reward approach 
designed to deliver top quartile pay for top performance. There are 
three key components:
 •
base salary – paid within appropriate market range; 
 •
annual bonus – paid under a short-term incentive plan where 
individuals have the opportunity to receive a bonus (of which  
a substantial portion above a specified threshold is deferred  
over three years) based on business and individual performance 
against targets; and 
 •
long-term incentives – performance based for senior executives 
and certain professionals such as senior fund managers and key 
distribution personnel which typically vest over three to five years.

Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
We also considered guidelines from the regulators and government 
on executive pay and remuneration and HR practices including 
diversity and gender. As a result, the Group has implemented several 
changes that strengthen the link between its remuneration policies 
and HR practice and the increased focus on corporate remuneration 
governance, these being:
 •
a Group Remuneration Policy Statement that sets out the Group’s 
remuneration policies and practice; 
 •
the introduction of risk assessment factors into our key reward 
processes through liaison with the CRO, the Board Risk 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee when awards  
are made and vest; 
 •
new rules for the Group’s share plans to provide the 
Remuneration Committee with the authority to vary or lapse 
individual unvested awards in cases of poor risk management  
or where results have been misstated or where there has been 
serious misconduct. The Committee also has the ability to claw 
back shares vested under long-term incentive plans e.g. in the 
case of serious personal misconduct; 
 •
the introduction of non-financial objectives and risk measures 
into the key remuneration policies and the annual employee 
appraisal processes. In particular, the Long-T erm Incentive Plans 
(L TIPs) contain a risk and sustainability measure alongside the 
relative TSR measure; and 
 •
processes that enable the Remuneration Committee to identify 
and regularly monitor all Code Staff in respect of reward, risk 
management, compulsory deferral and annual appraisals.
Total shareholder return performance
The graph to the left shows the Company’s share price performance 
compared to the movement in the FTSE 350 General Financial 
Services Index. This index was selected as the most appropriate  
index for the Group. The share price in 201 2 ranged from a low  
of 90.55 pence on 24 July 201 2, a peak of 132.70 pence on 19 
December 201 2 and closed at 132.30 pence on 31 December 201 2.
Executive Directors’ remuneration individual elements 
Executive Directors’ remuneration comprises:
 •
base salary; 
 •
annual bonus; 
 •
pension benefits; 
 •
benefits in kind; and 
 •
participation in certain Group-wide incentive schemes, such as 
L TIP, the Restricted Share Plan (RSP), the Sharesave scheme 
(SAYE), the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP), the Buy As 
Y ou Earn Share Plan (BAYE) and the Deferred Equity Plan (DEP).
The L TIP and the annual bonus are performance related and these 
are key elements in the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages. 
The SAYE is available to all UK and US employees and is not 
performance related. Awards to Executive Directors can be made 
under the RSP and may be subject to performance conditions. The 
ESOP is a performance-driven voluntary deferral plan available to all 
employees but is not operated every year.
For target levels of performance, at least 60% of total remuneration 
(excluding pension) should be performance related. The expected 
value of awards made under the L TIP was calculated by T owers 
Watson, using a proprietary methodology. Its methodology considers 
TSR rank at which payment begins, the payment level at this 
threshold, the maximum payment under the plan and the rank at 
which this maximum is achieved. The methodology also takes into 
account the correlation of the Company’s share price with those 
companies in its peer group, starting from the premise that the  
value of the shares awarded at the end of the performance period  
is correlated with the TSR ranking. The Committee is satisfied that  
the overall structure is a well-considered set of arrangements for  
the Executive Directors’ remuneration. It is kept under review to  
take account of changing circumstances. Incentive payments are  
not taken into account when determining Company pension 
contributions for Executive Directors.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually, with reference to underlying Group 
and individual performance, global economic conditions and an 
assessment against relevant peer group pay and base salary 
budgets applying to the broader employee population.
Annual bonus
At the discretion of the Committee, each Executive Director may 
receive a bonus subject to achieving performance targets set  
by the Committee. Payment of bonuses (if any) will be made to  
the Executive Directors annually, in March, on condition that 
performance targets were met in the preceding calendar year.  
The Committee has the flexibility to take into account other factors  
in determining any bonus. The bonus award is subject to the 
Company’s mandatory deferral policy. The cash element (post 
deferral) is paid in March payroll and subject to statutory deductions. 
The bonus range is zero to a specified maximum. The maximum 
bonus entitlement is based on a percentage of annual base salary. 
The maximum entitlements for 201 2 performance were 600%  
of salary for the Chief Executive (201 1: 600%) and 200% for the  
Chief Financial Officer (201 1: 200%). 
Each element of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is supported 
by the achievement of key business and performance measures.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements For the Executive Directors, the corporate performance targets 
relate to Group performance measures as set out in the table.  
The Group’s performance measure in 201 2 was predominantly 
underlying pre-tax profit. However, operating margins, net fund  
flows, return on equity and investment performance were also 
factored in. Also considered were a number of non-financial 
measures as set out in the notes to the table and a report from  
the CRO on risk management. 
The Committee and the Board review the performance of each 
Executive Director on an annual basis against these targets and 
guidance from the FSA in its Code on Remuneration. The 
Committee determined that annual bonuses for Executive Directors 
should continue to be subject to substantial deferral (which also 
applies to all Code Staff).

In 2012, the Committee agreed to consider, in particular, certain non-financial measures:
•	 potential external and/or reputational issues arising from regulatory issues, including an adverse report from, or financial penalty imposed by, the FSA, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Monetary Authority of Singapore or other regulator, an adverse report from Ernst & Young relating to the Group’s Annual Audit or reputational 
risk, other than those included above; and 
•	 operational risk and internal controls: the cost of any error deals in the year, together with a failure to satisfactorily close actions relating to any incidents; the number  
of serious issues identified by Internal Audit, combined with a failure to close related actions within agreed timescales or non-adherence to internal procedures i.e. 
Group-wide compulsory training (such as TCF and market abuse) or control sign-offs not completed on time.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Long-term incentives
Under the L TIP, the Committee may make awards to Executive 
Directors up to a maximum number of ordinary shares determined by 
the Committee at the date of grant. Full vesting of awards is over a 
three to five year period and is conditional upon the achievement of 
a performance target and risk and sustainability metrics, measured 
over a three year period, and the Executive Directors’ continued 
employment during the performance period. The primary 
performance measure is relative TSR against a comparator group 
and the Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s TSR 
performance reasonably reflects its underlying financial performance 
over the performance period. For 201 2 and future awards, the 
performance measures comprise 95% relative to TSR and 5% on 
non-financial (risk and sustainability). In addition, the Committee has 
the power to vary or lapse individual unvested awards in cases of 
poor risk management or where results have been misstated or 
where there has been serious misconduct. The Committee also has 
the ability in certain cases to claw back vested awards. In 
determining the 5%, the Committee will take account of the 
non-financial metrics in the annual bonus scheme along with  
a report from the CRO which will cover an assessment of risk 
awareness and culture in the Company over the L TIP period. 
The Group made awards under the L TIP to Andrew Formica, Shirley 
Garrood, James Darkins and David Jacob on 5 March 201 2. The 
market value of the ordinary shares capable of being acquired under 
these awards at the date of award was equivalent to 460%, 230%, 
246% and 230% of base salary, respectively. The maximum award 
for Andrew Formica was 500% of base pay and 300% for other 
Executive Directors. The Committee will consider awards under the 
L TIP to the Executive Directors in 2013.

 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements Shareholder alignment
We align the interests of our executives and shareholders in two  
key ways. Over time, each Executive Director is required to maintain 
a personal target shareholding equivalent to 100% (1 times) of  
base salary. In 201 2, each Executive Director achieved this target. 
The table below shows the financial value of the personal holding  
of each Executive Director and as a multiple of base salary at

All-employee Group share schemes 
The SAYE, a savings related share option scheme, is available  
to all UK employees. It operates within specific UK tax legislation 
(including a requirement to finance the exercise of the option using 
the proceeds of a monthly savings contract of up to £250 per 
month) and exercise of the option is not subject to satisfaction of a 
performance target since this is an all-employee scheme. Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE on the same terms 
as other employees. There is a similar plan for US employees.
The BAYE, available to all UK employees, is a scheme that operates 
within specific UK tax legislation, (limited to a maximum contribution 
of £1,500 per annum). The BAYE represents an opportunity for 
employees to increase their share ownership in the Company,  
which is an important tool in attracting and retaining staff. The  
BAYE enables participants to acquire shares via deductions from 
gross monthly salary (or a one-off lump sum payment), for which  
the Company provides two free matching shares for every one 
purchased. The BAYE also allows for limited annual awards of free 
shares up to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) (UK tax authority) 
limits. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the BAYE. 
There are similar plans for employees outside the UK (except for 
China and India).
The ESOP, offered in February 201 1, provided an opportunity for 
eligible employees to increase their ownership in the Group. 
Employees were able to purchase Company shares up to a set  
limit through the DEP and, subject to achievement of prescribed 
TSR and Company share price performance hurdles and continued 
employment over a specified period, the Company will provide 
matching shares for each share purchased. The Company did not 
offer the plan in 201 2 and does not intend to offer the plan in 2013. 
Where employees are subject to the mandatory deferral of a portion 
of their annual bonus, the deferred amount is used to purchase the 
Company’s shares or Henderson products in the DEP. The deferred 
shares/products are held in trust during the deferral period, three 
years, and are subject to forfeiture conditions. 
Deferral into Company shares in 201 2 attracted a matching share 
element. For every three Company shares deferred and held in  
the DEP trust for the full three year deferral period, employees will 
receive one free matching share when the deferred shares vest. 
Under the DEP rules, Executive Directors are not eligible to receive 
matching shares. 
The Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) is a global plan that 
provides employees with an opportunity to buy shares after three 
years at an option price fixed at the start of the plan. Under the 
CSOP, an employee may receive one or several awards of share 
options. As a global plan, the tax treatment for this plan can vary by 
country and tax jurisdiction but in the UK an employee’s CSOP is 
limited to £30,000 in aggregate of all unexercised options. Executive 
Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP, but can retain 
any awards made before their appointment.
The Executive Shared Ownership Plan (ExSOP) encourages 
employee share ownership at middle management level. Under the 
ExSOP, selected employees are invited to acquire, jointly with an 
employee benefit trust (Co-Owner) and under the terms of a joint 
ownership agreement, a restricted beneficial interest in a given 
number of shares in the Company. When the jointly owned shares 
are sold, after at least three years, the participant receives the 
growth in the value of the shares and the Co-Owner retains the 
original value of the shares. Executive Directors are excluded from 
participating in the ExSOP. 
All Group share awards can be funded by share issuance except  
for the DEP and an element of the BAYE which is made through 
on-market purchases. All awards to Executive Directors are satisfied 
by on-market purchases.
The Group’s share plans rules currently restrict the level of shares 
that may be issued to satisfy share plan vesting to 10% of the issued 
share capital of the Company over a 10 year rolling period. This 
excludes up to 1 6m ESOP shares which are outside this limit. 
Executive plans are restricted to 5%. 
There are three resolutions for shareholder approval at the 2013 
AGM in respect of specific changes to the Group’s CSOP and BAYE 
share scheme dilution limits and authority to amend each share plan 
to ensure consistency of plan dilution limits.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2 Pensions
Retirement benefits are designed to be both market competitive  
and cost effective. HGI Group Limited is the sponsoring employer  
of HGPS, which has both a defined benefit section (closed to new 
members) and a defined contribution section. No active members  
of the defined benefit section of HGPS receive unapproved pension 
benefits in addition to their normal scheme benefits. In the UK 
scheme, the Group replaced the statutory earnings cap which was 
abolished on 6 April 2006 by the Finance Act 2004 with an internal 
scheme earnings cap, which is broadly the same as the previous 
statutory figure adjusted for inflation. The annual scheme earnings 
cap in 201 2 was £135,61 2 (201 1: £1 28,41 2).
The Executive Directors participate in the non-contributory section  
of HGPS providing benefits on a defined contribution basis on the 
same age related basis as other employees. Andrew Formica 
receives a Group contribution, currently 10.5% of base salary, into 
the pension plan limited by the operation of the scheme earnings 
cap and Shirley Garrood receives 1 1.5%, again limited by the 
operation of the scheme earnings cap. 
The Group operates a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) that 
allows UK employees to make voluntary contributions into a wide 
range of funds as well as giving them the ability to transfer Company 
shares from maturing share plans into the SIPP in a tax effective 
manner. The Group rebates some of the national insurance savings 
to employees’ SIPP accounts. 
The Group also has pension arrangements in place for  
its non-UK-based employees, which are in line with local  
market practice.
Benefits and benefits in kind
The Executive Directors are contractually entitled to a lump-sum life 
assurance benefit of four times base salary and private healthcare 
medical insurance. In addition, the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer are entitled to permanent health insurance.
The Executive Directors also benefit from indemnity arrangements  
in respect of their services as Directors, and Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance, under separate Deeds of Indemnity. Further details 
can be found in the Directors’ report. 
Contracts and termination provisions
The Group’s policy is to employ Executive Directors on annual rolling 
contracts although, in exceptional circumstances on recruitment, 
longer initial terms may be approved by the Committee. T o date, it 
has not exercised this power. The Committee will, consistent with the 
best interests of the Group, seek to minimise termination payments.
The Executive Directors have service agreements terminable  
on not less than 1 2 months’ written notice by the Group or on not less 
than six months’ written notice by the relevant Executive Director.
The dates of appointment (and resignation if applicable) of the 
Executive Directors are:
Andrew Formica – 05/1 1/2008
Shirley Garrood – 26/08/2009
James Darkins and David Jacob were appointed on 04/05/201 1 
and resigned on 1 2/1 2/201 2 as Executive Directors but remain 
employed as executives.
The Executive Directors’ service agreements allow the Group  
to suspend Executive Directors from their duties at any time after 
notice has been given by either party, provided they continue to 
receive full pay. Under certain circumstances (such as serious 
misconduct), the Group may terminate employment immediately  
with no liability to make any further payment (other than amounts 
accrued to the date of termination).
The Executive Directors’ service agreements have no provisions  
for remuneration payable on early termination. In relation to  
their participation in long-term incentive related pay, Executive 
Directors are subject to the same L TIP rules as other participants.

Notes
•	 Under the SAYE, after 36 monthly contributions of up to £250, SAYE participants may exercise their options to acquire Company shares at a pre-defined issue price  
set at a 20% discount to the closing mid-market value on a pre-defined date. The vested SAYE for Andrew Formica and Shirley Garrood in 2012 relates to options 
awarded under the 2009 SAYE that vested and exercised at 94.5p per share (option price was 58.2p). The SAYE awarded relates to options awarded under the  
2012 scheme for which the scheme option price is 92.43p.
•	 Awards made under the L TIP are in the form of nil priced options. The 2008 L TIP vested in March 201 1. The awards for Andrew Formica (175,000) and  
Shirley Garrood (175,000) were exercised in 2012 at 120.16p per share. The award for James Darkins (vested prior to his appointment as an Executive Director)  
but has not yet been exercised.
•	 The 2009 L TIP fully vested in April 2012. Andrew Formica, Shirley Garrood and James Darkins chose not to exercise their awards and these are included in the L TIP 
vested but not exercised figures at 31 December 2012 or date of resignation. David Jacob’s award was automatically exercised due to his US citizen status under the 
rules of the plan.
•	 Maximum unvested L TIP award – this number reflects the number of shares that could vest in the future plus awards that have vested but have not been exercised. 
However, the expected level of achievement of the TSR performance target at the time of award is 42% of the maximum award. 
•	 The adjusted maximum unvested L TIP award reflects the 2010 L TIP which is not vesting and thus reduces the maximum unvested L TIP award amount.
•	 The 2009 CSOP options awarded to Shirley Garrood, James Darkins and David Jacob were in respect of previous roles prior to their appointment as Executive 
Directors. The awards vested in 2012 but have not yet been exercised. The option price is 72.6p.
•	 The final tranche of Andrew Formica’s RSP award (awarded in March 2008) having met the plan performance conditions fully vested at 120.16p per share. The second 
tranche of David Jacob’s RSP award (awarded in October 2008) did not fully achieve the performance conditions. Consequently, 75% of the award vested at 125.10p 
and the remaining 25% lapsed.

Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements FSA Code on Remuneration 
The FSA implemented its new Code on Remuneration (Code) with 
effect from 1 January 201 1. Under the Code, the Remuneration 
Committee must report annually on the remuneration policy and 
practice for employees termed Code Staff. Code Staff are 
“employees who perform a significant influence function, senior 
management and risk takers whose professional activities could 
have a material impact on a firm’s risk profile”. 
Code Staff are defined with reference to managerial responsibility  
to influence the firm’s overall risk profile. At the discretion of the 
Committee, other employees may be included as Code Staff if  
the Committee consider that their role has a material impact on  
the firm’s risk profile. An annual review of the firm’s risk profile  
is conducted in order to allow the Remuneration Committee to 
determine the Code Staff population. The Committee also takes 
advice from the CRO and Chairman of the Board Risk Committee.
Henderson Group’s Code Staff are defined as the Executive 
Directors, other members of the ExCo and other employees 
performing FSA Significant Influence Functions (SIFs). 
As at 31 December 201 2, 18 employees were identified as being 
Code Staff whose roles are:
 •
Executive Directors (Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer); 
 •
other ExCo members (Managing Director Corporate Services, 
Chief Risk Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Managing 
Director Investment Management, Managing Director Property 
and Head of Global Distribution); and 
 •
SIFs (General Counsel, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Investment 
Officer Property, Managing Director Private Equity and the  
Heads of Equities, Fixed Income, Internal Audit, Compliance, Asia,  
North America and Group Finance).
The aggregate annual remuneration of the Code Staff in 201 2  
was £1 6.7m (201 1: £20.2m). This is made up of fixed pay, variable 
pay, non-contributory pension and benefits in kind and share plan 
related remuneration. 
The structure of the remuneration packages for Code Staff is 
designed to support the achievement of the same key measures  
as for Executive Directors (as set out on page 56) and to ensure  
that Code Staff pay complies with the Board’s remuneration policy 
(as described on pages 53 to 55).
The chart gives more detail on the aggregate remuneration.  
Fixed pay comprises annual base salary. Variable pay comprises 
discretionary annual bonus and performance fees. Pension and 
benefits comprises company employer pension contribution and 
benefits in kind. Share-based remuneration comprises the gross 
gain (before tax and social security) on executive and employee 
share plans awarded in previous years that vested and were 
exercised in 201 2 and in addition, the value of dividends paid on 
share plans whilst under trust. A fuller description of annual 
remuneration is shown on pages 55 to 59. 
In line with the Company’s mandatory deferral policy, 40% of 
short-term incentive awards i.e. annual bonus awards and 
performance fee awards over a defined threshold, is deferred.
The Group’s deferral policy on short and long-term incentives fully 
complies with the requirements for Tier 3 firms (previously Tier 4 
before the FSA collapsed the Tiers 3 and 4 into one tier) as set out 
in the Code.
Executive long-term incentive awards made to Code Staff in 201 2 
totalled £3.2m. This represents the expected value of awards at 
vesting, over the next three to five years, dependent upon the 
achievement of performance hurdles. 
Code Staff can elect within the scheme rules to defer the exercise of 
executive share plan awards once they have vested. This means that 
the share related element of their aggregate remuneration could 
significantly vary year by year.
The report on Director’s remuneration sets out the Remuneration 
Committee’s responsibilities and the remuneration policy in respect 
of Code Staff. 
Additionally, the remuneration of the CRO and the Head of Internal 
Audit is determined by the Chairman of the Board Risk and Audit 
Committees respectively. These Committees also review and 
oversee remuneration paid to other senior employees in risk and 
assurance functions.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
in relation to the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with Jersey law which show a true  
and fair view in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and 
Company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
and Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows. In preparing the Group and Company financial statements,  
the Directors are also required to:
 •
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 •
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable;
 •
present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 •
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s and Company’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 •
state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRS, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets, and for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 •
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Group and Company  
for the year ended 31 December 2012;
 •
the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
 •
the accounting records have been properly maintained.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website, www.henderson.com. Legislation in Jersey governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Henderson Group plc 
We have audited the Consolidated and Company financial 
statements of Henderson Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2012, which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows (the Group), the Company Income Statement, the 
Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Company 
Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and  
the related notes 1 to 35 (the financial statements). The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Article 1 13A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we  
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 63, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the Group and Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
 •
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s 
profit and the Company’s loss for the year then ended; 
 •
have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union; and
 •
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 •
proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 •
the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 •
we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 •
the part of the Governance statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for our review.

Financial statements continued Notes to the Financial Statements
Group and Company
1.  Authorisation of financial statements and 
statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 201 2 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 26 February 2013 and the respective Statements of 
Financial Position were signed on the Board’s behalf by the Chairman, 
Rupert Pennant-Rea. Henderson Group plc is a public limited company 
incorporated in Jersey, and from 1 2 December 201 2, tax resident in the 
United Kingdom (formerly tax resident in the Republic of Ireland). 
The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the LSE and CDIs are 
traded on the ASX. 
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union and the 
provisions of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
2. Accounting policies 
2.1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis, except for 
certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. 
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in GBP 
and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 
pounds (£0.1m), except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the 
financial statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries as 
at 31 December each year. 
The financial statements of all the Group’s significant subsidiaries 
are prepared to the same year end date as that of the Company. The 
accounts of all material subsidiaries are prepared under either IFRS 
or local GAAP. Where prepared under local GAAP, balances reported 
by subsidiaries are adjusted to meet IFRS requirements for the 
purpose of the consolidated financial statements.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the 
effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group 
obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that 
the control ceases. Non-controlling interests represent the equity 
interests in subsidiaries not wholly held by the Group.
Interests in property closed-ended funds, private equity 
infrastructure funds, Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) 
and unit trusts are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates, joint 
ventures or other financial investments depending on the holdings 
of the Group and on the level of influence and control that the 
Group exercises. The Group’s investment in associates, where the 
Group has the ability to exercise significant influence as well as joint 
ventures where there is joint control, are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting.
Income recognition
Fee income and commissions receivable
Fee income includes management fees, transaction fees and 
performance fees (including earned carried interest). Management 
fees and transaction fees are recognised in the accounting period in 
which the associated investment management or transaction 
services are provided. Performance fees are recognised when the 
prescribed performance hurdles have been achieved and it is 
probable that the fee will crystallise as a result. The Group accrues 
the expected fee on satisfaction that the recognition criteria have 
established a performance fee is due. Initial fees and commissions 
receivable are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period 
in which services will be provided, determined by reference to the 
average term of investment in each product on which initial fees 
and commissions are earned. Other income is recognised in the 
accounting period in which services are rendered.
Carried interest
The Group is entitled to receive a share of profits (carried interest) 
from certain private equity funds it manages, once the funds meet 
certain performance conditions. Where the funds’ investments 
represents a large volume of the shares traded in relatively illiquid 
markets, the Group does not deem it appropriate to recognise 
unearned carried interest based on current fair values. However, 
where the value of the carried interest will be determined by the 
future disposal of investments which are quoted on a recognised 
exchange, then the Group will recognise carried interest to the 
extent deemed prudent. Carried interest for all other types of 
investments is only recognised when investments are disposed of 
and performance conditions are met.
Finance income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest 
rate method. Dividend income from investments is recognised on the 
date that the right to receive payment has been established.
Post-employment benefits
The Group provides employees with retirement benefits through 
both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. The assets 
of these schemes are held separately, from the Group’s general 
assets, in trustee administered funds. 
Defined benefit obligations and the cost of providing benefits are 
determined annually by independent qualified actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The obligation is measured as the 
present value of the estimated future cash outflows using a discount 
rate based on AA rated corporate bond yields of appropriate 
duration. The resulting surplus or deficit of defined benefit assets 
less liabilities is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, net of any taxes that would be deducted at 
source. The Group’s expense related to these schemes is accrued 
over the employees’ service lives, based upon the actuarial cost for 
the accounting period, having considered interest costs and the 
expected return on assets. Actuarial gains and losses, to the extent 
these are recognised, are included in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the accounting period in which they occur, 
net of any taxes that would be deducted at source. Normal 
contributions to the defined contribution scheme are expensed in 
the Consolidated Income Statement as they become payable in 
accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Other post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life 
insurance, are also provided for certain employees. The costs of such 
benefits are accrued over the employees’ service lives, based upon 
the actuarial cost for the accounting period using a methodology 
similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. The valuation methodology, assumptions and schemes 
are disclosed in note 10.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements 2. Accounting policies continued
2.1  Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions continued 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value 
of the equity instruments at the grant date. The awards are expensed, 
with a corresponding increase in reserves, on either a straight-line 
basis or a graded basis (depending on vesting conditions) over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. Based on the Group’s estimate, the expected life of 
the awards used in the determination of fair value is adjusted for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, market 
performance and behavioural considerations.
Income taxes
The Group provides for current tax expense according to the tax laws 
of each jurisdiction in which it operates, using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assetsand 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognised if they arise from goodwill; however,  
they are recognised on separately identified intangible assets. If the 
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time 
of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss, it is not accounted for. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for taxable differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint 
ventures where the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and where the reversal of the temporary 
differences is not anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based 
on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income is also recognised in that 
statement and not in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Sales taxes
Assets and expenses are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, 
except where the sales tax is not recoverable, in which case the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of expenses. Receivables and payables are stated with the 
amount of sales tax included. The net amount of sales tax recoverable 
from, or payable to, the tax authority, is included within receivables or 
payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is GBP. Transactions in 
foreign currencies are recorded at the appropriate exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary 
balances at the reporting date are converted at the prevailing 
exchange rate. Foreign currency non-monetary balances carried at 
fair value or cost are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value or cost is determined. Gains and losses arising 
on retranslation are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, 
except for available-for-sale financial assets where the unhedged 
changes in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations whose functional currency is not GBP are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and 
expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the 
accounting period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken 
through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income to 
the translation reserve. In the period in which an operation is 
disposed of, translation differences are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Business combinations
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, all 
business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method (acquisition accounting). The cost of a business combination 
is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued 
by the acquirer. The fair value of a business combination is 
calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy  
the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date. The 
acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains 
control of the acquiree. The cost of a business combination in excess 
of fair value of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including 
intangible assets identified, is recognised as goodwill. Any costs 
incurred in relation to a business combination after 1 July 2009  
are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position. Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 
January 2004 is carried at its value on 1 January 2004 less any 
subsequent impairments. 
Goodwill arising on investments in associates and joint ventures is 
included within the carrying value of the equity accounted investments.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired. For this purpose, management prepares a valuation for 
each cash generating unit based on value in use. This valuation is 
based on the approved forecasts for future years, extrapolated for 
expected future growth rates and discounted at a risk adjusted 
discount rate based on the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost 
of capital. Where the value in use is less than the carrying amount, 
an impairment is recognised. Where goodwill forms part of an entity 
or sub-group and the entity or sub-group or part thereof is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the entity or sub-group disposed of 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining 
the gain or loss on disposal. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately through the Consolidated Income Statement and 
cannot subsequently be reversed.
Notes to the Financial Statements
Group and Company continued

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
Financial statements continued Investment management contracts
Investment management contracts have been identified as a 
separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Intangible assets are recognised at the present value, 
as at the date of acquisition, of the expected future cash flows of the 
investment management contracts acquired. The intangible asset is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the 
investment management contracts, currently estimated at between 
three and eight years.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments by the Company in subsidiary undertakings are held at 
cost less any impairment where circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Equity accounted investments
Equity accounted investments comprise investments in associates 
and joint ventures held by the Group. Investments are recognised 
initially at cost. The investments are subsequently carried at cost 
adjusted for the Group’s share of profits or losses and other changes 
in comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, less any 
dividends or distributions received by the Group. The Consolidated 
Income Statement includes the Group’s share of profits or losses 
after tax for the year, or period of ownership, if shorter.
Deferred acquisition and commission costs
Incremental acquisition costs incurred in obtaining investment 
management business are deferred to the extent that they are 
recoverable out of future income. This includes initial commission 
paid by the Group in respect of certain investment products. These 
costs are amortised over the period in which they are expected to be 
recovered from matching revenues from related contracts. At the 
end of each accounting period, deferred acquisition and commission 
costs are reviewed for recoverability against future revenues from 
the related contracts in force at the reporting date.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill and 
financial assets)
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable 
amount, being the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell, 
and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their net present value using a risk 
adjusted discount rate based on the Group’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes party to 
the contractual provisions of an instrument, at fair value adjusted 
for transaction costs except for financial assets classified at fair 
value through profit or loss, where transaction costs are 
immediately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from the investments have expired or where they have been 
transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities cease to be 
recognised when the obligation under the liability has been 
discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised at the trade 
date, being the date when the purchase or sale becomes contractually 
due for settlement. Delivery and settlement terms are usually 
determined by established practices in the market concerned.
Debt securities, equity securities and holdings in authorised 
collective investment schemes are designated as either fair value 
through profit or loss, or available-for-sale, and are measured at 
subsequent reporting dates at fair value. The Group determines the 
classification of its financial assets on initial recognition. Financial 
assets classified as fair value through profit or loss comprise the 
Group’s manager box positions in OEICs and unit trusts and 
investments in the Group’s fund products on behalf of employee 
benefit trusts. Where securities are designated as fair value through 
profit or loss, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
included in the Consolidated Income Statement. Where investments 
in the Group’s fund products are held against outstanding deferred 
compensation liabilities, any movement in the fair value of these 
assets will be offset by a corresponding movement in the deferred 
compensation liability in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value which are not part of a designated hedge 
relationship are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. When an asset is disposed of, the 
cumulative changes in fair value, previously recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, are taken to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the current accounting period.
Unrealised gains and losses on financial assets represent the 
difference between the fair value of financial assets at the reporting 
date and cost or, if these have been previously revalued, the fair 
value at the last reporting date. Realised gains and losses on 
financial assets are calculated as the difference between the net 
sale proceeds and cost or amortised cost. 
Where a fall in the value of an investment is prolonged or significant, 
this is considered an indication of impairment. In such an event, the 
investment is written down to fair value and the amounts previously 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in respect of cumulative changes in fair value, are taken to 
the Consolidated Income Statement as an impairment charge.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day payment terms, are 
initially recognised at fair value, normally equivalent to the invoice 
amount. When the time value of money is material, the fair value is 
discounted. Provision for specific doubtful debts is made when 
there is evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances 
in full. Balances are written off when the receivable amount is 
deemed irrecoverable.
Cash amounts represent cash in hand and on-demand deposits. 
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid government securities 
or investments in money market instruments with a maturity date of 
three months or less.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
A financial liability ceases to be recognised when the obligation 
under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.

Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
 Overview P e rfo rma nce Gover n anc e Financial statements 2. Accounting policies continued
2.1  Significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group may, from time to time, use derivative financial instruments 
to hedge against price, interest rate, foreign currency and credit risk. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as financial assets 
when the fair value is positive or as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. 
At the inception of a hedge, the Group formally designates and 
documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to 
apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are expected to 
be effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value and are 
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been 
effective throughout the reporting periods for which they were 
designated and are expected to remain effective over the  
remaining hedge period.
Currency hedges
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge the currency 
nominal value of certain euro and US dollar denominated available-
for-sale financial assets and are classified as fair value hedges. The 
change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. The change in the fair value of the 
hedged item, attributable to the risk being hedged, is also recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement, offsetting the fair value 
changes arising on the designated hedge instrument.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets 
(such as publicly traded securities and derivatives) is based on 
quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market 
price used for financial instruments is the current bid price. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an 
active market is determined using valuation techniques commonly 
used by market participants, including the use of comparable 
recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis 
and option pricing models.
Provisions
Provisions which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, are 
recognised when: the Group has a present obligation, legal or 
constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation. In the event that the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a discount rate that reflects a current market assessment of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting, the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as a finance charge.
Equity shares
The Company’s ordinary equity shares of 1 2.5 pence each are 
classified as equity instruments. Equity shares issued by the 
Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received or 
the market price on the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of tax, 
are deducted from equity through share premium. When share 
capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Own shares held
Own shares held are equity shares of the Company acquired by or 
issued to employee benefit trusts. Own shares held are recorded at 
cost and are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement on the purchase, issue, sale or 
cancellation of the Company’s own equity shares. 
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are paid 
and, in the case of final dividends, when these are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders at the AGM. Dividend distributions are 
recognised in equity.
2.2  Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made significant judgements involving estimations 
and assumptions which are summarised below:
Impairment of intangible assets
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if 
there are indicators that the carrying value may be impaired.
Investment management contracts are reviewed for impairment 
annually or more frequently if there are indications that the carrying 
value is impaired. 
The judgement exercised by management in arriving at these 
valuations includes the selection of market growth rates, fund flow 
assumptions, expected margins and costs. Further details are given 
in note 13.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled share schemes at fair 
value at the date of grant and expenses them over the vesting period 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Consolidation of seed investments
From time to time, the Group invests seed capital on the launch of 
products, such as UCITS, SICAVs, hedge funds, property and private 
equity funds and other investment vehicles. The seed capital 
investments vary in duration depending on the nature of the 
investment, with a typical range of less than one year for equity and 
fixed income products and between three and seven years for 
private equity and property funds. Given the limited size and nature 
of these investments, the Group does not consider itself to have 
significant influence or control over the underlying funds to warrant 
accounting for them using the equity method or consolidating them 
into the Group’s financial statements.
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are reviewed for impairment at 
each reporting date or more frequently if there are indicators that the 
carrying value is impaired. In specific cases, where a quoted market 
price or fair value is not available, significant judgement is exercised 
by management in determining the extent of impairment, taking into 
account other available market data. Management also exercises 
judgement in determining whether a decrease in the value of an 
asset meets the prolonged or significant tests.
Notes to the Financial Statements
Group and Company continued
76
Henderson Group
Annual Report 201 2
Financial statements continued Pension and other post-employment benefits
The costs of, and period end obligations under, defined benefit 
pension schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The 
actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount 
rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term 
nature of these schemes, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. Further details are given in note 21.
Provisions
By their nature, provisions often reflect significant levels of 
judgement or estimates by management. The nature and amount of 
the provisions included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position are detailed in note 22 and contingencies not provided for 
are disclosed in note 32. 
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. Significant judgement is 
required by management in determining the amount of deferred tax 
assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level 
of future taxable profits.
2.3 Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in this Annual Report and Accounts 
are consistent with those of the previous financial year. The Group 
has also adopted any IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective 
for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 
January 201 2. There were no new standards effective for the current 
year which had a material impact on the Group.
2.4  Future changes in accounting policies
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013. The following new standards are not applicable to 
these financial statements but are expected to have an impact when 
they become effective. The Group plans to apply these standards in 
the reporting period in which they become effective. 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires items in other 
comprehensive income to be grouped based on whether they are 
potentially reclassifiable to the income statement. This amendment 
has a mandatory effective date in 2013.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits replaces interest costs and expected 
return on plan assets with a net interest cost that is calculated by 
applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability. 
This revision has a mandatory effective date in 2013. The expected 
impact of adoption is disclosed in note 34.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements defines the principle of 
control, and establishes control as the basis for consolidation in the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements. This standard has a 
mandatory effective date in 201 4. 
IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements states that when deciding how to 
account for joint ventures, the focus is on rights and obligations. This 
standard has a mandatory effective date in 201 4.
IFRS 1 2 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities includes the 
disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, 
such as joint arrangements, associates and other off balance sheet 
vehicles. This standard has a mandatory effective date in 201 4.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments proposes revised measurement and 
classification criteria for financial assets. This standard has a 
mandatory effective date in 2015. 
Unless stated above, the Group is assessing the impact of the above 
standards on the Group’s future financial statements.

Net recognition of Henderson PFI Secondary Fund II L.P. (Fund II) fees
Net management fees of £26.6m relating to Fund II have been recognised based on the resolution of matters in dispute between certain 
claimants who were investors in Fund II and the general partner of Fund II, Henderson Equity Partners (GP) Limited, and the manager of 
Fund II, Henderson Equity Partners Limited.
Restructuring costs
The Group has reorganised to simplify certain parts of its business and reduced headcount to lower staff costs, incurring restructuring costs 
of £9.1m.
Additional FSCS 2010/2011 levy
The FSCS have increased the one-off levy in relation to 2010/201 1 resulting in the Group recognising an additional charge of £2.5m. 
Gartmore void property provision
The Group has increased the void property provision, recognised on the acquisition of Gartmore, by £1.2m due to lower occupancy rates than 
initially forecast.
2011
Restructuring costs
In response to the market downturn in the second half of 201 1, the Group restructured certain parts of its business, incurring staff related 
costs of £6.0m. 
Gartmore integration costs
On 4 April 201 1, the Group’s acquisition of Gartmore was completed. In relation to the acquisition and integration of Gartmore, costs of 
£69.7m before tax were incurred during the period. These costs mainly related to staff related expenses, legal and professional fees, 
transition of outsourced retail and investment operations, office relocation and reorganisation and fund mergers.
New Star void property provision release
A void property provision recognised on the acquisition of New Star in 2009 was reassessed, resulting in a release of £6.5m.
Non-recurring tax
Following the acquisition of Gartmore, the Group reassessed the potential utilisation of previously unrecognised tax assets and tax liabilities 
recognised by Gartmore in the first quarter of 201 1. Consequently, a deferred tax asset of £1 4.8m was recognised in respect of the expected 
utilisation of these assets against future taxable profits and £4.1m of Gartmore tax liabilities were released.

Group
10.1 Share-based compensation plans
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during 201 2:
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP allows employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after three years. The awards 
are made typically for staff recruitment and retention purposes and larger awards, generally, have performance hurdles. The Remuneration 
Committee approves all awards and the vesting of awards over £50,000. On vesting, the employee must satisfy any employee tax and social 
security obligations.
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
The 201 1 ESOP enabled all staff, including Executive Directors, to defer part of their cash-based incentive awards up to a specified limit 
through the purchase of Company shares. The 201 1 ESOP awards up to three matching shares for every share purchased depending on the 
performance of the Henderson Group TSR and Company share price. It is a five year plan with one third of the matching shares vesting on 
the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries, if the conditions have been met on each anniversary.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The L TIP awards selected employees restricted shares or £nil cost options that have employment conditions and performance conditions 
attached as shown below. Employees who have been awarded £nil cost options have five years to exercise their options following the three 
year vesting period:
Criteria Amount vesting
Henderson Group TSR less than the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies nil%
Henderson Group TSR at the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 25%
Henderson Group TSR at or above the 75th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 100%
If the Henderson Group TSR is between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the amount vesting will increase on a linear basis. The Remuneration 
Committee must also be satisfied the Henderson Group TSR reflects the underlying performance of the Group. For the 201 2 L TIP, the 
performance hurdle was 95% relative to Henderson Group TSR and 5% on risk and sustainability metrics.
Since 201 1, employees are entitled to dividend equivalents, based on the dividends declared, during the three year vesting period in respect 
of the shares that vest. The dividend equivalents are payable in two equal tranches, one and two year(s) after vesting. However, employees 
are not entitled to vote or receive dividends in respect of these awards until the vesting conditions are met, nor are they allowed to pledge, 
hedge or assign the expected awards in any way.
The 2009 L TIP met its vesting conditions on 31 December 201 1 and 100% of awards vested in April 201 2. The 2010 L TIP did not meet its 
vesting conditions on 31 December 201 2 and all awards lapsed. 
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP)
Employees who receive cash-based incentive awards over a preset threshold, have an element deferred. The majority of awards are 
deferred into the Company’s shares, with some deferrals into Group managed funds. The DEP trustee purchases Company shares and 
units or shares in Group managed funds and holds them in trust. Awards are deferred for up to three years and vest in three equal tranches. 
Those employees who elected to participate in the 201 1 ESOP, have their restricted shares, upon vesting, automatically transfer into the 201 1 
ESOP as bonus shares. They revert to matching shares subject to the performance and employment conditions of that plan. 
The 201 2 DEP has a matching share element where employees, excluding Executive Directors, are awarded one matching share for every 
three restricted shares on the third anniversary of the award. One third of the restricted shares will become unrestricted on each anniversary. 
If an employee requests to receive any of the restricted shares prior to the third anniversary, the related matching shares will be forfeited.
Hedge fund performance fee bonus awards are deferred into hedge funds and are held in trust for three years. A third of the units or shares 
will convert from restricted units or shares to bonus units or shares each anniversary, and the forfeiture is lifted.
Forfeiture conditions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers.
The expense of deferred short-term incentive awards is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of deferral. As at 
31 December 201 2, £19.7m (201 1: £21.1m) of deferred awards are to be recognised in future periods.
Buy As You Earn Share Plan (BAYE)
The BAYE is a HMRC approved plan. Eligible employees purchase shares in the Company by investing monthly, up to £1 25 (annual limit 
£1,500), which is deducted from their gross salary. For each share purchased, for no additional payment, two free matching shares are 
awarded (partnership shares). Partnership shares will be forfeited if purchased shares are withdrawn from the trust within one year.
The international version of the BAYE operates on a similar basis to that of the UK, but each purchased share is matched with one 
partnership share, which is not subject to forfeiture.

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP is a HMRC approved share option plan with the maximum value of unvested options at any time limited to £30,000 for UK 
employees. No such restrictions apply for overseas employees. Employees buy Company shares after a three year vesting period at an  
option price fixed at the start of the scheme. There are no Group performance conditions attached to the options and the exercise period is 
two years, whilst US employees have three months to exercise. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP , but they may 
hold awards made prior to their executive appointment. The 201 2 CSOP option price was £1.25 (201 1 CSOP: £1.63 and 2010 CSOP: £1.24). 
The 2009 CSOP awards, excluding US employees, became exercisable in March 201 2. The option price was £0.73. The CSOP 2010 was 
available to exercise for US employees in June 201 2 as the US CSOP is a two year plan. 
Executive Shared Ownership Plan (ExSOP)
The ExSOP is an employee share ownership plan and is aimed at encouraging employee share ownership at middle management level. 
Executive Directors do not participate in the ExSOP. 
Certain employees are invited to acquire jointly, with an employee benefit trust, the beneficial interest in a number of Company shares under 
the terms of a joint ownership agreement (JOA). Under a JOA, the employee will benefit from any growth in value in excess of a hurdle price 
fixed at the time of the award. 
For the 201 2 ExSOP, the market price at grant was £1.21 (201 1: £1.61) per share. The hurdle price was set at £1.31 (201 1: £1.76) per share. 
The shares have a three year vesting period with a subsequent two year exercise period.
Sharesave scheme (SAYE)
The SAYE is a HMRC approved plan. UK employees may participate in more than one scheme but only up to a maximum of £250 per month 
across all schemes. Employees who participate in the SAYE contribute a monthly amount from their net salary to a savings account. The 
SAYE vesting period is three years for UK employees.
At the end of a three year period, the employees in the 201 2 SAYE can exercise their share options using the funds in their savings account, 
together with any bonus equivalent, 201 2: 0.0 (201 1 SAYE: 0.1 and 2010 SAYE: 0.3), to subscribe for shares at a preset price. This was 
£0.92 (201 1 SAYE: £1.31 and 2010 SAYE: £1.00) per share in 201 2, a 20% discount to the average share price five business days prior to 
the award. Employees have up to six months after the three year period to exercise their options and subscribe for shares. Forfeiture 
provisions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. 
The USA Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) operates on the same principles as the UK SAYE, but has a two year savings period, a 
lower discount at 15% and no bonus element. In 201 2, the preset option price was USD1.54 (201 1 ESPP: USD2.19 and 2010 ESPP: 
USD1.62). Employees may participate in more than one plan, but only up to a plan maximum of USD31 2.50 per month across all plans.
Gartmore plans
The Gartmore plans are schemes that allow employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after 
three years. The awards were made by Gartmore, prior to the Group’s acquisition, typically for staff retention purposes. On vesting, in order to 
obtain the shares, the employee must still be in employment and must satisfy any employee tax and social security obligations. These awards 
are now governed by the rules covering the Group’s DEP and RSP awards.

Expected volatility has been calculated based on the historical volatility for the Company’s shares over three years.
Other share schemes involve the grant of shares for £nil consideration. The fair value of these grants is calculated using the share price at 
grant date, which is set out in the following table. No adjustments have been made for dividends.

The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2H1 2 of 5.05 pence per share which, when added to the interim 1H1 2 dividend of 2.10 
pence per share, results in a total dividend for 201 2 of 7 .15 pence per share. 
The final dividend proposed in respect of 2H1 2 of £56.3m is based on the total number of ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 201 2. 
There is a £1.1m decrease between the proposed dividends (2H1 1 final: £55.4m and 1H1 2 interim: £23.3m), as reported in the 201 1 Annual 
Report and Accounts and the Interim Report and Accounts for the six months ended 30 June 201 2, versus the dividends paid out during the 
year (2H1 1 final: £54.8m and 1H1 2 interim: £22.8m). This represents dividends waived by employee benefit trust trustees on shares held in 
trust on behalf of Group employees. The amount waived in respect of the final dividend declared in respect of 2H1 2 will be established by 
the employee benefit trust trustees on 10 May 2013, being the dividend record date.

Carrying value at 31 December 5 15.3 249.2 0.6 765.1
The Group considers itself to have one cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated. 
The recoverable value of goodwill for the Group at 31 December 2012 has been determined by a value in use calculation, using the 
Group’s annual budget and five-year forecasts approved by the Board and a terminal value for the period thereafter. The terminal value has 
been calculated assuming a long-term growth rate of 2% per annum in perpetuity, based on the Group’s view of long-term nominal growth. 
A pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 10.1% (201 1: 1 1.6%) per annum has been applied.
The resultant value in use calculation has been compared with the carrying value of goodwill to determine if any goodwill impairment arises. 
The calculation shows significant headroom in the recoverable value of goodwill. 
The value in use calculation has been flexed for a 40% reduction in equity market levels in 2013 and an appropriate decrease in costs.  
This calculation also shows headroom in the recoverable value of goodwill. 
Recent market transactions and the Group’s current market capitalisation provide additional evidence that the recoverable value of goodwill 
is in excess of the carrying value.

Total financial liabilities  449.5 597 .4 459.9 608.4
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss mainly consist of investments in the Group’s fund products which are held, in employee 
benefit trusts, against outstanding deferred compensation arrangements. Any movement in the fair value of these assets is offset by a 
corresponding movement in the deferred compensation liability, both recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge mainly available-for-sale financial assets denominated in foreign 
currency and therefore applies fair value hedge accounting. 
Debtor and creditor balances, included in the table above, represent balances mainly settling in a short time frame, and accordingly, the fair 
value of these assets and liabilities is considered to be materially equal to their carrying value after taking into account any impairment.
Company
As at 31 December 2012, the Company held financial assets at fair value through profit or loss with a carrying value and fair value of 
£13.0m (201 1: £7 .4m). These investments are classified as Level 1 and Level 2 using the hierarchy set out on the following page.  
During 2012, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 (201 1: £nil).

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial assets and liabilities by valuation technique:
 •
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 •
Level 2: other techniques where all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
 •
Level 3: techniques where inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

As the fair value measurement of the financial assets included in Level 3 is based on non-observable inputs, a change in one or more 
underlying assumptions could result in a significant change in fair value. However, due to the numerous different factors affecting the assets, 
the impact cannot be quantified.

21.2 Gartmore Pension Scheme – Final Salary Scheme
As part of the acquisition of Gartmore in April 201 1, the Group acquired the assets and liabilities of the Gartmore Pension Scheme (GPS). 
GPS was closed to new entrants and future accrual for existing members in 2006. The sponsor and participating company is Gartmore 
Investment Management Limited. The actuarial advisers to GPS are Lane Clark & Peacock LLP.
The 2012 GPS accounting valuation under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, is based on full membership data as at 31 December 201 1 and 
updated to the accounting date by an independent actuary in accordance with IAS 19. The GPS assets are stated at their fair values as at  
31 December 2012. As part of a buy-in arrangement, the trustee entered into a bulk annuity insurance agreement on 4 April 2012 with  
the Pension Insurance Corporation. The buy-in arrangement entered into by the trustee has reduced the Group’s exposure to the risks 
associated with the scheme. As a result, the value of assets, recognised under IAS 19, reduced to reflect the buy-in arrangement and  
are shown as actuarial losses in the relevant tables below.

21.3 Henderson Group unapproved pension schemes
The Group operates three unapproved pension schemes, the details of which are provided below:
Pearl Executive Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of HGPS. However, pensionable earnings under HGPS are limited to 
1/60th for each year of service and the earnings cap. The Pearl Executive Scheme provides benefits at 1/30th for each year of service with 
a maximum of two thirds of salary after 20 years service based on pensionable earnings above the earnings cap, on an unfunded basis;
Henderson Top Up Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of HGPS. However, pensionable earnings under HGPS are limited 
to the earnings cap, and the Henderson T op Up Scheme enables benefits to be based on pensionable earnings without restriction of the 
earnings cap. These additional uncapped benefits are provided on an unfunded basis; and 
there is also an unfunded liability in respect of one member, to whom the Group has made a contractual promise to pay a fixed pension  
from age 60.

The change in the UK corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 resulted in a reduction of the Group’s deferred 
tax asset and deferred tax liability of £3.0m and £6.2m respectively. The proposed further reduction of the UK corporation tax rate to 21% 
by 1 April 201 4 is anticipated to be substantively enacted in 2013. The Group estimates the aggregate impact of the proposed reduction 
from 23% to 21% would reduce the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as at 31 December 201 2, by approximately £2.7m and 
£4.9m respectively. Any impact will not be recognised by the Group until the proposed reduction is enacted.
At 31 December 201 2, the Group has unused tax losses in respect of which no deferred tax has been recognised as utilisation of the losses  
is dependent on future profits. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of trading losses carried forward is £1.5m (201 1: £13.5m).  
The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of capital losses carried forward is £1 2.5m (201 1: £1 4.6m). These losses have no expiry date.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with the Group’s investments in overseas subsidiaries, 
branches, associates and joint ventures where the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and where the 
reversal of the temporary differences is not anticipated in the foreseeable future (201 1: £nil).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises differences on exchange arising from the translation of opening statements of financial position of 
subsidiaries, whose reporting currency is not GBP, and differences between the results of these subsidiaries translated at average rates for 
the reporting period and period end rates. 
The translation reserve also includes unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets which are not part of 
a designated hedge relationship. Upon disposal or impairment of these assets, amounts previously recognised in the translation reserve are

28.  Financial risk management
Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial assets principally comprise investments in equity securities, short-term investments, trade and other receivables and cash and  
cash equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise borrowings for financing purposes and trade and other payables. The main risks arising from 
financial instruments are price, interest rate, liquidity, foreign currency and credit. Each of these risks is examined in detail below. The Group 
monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis and intra-Group balances are settled when it is deemed appropriate for both parties to the 
transaction. The Company is not exposed to material financial risk and separate disclosures for the Company have not been included.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management 
practices appropriate for a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board and overseen by the Board 
Risk Committee.
28.1 Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to price risk in respect of seed capital investments in Group funds (available-for-sale financial assets). Seed capital 
investments vary in duration, depending on the nature of the investment, with a typical range of less than one year for equity and fixed 
income products and between three and seven years for private equity and property products. The total market value of seed capital 
investments at 31 December 201 2 was £44.9m (201 1: £54.3m). 
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis. Significant movements in investment values are monitored on a daily basis. 
Where appropriate, management will hedge price risk. At 31 December 201 2, investments with a carrying value of £1.6m (201 1: £1.4m) were 
hedged against price risk through the use of contracts for difference (CFDs).
A fall in the value of an investment which is prolonged or significant is considered to be evidence of impairment under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. In such an event, an investment is written down to its fair value and cumulative losses previously 
recognised in equity, in respect of market value and unhedged foreign exchange movements on the investment, are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as an impairment charge.

Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest rates, either through a mismatch of 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, or through the effect such movements have on the value of interest-bearing assets. The Group is 
exposed to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Available-for-sale financial assets are not currently 
exposed to interest rate risk. This exposure is monitored by management on a continuous basis.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate are repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on debt instruments 
classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Assets and liabilities categorised as fixed rate or other are not exposed to 
interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis on the Consolidated Income Statement has been performed on the basis of a 50bps per annum fall in 
interest rates at the beginning of the year. The impact of such a decrease would reduce finance income by approximately £1.0m per annum 
(201 1: £1.4m) in the Consolidated Income Statement.

28.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
Group liquidity is managed on a daily basis by Group Finance, to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or highly liquid assets available to 
meet its liabilities. Group Finance also controls and monitors the use of the Group’s non-operating capital resources. It is the Group’s policy to 
ensure that it has access to funds to cover all forecast commitments for at least the next 1 2 months. 
The maturity dates of the Group’s financial liabilities and obligations are as follows:

28.4 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk through its exposure to non-GBP income, expenses, assets and liabilities of its overseas 
subsidiaries as well as net assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than GBP. The currency exposure is managed by 
monitoring foreign currency positions. The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce or eliminate the currency exposure  
on certain individual transactions. The Group seeks to use natural hedges to reduce exposure. Where there is a mismatch on material 
currency flows and the timing is reasonably certain, they are actively hedged. Where there is insufficient certainty, the currency is translated 
back into GBP on receipt. 
Foreign currency risk management is overseen by the Hedge Committee and hedge effectiveness is reported to the Board monthly.
A rolling programme of forward foreign currency contracts has been implemented to hedge the currency exposures arising from certain 
available-for-sale financial assets, with a year end notional value of USD39.0m and EUR7 .8m (201 1: USD43.7m and EUR7 .8m) 
(refer to note 28.6).
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis
Available-for-sale financial assets are either denominated in GBP or hedged back to GBP using forward foreign currency contracts based 
on the Group’s hedging policy. However, there remain some available-for-sale financial assets which are not fully hedged as they fall below 
the policy level for implementing hedging arrangements. In addition, there are unhedged foreign currency cash balances and net trading 
receipts in subsidiaries of the Group.

28.5 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty of the Group defaulting on funds deposited with it or the non-receipt of a trade debt. 
The Group has an established credit policy to ensure that it only transacts with counterparties that are able to meet satisfactory rating 
requirements. Counterparty limits are reviewed and set centrally by the Credit Risk Committee. Management is responsible for ensuring that 
it remains within these limits and the Risk function monitors and reports any exceptions to the policy. The Group has not suffered any losses 
as a result of trade debtor or counterparty defaults during the year.
The Risk function is also responsible for reporting credit exposures to the Board Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and for ensuring that 
any credit concerns are raised and actions taken to mitigate risks.

28.6  Hedging activities
At 31 December 201 2, the Group held CFDs to hedge the price risk arising from certain available-for-sale financial assets. These have been 
assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised loss arising on these and other instruments entered into throughout 
the year amounted to £0.2m (201 1: £0.4m gain) and has been offset in the Consolidated Income Statement by £0.2m (201 1: £0.4m loss), 
being the net realised and unrealised gain on available-for-sale financial assets in designated hedging relationships during the year. 
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the CFDs was £nil (201 1: £nil).
At 31 December 201 2, the Group held forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk arising from available-for-sale 
financial assets denominated in US dollars and euros (refer to note 28.4).
These forward foreign currency contracts have been assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised gain arising 
on these and other instruments entered into throughout the year amounted to £1.2m (201 1: £0.4m loss) and has been offset in the 
Consolidated Income Statement by £1.2m (201 1: £0.4m gain), being the net realised and unrealised foreign exchange loss on available-
for-sale financial assets in designated hedging relationships during the year. The fair value of these hedges is set out in the table below:

The rental expense on this lease is being recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
On acquisition of New Star and Gartmore, the Group became party to three further material operating leases. These are in relation to 1 
Knightsbridge Green, London, 8 Lancelot Place, London and Rex House, Queen Street, London. At the reporting date, the leases run for a 
period of four, 10 and 13 years respectively. A void properties provision has been recognised for these leases at the net present value of the 
net expected future cash outflows (refer to note 22). 
The future minimum lease payments under the four non-cancellable operating leases fall due as follows:

consisted of intangible assets of £0.7m and other net assets of £0.1m.
On 4 April 201 1, Henderson Group plc completed its acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Gartmore Group Limited. The value 
of total equity consideration for Gartmore was £420.0m, being 242,639,403 new ordinary shares at the closing market price on the LSE on 
the last business day prior to issue. The cost of acquisition amounted to £365.4m after adjusting for Gartmore related employee share 
awards. The fair value of the net assets of Gartmore at the date of acquisition were £1 27 .1m and the goodwill accounted for £238.3m.
33.2  Disposals
The Group disposed of Henderson (Buchanan Galleries) Limited and Henderson Buchanan plc, which held certain available-for-sale financial

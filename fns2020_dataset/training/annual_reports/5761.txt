Chairman’s statement
Introduction
A major focus for us during the year 
was to address the new priorities 
of our financial services clients, 
particularly in the US and UK, 
where the emphasis has been on 
strengthening risk management 
and collections activities across 
their organisations. We responded 
by intensifying our client education 
efforts, reallocating sales resource 
and quickly bringing to market a wide 
range of countercyclical products 
to satisfy the entire range of client 
needs. These products remain in 
high demand and have secured  
us a number of multi-country  
client contracts. 
Experian’s Consumer Direct 
business, which enables consumers 
to monitor their personal credit files, 
grew strongly in both the US and 
UK as consumers chose to actively 
manage their credit status. Our 
increased investment in consumer 
marketing, the growing contribution 
from affinity partners, such as 
American Express and Discover, 
and demand for new identity theft 
protection products all contributed 
to Experian extending its lead in this 
growing market.
Outside of financial services, we 
continued to diversify by taking our 
core data and analytics products into 
markets such as the public sector, 
healthcare and telecommunications.  
We also expanded our global 
footprint, winning substantial 
contracts in Eastern Europe and Asia 
Pacific, and opening a new credit 
bureau in Morocco. In Latin America, 
where we significantly increased 
our presence during 2007 with the 
acquisition of Serasa, our business 
went from strength to strength, 
meeting the need for more advanced 
credit reference and customer 
management products.   
Experian’s diverse and well 
balanced business model has been 
a major factor in our ability to keep 
on growing through the current 
economic cycle. However, we should 
also recognise the outstanding 
efforts of the management team 
in successfully redirecting our 
business towards areas of greatest 
need and opportunity, while 
continuing to reduce costs across 
the business. Our people have 
responded superbly to the  
challenge and I thank them all for 
their tremendous co-operation  
and energy.   
 
Since the year end, Experian’s 
board has been strengthened by 
the appointment of Chris Callero 
as an executive director. Chris is 
the President and Chief Operating 
Officer for Experian and has played 
a central role in Experian’s success, 
particularly in North and Latin 
America, since joining the Group 
in 2002. Sean FitzPatrick stood 
down as a non-executive director 
in December 2008 and we are very 
grateful for the valuable contribution 
he made to our business. 
  
Despite the difficult market 
conditions, corporate responsibility 
remained a priority for Experian 
during the year and we considerably 
widened the scope of our  
CR reporting to include the  
EMEA/Asia Pacific region for the 
first time. We also provided greater 
focus for our global community 
programme by concentrating on 
projects that provide financial 
education to vulnerable people and 
that encourage entrepreneurial 
skills combined with wise financial 
planning. In the UK, we increased 
the level of employee volunteering 
and won two awards from Business 
in the Community. Overall, 
notwithstanding the economic 
pressures and cost saving  
initiatives, the Group gave more 
to our communities than in any 
previous year.  
Looking ahead, it is clear that the 
economic environment will remain 
challenging for some time to come. 
Experian has, however, strengthened 
its overall market position this 
year, reduced its operating costs 
and continued to invest in new 
opportunities for growth, which 
leaves us well placed as conditions 
improve. In the meantime, we 
remain committed to our successful 
strategy of focusing on data and 
analytics, driving profitable growth 
and optimising capital efficiency.
Experian delivered another strong performance this year against 
a backdrop of exceptionally challenging market conditions. It is an 
achievement that clearly demonstrates the resilience of Experian’s 
core business and the benefits we derive from our broad portfolio 
of capabilities, but it has also shown just how quickly the Group can 
adapt to changing circumstances.

Experian provides information, analytical tools and marketing 
services to organisations around the world, ranging from small 
start-up businesses to multinational corporations. Clients use these 
services to manage risk, find and retain customers, and automate 
decision-making. Experian also helps individuals to manage their 
credit relationships and to minimise the risk of identity theft. 
Principal activities
Experian’s vision is for its people, data 
and technology to become a necessary 
part of every major consumer economy 
in the world.
The Group reports its financial 
performance on a geographical basis 
across four regions – North America, 
Latin America, UK and Ireland and 
EMEA/Asia Pacific. Its activities in 
these regions are grouped into four 
principal business lines:  
Credit Services
Credit Services helps organisations 
to acquire new customers for credit 
products, to predict and manage credit 
risk, and to reduce their exposure to  
bad debt and fraud. Experian maintains 
very large, comprehensive databases  
that hold the credit application and 
repayment histories of millions of 
consumers and businesses. The Group 
owns 13 consumer credit bureaux and 
ten business credit bureaux and has an 
interest in a further two consumer and 
two business credit bureaux around  
the world. 
Decision Analytics
Decision Analytics enables 
organisations with large customer 
bases to manage and automate huge 
volumes of day-to-day decisions. 
Experian’s clients include international 
banks, utility companies and public 
service providers, who rely on its 
predictive tools and sophisticated 
software to control decision-making at 
all points of contact with customers.
Market position
Experian is the global leader in its 
industry, with strong market positions. 
The Group is nearly twice the size 
of its nearest peer and considerably 
broader in its capabilities and global 
reach. This diversity and balanced 
spread of revenues provides Experian 
with a degree of protection against 
fluctuations in economies, as well as 
significant competitive advantage. 
Competition for Experian’s products 
and services often comes in the form 
of niche, localised providers. There 
is no single competitor that operates 
across all four principal business 
lines, although the Group has a 
number of competitors within these 
activities. 
 
In consumer credit information, 
Experian is one of three providers in 
the US; the others are Equifax and 
TransUnion. Experian is the clear 
market leader in both the UK and 
Brazil, and has leading positions in 
many other countries. 
In business information, Experian 
has leading positions in the UK and 
Brazil, and in a number of other 
markets. Dun & Bradstreet is the only 
global competitor in this field.
 
Experian is the market leader in the 
provision of credit-related analytics 
and software in all geographies 
other than the US, where Fair Isaac is 
dominant. There is also competition 
in individual markets from smaller, 
localised players.

Marketing Services 
Marketing Services helps clients to find 
and retain customers, using the most 
appropriate channel and message. 
Experian gathers extensive geographic, 
demographic and lifestyle information 
on consumers and businesses. The 
data is used in conjunction with 
advanced analytical systems to enable 
clients to profile their customers, 
undertake highly targeted campaigns 
and measure their marketing success 
rates and return on investment.
Interactive 
Interactive enables consumers to 
manage and protect their personal 
credit files and to make more informed 
purchasing decisions. Experian 
provides credit reports directly to 
consumers, together with credit scores 
and tools for preventing identity theft. 
It also provides businesses with lead 
generation by connecting them with 
consumers over the internet. 
Key facts
 
In the US, large marketing 
competitors for traditional direct 
marketing services include Acxiom 
and Harte-Hanks. Competition 
elsewhere tends to be fragmented 
and specialist, particularly in new 
media.
 
Experian’s direct-to-consumer, 
credit information business is the 
clear market leader in both the US 
and UK. In the US, competition is 
provided by Equifax, TransUnion, Fair 
Isaac and other smaller specialists, 
but Experian is more than twice the 
size of any of these competitors. In 
the UK, competition is provided by 
Equifax and smaller niche players.

Growth drivers
Experian has many growth 
opportunities and investing for future 
growth is a cornerstone of its strategy. 
Despite marketplace challenges 
caused by the global recession, the 
Group has continued to deliver strong 
financial performances due to the 
flexibility and diversity of its business 
model. 
Credit-related activities
In the short term, Experian is a 
beneficiary of increased demand for 
its countercyclical products, which 
help lenders calculate and preserve 
capital and manage loan portfolio risk. 
In the medium term, growth prospects 
for Experian’s credit-related activities 
are underpinned by a number of 
factors: global demand for consumer 
and business credit; increasing 
demand for analytics that help 
institutions and consumers to predict 
and manage lending risk and prevent 
fraud; standardisation in technology 
platforms amongst global financial 
services clients; and growth in 
demand for Experian’s products from 
outside the financial services industry, 
including telecommunications, 
utilities, public sector and the US 
healthcare payments sector.  
Marketing-related activities
New communication channels 
are driving growth in Experian’s 
marketing-related activities. There is 
a growing requirement from around 
the world for marketing campaigns 
that can be targeted more precisely, 
executed more quickly, coordinated 
across multiple channels and 
delivered with a measurable return 
on investment. This is stimulating 
increased demand for the type of 
expertise, data and sophisticated 
software and analytical tools in which 
Experian has invested.   
Strategy
In order to capitalise on the market 
opportunities available to Experian 
and to drive long-term shareholder 
value, the Group has centred its 
strategy on three elements:
1. Focus on data and analytics
Experian’s core expertise lies in 
the ownership and operation of 
comprehensive databases about 
consumers and businesses. From 
these it is able to extract significant 
extra value by applying its own 
proprietary analytics and software. 
This combination of data and 
analytics is a key differentiator.
 
Experian’s principal business lines 
are characterised by their market-
leading positions, high barriers to 
entry, global reach and potential for 
long-term growth, as well as their 
attractive financial characteristics.
The Group is therefore focusing 
its investment on developing these 
core capabilities in order to build 
market-leading positions in credit 
risk management and targeted 
marketing. It is also taking advantage 
of synergies across its credit and 
marketing activities, where it can 
leverage a significant number of data 
management processes to serve 
clients in both areas.
2. Drive profitable growth
Experian has excellent positions in 
its two end-markets of credit and 
marketing and its aim is to drive 
organic revenue growth by leveraging 
its scale and focusing on ‘best-in-
class’ performance. 
The Group’s strategic framework 
for driving profitable growth has the 
following components:
- Increase global reach: by expanding 
its global network and extending 
its existing capabilities into new 
geographic and vertical markets. 
- Innovate to stay ahead: by 
promoting its culture of innovation 
and investing in new data sources 
and enhanced analytics to deliver 
significant value to clients. 
- Drive operational excellence: by 
leveraging its global scale and 
common platforms to allow it to 
deploy global products quickly into 
new markets. 
3. Optimise capital efficiency
Experian is committed to maintaining 
a prudent, flexible and efficient 
balance sheet. The Group aims to 
use its strong cash flow to reinvest 
in the business to retain competitive 
advantage and to make targeted 
acquisitions that fit its strategy and 
meet its financial hurdles. As credit 
ratios improve, Experian will evaluate 
additional opportunities for returning 
surplus cash to shareholders via 
dividends or share repurchases.

Key resources
People, data and technology are the 
resources that Experian considers to 
be fundamental to its business.
People
The management of talent is 
particularly critical to Experian’s 
success and the Group invests 
over 40% of revenues in attracting, 
developing and retaining people. 
Employees are drawn from as diverse 
a pool as possible and the ethnic 
profile broadly reflects that of the 
populations in which Experian 
operates (more detail can be found at 
www.experiancrreport.com). 
Succession planning ensures that 
appropriate leadership resources 
are in place to achieve Experian’s 
strategic objectives, with plans 
regularly reviewed by the nomination 
committee. About two thirds of 
senior leadership appointments are 
the result of internal promotions. 
The Group assesses and rewards 
employees according to their 
contribution to the growth of the 
business. Success at Experian is also 
about personal fit with the culture 
and with the behaviours that are 
valued by the organisation. These 
behaviours are tracked and measured 
as part of a globally consistent 
performance appraisal system.
In return, Experian invests heavily in 
ensuring employees have the right 
environment and skills to perform to 
the best of their ability. Employees 
are also actively involved in the 
planning and direction of their work, 
at all levels in the organisation. 
Employee surveys and forums 
provide valuable insights into the 
views of employees and their level 
of engagement with the business. 
Experian’s second Global People 
Survey in 2009 achieved an 84% 
employee participation, up from 73% 
the previous year, with improvements 
across all survey categories. 
Experian’s performance is now at 
or above the norm in ten out of 14 of 
categories when compared with its 
closest peer group of global financial 
services companies.  
Data
At the core of Experian’s strategy, 
and underlying its success, are 
comprehensive databases of credit 
and marketing information on 
consumers and businesses. The 
Group strives for market leadership 
in each of the three key measures of 
data capability - breadth, depth and 
quality.
Experian invests heavily each year to 
maintain complete, accurate and up-
to-date information, while continuing 
to add new data sources that may 
be of value to its clients. The major 
database update of information from 
the UK Voters’ Roll was achieved in 
record time this year.  
Experian is also the trusted steward 
of much sensitive information. It 
has the obligation to protect this for 
clients, who are the source of much 
of the data, and for consumers, 
who are the subjects of the data. 
The Group therefore operates 
very rigorous security and control 
policies, which are reviewed on a 
regular basis.
T echnology
Experian’s information technology 
(IT) systems are used to store, 
process and deliver the data that 
forms the foundation of the business. 
The Group employs almost 1,200 IT 
specialists. 
Innovation is at the heart of Experian 
and much of the technology provided 
to clients is developed, maintained 
and supported by in-house teams 
across our various locations. 
Significant efficiencies have 
been achieved in the year through 
consolidation of infrastructure 
facilities and resources.

Business review
Chief Executive’s review
Don Robert 
Chief Executive Officer
This performance has been 
delivered in a challenging and 
uncertain environment, caused by 
unprecedented disruption within 
the global financial system. Our 
performance is attributable to the 
breadth of our business and our ability 
to adapt to new market conditions. We 
were quick to refocus our organisation 
towards changing client needs and 
to reduce our cost base. The benefits 
from our cost efficiency programme 
are exceeding our plan. We delivered 
US$80m of cost savings in 2009, and 
today we raise our expectation for total 
annualised savings from fiscal year 
2010 onwards by US$20m to US$150m. 
Global growth strategy
For now, challenges remain for 
some of our clients and in some of 
the regions in which we operate. 
In the US and UK, lenders remain 
focused on account management 
and collections and on addressing 
costs. More broadly across 
these two economies, rising 
unemployment is slowing  
consumer demand. 
However, as the external 
environment begins to stabilise, 
our strategic focus increasingly 
is on nurturing, building and 
harvesting growth opportunities 
for our business. During 2009, we 
invested significantly in new growth 
opportunities, and our plan is to 
invest at a similar level in the year 
ending 31 March 2010.
Experian performed well in 2009. Our organic revenue growth was 3%, 
we expanded our margins by 50 basis points to 23.3% and we delivered 
strong free cash flow of US$736m, up 11%. Benchmark EPS grew 8% 
to 62.3 US cents per ordinary share and we have raised our full-year 
dividend by 8% to 20.0 US cents per ordinary share. 9 Experian Annual Report 2009

Our strategic focus increasingly 
is on nurturing, building and 
harvesting growth opportunities 
for our business 
Focus on data and analytics
Over the past year, Experian has further 
extended its industry-leading market 
position. Innovation is our lifeblood, 
and each year we fund a series of 
new initiatives, as well as upgrading 
products to keep our portfolio fresh and 
vital. The proportion of Group revenue 
arising from products developed in the 
past five years has steadily trended 
upwards and now stands at over 20%. 
Over the coming year, we will fund a 
number of new initiatives organically, 
including identity theft management 
tools within Consumer Direct; 
marketing and analytical product 
extensions in Latin America and Asia 
Pacific; and value-added products in 
North America.
We are also highly focused on 
extending our geographic footprint. We 
are very pleased to have been awarded a 
provisional licence to operate a bureau 
in India, and over the next year we will 
focus on establishing our joint venture 
company and gathering data ahead of 
launch. We are also investing in new 
data sources to support the migration 
of our Spanish bureau to a positive data 
market and in new bureaux investments 
in Morocco and Eastern Europe. 
Drive profitable growth
The majority of our growth today stems 
from more established investments 
and our aim is to sustain this growth. 
Within our B2B businesses we aim to 
be a strategic partner to our clients, 
delivering value-added products, 
through strong sales execution, 
enhanced client experience and flawless 
delivery. Across our B2C operations, 
our strategy is to enhance the consumer 
experience and deliver greater value, 
while building brand equity.
We continue to see significant 
opportunity for growth across:
–  new geographies, such as Latin 
America, where the addressable 
market for both credit risk 
management and high return on 
investment (‘RoI’) marketing is large 
and under-penetrated;
–  new vertical markets, where we have 
increased our investment in UK 
public sector, utilities, US healthcare 
payments and capital markets;
–  new products, for example in scoring, 
risk management, fraud prevention, 
contact data management and 
customer segmentation tools.
Our success here will help offset  
short-term headwinds from 
financial services consolidation and 
recessionary market conditions.
Optimise capital efficiency
We remain committed to maintaining 
a prudent but efficient balance 
sheet. Net debt at the end of the 
year was US$2,110m, after funding 
capital expenditure of US$305m and 
acquisition spend of US$179m. 
Our cash flow is typically second-half 
weighted and we expect net debt to 
remain at a similar level for the next 
six months, excluding any acquisition 
activity. 
Dividend
For the year ended 31 March 2009, we 
have announced a second interim 
dividend of 13.25 US cents per share. 
This gives a full-year dividend of 20.00 
US cents per share, up 8%, and 3.1 
times covered by Benchmark EPS. The 
second interim dividend will be paid 
on 24 July 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 26 
June 2009.
Our people
This has been a difficult year, one of 
the most challenging in our history. 
The consistency and strength of our 
performance reflects the commitment 
and hard work of our people, and I 
would like to take this opportunity 
to thank all our employees for their 
dedication, support and outstanding 
accomplishments over the past year.  10 Experian Annual Report 2009

Microsoft Xbox is the world’s leading video games console, with more 
than 28 million sales of its latest generation Xbox 360. There are also 
more than 17 million subscribers to Xbox LIVE, its online gaming service. 
Being able to keep in touch with this vast audience is a high priority for 
Microsoft Xbox in the fast moving and fiercely competitive gaming industry.
At the heart of Xbox’s communications is a global marketing database, 
developed by Experian, holding information on customers in 29 
countries. The database has been harnessed to Experian’s email 
marketing technology to drive a highly targeted email communications 
programme. More than 150 million emails each year keep Xbox 
customers informed about everything from new upgrades to the system 
to news that their subscriptions are about to expire.
Rob Ziemak of Microsoft Xbox said: “Experian is helping us to 
communicate with our customers in a very personal and efficient way. 
We also have the ability now to create and execute new email marketing 
campaigns in just days.”

Key performance indicators
Business review
Experian’s strategy is centred on three elements: to focus on data 
and analytics, drive profitable growth and optimise capital efficiency. 
Experian’s financial objectives are to drive organic growth, to maintain 
or grow margins and to convert at least 85% of EBIT into operating 
cash flow. The following indicators are the key metrics used by 
the board and management team to assess Experian’s success in 
achieving its objectives.
Organic revenue growth
Organic growth increased by 3% 
in the year ended 31 March 2009.  
Organic revenue growth was 
achieved against a challenging 
economic backdrop, demonstrating 
the resilience of the business 
model.

Cash flow (US$m) and  
cash flow conversion
Experian aims to convert at least 
85% of its EBIT into operating cash 
flow each year. In the year ended 
31 March 2009, Experian converted 
99% of EBIT to operating cash flow, 
significantly in excess of its target.

EBIT (US$m) and margin
In the year ended 31 March 2009, 
Experian increased its total EBIT 
by 3% to US$939m. Continuing 
EBIT increased by 8% at constant 
exchange rates. EBIT margin from 
continuing activities expanded by 
50 basis points to 23.3%. Experian 
delivered this margin while 
continuing to fund investment for 
future growth.
T otal revenue growth
In the year ended 31 March 2009, 
Experian increased its revenue 
from continuing activities by 
8% at constant exchange rates. 
Acquisitions accounted for 5% of the 
revenue growth, largely reflecting 
the contributions from Serasa and 
other smaller acquisitions.

Changes to key performance 
indicators
Experian no longer reports ‘revenue per 
employee’ as a KPI as our increasing 
mix of businesses has resulted in this 
no longer being an appropriate global 
performance indicator . 
Experian’ s strategy is to drive profitable 
growth, for example, through increased 
global reach. The ownership of both 
consumer and business bureaux around 
the world supports this strategy . 
The number of business credit bureaux 
which Experian owns, or in which it has an 
interest, has increased to the extent that it 
is now appropriate to disclose it separately 
as a KPI. The comparative numbers of 
business bureaux remain only those 
bureaux historically owned by Experian, 
but reflect minority ownership from 2009.
Number of consumer credit 
bureaux 
Experian’s consumer credit bureaux 
provide the foundation for its 
consumer credit-related activities.  
Experian owns consumer credit 
bureaux in 13 countries and has an 
interest in a further two, bringing 
the total number of countries in 
which Experian has an interest in a 
consumer credit bureau to 15.

Countries with offices 
Experian supports local and 
multinational clients in over 65 
countries throughout a network 
of offices. Additional offices were 
opened during the year in Costa Rica 
and Morocco to support Experian’s 
growth in those countries.  This 
brought the total number of 
countries where Experian has offices 
to 40.

Carbon footprint (000’s tonnes)
Experian’s environmental impact is 
largely the result of energy use in 
buildings, especially its data centres, 
and employee travel. The Group is 
taking steps to reduce its energy 
consumption and overall energy 
costs, and to extend its purchase of 
energy from renewable sources.

Employee engagement
Experian’s people are at the heart 
of the Group’s success and are a 
key resource. Experian has taken 
a number of steps to improve 
employees’ satisfaction and 
involvement with the Company 
and regularly surveys its whole

Business review
Credit Services
T otal revenue at Credit Services 
declined by 4%, with organic revenue 
down 5%. Prospecting activity by 
financial services clients remained 
weak throughout the year, due to the 
depressed market environment for 
lending. Mortgage origination revenue 
also declined, although there were 
occasional surges in volumes linked 
to consumer refinancing activity. 
These factors were partially offset by 
growth in account management and 
collections, with good traction from 
new countercyclical products such 
as bankruptcy scores and business 
delinquency notification services. 
In addition, there was a resilient 
performance from the automotive 
vertical, which benefited from market-
share gains in the sale of vehicle history 
reports.
Experian North America delivered modest organic revenue growth 
during a time of exceptionally challenging market conditions. There 
was good progress on margins, up 40 basis points, reflecting 
excellent delivery on cost efficiency initiatives.

Virgin Mobile USA is a leading national provider of wireless services, 
with more than five million pay-as-you-go or prepaid customers. In 
2008, the company entered the ‘postpaid’ market where customers 
agree to annual contracts in order to have access to more advanced 
handsets and a range of video, Internet and information services. T o 
support its growth plans in this market, Virgin Mobile USA needs to 
be confident about the decisions it makes about customers and their 
ability to fulfil the terms of their credit agreements.
At the heart of this decision-making process is Experian’s Strategy 
Management, a sophisticated decision engine that brings together 
customer information and analysis with Virgin Mobile USA ’s own 
credit policies and terms of business. It ensures fast and consistent 
decisions at the point of application, while enabling Virgin Mobile USA 
to set the most appropriate terms for each customer and to undertake 
continual monitoring and refinement of the company’s credit strategy.  
Danny Perez, Director of Credit & Risk at Virgin Mobile USA: “Experian 
has provided us with the ability to refine and execute our credit strategy 
with great precision and to be highly responsive to customer needs 
and changes in the marketplace.”

North America continued
During the year, Experian continued 
to focus on strengthening its market 
position and on expanding into new 
growth verticals. In addition, through 
the acquisition of SearchAmerica in 
December 2008, Experian is extending 
its core data and analytics to the fast-
growth healthcare payments sector. 
As previously announced, Experian 
has discontinued efforts to launch 
a credit bureau in Canada. This 
reflects the reduced attractiveness of 
the opportunity following the global 
financial crisis, which has caused lender 
needs in Canada to change.
Decision Analytics
Revenue growth at Decision Analytics 
was 1%. There was good progress 
during the year across custom analytics, 
as well as account management, 
commercial lending and fraud 
prevention software. This helped 
to offset weaker demand for loan 
origination products. Experian further 
penetrated the market during the year, 
with a number of new business wins. 
In addition, Experian is developing 
its presence in new verticals, such 
as capital markets, by building 
relationships with lenders, ratings 
agencies and regulators. 
Marketing Services
T otal revenue at Marketing Services 
declined by 1%, while organic revenue 
declined by 2%. Recessionary conditions 
and cutbacks in discretionary retail 
spend impacted the traditional 
activities of list processing, data and 
database, which declined during the 
year. New media businesses delivered 
good growth reflecting deeper market 
penetration through new business wins 
and good retention rates.
 
Interactive
Revenue growth at Interactive was 7%. 
Consumer Direct delivered a very strong 
performance, with growth in excess of 
20%, further extending Experian’s market 
lead. Growth was driven by higher 
memberships, growth in the affinity 
channel, plus contribution from one-off 
data breach contracts. During the year, 
Experian has invested in enhancing the 
value of the customer experience as well 
as in new product introductions, such as 
identity management tools. 
In lead generation, Experian Interactive 
Media continued to experience very weak 
market conditions as lenders exited the 
market for subprime mortgage leads. 
Comparison shopping revenues were 
impacted by the weak retail environment 
and by adverse business mix as 
shoppers switched to lower value items.
Financial review
Revenue from continuing activities was 
US$2,083m, up 1%, with organic revenue 
growth of 1%. 
EBIT from direct businesses was 
US$568m (2008: US$554m), an increase 
of 3% in the year, giving an EBIT margin 
of 27.3% (2008: 26.9%). The margin 
improvement reflected progress on 
cost efficiency initiatives, including 
offshoring of administrative and 
development roles to Chile and Costa 
Rica and technology efficiencies.
EBIT from F ARES, the 20%-owned 
real estate information associate, was 
US$48m (2008: US$54m). The reduction 
reflected the very weak environment for 
mortgage origination. 
Social, ethical and 
environmental (SEE) risks  
and opportunities 
Experian in North America has taken
steps to incorporate consideration
of SEE issues into its everyday
processes, communicating its stance
with employees, clients and industry
advocates. Environmental initiatives are
beginning to contribute energy and cost 
savings, which are reported in the full CR

Williams-Sonoma is a premier retailer of home furnishings in the 
United States, with over 600 stores nationwide. More than 40% of sales 
are direct to customer and the company distributes many millions of 
catalogues each year, which also help attract visitors to its stores.  
With such a vast catalogue distribution, the ability to reach only the  
right households is crucial.  
Working with Experian, Williams-Sonoma has developed highly 
sophisticated selection criteria, using as many as 650 data elements, 
to determine who best to mail and which catalogue. It has enabled the 
company to reduce its catalogue circulation by over 30% with a minimal  
loss in sales. Experian’s unique personal identification number (PIN) 
also provides the ability to link customer records across multiple  
mailing lists and data sources, without risk of duplication, and to keep 
the central database continually updated and de-duplicated.      
Pat Connolly, Chief Marketing Officer at Williams-Sonoma: “Experian has 
allowed us to advance the science of prediction in terms of whom to mail 
and not to mail. Our new mailing platform is giving us the flexibility and 
efficiency we need to compete in a very challenging retail environment.”

Credit Services
There was strong growth in Credit 
Services in Brazil. Total revenue 
increased by 51% at constant exchange 
rates. Organic revenue growth was 
17%, following the annualisation of 
the acquisition of Serasa (acquired in 
June 2007). While lending conditions 
tightened progressively during the year, 
revenue continued to grow strongly 
reflecting the relative under-penetration 
of credit reference products in Brazil. 
There was excellent organic performance across all activities within 
Latin America. The strong uplift in margins reflected positive 
operating leverage. On EBIT , both Serasa and Informarketing 
exceeded their respective acquisition buy-plans. 
In consumer information, there 
was excellent progress across both 
financial and non-financial verticals, 
as well as a growing contribution 
from countercyclical products such 
as collection notifications. Growth at 
business information was driven by 
strong demand for richer reports, which 
help to better assess risk. In addition, 
Experian benefited from deeper inroads 
into the small and mid-sized channel, 
where penetration of credit risk 
management products is low.

was driven by higher penetration of loan 
origination software, as well as rising 
demand for customer segmentation 
and account management tools. 
Marketing Services
There was very strong growth at 
Marketing Services, where organic 
revenue increased by 56%. Growth 
reflected a significant increase in 
new business wins for data and data 
enhancement. 
Financial review
Revenue was US$462m for Latin 
America, up 51% at constant exchange 
rates, reflecting the first full-year 
contribution from Serasa (Serasa was 
acquired in June 2007). Organic revenue 
growth was 18%.
EBIT in the year was US$118m, up 67% 
at constant exchange rates. The EBIT 
margin was 25.5% (2008: 23.1%). The 
margin improvement reflects strong 
positive operating leverage.

Business review
At constant currency, there was good progress during the year across 
UK and Ireland, notwithstanding exceptionally challenging market 
conditions for financial services clients. Performance benefited from 
growth in non-financial verticals, good demand for countercyclical 
products and further market penetration at Consumer Direct. Strong 
execution on cost efficiency measures helped to deliver a significant 
uplift in margins of 150 basis points.

ScottishPower is one of the largest energy companies in the UK and 
provides gas and electricity to over five million customers, including 
businesses of every type and size. The profitable expansion of this 
commercial customer base means having the confidence that new 
customers will honour their credit commitments. 
In 2008, ScottishPower signed a three-year contract for access to 
Experian’s comprehensive business information database. The energy 
company also introduced Experian’s application processing system, 
Commercial Autoscore, in order to automate credit decisions using 
its own credit evaluation criteria. This has ensured fast, accurate and 
consistent decision-making across multiple ScottishPower locations. 
Mark Fawcitt of ScottishPower: “Experian has enabled us to 
understand and control the level of risk within our commercial 
customer base. Its in-depth information on businesses is especially 
valuable in helping to manage risk.”

Credit Services
The major disruption in the financial 
services industry during the year 
caused a significant reduction 
in lending as well as major client 
consolidations. Total revenue for Credit 
Services was flat at constant exchange 
rates, while organic revenue declined 
by 2%. The relatively modest rate of 
decline was reflective of growth in 
non-financial verticals such as public 
sector and utilities, growth in revenue 
from countercyclical initiatives and a 
resilient performance within business 
information. Strategic initiatives during 
the year included further investment in 
sales infrastructure across the public 
sector and utilities verticals, and re-
orientation of existing sales resource 
towards countercyclical opportunities.
Decision Analytics
Total revenue at Decision Analytics 
increased by 9% at constant exchange 
rates, with organic revenue growth 
of 6%. The acquisition contribution 
related to Tallyman and N4 Solutions, 
both of which performed ahead of plan.  
Growth was driven by strong demand 
for countercyclical products, including 
fraud prevention and collections 
software, and there was good progress 
in non-financial verticals such as 
telecommunications and public sector. 
During the year, there were large 
contract wins with Anglian Water and 
Vanquis Bank, for example.
 
Marketing Services
Total revenue in Marketing Services 
decreased by 2% at constant exchange 
rates. Organic revenue declined by 
3%. Traditional marketing activities 
were further affected by the downturn 
in the financial services market. New 
media activities performed well, with 
double-digit growth across contact 
data management, email services and 
online competitive intelligence. There 
was good strategic progress during 
the year across new media, with further 
penetration of the public sector by 
the Mosaic segmentation tool and 
enhancements to contact data tools.
Interactive
Interactive performed strongly, 
delivering organic revenue growth of 
47%. Growth was driven by increased 
direct memberships, reflecting 
product enhancements, greater 
market segmentation and investment 
in branding and customer acquisition. 
Experian has also made good progress 
in growing indirect memberships with 
a number of affinity partnership wins in 
the year. 
Financial review
Revenue from continuing activities was 
US$850m, up 5% at constant exchange 
rates. Organic revenue growth was 3%.  
The contribution to revenue growth from 
acquisitions during the period was 2%. 
The acquisition contribution related to 
T allyman, N4 Solutions, pH Group and 
Hitwise.
EBIT from continuing activities was 
US$213m, up 10% at constant exchange 
rates. The EBIT margin was 25.1% 
(2008: 23.6%). The improvement in 
margin was due to strong execution 
on cost efficiency initiatives, including 
outsourcing to India, organisational 
delayering and technology efficiencies.
Social, ethical and 
environmental (SEE) risks  
and opportunities 
The UK and Ireland’s performance has
been recognised with two awards from
the charity ‘Business in the Community’.
The region has again achieved
environmental certification to ISO14001,
the most stringent international
measure of environmental management.
Investment in products with strong
social and environmental aspects will
make a demonstrable contribution in the
new financial year.

Birmingham City Council is the largest local authority in Europe, 
serving over one million residents. The council has recently embarked 
upon a highly ambitious business transformation programme that 
is set to revolutionise the way services are delivered to the people of 
Birmingham. It is expected to save the city a total of £1billion over ten 
years through more cost-effective ways of working.
Driving this transformation project is a rich understanding of 
Birmingham’s customers, supported by Experian. The city’s 
population has been segmented into 12 distinct customer groups, 
each with its own shared characteristics and public service needs. 
This unique segmentation system will enable the council to target 
resources with much greater precision, ensuring that individual 
communities increasingly receive the type of service they require. It 
is also helping “join up” services to meet the diverse demands and 
preferences of Birmingham’s population.
Paul Tilsley, Deputy Leader of Birmingham City Council: “Our 
business transformation project has to be driven by a deep insight into 
Birmingham people’s needs and preferences - we are delighted that 
Experian is helping us to develop this insight.”

China UnionPay Data (CUP Data) is the largest provider of credit 
card data processing services in China.  During the past two years, 
CUP Data and Experian have established a strategic partnership 
aimed at providing the Chinese banking industry with international 
best practices in credit risk management. 
China Minsheng Bank Credit Card Center is one of several major 
banks to utilise Experian’s comprehensive credit decisioning 
service through CUP Data’s card processing systems. The service 
allows banks to implement comprehensive and effective credit risk 
management quickly through the technical platforms of CUP Data, 
reducing credit risk and preventing fraudulent transactions.
Yang Ke, General Manager of China Minsheng Bank Credit Card

eBay is a global online marketplace, with 233 million registered users 
worldwide, where practically anyone can trade practically anything. In 
the Netherlands, eBay has built one of the most successful markets for 
the sale of used cars and the company is continually looking for ways 
to improve its service to consumers and dealers.
During the year, eBay joined forces with Experian to create an 
important new facility on its Dutch website, Marktplaats.nl, that would 
ensure greater peace of mind for used car buyers. Every vehicle offered 
for sale on the site now comes with an Experian vehicle history check, 
including information about the number of previous owners and its 
officially recorded mileage. There is also helpful information about the 
cost of ownership and comparisons with other, similar vehicles.
Dick Gorris, Channel Manager at eBay: “Experian’s vehicle history 
check has strengthened our position in the used car market and made 
the process of buying a used car less of a gamble”.

Risks and uncertainties
Business review
Risks to Experian’s business are 
either specific to Experian’s business 
model, such as information security, 
or more general, such as the impact 
of competition. Experian has identified 
the following principal risks.
Data
The data that Experian holds may 
be inappropriately used
Experian has established rigorous 
information security policies, 
standards, procedures, and 
recruitment and training schemes, 
which are embedded throughout its 
business operations. Experian also 
screens new third party partners 
carefully and conducts targeted 
audits on their operations. The loss 
and/or potential misuse of consumer 
data is addressed through continued 
investment in IT security infrastructure, 
including the significant use of data 
and communications encryption 
technology.
Legislation or government 
regulations may alter what data 
Experian can collect and how it  
is collected
To the best of Experian’s knowledge, 
the Group is in compliance with 
data protection requirements in the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. 
Experian actively monitors its 
collection and use of personal data, 
while the Group’s legal, regulatory and 
government affairs departments work 
closely with senior management to 
adopt strategies to educate lawmakers 
and influence the public policy debate, 
where appropriate.  
T echnology
There could be security breaches 
of Experian’s systems or facilities
Experian’s data centres are protected 
against computer viruses or other 
purposeful attacks, such as physical 
break-ins or hacking. To mitigate the 
risk from insecure systems, Experian 
has strict standards, procedures 
and training schemes for technology 
services, physical security and 
information security.
Business processes or systems  
could fail
Failures to plan, resource, test or 
adequately respond to major incidents 
could put Experian at risk of breaching 
client contracts and services levels, 
loss of revenue and reputation damage.  
Experian’s data centres are protected 
against damage from fire, power loss, 
telecommunications failure, natural 
disaster, and hardware or software 
malfunction. Experian maintains 
full duplication of all information 
contained in databases and runs back-
up data centres. The Group also has 
established support arrangements 
with third party vendors and strict 
standards, procedures and training 
schemes for business continuity.  
Whilst the probability of disaster 
events occurring is generally low, the 
geographic diversity of the business 
means that Experian is in a position to 
respond effectively to both larger and 
smaller scale incidents.
People
Experian is dependent upon highly 
skilled personnel, especially its  
senior management and other 
experienced staff
Loss of these people could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s ability 
to deliver its corporate objectives. 
Experian aims to provide compensation 
and benefits that are competitive with 
other leading companies, as well as 
fulfilling future career opportunities.
Experian identifies a number of risks to its business activities 
which it seeks to anticipate, assess regularly and over which it 
seeks to introduce internal controls to ensure that such risks are 
appropriately mitigated. The corporate governance statement 
contained in this report provides further detail on this enterprise 
risk management process.   29 Experian Annual Report 2009
Introduction 
2 – 7
Business review
Risks and uncertainties
Governance
44 – 72
Financial statements
73 – 148
29
General economy
Macro economic factors impact  
the demand for customer credit  
in particular
Experian could be adversely affected 
by worsening economic conditions 
globally or in certain individual markets 
such as the United Kingdom or United 
States.  However, prudent expense 
management along with the breadth of 
Experian’s portfolio by geography, by 
product, by sector and by client partly 
reduces the impact of this risk. 
Consolidation among Experian’s 
clients may cause price 
compression and a reduction  
in its revenue and profits
No single client accounts for more 
than 2% of Experian’s revenue, which 
reduces the probability of this potential 
risk having a significant impact on 
the business. However, in light of the 
global economic downturn, Experian 
continues to respond with a wide 
range of countercyclical products and 
solutions, across all relevant business 
lines.
Experian could fail to protect 
adequately against its exposure to 
financial risks
Experian’s financial risk management 
focuses on the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on 
the Group’s financial performance. 
Counterparties could fail
Counterparty risk is a new principal 
risk.  Experian’s ability to engage 
in routine transactions to fund its 
operations and manage its risks 
could be adversely affected by 
the commercial soundness of our 
counterparties.  We continue to 
monitor counterparty positions 
regularly. Treasury and insurance 
activities are conducted only with 
financial and insurance institutions 
with strong credit ratings, within limits 
set for each organisation.  
Other risks
Experian could face increased 
competition, especially in the credit 
reporting industry
Experian mitigates this risk through 
continued research and investment in 
people, technology and products as 
prioritised by its strategic plan.
Acquisitions may not meet 
expectations
Experian assesses all acquisitions 
rigorously, using both in-house 
experts and professional advisers. In 
addition, the Group conducts extensive 
post-acquisition reviews to ensure 
performance remains consistent with 
the acquisition buy-plan.
The outcome of litigation could be 
unfavourable to Experian
Experian carries insurance and 
employs expert legal personnel in-
house, as well as retaining the services 
of several leading legal practices, to 
assist in the effective management and 
disposal of legal proceedings.  
Experian could fail to protect 
adequately its valuable intellectual 
property rights or face claims 
for intellectual property right 
infringement
Experian seeks patent protection and 
appropriate agreements regarding 
its intellectual property rights, 
where appropriate and feasible, and 
continues to monitor this situation. 
Experian is dependent upon highly 
skilled personnel, especially its  
senior management and other 
experienced staff 30 Experian Annual Report 2009
Financial review
Business review
The Group made further sound financial progress in a very 
challenging year with good revenue, profit and cash performance.
Revenue and profit performance
Group revenue from continuing 
operations increased by 2% from 
US$3,789m to US$3,873m, including 
the benefit of acquisitions. At constant 
exchange rates, Group revenue from 
continuing operations grew by 8%.
Profit before tax increased by 11%, from 
US$521m in the year ended 31 March 
2008 to US$578 in the year ended  
31 March 2009.
Benchmark PBT for continuing 
operations rose by US$60m to 
US$843m (2008: US$783m). At 
constant exchange rates, EBIT from 
continuing operations increased by 8% 
to US$939m. This increase arose from 
the increase in revenue in continuing 
operations, together with the benefit of 
the Group’s previously announced cost 
reduction programme.
T axation 
The Group’s effective rate of tax for the 
year based on Benchmark PBT was 
21.8% (2008: 23.4%). This rate is defined 
as the total tax expense adjusted for 
the tax impact of non-Benchmark 
items and further excluding the benefit 
of a one-off corporation tax credit of 
US$20m (2008: US$nil) that relates 
to arrangements involving entities no 
longer part of the Group, divided by 
Benchmark PBT . The Group’s cash tax 
rate for continuing operations (based 
on tax paid in the year and Benchmark 
PBT for continuing operations) was 
4.6% (2008: 10.1%).
Earnings and dividends  
per share
Basic earnings per share were 48.0 US 
cents (2008: 43.3 US cents), including  
1.2 US cents (2008: 2.2 US cents) in 
respect of discontinued operations. 
Benchmark earnings per share 
increased to 62.3 US cents from  
57.5 US cents last year. 
The board has announced a second 
interim dividend of 13.25 US cents per 
ordinary share (2008: 12.00 US cents), 
giving a total dividend per share of  
20.00 US cents for the full year  
(2008: 18.50 US cents), an increase 
of 8%, which is covered 3.1 times by 
Benchmark earnings per share.
Share price and total equity
The share price of Experian ranged 
from a low of 274.75p to a high of 453.25p 
during the year. On 31 March 2009, the 
mid market price was 436.75p, giving a 
market capitalisation of US$6.4bn at 
that date (2008: US$7.4bn).
Total equity at 31 March 2009 amounted 
to US$1,899m (2008: US$2,117m), which 
is equivalent to US$1.87 per share (2008: 
US$2.09), excluding own shares held by 
employee trusts.
Actuarial losses of US$202m in 
respect of defined benefit pension 
plans and currency translation losses 
of US$428m, mainly as a result of the 
weakening of sterling, have contributed 
to the decrease in total equity during 
the year. 
Cash flow, net debt and funding
The Group seeks to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
its foreseeable needs and to invest 
its cash assets safely and profitably. 
It has continued to be strongly cash 
generative in the year with operating 
cash flow of US$927m (2008: US$886m) 
and a cash flow conversion of 99%.  
As indicated in the table below, the 
Group’s free cash flow in the year ended 
31 March 2009 was US$743m compared 
with US$665m in 2008.
Free cash flow was used to fund 
acquisitions of US$179m and equity 
dividends of US$189m. Cash outflow 
from exceptional items amounted to 
US$102m. The net cash inflow for the 
year was US$428m (2008: US$1,277m 
outflow). 
At 31 March 2009, net debt was 
US$2,110m (2008: US$2,699m). The 
maturity, currency and interest rate 
profiles of the Group’s loans and 
borrowings are shown in note 26 to 
the Group financial statements. Debt 
maturities are spread over the next five 
years, to avoid excessive concentration 
of refinancing needs. At 31 March 2009 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
totalled US$1,050m (2008: US$1,121m). 
There have been no defaults under any 
covenants given on the Group’s loans 
and borrowings in the current or the 
prior year.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, 
6.375% Eurobonds 2009 with a par 
value of £147m were redeemed out of 
free cash flow. The balance of these 
Eurobonds, which was £203m at 31 
March 2009, falls due for repayment in 
July 2009. It is expected that this will be 
funded from drawings under existing 
committed borrowing facilities.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, the 
Group’s net interest expense was 
US$96m (2008: US$125m). This expense 
is stated after crediting US$17m (2008: 
US$23m) in respect of the expected 
return on pension assets over the 
interest on pension liabilities. The 
reduction of US$35m in the other 
elements of the Group’s net interest 
expense stems from the environment of 
declining global interest rates together 
with the benefit of the Group’s strong 
cash flow performance. 31 Experian Annual Report 2009

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the national airline carrier of the 
Netherlands, serving over 23 million passengers each year and flying 
to 146 destinations worldwide. KLM’s leisure customers typically travel 
just a few times a year, so a major challenge for the airline is keeping 
customers engaged and loyal between flights.   
One of the keys to KLM’s success has been the ability to reach 
customers with timely and relevant email communications. These 
messages include anything from contacting active customers with 
updates on their flights to providing customers and prospects 
with personalised offers, based on their stated preferences. Using 
Experian’s email marketing technology, multi-language capabilities 
and analytical tools, KLM is able to keep regularly in touch with 
customers all over the world, in a language they understand and with 
offers that are relevant to their circumstances.  
Emilie Hardick, Manager Email Marketing at KLM: “Our use of 
permission-based email is translating into stronger and more 
profitable customer relationships. Working with Experian, email has 
become our most cost-effective channel of communication.”

Capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals
Capital expenditure incurred on 
continuing activities in 2009 was 
US$305m, US$16m lower than last year. 
Such expenditure was equivalent to 
108% of the depreciation charge in 2009.
 
Acquisition expenditure amounted 
to US$179m (2008: US$1,720m). 
During the year, the Group completed 
a number of small acquisitions, 
including SearchAmerica, a leading 
provider of data and analytics to 
the US healthcare industry, and 
KreditInform, a commercial credit 
information and analytics provider 
in South Africa, and settled deferred 
consideration of US$59m in respect 
of prior year acquisitions. In addition, 
the Group purchased a 40% stake in 
DP Information Group, a credit bureau 
in Singapore, and invested in a joint 
venture in Japan with CCB.
On 31 October 2008, the Group received 
US$203m on completion of the disposal 
of the transaction processing business 
in France, after settlement of working 
capital and net debt. These funds 
were used to pay down existing loan

Sberbank is Russia’s largest bank, with over 6.5 million retail 
customers, served through more than 750 branches and 20,000 sales 
offices. The ability to maintain tight control of lending decisions 
across such a large network is a major priority for the bank.  
During 2008, Sberbank began a multi-stage project to implement 
Experian’s full suite of Strategy Management systems in order to 
centralise the control of its lending strategy and enhance decision-
making at each stage of the bank’s relationship with customers. 
Strategy Management will be used for deciding whether to accept 
customer applications and on what terms, monitoring customer 
performance and determining the best time to offer new products  
and, if accounts fall into arrears, deciding on the appropriate  
follow-up actions.
Vadim Kulik, Director of Sberbank’s Centre for Development of 
Centralised Retail Credit Back-Office: “Experian is providing Sberbank 
with the most advanced analytical technologies to control our lending 
operations. These will give us much greater control of risk, while 
increasing our business effectiveness and enabling us to automate 
millions of decisions each year. For our customers, it will mean we can 
make faster decisions and offer products that are more relevant to their 
individual needs and circumstances.”

Accounting policies, estimates 
and assumptions
The principal accounting policies used 
by the Group are shown in note 2 to 
the Group financial statements. These 
include details of critical estimates and 
assumptions, the most significant of 
which relate to tax, pension benefits, 
goodwill and financial instruments.
The estimates made in respect of 
the Group’s tax assets and liabilities 
include the consideration of 
transactions in the ordinary course 
of business for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain.
The recognition of pension assets 
and obligations involves the selection 
of appropriate actuarial assumptions 
and changes therein may impact on 
the amounts disclosed in the Group 
balance sheet and the Group income 
statement. At 31 March 2009 the 
Group has a net pension liability of 
US$58m (2008: asset of US$132m). This 
consists of a deficit in the Experian 
defined benefit plan of US$19m (2008: 
surplus of US$182m) and other pension 
obligations of US$39m (2008: US$50m). 
Further details of the defined benefit 
plan are included in note 28 to the 
Group financial statements.
Goodwill is allocated to cash 
generating units. The assumptions 
used in the cash flow projections 
underpinning the impairment testing 
of goodwill include assumptions in 
respect of profitability and future 
growth, together with pre-tax discount 
rates specific to the geographical 
segments in which the Group operates. 
These assumptions are set out in 
further detail on page 88.
The assumptions in respect of the 
valuation of the put option associated 
with the remaining 30% stake of Serasa 
Experian are set out in note 25(d) to the 
Group financial statements.
 Financial risk management
The risks and uncertainties that are 
specific to Experian’s business model 
together with more general risks 
are set out on pages 28 and 29. As 
indicated therein, the Group’s financial 
risk management focuses on the 
unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance. 
The Group seeks to reduce its 
exposures to foreign exchange, 
interest rate and other financial risks 
and full disclosures in respect of such 
risks, as required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’, are included 
within the notes to the Group financial 
statements.
Business review
Financial review continued
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s reported profit can be 
significantly affected by currency 
movements. In the year ended 31 March 
2009 approximately 33% of the Group’s 
EBIT from continuing operations was 
earned in currencies other than the US 
dollar, of which approximately 19% was 
attributable to sterling and 8% to the 
Brazilian real. 
The Group is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk from future commercial 
transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities and investments in, and loans 
between, entities with different functional 
currencies. The Group manages such 
risk, primarily within entities whose 
functional currencies are sterling, 
by borrowing in the relevant foreign 
currencies and by using forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The principal 
transaction exposures are to the US 
dollar and the euro. There have been 
no significant transaction exposures in 
respect of the Brazilian real.
The Group has investments in entities 
with other functional currencies, 
whose net assets are exposed to 
foreign exchange translation risk. In 
order to reduce the impact of currency 
fluctuations on the value of such 
entities, the Group has a policy of 
borrowing in US dollars and euros, as 
well as in sterling, and of entering into 
forward foreign exchange contracts in 
the relevant currencies. 35 Experian Annual Report 2009

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate exposure 
is managed by the use of fixed and 
floating rate borrowings and by the 
use of interest rate swaps to adjust 
the balance of fixed and floating rate 
liabilities. The Group also mixes the 
duration of its borrowings and interest 
rate swaps to smooth the impact of 
interest rate fluctuations.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
managed by dealing only with banks 
and financial institutions with strong 
credit ratings, within limits set for each 
organisation. Dealing activity is closely 
controlled and counterparty positions 
are monitored regularly.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains long-term 
committed facilities to ensure it has 
sufficient available funds for operations 
and planned expansions. The Group 
monitors rolling forecasts of projected 
cash flows to ensure that it will have 
adequate undrawn committed facilities 
available.
Capital risk management and 
going concern
The Group’s objectives in managing 
capital are to safeguard its ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure 
and cost of capital. 
    
In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or 
sell assets to reduce net debt. As part 
of its internal reporting processes 
the Group monitors capital employed 
by geographical segment. For this 
purpose, capital employed excludes net 
debt and taxation balances. The Group 
manages its working capital in order 
to meet its target for the conversion of 
at least 85% of its EBIT into operating 
cash flow. This target forms one of its 
key performance indicators.
 
The board has formed a judgment 
at the time of approving the financial 
statements that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. In arriving at this 
conclusion the board has taken account 
of current and anticipated trading 
performance, together with the current 
and anticipated levels of net debt and the 
availability of the committed borrowing 
facilities detailed above. For this reason, 
the going concern basis continues to be 
adopted in the preparation of the Group 
and the Company financial statements.
Exceptional items  
Expenditure of US$92m arose in 
the year in connection with the 
Group’s strategic programme of cost 
efficiency measures. Of this, US$51m 
related to redundancy and US$34m 
related to offshoring activities, other 
restructuring and infrastructure 
consolidation costs. The programme 
of cost efficiency measures is now 
expected to deliver annualised savings 
of approximately US$150m, of which 
US$80m has been realised in the 
current year. Total exceptional costs of 
this programme are now expected to 
be in the region of US$170m.  
During the year Experian initiated the 
closure of its Canadian credit bureau 
and is in discussions to terminate the 
joint venture in Japan.
Demerger and related restructuring 
costs comprise legal and professional 
fees, together with costs in connection 
with the cessation of a number of 
subsidiaries of the former GUS plc. 36 Experian Annual Report 2009
Business review
Financial review continued
Other non-GAAP measures 
IFRS requires that, on acquisition, 
specific intangible assets are identified 
and recognised separately from 
goodwill and then amortised over their 
useful economic lives. These include 
items such as customer relationships, 
completed technology, data provider 
relationships, trademarks and brand 
names, to which value is first attributed 
at the time of acquisition. The Group 
has excluded amortisation of these 
acquisition intangibles from its 
definition of Benchmark PBT because 
such a charge is based on judgements 
about their value and economic life.
A goodwill adjustment of US$1m 
arose in accordance with IFRS3 
‘Business Combinations’ following 
the recognition of a benefit in respect 
of previously unrecognised tax losses 
relating to prior year acquisitions. The 
corresponding tax benefit reduced the 
tax charge in the year by US$1m. The 
equivalent adjustment in the prior year 
was US$2m.
The charge in respect of the demerger-
related equity incentive plans relates 
to one-off grants made to senior 
management and all other staff levels 
at the time of demerger under a number 
of equity incentive plans. The cost of 
these one-off grants is being charged 
to the Group income statement over 
the five years following the demerger, 
but is excluded from the definition of 
Benchmark PBT . The cost of all other 
grants is charged to the Group income 
statement and included in the definition 
of Benchmark PBT .

An element of Experian’s derivatives 
is ineligible for hedge accounting. 
Gains or losses on such derivatives 
arising from market movements, 
together with gains and losses on put 
options in respect of acquisitions, 
are credited or charged to the Group 
income statement. The credit for the 
year includes a credit of US$21m (2008: 
US$69m) in respect of the revaluation 
of the Serasa put option liability. The 
gain in respect of the valuation arising 
in the current year relates primarily to 
an increase in the Brazilian risk free 
rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation 
model.
Use of non-GAAP financial 
information 
Experian has identified certain 
measures that it believes will assist 
understanding of the performance 
of the Group. As the measures are 
not defined under IFRS they may not 
be directly comparable with other 
companies’ adjusted measures. The 
non-GAAP measures are not intended 
to be a substitute for, or superior to, any 
IFRS measures of performance. Certain 
non-GAAP measures identified by the 
Group are shown in note 2 to the  
Group financial statements. 
Further non-GAAP measures and 
reconciliations of those measures are

Discontinuing activities: Experian 
defines discontinuing activities as 
businesses sold, closed or identified 
for closure during a financial year.  
These are treated as discontinuing 
activities for both revenue and EBIT 
purposes. Prior periods, where shown, 
are restated to disclose separately 
the results of discontinuing activities. 
This financial measure differs 
from the definition of discontinued 
operations set out in IFRS 5, under 
which a discontinued operation is a 
component of an entity that has either 
been disposed of, or is classified as 
held for sale, and is: (i) a separate major 
line of business or geographical area of 
operations; (ii) part of a single plan to 
dispose of a major line of business or 
geographical area of operations; or (iii) 
a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a 
view to resale.
Continuing activities: Businesses 
trading at 31 March 2009 that have 
not been disclosed as discontinuing 
activities are treated as continuing 
activities. 
Organic growth: This is the year-on-
year change in continuing activities 
revenue, at constant exchange rates, 
excluding acquisitions (other than 
affiliate credit bureaux) until the first 
anniversary date of consolidation. 
Direct business: Direct business 
refers to Experian’s business exclusive 
of the financial results of associates 
(including FARES).
Constant exchange rates: In order to 
illustrate its organic performance, 
Experian discusses its results in 
terms of constant exchange rate 
growth, unless otherwise stated. This 
represents growth calculated as if the 
exchange rates used to determine the 
results had remained unchanged from 
those used in the previous year.
Free cash flow: Free cash flow is 
derived from operating cash flow by 
excluding net interest and tax paid 
together with dividends paid to minority 
shareholders.

Barclays is a major global financial services provider with over 300 
years of history and expertise in banking, and more than 48 million 
customers and clients worldwide. Successfully managing customers 
who have fallen into arrears and who may be in financial difficulty is an 
important concern for the bank.
In the UK, Barclays chose Experian’s Tallyman debt management and 
collection system to improve collections for retail banking customers 
in arrears on their mortgages, current accounts and unsecured loans. 
Tallyman is enabling Barclays to take a much more proactive approach 
in rehabilitating these customers, while minimising the amount of debt 
that is written off.
Peter Frost, Operations Director, Barclays PLC: “In today’s financial 
environment it is essential to employ best practice systems to manage 
customers who might be getting into difficulties. Working with 
Experian, we are improving our collections performance through being 
able to apply the most appropriate treatment for each customer at the 
right time. We have also been able to automate many aspects of the 
collections process, which has made decision-making both faster and 
more cost-effective.”

Business as usual: Further embed 
CR principles into normal business 
processes, taking account of the 
potential social benefits and risks, and 
the impact on climate change.
Focusing the community programme:  
Create a focused approach for 
major projects, funded with central 
monies, but retain local flexibility for 
regional funds to encourage employee 
engagement.
Big Ideas: Use CR to provide a catalyst 
for entrepreneurial ‘big ideas’; products 
or services that can have a major social 
or environmental impact.
The following provides a review of 
progress against both strategic 
objectives and the six specific 
responsibilities. It also demonstrates 
how consideration of social, ethical and 
environmental issues is contributing 
to key resources and core business 
goals. It shows the direction Experian’s 
corporate responsibility programme is 
taking and gives an insight into the CR 
vision and strategy for the year ending 
March 2010.
Our six responsibilities
Data
Products and services
Consumers
Being a good employer
Minimising impacts on the 
environment
Playing an active part in communities
Use and protect data properly, respecting all the relevant laws, 
helping evolve industry guidelines and new legislation, and 
ensuring a culture of compliance with the highest standards of 
integrity. 
Create social and economic benefit through our products, 
services and capabilities, balancing commercial benefit with 
consumers’ rights and needs. 
Inform and empower consumers, and ensure that those who 
interact directly with our company receive fair and honest 
treatment. 
Be a good employer to all, establishing a set of expected 
behaviours and values, aiming to ensure that everyone working 
for us is treated fairly and given the maximum opportunity to 
fulfil their potential, and ensuring that all our workplaces are 
safe and healthy.
Minimise as far as possible the environmental impacts 
associated with our business and enable employee 
participation, with a particular concentration on the reduction 
of energy use and its effect on global warming. 
Play an active part in social and economic regeneration in our 
communities, be they local, national or global.

Experian’s aim is to make the business more sustainable from a 
social, ethical and environmental (SEE) perspective. The Group 
developed a framework of six key responsibilities in 2007 and a core 
strategy followed in 2008, strongly linked to elements of the wider 
business strategy.  41 Experian Annual Report 2009

The Group considers its  
marketplace responsibilities  
to be particularly material
Experian’s particular focus
Experian’s framework for reporting 
follows the well-recognised pattern 
of responsibilities to the marketplace, 
workplace, environment and 
community. The Group considers its 
marketplace responsibilities to be 
particularly material and so includes 
within these its consideration of 
consumers, its responsibility to develop 
products and services with a strong 
social benefit and, most importantly, 
its good stewardship of data. Being 
a good employer is vital since people 
are a key resource and this is linked 
to good relationships with local 
communities. Strong environmental 
management is seen as an essential 
means of controlling cost and engaging 
employees, so is increasingly factored 
into decisions.
The table here shows what the  
Group set out to achieve this year in 
each key area of responsibility and the 
progress made. 
Strategic progress in CR and 
links with business strategy
This is only the second full year of 
development for the CR programme at 
Experian, but the aim is for it to become 
second nature in the way the Group 
conducts business, considering the 
longer-term nature of its decisions 
and its impact on society and the 
environment.
Achieving this is a lengthy process, 
but during the year there were specific 
achievements against the goals set for 
each strand of the strategy.
Objective Achievements
Further evolve 
understanding of CR 
across the Group 
and embed CR into 
decision-making 
processes
–  Regional teams established in two new regions, 
with all regions now engaged
–  Stakeholder engagement with clients, suppliers, 
employees and key external agencies
–  Where not already captured, SEE risks are being 
built into risk registers
Business as usual - embedding CR 
Embedding considerations of SEE 
risks into standard processes supports 
Experian’s investment in its key 
resources, specifically 
–  data resources and the technology to 
manage them;
– people and their continued loyalty. 42 Experian Annual Report 2009
Business review
Corporate responsibility continued
CR contributing to the wider 
business goals 
Experian’s vision of becoming a 
necessary part of every major consumer 
economy in the world necessitates 
growth and, in the economic climate 
of the last two years, sustainability is 
being seen as an important element in 
the profitability of this growth.
Growth brings risks as well as 
opportunities and the CR agenda 
addresses these from a SEE 
perspective, helping Experian to 
consider the longer term and the 
reaction of society to its decisions. 
In the last two years, Experian’s aim  
has been to: “Increase global reach 
by expanding its global network and 
extending its existing capabilities into 
new geographic and vertical markets”.
As part of this growth the  
EMEA/Asia Pacific region has seen 
considerable expansion. T o parallel this, 
Experian has extended the reach of its 
CR reporting of non-financial data to 
include China, Australia, South Africa 
and most of its smaller European offices 
for the first time this year. 
There is strong commitment from 
regional management: in EMEA the 
senior management team have all been 
requested to include a CR-focused 
objective in their personal goals for 
the next fiscal year. In Asia Pacific CR 
has recently been used as a subject for 
discussion with employees across the 
region and the senior management have 
supported a bid for central funds for a 
community project in China. 
A further element of Experian’s growth 
strategy is to: “Innovate to stay ahead 
by promoting its culture of innovation 
and investing in new data sources and 
enhanced analytics”.
The fund Experian provides for ‘Big 
Ideas’ through its central CR budget 
helps promote innovation to address 
social concerns – either by creating 
a new product or using a current 
product in a new way. Last year the fund 
supported an innovative development in 
microfinance and this year funds were 
allocated to the development of two 
products in new fields. One will support 
companies wanting to understand their 
position on employee diversity and plan 
actions to address any imbalance. The 
other will provide a means of engaging 
employees in managing their own 
carbon footprint. It is intended that both 
become commercially available in 2010.
Objective Achievements
Ensure appropriate 
proposals resonate 
with the strategic focus 
and fully utilise the 
funds available
–  100% of central budget utilised
–  All regions took up allocated funds
–  Over 75% of central budget available for 
community projects spent on projects 
with a focus on financial education and 
entrepreneurship
Objective Achievements
Support the process 
of discussions at a 
regional level to promote 
the development of the 
‘Big Ideas’ pipeline
–  Pipeline discussions held
–  Two new projects were identified involving 
products from the UK’s public sector business 
Focusing the community programme
Big Ideas - supporting social and  
environmental innovation 
Focusing the centrally-funded 
community programme on financial 
education and entrepreneurship 
supports business goals, provides 
long-term benefits for consumers and 
enables employees to see Experian’s 
contribution making an impact.
Experian’s expertise is in providing 
unique insight and improving decision 
making. Using these talents in a social 
and environmental capacity is something 
the Group is encouraging through its ‘Big 
Ideas’ programme, which in turn supports 
innovation and growth in new markets.

Supporting key resources
The three resources that Experian 
considers fundamental to its business 
are people, data and technology and all 
three feature in the CR responsibilities.
People
The people Experian employs need to 
believe in the way the Group is being 
managed, and social and ethical issues 
are top of mind. ‘Doing it Right’ is 
one of four behaviours expected and 
measured globally through a standard 
appraisal system. This year the Group 
has taken steps towards formally 
signing up to the UN Global Compact, 
ensuring policies and processes 
are aligned with Human Rights best 
practice. 
Despite Group cost efficiency 
measures, which included some 
redundancies, the engagement 
score, measured by the global people 
survey, improved by 3%. Loyalty is 
being encouraged partly through a 
further commitment to volunteering, 
exemplified by the UK’s ‘Inspire’ 
management development programme 
and the community involvement 
embedded in this, together with 
developments such as the ‘Experian 
Gift’,  which allows each UK and  
Ireland employee three days per year  
in business time for volunteering  
and has led to the hours donated  
almost doubling.  
Community donations from Experian 
have increased this year with central 
funds supporting regional projects to 
help support the projects employees 
believe to be important.
Data
Careful and secure data management is 
also being influenced by considerations 
for society. Data security is part of 
Experian’s culture, but the Group 
seeks continual improvement and 
has increased the resilience of its 
Information Security programme 
through a consistent approach in its 
practices and a reduction of complexity. 
Internal assessment programmes have 
been standardised across each region 
to further facilitate global reporting and 
tracking of potential issues. Experian 
continues to cover a wide area of risk 
analysis and routinely reviews activities 
by its resellers, vendors, clients, 
internal processes and new business 
initiatives. 
Technology
Investment in technology is ongoing  
but cost efficiencies are important.  
A major consideration in every 
technology procurement process 
now is not only the price tag but also 
the ecological performance of new 
hardware for data centres. Experian 
is also working to understand the 
approach its suppliers are taking 
to environmental  impacts and has 
launched a survey on its corporate 
website for suppliers and other 
stakeholders. 
Priorities for the coming year
Looking ahead, while challenges remain 
in the external environment, Experian’s 
focus is on investment to drive future 
growth. Continuing and improving the 
Group’s ability to see social, ethical and 
environmental risks and opportunities 
is an essential part of this growth 
strategy. 
A vision has been defined and 
endorsed by the board. Objectives have 
been set under the three strands of the 
CR strategy to achieve this vision:
Embedding CR 
–  By 2011 further embed SEE risks in 
the risk process and ensure each 
business unit is addressing them in 
their risk register.
–  Express SEE risks and opportunities, 
challenges and achievements more 
explicitly and communicate these to 
all employees.
Supporting social and 
environmental innovation 
–  Build SEE opportunity reviews into 
product development processes in  
at least one region by the year ending 
31 March 2010. 
–  Continue to provide funding for  
‘Big Ideas’ and publicise the 
programme internally.
Focusing the community 
programme
–  Evolve the community focus to 
include an element of sustainability 
for communities and spend at least 
75% of central funds available for 
community projects on this focus.
Experian’s full CR report can be found 
online at www.experiancrreport.com 
and a printed summary can also be 
downloaded from this site. 
Experian’s CR vision has been endorsed by the board.
– Experian’s working population understands the social, ethical and 
environmental risks associated with the business and standard processes 
take account of these on a day-to-day basis enabling the Group to create a 
stronger and more sustainable business model. 
– The opportunities social, ethical and environmental issues present 
are regularly reviewed and Experian considers how it can help other 
organisations become more sustainable with new products and services. 
– Experian uses its skills, information and expertise to best effect in 
interactions with its communities and helps them become more  
self sustaining. 44 Experian Annual Report 2009

listed in article 92 of the articles of 
association of the Company.  The 
Company may, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991, remove any director from 
office and elect another person in 
place of a director so removed. 
Articles of association 
The articles of association of the 
Company may be amended by the 
passing of a special resolution.
Restrictions on transfers of 
shares and/or voting rights
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities and/or 
voting rights and, apart from those 
matters described below, there are no 
restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company 
and/or voting rights: 
Certain restrictions on transfers  –
of shares may from time to time be 
imposed by law, for example, insider 
dealing regulations. In accordance 
with the Listing Rules of the UK 
Financial Services Authority, certain 
employees are required to seek the 
approval of the Company to deal in 
its shares.
Some of Experian’s share based  –
employee incentive plans include 
restrictions on transfer of shares while 
the shares are subject to the plan. 
A – s described in the report on 
directors’ remuneration, non-
executive directors receive a 
proportion of fees in shares which 
may not normally be transferred 
during a director’s period of office.
Where, under a share based  –
employee incentive plan operated 
by Experian, participants are the 
beneficial owners of the shares but 
not the registered owner, the voting 
rights are normally exercised by the 
registered owner at the direction of 
the participant.
No member shall, unless the  –

Governance
Corporate go vernance statement
As the Combined Code states, boards 
should set the values and standards 
for a company. Experian’s board is 
committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance and believes that 
such standards, which apply equally 
to Experian’s directors and employees, 
are critical to business integrity, 
performance and to maintaining 
investors’ trust in Experian. 
The Combined Code on  
Corporate Governance
The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance published by the UK 
Financial Reporting Council in June 
2006 sets out guidance on how 
companies should be directed and 
controlled to ensure good governance 
practice and is applicable to this 
reporting period.  The Financial 
Services Authority requires companies 
listed in the UK to disclose, in relation 
to Section 1 of the Combined Code, 
how they have applied its principles 
and whether they have complied 
with its provisions throughout the 
accounting year. This statement sets 
out details of how the Company has 
applied the principles and complied 
with the provisions of the Combined 
Code during the year ended 31 March 
2009. Further information on the 
Combined Code can be found on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website 
www.frc.org.uk. 
Statement of compliance
It is the board’s view that the Company 
has been compliant with the provisions 
set down in Section 1 of the Combined 
Code throughout the year ended 31 March 
2009. 
The board
The directors have responsibility to the 
Company’s shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately 
managed and that it achieves its 
objectives. The board meets regularly 
to determine the Company’s strategic 
direction, review the Company’s 
operating and financial performance 
and oversee that the Company is 
adequately resourced and effectively 
controlled. The specific duties of the 
board are clearly set out in a formal 
schedule of matters reserved to the 
board for decision. There is a wide 
range of corporate governance issues 
and items that are specifically reserved 
for decision by the board. Matters 
requiring board approval include:
The Group’s long-term objectives  –
and commercial strategy. 
The annual operating and capital  –
expenditure budgets and any 
material changes to them.
Acquisitions, disposals and other  –
transactions above delegated limits.
Major changes to the Group’s  –
capital structure, corporate 
structure, or any changes to the 
Company’s listing or its status as a 
public limited company.
Announcements of half-yearly and  –
preliminary results and interim 
management statements.
Dividend policy. –
T reasury policy, including entry into  –
banking facilities, foreign currency 
exposure and the use of financial 
derivatives.
Shareholder documentation.  –
The full schedule of matters reserved to 
the board is available from the Company 
Secretary on request and on the 
Experian website www .experianplc.com.
One of the Group’s key internal 
governance documents is the Global 
Delegated Authorities Matrix. This 
draws together the schedule of matters 
reserved to the board, the terms of 
reference for the board committees as 
well as authority levels for the Group’s 
principal operating subsidiaries, 
directors and senior executives. For 
those matters not specifically reserved 
to the board, the Matrix prescribes 
the cascade of authorities delegated 
throughout the Group by respective 
Group companies, together with the 
monetary limits of the delegations. 
Responsibility for approval of smaller 
acquisitions, disposals and other 
transactions has been delegated by 
the board to its principal operating 
subsidiaries. Approval of capital 
expenditure and revenue expenditure 
(within defined monetary limits) has 
also been delegated to the principal 
operating subsidiaries. The Company 
Secretary ensures that, at each of its 
meetings, the board receives reports 
on the activities of its committees and 
copies of minutes of the meetings of 
the principal operating subsidiaries to 
monitor the exercise of the delegations. 
The board and its committees operate 
in line with an agreed work plan. The 
January meeting focuses on strategy, 
the March meeting deals with the 
approval of operating budgets for 
the coming financial year and the 
May and November meetings cover 
the consideration of the annual 
financial statements and the half-
yearly financial report respectively. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer provide reports 
at all scheduled board meetings and 
senior executives below board level are 
often invited to make presentations 
to the board and participate in certain 
aspects of the strategy and budget 
reviews. 
The directors
The board currently comprises the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the President and Chief Operating 
Officer and six independent non-
executive directors. It is the current 
intention of the board to appoint an 
additional non-executive director at an 
appropriate time. Each non-executive 
director serves for a fixed term not 
exceeding three years that may be 
renewed by mutual agreement. Subject 
to the board being satisfied with a 
director’s performance, independence 
and commitment, each non-executive 
director may normally serve a 
maximum of three terms of three years.

Each director is required to have been 
elected by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting following his/her 
appointment by the board. Additionally, 
each director must be re-elected 
at least once every three years. The 
board’s policy is to appoint and retain 
non-executive directors who can apply 
their wider knowledge and experiences 
to their understanding of the Group. 
Experian’s non-executive directors 
are experienced and influential 
individuals from a range of industries 
and countries and, together, they bring 
an objective viewpoint and range of 
experience to the Company which 
ensures that no individual or group 
of individuals is able to dominate the 
board’s decision-making. In addition to 
their strengths of experience, diversity 
and an international perspective, the 
board also seeks to comply with the 
requirements of the Combined Code 
on the independence of non-executive 
directors. 
The Chairman and the  
Chief Executive Officer
The respective roles of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the board. The Chairman’s 
priority is the management of the 
board and the Chief Executive 
Officer’s primary role is the running 
of the Company’s businesses and the 
development and implementation of 
strategy. The Chairman’s commitment 
to the Company is two to three days 
per week and his main interests 
outside the Company are set out in 
his biographical details. The board 
believes that the Chairman continues 
to be able to carry out his duties and 
responsibilities effectively for the 
Company. 
Senior Independent Director
Under the Combined Code the board 
appoints one of the non-executive 
directors to act as senior independent 
director. The main responsibility of 
the Senior Independent Director 
is to be available to shareholders 
should they have concerns that they 
have been unable to resolve through 
normal channels, or when such 
channels would be inappropriate. 
The Senior Independent Director 
is also responsible for leading the 
board’s discussion on the Chairman’s 
performance and the appointment of 
a new chairman, when appropriate. 
Sir Alan Rudge served as Senior 
Independent Director throughout the 
year ended 31 March 2009.
Company Secretary 
All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, whose appointment and 
removal may be effected only with 
board approval. He is responsible 
for ensuring board procedures are 
followed and for advising the board, 
through the Chairman, on governance 
matters. 
Board meetings and  
directors’ attendance
The Company requires all directors 
to devote sufficient time to the work 
of the board and, wherever possible, 
to attend the meetings of the board 
and the committees on which they 
serve. In addition to the annual general 
meeting (which all directors attended), 
the board had six scheduled and one 
ad-hoc meeting during the year ended 
31 March 2009. For each scheduled 
board meeting, the directors meet over 
either a two or three day period and 
board committee meetings are also 
held during the time they are together. 
Structuring the board and committee 
meetings in this way enhances the 
effectiveness of the board and its 
committees; for details of board 
and committee meetings and their 
attendance by board members please

Attendance by individual directors at meetings of the board and its committees 52 Experian Annual Report 2009
The principal board committees also 
undertook an evaluation exercise 
which was similar in structure to the 
board evaluation. The feedback from 
those evaluations was discussed at the 
respective meetings of the principal 
committees. 
The performance of the Chairman was 
also reviewed and took into account the 
views of both the executive and non-
executive directors. The Chairman’s 
evaluation was managed by the Senior 
Independent Director who provided 
feedback to the Chairman. As part of 
the Chairman’s evaluation, the non-
executive directors met separately 
under the chairmanship of the Senior 
Independent Director. 
The executive directors were evaluated 
in respect of their duties through 
a separate process whereby the 
Chairman assessed all of the directors, 
having obtained feedback from the 
other directors.
Following the reviews, the directors 
have concluded that the board and 
its committees operate effectively. 
Additionally, the Chairman has 
concluded that each director 
contributes effectively and 
demonstrates full commitment to 
his/her duties. 
Information flow
Directors are fully briefed in advance 
of board and committee meetings 
on all matters to be discussed. The 
Chairman, with the assistance of the 
Company Secretary, ensures that 
directors are supplied in a timely 
manner with information in a form 
and of a quality to ensure they are 
fully briefed and to enable the board 
to discharge its duties effectively. 
Additional information is also provided 
to directors on a monthly basis. 
Board and committee 
effectiveness
The effectiveness of the board and 
its committees is vital to the success 
of the Group and the Company 
undertakes an evaluation each year 
in order to assess how well the board, 
its committees, the directors and the 
Chairman are performing. 
Following the independent review last 
year, this year’s board and committee 
reviews were conducted ‘in-house’ 
and were led by the Chairman with the 
support of the Company Secretary. 
All directors completed an online 
questionnaire evaluating board 
processes, effectiveness and where 
improvements may be considered. 
The questionnaire contained a range 
of questions and included free text 
boxes for additional comments. A 
report on the findings was presented 
to the board and the board and the 
nomination committee discussed the 
feedback received which included 
suggestions relating to board 
composition and induction and 
training. Positive comments were made 
around the progress that the board 
has made since the Company’s listing 
in October 2006, the effectiveness of 
the board and the relationship that 
exists between the board and senior 
management. 
In January and March 2009, the 
Chairman and the non-executive 
directors met as a group without the 
executive directors present.  At the 
end of the January 2009 meeting, the 
Chairman withdrew so that, under the 
leadership of the Senior Independent 
Director, the non-executive directors 
had the opportunity to discuss any 
appropriate issues and appraise the 
Chairman’s performance, taking 
account of the views expressed by 
the executive directors. Going forward, 
the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors intend to normally meet as a 
group without the executive directors 
present at the end of each scheduled 
board meeting.    
Independence
The Combined Code requires that 
at least half the board, excluding 
the Chairman, should comprise 
independent non-executive directors 
as determined by the board. It is the 
board’s view that an independent 
non-executive director needs to be 
able to present an objective, rigorous 
and constructive challenge to 
management, drawing on his/her wider 
experiences to question assumptions 
and viewpoints. T o be effective, an 
independent director needs to acquire 
a sound understanding of the industry 
and the Group so as to be able to 
evaluate properly the information 
provided. Having considered the 
matter carefully, the board is of the 
opinion that all of the current non-
executive directors are independent 
and free from any relationship or 
circumstances that could affect, or 
appear to affect, their independent 
judgement. Accordingly, over half of the 
directors, excluding the Chairman, are 
considered independent non-executive 
directors. 
Re-election
Each of the directors being proposed 
for re-election at the 2009 annual 
general meeting has been subject to a 
performance evaluation during the year 
ended 31 March 2009.

Induction and training
Following appointment, directors 
receive an induction programme, 
which includes business presentations 
from senior management, site visits 
and receipt of information about 
such matters as the operating 
procedures and activities of the 
Group, the governance structure of 
the Group, information on the duties 
and responsibilities of directors 
and information on dealing in the 
Company’s shares. The induction 
process is continued throughout the 
directors’ terms of office.  
The board believes strongly in the 
development of all Group employees 
and directors and it is a requirement 
of each director’s appointment that 
they commit to continue acquiring 
knowledge about the business. 
T o achieve this, directors are kept 
briefed on Experian’s business, the 
environment in which it operates and 
other matters throughout their period 
of office. The form that development 
takes is subject to the requirements of 
the directors. During the year, directors 
received a number of induction 
and training sessions ranging from 
an external presentation on risk 
management to internal presentations 
on the finance function, the finance 
systems of the Group, financial 
reporting and a number of the Group’s 
businesses. The board made a visit 
to the Group’s business in Brazil and 
met and received presentations from 
management and employees. Further 
visits to Group business locations are 
included in the board’s future meeting 
programme. 
There is a procedure in place whereby 
directors may, in the performance 
of their duties, seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense if considered appropriate. No 
director obtained any such independent 
professional advice during the year 
ended 31 March 2009.
Conflicts of interest
The articles of association of the 
Company were amended at the 2008 
annual general meeting to give the 
board the power to authorise conflicts, 
or potential conflicts, of interest. 
The authorisation procedure that 
the board adopted involved the issue 
of a questionnaire by the Company 
Secretary asking directors to identify 
any conflicts or potential conflicts, 
which were considered by the board 
at the next meeting. Directors are 
also required to advise the Company 
Secretary of any actual or potential 
conflicts as soon as they arise, so that 
they can be considered by the board 
at the next available opportunity. It is 
the board’s view that the Company’s 
procedures for ensuring that the 
board’s powers of authorisation of 
conflicts are operating effectively 
and that the procedures have been 
followed. 
Board committees
The principal board committees 
are the nomination committee, the 
remuneration committee and the audit 
committee. The committees operate 
within defined terms of reference 
which cover the authority delegated to 
them by the board. These can be found 
on the Experian website 
www.experianplc.com and are available 
from the Company Secretary upon 
request. The Company Secretary is 
secretary to all three committees. 
Throughout the year the chairman of 
each committee provided the board 
with a report of the issues considered 
at the meetings of the committees and 
the minutes of the committee meetings 
were circulated to the board. Reports 
of the activities of each of the principal 
board committees are set out on the 
following pages. 54 Experian Annual Report 2009
In accordance with the articles of 
association of the Company, directors 
are subject to election at the first 
annual general meeting following their 
appointment, and thereafter they must 
seek re-election no more than three 
years from the date they were last 
elected or re-elected. 
During the year, the committee 
recommended to the board the 
appointment of Chris Callero as an 
executive director. The board approved 
the recommendation and Mr Callero 
was appointed as a director on 1 April 
2009.

the search company and interviews 
prospective candidates who are, if 
thought suitable, recommended to the 
board, which makes the appointment.

the committee meets with the external 
auditors and internal audit executives 
without management present. 
The board is satisfied that at least 
one member of the audit committee 
has recent and relevant financial 
experience and is confident that the 
collective international business 
experience of the committee members 
enables them to act as an effective 
committee. The committee has access 
to the financial expertise of the Group 
and its auditors and the chairman 
of the audit committee is in regular

Corporate governance statement continued
Fraud and whistleblowing: The audit 
committee receives an annual report 
from internal audit on instances of 
actual or potential fraud, and concerns 
relating to the financial accounting 
of the Company. During the year, 
progress was also made to ensure 
continued publicity for the fraud and 
whistleblowing helpline.
Performance evaluation: The 
committee conducts a yearly 
evaluation of its performance. For 
2008, the review was coordinated by 
the Company Secretary on behalf of 
the audit committee chairman using 
an online software tool. The results of 
the evaluation were discussed at the 
September 2008 committee meeting. 
An area for future focus identified 
was the provision of further training 
opportunities for committee members 
and a plan has been put in place to 
address this issue. 
Internal controls and  
risk management
The board acknowledges that it is 
responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and 
can provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The board confirms that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group, 
including those risks relating to social, 
ethical and environmental matters. 
This process was in place throughout 
the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report 
and meets the requirements of the 
Combined Code. For certain joint 
arrangements, the board places 
reliance upon the systems of internal 
control operating within the partners’ 
infrastructure and the obligations 
upon partners’ boards relating to the 
effectiveness of their own systems. 
In the board’s view, the information 
it received was sufficient to enable 
it to review the effectiveness of the 
accounting records and financial 
statements that will ultimately be 
subject to external audit; management 
of or significant involvement in internal 
audit services; any work that could 
compromise the independence of 
the external auditors; and any other 
work that is prohibited by UK ethical 
guidance.
The policy includes financial limits 
above which the chairman of the audit 
committee must pre-approve any 
proposed non-audit services. The audit 
committee receives half-yearly reports 
containing details of assignments and 
related fees carried out by the external 
auditors in addition to their normal work. 
The Company’s policy has recently 
been amended to cap the payment, 
going forward, of non-audit fees to the 
Company’s auditors at 100% of fees for 
audit and assurance services, except in 
exceptional circumstances.
The audit committee has considered 
the evaluation of the external auditors, 
the proposed fee structure and the 
audit engagement terms for 2009 and 
is satisfied that the performance, 
contribution and commitment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are 
such that their re-appointment is 
merited. Accordingly, the committee 
has recommended to the board that the 
re-appointment of the external auditors 
be proposed to shareholders at the 
2009 annual general meeting.
Internal audit: At each committee 
meeting, the Head of Global Internal 
Audit presents an internal audit report, 
which includes details of any issues 
requiring the attention of the audit 
committee, an update on the work 
being performed by internal audit 
and details of the planned internal 
audit work programme. This year, the 
exercise to monitor and review the 
effectiveness of the internal audit 
function was overseen by Experian’s 
Group Corporate Secretariat, on behalf 
of the audit committee, to enable 
the committee to fulfil its Combined 
Code review obligation. The review 
concluded that the internal audit 
function is effective and adds value to 
the business. 
auditors is evaluated by the audit 
committee each year, with a particular 
focus this year on the robustness of 
the audit (including independence and 
quality control), quality of delivery 
and the quality of people and service. 
The audit committee determined that 
there was nothing to indicate that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP had not 
carried out an effective audit of the 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2008. 
Details of fees paid to the external 
auditors for the year are set out in note 
6 to the Group financial statements. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers provide 
a range of services to Experian 
(including non-audit services) and 
a policy has been adopted by the 
Company in relation to the provision of 
such services by the external auditors 
and can be summarised as follows. 
Provided that the provision of such 
services does not conflict with 
the external auditors’ statutory 
responsibilities and ethical guidance, 
the following types of services may be 
assigned to the external auditors:
Further assurance services: where 
the external auditors’ deep knowledge 
of the Group’s affairs means that 
they may be best placed to carry out 
such work. This may include, but is not 
restricted to, shareholder and other 
circulars, regulatory reports and work 
in connection with acquisitions and 
divestments.  
T axation services: where the external 
auditors’ knowledge of the Group’s 
affairs may provide significant 
advantages which other parties would 
not have. Where this is not the case, 
the work is put out to tender. 
General: in other circumstances, the 
external auditors may provide services 
provided that proposed assignments 
are put out to tender and decisions to 
award work are taken on the basis of 
demonstrable competence and cost 
effectiveness. However, the external 
auditors are specifically prohibited 
from performing work related to  57 Experian Annual Report 2009

Information and communication
The Group has a comprehensive  –
system of budgetary control, 
including monthly performance 
reviews for each major business. 
These reviews are at a detailed level 
within each region and at a high 
level for the board.
On a monthly basis, the achievement  –
of business objectives, both 
financial and non-financial, 
is assessed using a range of 
performance indicators. These 
indicators are regularly reviewed to 
ensure that they remain relevant and 
reliable.
The Group has whistleblowing  –
procedures in place for employees 
to report suspected improprieties.
Monitoring
A range of procedures is  –
used to monitor the effective 
application of internal control in 
the Group, including management 
assurance, through the ongoing 
risk management process, and 
independent assurance, through 
internal audit reviews and reviews 
by specialist third parties.
The internal audit department’s  –
responsibilities include reporting 
to the audit committee on the 
effectiveness of internal control 
systems, focusing on those areas 
considered to be of greatest risk to 
the Group.
Follow-up processes are used to  –
ensure appropriate response to 
changes and developments in risks 
and the control environment.
Senior management makes  –
presentations on risk to the audit 
committee, which reports regularly 
to the board on the risks facing the 
Group’s business.
The audit committee has delegated  –
responsibility from the board for 
reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls and 
receives an annual report on the 
controls over these risks. This 
includes risks arising from social, 
ethical and environmental matters.
The Group has in place a number of  –
strategic project committees, whose 
reviews are considered an essential 
part of the delegated authorities 
process. These committees have 
established processes, which 
include risk assessment as an 
integral component. 
The Group has in place a full-time  –
Global Enterprise Risk Manager.
Control environment and  
control activities
The Group has established  –
procedures and detailed matrices 
for delegated authority which ensure 
that decisions that are significant, 
either because of their value or the 
inherent degree of risk, are taken at 
an appropriate level.
The Group has implemented  –
appropriate strategies to deal with 
each significant risk that has been 
identified. These strategies include 
internal controls, insurance and 
specialised treasury instruments.
The Group sets out principles,  –
policies and standards to be 
adhered to throughout its business. 
These include risk identification, 
management and reporting 
standards, ethical principles and 
practice, accounting policies, 
treasury policy, information security 
policy and policy on fraud and 
whistleblowing. 
Group’s system of internal control in 
accordance with the ‘Internal Control 
Revised Guidance for Directors’ 
contained in the Combined Code. 
The audit committee has kept under 
review the effectiveness of this system 
of internal control and has reported 
regularly to the board.
The board reviews annually the 
effectiveness of the key procedures 
which have been established to provide 
internal control.
The key procedures, which operate 
throughout the year, are as follows:
Risk assessment
The Group sets out its objectives  –
clearly as part of its planning 
process and organisation design. 
These objectives are incorporated 
as part of the planning cycle and 
are supported by the use of both 
financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators.
Risks are methodically anticipated,  –
identified, assessed and 
appropriately mitigated as part of an 
enterprise-wide risk management 
process operating throughout 
the Group on an ongoing basis 
and headed by an executive risk 
management committee (‘ERMC’), 
supported by regional risk 
management committees (‘RRMC’).
The ERMC has responsibility  –
for oversight of the Group’s risk 
management process and monitors 
and evaluates the Group’s global 
risk profile. Responsibility for 
evaluation and mitigation of 
regional risks falls to the RRMC, 
to which Experian’s business units 
submit reports on a quarterly basis, 
detailing identified risks, associated 
mitigation strategies and the status 
of implemented action steps. 58 Experian Annual Report 2009
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued
by a poll. Shareholders also have the 
opportunity to send in questions prior 
to the annual general meeting. 
 
In line with the Combined Code, 
details of proxy voting by shareholders, 
including votes withheld, are made 
available on request and are placed on 
the Company’s website 
www.experianplc.com following the 
meeting. At the meeting, the Company 
complies with the Combined Code 
as it relates to voting, the separation 
of resolutions and the attendance of 
committee chairmen. All directors were 
present during the 2008 annual general 
meeting and met with shareholders 
on an informal basis before the main 
business of the meeting. In 2008, voting 
levels at the annual general meeting 
showed an increase to 56% of the 
issued share capital of the Company, 
compared with 54% in 2007. 
Engagement with shareholders  
and others
The Company places a high degree 
of importance on maintaining good 
relationships and communications 
with institutional investors, private 
investors and others and makes every 
effort to ensure that shareholders are 
kept informed of significant Company 
developments.
There is an ongoing programme of 
dialogue and meetings between the 
executive directors and institutional 
investors and analysts. At these 
meetings, a wide range of relevant 
issues including strategy, financial 
performance, management and 
governance are discussed within the 
constraints of the information already 
made public. The announcement of 
interim management statements, 
trading updates, half-year and annual 
results also provide opportunities for 
the Company to answer questions 
from analysts covering a wide range 
of topics. During the year, Experian’s 
investor relations team arranged 
a number of visits for investors to 
Experian operations, including in the 
USA and UK. 
T o assist members of the board to 
gain an understanding of the views 
of institutional shareholders, at each 
of its meetings the board receives 
an investor relations and media 
report, which covers a wide range of 
matters including a commentary on 
the perception of the Company and 
views expressed by the investment 
community, media reports, share price 
performance and analysis. 
The board is equally interested in the 
concerns of private shareholders and, 
on its behalf, the Company Secretary 
oversees communication with these 
investors. It is the practice of the 
Company to issue a ‘Shareholder 
Questions’ card with the annual 
general meeting documentation 
to enable shareholders to put 
relevant questions to the Company. 
Shareholders are also able to put 
questions to the Company via 
its website. 
The Company has taken advantage 
of the provisions allowing 
communications to be made 
electronically to shareholders 
where they have not requested 
hard copy documentation. As a 
result the Company’s website has 
become a very important method of 
communication with shareholders. 
The website provides shareholders 
and potential investors with 
information about the Company, 
including annual and half-yearly 
reports, recent announcements, share 
price information, and information 
on corporate responsibility and 
governance matters. All material 
information reported via a regulatory 
news service is simultaneously 
published on the Company’s website 
affording all shareholders full access 
to Company announcements.
The board notes that Section 2 
of the Combined Code seeks to 
encourage more active participation 
by institutional shareholders, 
including entering into a dialogue with 
companies and making considered 
use of their votes – principles which 
the Company supports.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting is 
an important event in Experian’s 
corporate calendar and provides a 
valuable opportunity for the board to 
communicate with private investors. 
All directors, including the chairmen 
of the audit, remuneration and 
nomination committees, attend the 
meeting.  
Experian’s 2009 annual general 
meeting will take place on Wednesday 
15 July 2009 and shareholders are 
encouraged to attend the meeting 
and use the opportunity to ask 
questions. However, given the 
size and geographical diversity 
of the Company’s shareholder 
base, attendance may not always 
be practical and shareholders are 
encouraged to use proxy voting on the 
resolutions put forward. Every vote 
cast, whether in person or by proxy, is 
counted, because votes on all matters 
except procedural issues are taken  59 Experian Annual Report 2009

The remuneration committee: 
members, role and frequency of 
meetings
Details of the committee members, 
the scope of their role and frequency of 
meetings can be found in the corporate 
governance statement. 
Working with advisers
In making its decisions, the committee 
consults with the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Group 
HR Director and the Global Head 
of Reward who are invited to attend 
meetings of the committee as 
appropriate. The Chief Financial 
Officer is also consulted in respect 
of performance conditions attaching 
to short and long-term incentive 
arrangements.
The committee has access to 
independent consultants to ensure 
that it receives objective advice. 
In 2007, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) 
were appointed by the committee as 
advisers and they continued to act 
during the year under review. Deloitte 
also provided unrelated advisory and 
tax services to the Group during the 
year. Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) were 
also appointed by the committee in 
2007 and, during the year under review, 
provided advice and valuation data 
for Experian’s current and proposed 
executive remuneration arrangements 
and also provided independent advice 
on target calibration for the short and 
long-term incentive plans. Linklaters 
LLP provided legal advice in respect of 
share plan design and interpretation. 
   
Remuneration philosophy 
Experian’s remuneration philosophy 
is that reward should be used to drive 
business performance. In this regard, 
the remuneration committee aims to 
have in place a remuneration policy for 
Experian which is consistent with its 
business objectives and is designed to:
pay market-competitive base salary  –
levels;
provide competitive performance- –
related compensation which 
influences performance and helps 
attract and retain executives 
by providing the opportunity to 
earn commensurate rewards for 
outstanding performance, leading 
to long-term shareholder value 
creation;
apply demanding performance  –
conditions to deliver sustained 
profitable growth in all our 
businesses, thereby aligning 
incentives with shareholders’ 
interests, setting these conditions 
with due regard to actual and 
expected market conditions;
provide a balanced portfolio of  –
incentives - both cash and share-
based - which align both short-
term (one year) and longer-term 
(three year) performance such that 
sustainable growth and value are 
delivered for our shareholders;
drive accountability and  –
transparency and align remuneration 
with the interests of shareholders; 
and
deliver competitive benefits to  –
underpin the other components of 
the remuneration package.
Consistent with the policy, the 
committee compares the Experian 
remuneration arrangements with 
those of other relevant organisations 
and companies of similar size and 
scope to Experian. The remuneration 
arrangements are also reviewed in 
light of changing market conditions, 
which have become increasingly more 
challenging over the year under review. 
Performance-related incentives are 
targeted at upper quartile levels for 
outstanding performance to produce 
a highly leveraged package if the 
Group’s growth objectives are attained. 
Experian is committed to performance-
related pay at all levels within the 
organisation. 
The committee undertook a review of 
remuneration arrangements during the 
year.  This review concluded that, while 
the key elements of our arrangements 
are still aligned with the principles of 
remuneration policy and long-term 
strategy, certain changes should be 
made to better align arrangements 
with the creation of future shareholder 
value.  The key elements of 
remuneration arrangements going 
forward are summarised below.
The remuneration committee is 
mindful of the current environment and 
especially the need to link pay closely 
to performance.  In light of current 
economic conditions and the desire to 
link executive salaries more closely to 
policy elsewhere in the organisation, 
coupled with the committee’s desire to 
ensure a greater emphasis on variable 
pay going forward, the committee has 
decided to freeze base pay levels for 
the coming year for executive directors 
and senior management.  In the case of 
the chief executive officer (‘CEO’) this 
means his base pay will be frozen for a 
second consecutive year.  
The revised arrangements take into 
account the need to align incentives 
with market practice and conditions 
and to strike the right balance between 
short-term and long-term performance.  
The proposed incentive arrangements 
will provide a stronger focus on 
absolute share price growth (through 
the use of options and delivery of 
all long-term incentives in shares), 
balanced with relative share price 
growth (in the Performance Share 
Plan (‘PSP’)) and a balance between 
internal and external measures 
of performance.  In addition, by 
encouraging executives to invest in and 
hold Experian shares through the co-
investment plan (‘CIP’) arrangements, 
their interests will be further aligned 
with those of our shareholders over the 
longer term.
The proposed total compensation 
package has a similar expected value 
to the arrangements currently in place 
and is driven by the need to replace the 
reinvestment plan which was a one off 
plan and will cease next year.
Further details of how remuneration 
arrangements will operate going 
forward are set out in the following 
pages.
Report on directors’ remuneration 60 Experian Annual Report 2009
2009/10 incentive arrangements 
for the CEO
In recognition of his personal 
performance and the continued 
valuable contribution Don Robert 
makes to Experian and to continue 
to incentivise him to create future 
shareholder value, the remuneration 
committee proposes to make awards 
worth 300% of salary in face value 
under each of the PSP and Executive 
Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) in the 
coming year.  These changes will 
position our CEO’s remuneration 
highly competitively against UK and 
US financial services and other  
US-listed companies of similar size 
to Experian.  The committee believes 
the approach taken is appropriate for 
a CEO of Don Robert’s calibre and 
that it is appropriate for his overall 
remuneration to be highly variable, 
with a strong link to the Group’s 
performance.  As such, his base salary 
during 2009/10 will continue to be 
frozen at the level set in 2007.
The future level of any awards for 
the CEO will be determined by the 
remuneration committee on an annual 
basis, taking account of the prevailing 
circumstances at the time.
These proposals are within the 
parameters of the current rules but in 
line with our commitment to engage 
with shareholders, the committee 
consulted with key shareholders on the 
proposed changes.
Service contracts
Each executive director has a 
rolling service contract which can 
be terminated by the Group giving 
twelve months’ notice. In the event 
of termination of the director’s 
contract, any compensation payment 
is calculated in accordance with 
normal legal principles, including the 
application of mitigation to the extent 
appropriate in the circumstances of the 
case.
Remuneration of 
executive directors
Each element of reward is important 
and has a specific role in achieving 
the aims of the remuneration 
philosophy. The combined potential 
remuneration from annual bonus and 
share-based incentives outweighs 
the other elements and is subject 
to performance conditions, thereby 
placing much of it at risk. In fair value 
terms, the proportion of the total 
remuneration (excluding pension and 
benefits) of the CEO which is variable 
is approximately 80% as illustrated.
The remuneration committee selects 
performance measures that are 
designed to be aligned with the 
Group’s strategic goals and that 
are transparent to directors and 
shareholders. Each element  
of remuneration is designed to  
support the achievement of different 
corporate objectives as outlined in the 
following table.

Fixed remuneration 
Base salary and benefits
T o assess the appropriate market 
salary for a role, external remuneration 
consultants provide benchmark data 
to the remuneration committee. 
Executive directors’ salaries are 
benchmarked against a mid-market 
level of executive directors from the 
companies in the FTSE 100 Index and 
other global comparators, reflecting 
the markets from which Experian 
recruits talent. These include, but are 
not limited to, international companies 
of a similar size and geographic scope, 
companies in the financial services 
and related industries and companies 
with significant operations in the same 
markets as Experian (for example, 
North America). Before making a 
final decision on individual salary 
awards, the committee assesses each 
director’s contribution to the business, 
to reflect individual performance and 
experience. 
In addition to base salary, executive 
directors receive certain benefits-in-
kind including a car or car allowance, 
private health cover and life assurance. 
These are set at market norms for each 
role. 
No executive director received a base 
salary increase at 1 April 2009. The CEO 
has not received an increase since 1 
April 2007 notwithstanding the Group’s 
strong performance over this period. 
Pensions  
The retirement age for directors is 60 
under arrangements which broadly 
provide a pension of two thirds of 
final salary, ill health and dependants’ 
pensions in addition to life assurance 
cover during the period of employment.  
Incentive payments (such as annual 
bonuses) are not pensionable.
The Group has had arrangements 
in place for a number of years which 
were designed to ensure that UK 
directors who were affected by the 1989 
HM Revenue and Customs earnings 
cap were placed in broadly the same 
position as those who were not. With 
the agreement of the trustees of the 
pension scheme, the Group decided 
to retain a notional earnings cap for 
its existing and future employees, with 
the exception of new senior executives 
who are pensioned on full basic salary 
up to the Lifetime Allowance. The 
Experian Pension Scheme was closed 
to new members on 31 December 2008, 
subject only to exceptions approved by 
the remuneration committee on a case 
by case basis. 
The Group has put security in place 
for the unfunded pension entitlements 
of UK executives affected by the 
earnings cap, by establishing Secured 
Unfunded Retirement Benefits 
Schemes (‘SURBS’). Further details 
are provided under the disclosure of 
the arrangements for each director.
In the US, Experian provides a Personal 
Investment Plan (401k) which all US 
employees, including directors, are able 
to join. This is a defined contribution 
arrangement to which participants are 
able to contribute up to 50% of salary, 
up to a maximum salary and participant 
contribution limit established by the 
IRS each calendar year. 
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus plan and 
co-investment plan
Annual bonuses are awarded for 
achieving profit growth targets. 
The committee believes that linking 
incentives to profit growth helps to 
reinforce Experian’s growth strategy. 
During the year, Kepler advised 
on the calibration of targets using 
benchmarks that reflect stretching 
internal and external expectations. 
Benchmarks include: broker earnings 
estimates; earnings estimates for 
competitors; straight-line profit growth 
consistent with median/upper quartile 
shareholder returns over the next three 
to five years; latest projections for the 
current year; budget; strategic plan; 
and long-term financial goals.
2008/09 bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for 
executive directors is 200% of base 
salary. However, this level of annual 
bonus is only payable if Experian’s 
financial performance surpasses 
stretching financial targets designed 
to deliver exceptional results to 
shareholders. 
Experian’s underlying performance 
continued to be strong in 2008/09 in 
what was an extremely challenging 
business environment for both 
Experian and our clients. The bonuses 
payable to executive directors 
in respect of this financial year 
are representative of this strong 
performance in uncertain market 
conditions.
For annual bonuses earned in respect 
of the 2008/09 financial year, executive 
directors have been offered their first 
opportunity since the demerger of 
Experian and Home Retail Group from 
GUS plc in October 2006 (‘demerger’) 
to defer receipt of some or all of their 
bonus and invest it in Experian shares 
(‘invested shares’) under the Experian 
CIP . The number of invested shares 
acquired on behalf of the executive will 
be matched with an additional award 
of shares (‘matching shares’) on a 1:1 
basis. The release of these matching 
shares to participants will be subject 
to the achievement of a performance 
condition, being growth in profit 
before tax (‘PBT’) of 3% per annum on 
average for the three financial years 
beginning with the 2009/10 financial 
year. The committee believes that 
PBT is an appropriate measure as it 
is aligned with Experian’s core growth 
strategy. The release of invested shares 
and matching shares will be deferred 
for three years. If an executive resigns 
during the three-year period he/she will 
forfeit the right to the matching shares 
and the associated dividends. The 
executive would be entitled to retain 
any invested shares. 
2009/10 bonus
The maximum bonus which may 
be earned by executive directors in 
the coming year will remain at 200% 
of base salary. Deferral of annual 
bonus into the CIP will continue to 
be voluntary, but it is intended that a 
minimum of 50% of any earned bonus 
must be deferred by any executive who 
chooses to participate in the plan. 
Deferral of up to 100% of earned bonus 
will still be possible.

In addition, it is intended to increase 
the maximum match under the CIP 
from 1:1 to up to 2:1. The CIP is used as 
part of a suite of long-term incentive 
arrangements and the increase in 
potential match has been factored 
into market-based remuneration 
benchmarking that has been carried 
out on behalf of the committee. The fair 
value of total remuneration, including 
the increased match, remains within 
competitive levels.
The match of 1:1 will be awarded for 
the achievement of a target level of 
growth in PBT , increasing on a straight 
line basis to up to a 2:1 match for the 
achievement of stretching levels of 
performance. The final targets will be 
determined shortly before the awards 
are made in June 2010 and will be fully 
disclosed at the appropriate time. 
However, the committee undertakes 
to ensure that any targets, whilst they 
must be seen as achievable to retain 
and motivate executives during the 
deferral period, must be sufficiently 
stretching to deliver significant 
shareholder value. 
Experian performance share plan 
(‘Experian PSP’)
The Experian PSP was approved 
by GUS plc shareholders at the 
Extraordinary General Meeting (‘EGM’) 
held on 29 August 2006. An initial award 
was made to participants, including 
the executive directors, on 11 October 
2006. Performance shares are ‘free’ 
Experian shares for which no exercise 
price is payable. Shares are allocated 
subject to a performance condition 
which is measured over a three-year 
performance period with a five-year 
vesting period. Dividend equivalents 
accrue on these awards.
For the above demerger awards 
granted in October 2006, the 
performance condition is in two 
separate parts; 50% of the award is 
subject to achievement against a 
sliding scale of growth in PBT , which 
the committee considers to be an 
appropriate measure as this represents 
one of the key drivers of the business. 
The threshold for vesting is growth in 
PBT of 7% per annum at which 25% of 
this part of the award will vest, rising 
on a straight-line basis to 100% of this 
part of the award vesting if PBT grows 
at a rate of 14% per annum.
The remaining 50% of the award will 
vest according to the performance of 
Experian’s total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) (defined as share price 
movement plus reinvested dividends) 
relative to the following group of peer 
companies as set at the award date: 
Acxiom
Alliance Data Systems
Bisys Group
Capita Group
Choicepoint
Dun & Bradstreet
Equifax
Fair Isaac
Fidelity National Financial
Fimalac
First American
First Data
Fiserv
Global Payments
Harte-Hanks
IAC/Interactive Corp
Moodys
Reuters Group
Thomson
T otal System Services
   
This bespoke comparator group 
consists of Experian’s main 
competitors in the business areas 
and countries in which the Group 
operates. This part of the award will 
not vest if Experian’s TSR is below 
the median return for the comparator 
group. Once Experian achieves median 
performance, 25% of this portion 
of the award may vest, rising on a 
straight-line basis to 100% of this part 
of the award vesting for upper quartile 
performance or better. 
Performance conditions for 
future awards under the Experian 
performance share plan will be decided 
in advance of grant. For awards to be 
made in 2009/10, it is intended that 
75% of any award will be subject to a 
growth in PBT performance condition 
and 25% will be subject to a relative 
TSR performance condition. This is to 
ensure that greater line of sight exists 
between participating executives and 
the performance measures employed. 
For the element of an award which 
is subject to the PBT performance 
condition, 25% will vest for growth in 
PBT of 4% per annum on average rising 
to 100% vesting for growth in PBT 
of 8% per annum on average, which 
is expected to be broadly equivalent 
to median and upper quartile 
performance respectively. For the TSR 
element of the awards, vesting will be 
according to the percentage extent to 
which Experian’s TSR outperforms the 
TSR of the FTSE 100 Index. 25% of the 
award would vest at threshold, rising 
to 100% where Experian outperforms 
the FTSE 100 Index by at least 25% over 
the three-year performance period. 
This equates to approximately 7.7% 
per annum. In addition, vesting of these 
awards will be subject to satisfactory 
return on capital employed (’ROCE’) 
performance.  64 Experian Annual Report 2009
Meeting obligations under 
share-based incentives
Obligations under Experian’s employee 
share plans may be met using either 
shares purchased in the market or, 
except for rolled-over awards under 
certain GUS schemes, newly issued 
shares. The approach during the 
year has been to use a combination 
of newly issued shares and shares 
previously purchased by the employee 
trusts. Following a recent review it 
has been decided that for the time 
being all awards will be satisfied by 
the purchase of shares or from shares 
previously purchased by the employee 
trusts. The policy will remain under 
regular review.
 
 The above graphs show that, at 31 
March 2009, a hypothetical £100 
invested in GUS and subsequently, 
Experian would have generated a 
total return of £180 compared with a 
return of £83 if invested in the FTSE 
on 31 March 2001 and a total return of 
£120 compared with a return of £105 if 
invested on 31 March 2004. 
With respect to Responsible 
Investment Disclosure, the committee 
is satisfied that environmental, social 
and governance risks are not raised 
by the incentive structure for senior 
management and do not inadvertently 
motivate irresponsible behaviour.
Experian share option plan
The Experian share option plan was 
approved by GUS plc shareholders at 
the EGM held on 29 August 2006. This 
plan seeks to align shareholder and 
participant interests through share 
price growth and the employment of 
a stretching performance condition. 
For awards to be granted to executive 
directors in the next financial 
year, options will vest subject to 
the achievement of a stretching 
performance condition, being growth in 
earnings per share (‘EPS’). 25% of an 
award will vest for EPS growth of 4% 
per annum rising to 100% vesting for 
EPS growth of 8% per annum.  
In addition, vesting of these awards  
will be subject to satisfactory  
ROCE performance. 
For each of the long-term incentive 
plans, external consultants will be used 
to calculate whether, and the extent 
to which, the performance conditions 
have been met.
Experian Sharesave 
All executive directors and employees 
of Experian and any participating 
subsidiaries in which sharesave or a 
local equivalent is operated are eligible 
to participate if they are employed 
by Experian at a qualifying date. 
Sharesave provides an opportunity for 
employees to save a regular monthly 
amount, over either three or five years 
which, at the end of the savings period, 
may be used to purchase Experian 
shares under option for up to 20% 
below market value at the date of grant.
Performance graph
The committee has chosen to illustrate 
the ‘TSR’ for GUS plc until demerger 
and Experian plc against the FTSE 100 
Index for the period since listing on 
11 October 2006 to 31 March 2009. The 
FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate 
index against which TSR should 
be measured, as it is a widely used 
and understood index of leading UK 
companies.

Shareholding guideline 
The committee believes that it is 
important that executives should build 
a significant shareholding to align their 
interests with those of shareholders. 
Therefore, the committee has 
established guidelines under which 
the CEO should hold the equivalent of 
two times his base salary in Experian 
plc shares and other executive 
directors, one times their base salary, 
including shares held under the CIP 
and the reinvestment plan. Each of 
the executive directors meets these 
guidelines.
Non-executive directors’ 
remuneration policy
The Board’s policy on non-executive 
directors’ remuneration is that:
Fees should reflect individual  –
responsibilities and membership of 
Board committees;
Remuneration should be in line  –
with recognised best practice and 
sufficient to attract, motivate and 
retain high calibre non-executives;
Remuneration should be a  –
combination of cash fees (paid 
quarterly) and Experian shares 
(bought annually in the first quarter 
of the financial year until the non-
executive director’s individual 
shareholding requirement is met, 
(see below));
The use of Experian shares in the  –
package helps align the interests of 
non-executive directors with those 
of shareholders;
Non-executive directors do not  –
receive any benefits in kind with the 
exception of the Chairman who has 
the use of a company car and private 
healthcare.
The fees of non-executive directors 
will next be reviewed in late 2009. Fees 
are reviewed in the light of market 
practice in FTSE 100 companies and 
anticipated number of days worked, 
tasks and responsibilities. The fees 
which applied for the year under review 
and which have not been increased 
since November 2006 are given in the 
table below.
Experian requires its non-executive 
directors to build up a holding in 
the company’s shares equal to their 
annual fee. One quarter of their 
annual fee is used to purchase shares 
in the company each year until they 
reach this holding. Any tax liability 
arising from these arrangements is 
the responsibility of the individual 
director; such shares are included 
in the table of directors’ interests. 
Non-executive directors do not 
participate in executive share plans or 
other employee share arrangements. 
Non-executives do not have service 
contracts but each has a letter of 
appointment. No non-executive 
director’s letter of appointment 
provides for any termination payment. 
Each appointment is for a renewable 
three-year term but may be terminated 
by either party on one month’s written 
notice.

Notes:
1.   John Peace ceased to be an employee of the Group on 31 March 2007. Under the GUS Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme rules, he has six months 
from this date to exercise his options, excluding any periods during which he is restricted from dealing in the Group’s shares. Disclosures will be made in 
respect of the exercise of these options at the appropriate time.
2.   Options granted to Don Robert prior to his date of appointment to the board of GUS plc in April 2005 were granted under the GUS North America Stock Option 
Plan. The 2005 and 2006 grants were made under the GUS UK Executive Share Option Scheme.
3.   Options were granted to David T yler in respect of his role as an executive director of GUS plc. On demerger, he was eligible to exchange his options for 
equivalent options over Experian shares on the same basis as other participants in the relevant GUS plans except that he was not eligible to participate in 
the Experian Reinvestment Plan. T o the extent that his options were rolled over, the new options did not vest or lapse in connection with his termination of 
employment. In respect of such options, David T yler is treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the relevant plan rules if he ceases to be a non-executive 
director except as a result of voluntary resignation or actions which would constitute gross misconduct. The relevant performance conditions apply.
All options in the above table were originally granted under the GUS executive share option schemes. Options which were 
granted before 2005 were exchanged for equivalent options over Experian plc shares on demerger. Unvested options granted in 
2005 and 2006 (other than options granted under the GUS 1998 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme) were automatically 
exchanged for equivalent options over Experian plc shares. The performance condition for options granted in 2005 and 2006 is 
based on the growth of Experian’s earnings per share in excess of the UK Retail Price Index from the date of demerger.  
The market price of Experian plc shares at the end of the financial year was 436.75p; the highest and lowest prices during the 
financial year were 453.25p and 274.75p respectively. 68 Experian Annual Report 2009
Performance share plans
In May 2005 and June 2006, executive directors received a share award under the GUS PSP with a face value of one times 
salary. On demerger, these awards were automatically rolled over into Experian shares. As approved by GUS plc shareholders 
at the EGM held on 29 August 2006, awards equivalent to two times salary were made to executive directors on demerger 
in October 2006 under the Experian performance share plan. Both awards are outlined below. For awards granted under the 
rolled over GUS performance share plan, the performance condition is based on  TSR against the comparator group adopted 
by Experian. Rolled over awards will not vest if Experian’s TSR is below the median return for the comparator group. For these 
rolled over awards only, once Experian achieves median performance, 40% of the award may vest, rising on a straight-line basis 
to 100% of the award vesting for upper quartile performance or better.

Notes: 
1.   On demerger, GUS PSP awards made in 2005 and 2006 were replaced with equivalent awards over Experian shares. 
2.   John Peace’s employment with Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc) ended on 31 March 2007.  Under the rules of the GUS PSP , all outstanding awards were 
time pro-rated to 31 March 2007 and the pro-rated figures are shown in the table above.  The awards will vest, subject to the achievement of the performance 
condition, on the vesting date specified.
3.   David T yler’s awards were rolled over on the basis described in note 3 to the share options table.
4.   Awards made in May 2005 were subject to the TSR performance condition described above. Over the performance period, Experian’s TSR was at the median 
of that of the comparator group and so 40% of the shares awarded in 2005 vested on 19 November 2008 when the Experian share price was 329.25p. Dividend 
equivalents were paid to Paul Brooks, John Peace, Don Robert and David T yler on their vested shares.  They received £5,600, £19,198, $41,985 and £19,524 
respectively.
5.   The performance period in respect of the awards made in June 2006 runs from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2009. In respect of awards made in October 2006, the 
performance period for the TSR element of the award is 11 October 2006 to 11 October 2009 and for the PBT element 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2009.

GUS co-investment plans and Experian reinvestment plans
Awards to directors under the 2004 and 2005 cycles of the GUS co-investment plan and North America co-investment plan 
were reinvested in awards under the Experian reinvestment plan and North America reinvestment plan at demerger. Awards 
under the 2006 cycle were automatically rolled over into equivalent awards over Experian shares under the rules of the GUS 
co-investment plan. Release of matching shares under the Experian reinvestment plan is subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions (see note 3 to the table below), the retention of reinvested awards and continued employment. No 
further awards will be made under the reinvestment plan. Matching shares awarded under the GUS co-investment plans will be 
released subject to continued employment.

Notes:
1.   Invested shares for John Peace and David T yler were purchased with their bonus net of tax. The matching share awards are made on a gross basis and are 
taxed at the point of vesting. Invested shares for Don Robert and Paul Brooks were calculated by reference to the bonus gross of tax. 
2.   John Peace was not eligible to participate in the reinvestment plan. He was granted a special reinvestment award over Experian shares which will vest after 
three years if he continues to be Chairman of Experian plc, subject to the good leaver reasons included in the rules. Details of this award were disclosed in the 
circular to GUS plc shareholders dated 26 July 2006. 
3.   The first 50% of a matching award under the Experian reinvestment plan will vest subject to satisfaction of a performance condition relative to a sliding scale 
of growth in Experian’s PBT over a three-year period. The threshold for vesting will be growth in PBT of 7% per annum at which 30% of this part of the matching 
award will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of this part of the award vesting at growth in PBT of 14% per annum. This part of the matching award will 
vest in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant. The remaining 50% of the matching award will be time-based and will vest as to 50% of 
this part of the matching award on the third anniversary of grant and as to 25% on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
4.   David T yler’s 2006 GUS co-investment plan awards were rolled over on the basis described in note 3 to the share options table 70 Experian Annual Report 2009
Executive directors’ annual pension   
Don Robert is provided with benefits through a Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan (‘SERP’) which is a defined 
benefit arrangement in the US. The figures below are in respect of his SERP entitlement. He also participated in a US defined 
contribution arrangement during the year and the employer contributions to this arrangement were $8,507 (2008: $3,692).
Paul Brooks is a member of the registered Experian UK pension scheme. His benefits are restricted by an earnings cap. 
However, benefits in excess of this cap are provided for through the Experian Limited SURBS. The pension figures below 
reflect both his registered and non-registered entitlement. 
The table below provides the disclosure of the above directors’ pension entitlements in respect of benefits from registered 
schemes and non-registered arrangements.

   Five former directors of Experian Finance plc (formerly GUS plc) receive unfunded pensions from the Company. Four of the 
former directors are paid under the SURBS. The total unfunded pensions amount paid to the former directors was £566,734 
(2008: £539,644).
Notes:
Columns (1) and (2) represent the deferred pension to which the director would have been entitled had he left the Group at 31 March 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Column (3) is the transfer value of the pension in column (1) calculated as at 31 March 2009 based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Group 
pension scheme in accordance with version 8.1 of the UK actuarial guidance note GN11.
Column (4) is the equivalent transfer value, but calculated as at 31 March 2008 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
Column (5) is the change in transfer value of accrued pension during the year net of contributions by the director. The change in the transfer value for Paul 
Brooks includes the impact of a new transfer value basis agreed by the trustees of the Experian Pension Scheme which took effect on 1 October 2008, following 
legislation which required the basis to be updated. This had the effect of increasing Paul Brooks’ transfer value by approximately 36% as the new basis reflects 
changes in demographic and financial assumptions. The remainder of the increase in the transfer value reflects the increase in Paul Brooks’ accrued pension and 
the fact that he is one year older.
Column (6) is the increase in pension built up during the year, recognising (i) the accrual rate for the additional service based on the pensionable salary in force at 
the year end, and (ii) where appropriate the effect of pay changes in “real” (inflation adjusted) terms on the pension already earned at the start of the year.
Column (7) represents the transfer value of the pension in column (6).
The disclosures in columns (1) to (5) are equivalent to those required by the UK Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations and those in columns (6) and (7) are 
those required by the UK Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. 
Directors’ service contracts 
In accordance with Don Robert’s service agreement with Experian Services Corporation (‘ESC’) dated 7 August 2006, if his 
employment is terminated by ESC without cause he is entitled to the following severance payments: continued payment 
of monthly salary for 12 months from the termination date; 12 months’ participation in welfare benefit plans in which he 
participated during his employment; and an annual bonus based on a 100% achievement of objectives payable in equal monthly 
instalments for 12 months. The same amounts are payable by ESC if Don Robert terminates the contract: (i) following material 
breach by ESC; or (ii) for Good Reason following a change of control of ESC. Good Reason means, during the six month period 
following a change of control, a material and substantial adverse reduction or change in Don Robert’s position. 
Don Robert’s service agreement also provides for the following payments to be made if the agreement terminates in the event 
of Don Robert’s death (in addition to payments due but unpaid before death): a pro rata annual bonus for the bonus year to 
the termination date based on ESC’s performance in that bonus year; and a lump sum equal to 12 months’ base salary to be 
paid no later than 90 days after the date of death. If the employment is terminated due to Don Robert’s disability he is entitled 
to the bonus as described immediately above (in addition to payments due but unpaid before the termination). Any deferred 
compensation obligations with respect to Don Robert will be governed in accordance with the relevant plan rules. This is 
consistent with US employment practice.

Report of the auditors: 
Group financial statements
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Experian plc
W e have audited the Group financial statements of Experian plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Group income 
statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of recognised income and expense and the 
related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
W e have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Experian plc for the year ended 31 March 2009. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose.  
W e do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the 
Group financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the 
business review that is cross referred from the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
W e review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Services A uthority , and we 
report if it does not. W e are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal controls cover all risks and controls, 
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Group financial highlights, the directors’ report, the chairman’s 
statement, the business review, the board of directors, the unaudited part of the report on directors’ remuneration, the 
corporate governance statement and all of the other information listed on the contents listing. We consider the implications for  
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors 
in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we have also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  -
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and  -
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements. -

Notes to the Group financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2009
1. Corporate information
Experian plc (the ‘Company’), which is the ultimate parent company of the Experian group of companies (‘Experian’ or  
the ‘Group’), is incorporated and registered in Jersey under Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares.   
The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. Experian is a business services group. The Company  
changed its name from Experian Group Limited on 21 July 2008. 
The consolidated financial statements of Experian plc and its subsidiary undertakings were approved by the board on  
19 May 2009. 
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
for use in the European Union (the ‘EU’) and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IA SB’).  These are those 
standards, subsequent amendments and related interpretations issued and adopted by the IASB that have been endorsed by the EU. 
Although the Company is incorporated and registered in Jersey, the Group financial statements include disclosures sufficient to 
comply with those parts of the UK Companies Acts 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The Group financial statements are presented in US dollars, as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s 
operations, and they are rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost basis modified for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments. The principal exchange rates used in preparing the Group financial statements  
are set out in note 5. The Company financial statements which are set out on pages 138 to 146 are prepared and presented  
in sterling. The financial statements for the Company for the year ended 31 March 2010 will be prepared and presented in  
US dollars as the US dollar has become the dominant currency to which the Company is now exposed.
As indicated on page 88, during the year ended 31 March 2009, there have been a number of new accounting standards, 
amendments and interpretations effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2008. None of these has had a 
material impact on the results or financial position of the Group for the year under review.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial statements 
of the Company are included within the Group annual report.  The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK 
accounting standards.
Comparative information
There have been a number of developments which change the presentation of the comparative financial information and these 
are summarised as follows:
Experian disposed of its transaction processing activities in France on 31 October 2008. As a consequence, in  -
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’,  
the results and cash flows of that business for the year ended 31 March 2008 have been reclassified as discontinued. 
The results of the EMEA/Asia Pacific geographical segment and the Credit Services business segment (shown within 
note 4) have been restated accordingly. 
Following a review of the Group’s assessment of risks and rewards, there have been a number of changes in the  -
reporting of revenues and profits across the Group’s four business segments so that these more appropriately reflect 
the nature of the underlying businesses and align the risks and rewards of certain smaller businesses with those of  
the business segments in which they are now reported. Further information on the nature of these changes is given in 
note 4. 
Except as indicated above, the Group financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with that reported for the 
year ended 31 March 2008.

2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated 
from the date that the Group no longer has control. As required by IFRS 3 all business combinations are accounted for using 
the purchase method.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation.  Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the  
asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Group’s 
consolidation. The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings for the financial year ended 31 March 2009. A list of the significant subsidiaries is given in note Q to the parent 
company financial statements.
Equity minority interests  
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the Group. 
Disposals to minority interests result in gains and losses for the Group that are recorded in the Group income statement. 
Purchases from minority interests result in goodwill, being the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant 
share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary.
Associates 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally achieved by a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The equity method is used to account for investments in associates and investments 
are initially recognised at cost.
The Group’s share of net assets of its associates and loans made to associates are included in the Group balance sheet. The 
Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition after tax profits or losses is recognised in the Group income statement, 
and its share of post-acquisition movements in equity is recognised in the Group’s equity. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. The carrying amount of an investment in an associate 
is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount to its carrying amount whenever there is an indication that the 
investment may be impaired.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable on the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of 
value added tax and other sales taxes, rebates and discounts, including the provision and processing of data, subscriptions to 
services, software and database customisation and development and the sale of software licences, maintenance and related 
consulting services.
Revenue in respect of the provision and processing of data is recognised in the year in which the service is provided. 
Subscription revenues, and revenues in respect of services to be provided by an indeterminate number of acts over a specified 
period of time, are recognised on a straight line basis over those periods. Customisation, development and consulting revenues 
are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the work. Revenue from software licences is recognised upon 
delivery. Revenue from maintenance agreements is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance period.
Where a single arrangement comprises a number of individual elements which are capable of operating independently of 
one another, the total revenues are allocated amongst the individual elements based on an estimate of the fair value of each 
element. Where the elements are not capable of operating independently, or reasonable measures of fair value for each element 
are not available, total revenues are recognised on a straight line basis over the contract period. 80 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currency translation
Presentation currency
The Group’s financial statements are presented in US dollars. 
T ransactions and balances
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group undertaking at the exchange 
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. T ranslation differences on 
monetary items are taken to net financing costs in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity, as qualifying 
net investment hedges or cash flow hedges.
T ranslation differences on non-monetary available for sale financial assets are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss in equity .
Group undertakings
The results and financial position of Group undertakings whose functional currencies are not US dollars are translated into  
US dollars as follows:
Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date; -
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year (unless this average is not a reasonable  -
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. -
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in Group undertakings whose functional 
currency is not the US dollar , and of borrowings and other currency instruments, primarily foreign exchange contracts, designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken directly to equity. T ax charges and credits attributable to those exchange differences are taken 
directly to equity . When such an undertaking is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Group income statement as 
part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of such entities are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the entities and are translated into US dollars at the closing exchange rate.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate geographical area of operation or 
a separate major line of business. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or earlier, if the operation 
meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, under IFRS 5.
Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans. These include awards in respect of shares in  
the Company made at or after the demerger of Experian and Home Retail Group from GUS plc in October 2006, together 
with awards previously made in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into awards in respect of shares in the 
Company at demerger. The fair value of options and shares granted is recognised as an expense in the Group income statement 
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, after taking into account the Group’s best estimate of the number of awards 
expected to vest. The Group revises the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date. Non-market performance conditions are 
included in the vesting estimates. Expenses are incurred over the vesting period. Fair value is measured at the date of grant 
using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award. 
Market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual 
performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary or associate acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that 
date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with 
those of the Group.

2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is separately recognised in the balance sheet. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of 
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and monitored for internal management purposes by geographical 
segment. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination 
in which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an 
impairment loss is recognised in the Group income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an undertaking include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the undertaking sold, 
allocated where necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets 
are identifiable, separable or arise from legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired 
separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost. Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of 
an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria are satisfied. These criteria include 
the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate resources to 
complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit. 
The cost of other intangible assets with finite useful economic or contractual lives is amortised over those lives. The carrying 
values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
values may not be recoverable. If impaired, the carrying values are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and 
value-in-use which is determined by reference to projected future income streams using assumptions in respect of profitability 
and growth.
Research expenditure is charged in the Group income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Databases and computer software
Databases
Capitalised databases comprise the fair value of databases acquired as part of a business combination or the data purchase 
and data capture costs of internally developed databases. 
Databases are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over three to seven years. 
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific 
software. Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group,  
and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software 
development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years. 
Other costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Acquisition intangibles
Customer and advertiser relationships
Contractual and non-contractual customer and advertiser relationships acquired as part of a business combination 
are capitalised at fair value on acquisition and amortised on a straight line basis over three to eighteen years, based on 
management’s estimates of the average lives of such relationships.
T rademarks and licences 
T rademarks and licences acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value on acquisition and are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their contractual lives, up to a maximum period of 20 years.
T rade names
Legally protected or otherwise separable trade names acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value 
on acquisition and amortised on a straight line basis over three to fourteen years, based on management’s expectations to 
retain trade names within the business.
Completed technology
Completed technology acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised at fair value on acquisition and amortised on  
a straight line basis over three to eight years, based on the expected life of the asset. 82 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land is not depreciated.
Equipment on hire or lease is depreciated over the lower of the useful life and period of the lease. 
Depreciation is provided on other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to depreciate the cost, less estimated 
residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years; -
Leasehold properties with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease; and -
Plant, vehicles and equipment are depreciated over two to ten years according to the estimated life of the asset. -
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in four categories: loans and receivables, derivatives used for hedging, assets at 
fair value through the profit and loss account and available for sale. The classification is determined at initial recognition and 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets are acquired.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets, with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities more than one year after the balance sheet date which are classified 
as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Derivatives used for hedging
Derivative financial assets used for hedging are included in current assets, except for maturities more than one year after the balance 
sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Derivatives utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency 
swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity swaps.
Assets at fair value through the profit and loss account
Assets at fair value through the profit and loss account comprise holdings of listed equity securities, principally those held in the UK 
to secure unfunded pension benefit arrangements.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or not 
classified in the other financial asset categories. 
Available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value and are included in non-current assets unless management intends 
to dispose of the assets within one year of the balance sheet date. Purchases and disposals of such assets are accounted  
for at settlement date. Unrealised gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity.  
On disposal or impairment of such assets, the gains and losses in equity are recycled through the income statement.  Gains 
and losses recognised on disposal exclude dividend and interest income. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence to suggest that available for sale financial 
assets are impaired. In the case of equity securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered in determining whether the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss is removed 
from equity and recognised in the Group income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the Group income statement on 
equity instruments are not subsequently reversed through the Group income statement.
T rade receivables
T rade receivables are initially recognised at fair value (original invoice amount) and subsequently measured at this value less 
any provision for impairment. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost less any 
provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Such evidence is based primarily on the pattern 
of cash received compared to the terms upon which the trade receivable is contracted. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the carrying amount and the value of estimated future cash flows. Any charge or credit in respect of such 
provisions is recognised in the Group income statement within administrative expenses. The cost of any irrecoverable trade 
receivables is recognised in the Group income statement immediately within administrative expenses. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited in the Group income statement within administrative expenses.

2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, term and call deposits held with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the Group balance sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined 
above, net of bank overdrafts.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated  at 
amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to 
reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Borrowings are classified as non-current to the extent that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date.
Incremental transaction costs which are directly attributable to the issue of debt are capitalised and amortised over the 
expected life of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the year in 
which they are incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and certain obligations, including social security obligations, in respect of share-based payments. Derivative instruments 
utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity swaps.  
These are recognised as assets or liabilities as appropriate. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at cost, being the fair value at the date a contract is entered into, and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. Depending on the type of the derivative financial instrument, fair value calculation 
techniques include, but are not limited to, quoted market value, present value of estimated future cash flows (of which the valuation 
of interest rate swaps is an example) and exchange rates at the balance sheet date (of which the valuation of foreign exchange 
contracts is an example). The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as:
Fair value hedges – hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment; or -
Cash flow hedges – hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable  -
forecast transaction; or
Net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in operations whose functional currency is not the US dollar. -
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both 
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items. This effectiveness testing is performed at every reporting date throughout the life  
of the hedge to confirm that the hedge has remained and will continue to remain highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting.
Derivative assets and liabilities are classified as non-current unless they mature within one year after the balance sheet date.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are taken to net financing costs over the period of the 
contracts, together with the interest differentials reflected in foreign exchange contracts. 84 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the 
Group income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the 
hedged risk. The ineffective portion of a fair value hedge is recognised in net financing costs in the Group income statement.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately within cost of sales or 
operating expenses, as appropriate, in the Group income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the Group income statement in the period when the hedged item impacts the 
Group income statement. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Group income statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is transferred immediately to the Group 
income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in an undertaking 
whose functional currency is not the US dollar is recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in net financing costs in the Group income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are 
included in the Group income statement when the undertaking is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
Group income statement. Costs in respect of derivatives entered into in connection with social security obligations on employee 
share incentive plans, other than those of a financing nature, are charged as an employment cost; other costs and changes in fair 
value on such derivatives are charged within financing fair value remeasurements in the Group income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value 
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the Group income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities is determined by using market data 
and established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are  
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.  The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, which are CGUs.
T rade payables
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value. Where the time value of money is material, payables are carried at 
amortised cost.
Contingent consideration
Where part or all of the amount of purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the cost of the acquisition initially 
recorded includes a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future.  
The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, with corresponding adjustments made to goodwill 
until the ultimate outcome is known.
Where part or all of the amount of disposal consideration is contingent on future events, the disposal proceeds initially 
recorded include a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the contingent amounts expected to be receivable and payable in 
the future. The proceeds are adjusted when revised estimates are made, with corresponding adjustments made to debtors and 
creditors as appropriate, and profit and loss on disposal, until the ultimate outcome is known.

Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in equity.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the Group financial statements.  However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
The Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and -
It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and -
The amount has been reliably estimated.  -
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a  
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability . Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Such leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and  
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.  
The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables. The interest element of the lease payment is 
charged in the Group income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability for each year. 
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged in the Group income statement on a straight line basis over the period of 
the lease. Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the period of the lease. 86 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Employee benefits
Defined benefit pension arrangements – funded plans
The retirement benefit assets and obligations recognised in the Group balance sheet in respect of funded plans comprise the 
fair value of plan assets of funded plans less the present value of the related defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet 
date, together with adjustments for past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
market yields available at the assessment date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which 
the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension 
liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised 
immediately in the Group statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Group income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are 
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past 
service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period. 
The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement comprises the cost of benefits accrued plus interest on the 
defined benefit obligation less the expected return on the plan assets over the year. The operating and financing costs are 
recognised separately in the Group income statement.
Defined benefit pension arrangements – unfunded plans
Unfunded pension obligations are determined and accounted for in accordance with the principles used in respect of the 
funded arrangements but are disclosed in the Group balance sheet within retirement benefit obligations. 
Defined contribution pension arrangements
The assets of defined contribution plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The 
pension cost recognised in the Group income statement represents the contributions payable by the Group to these funds in 
respect of the year.
Post-retirement healthcare obligations
The Group operates plans which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain retired employees and their dependent 
relatives. The principal plan relates to former employees in the UK and, under this plan, the Group has undertaken to meet the 
cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees who retired prior to 1 April 1994 and their dependants. The 
obligations in respect of these plans are calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries.
The obligations are calculated using an actuarial methodology similar to that for the funded defined benefit pension 
arrangements but are disclosed in the Group balance sheet within retirement benefit obligations. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the 
Group statement of recognised income and expense. 
The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement comprises the cost of benefits accrued plus interest on the 
defined benefit obligation. The operating and financing costs are recognised separately in the Group income statement.
Minority interests in equity
The minority interests in equity in the Group balance sheet represent the share of net assets of subsidiary undertakings held 
outside the Group. The movement in the year comprises the profit attributable to such interests together with any dividends 
paid, movements in respect of corporate transactions and related exchange differences.
Where put/call option agreements are in place in respect of shares held by the minority shareholders, the put element of the liability  
is measured in accordance with the requirements of IA S 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and is stated 
at the net present value of the expected future payments. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosure and Presentation’ this liability is shown as a non-current financial liability in the Group balance sheet. The change in the 
net present value of such options in the year is recognised in the Group income statement within finance expense.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing the Group financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The resulting 
accounting estimates, which are based on management’s best judgment at the date of the Group financial statements, will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Taxes
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the related provision 
for income taxes as there are transactions in the ordinary course of business and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.  
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences 
will impact on the results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such 
determination is made.
Pension benefits
The present value of the defined benefit assets and obligations depends on factors that are determined on an actuarial basis 
using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the defined benefit assets and obligations and net 
pension costs include the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate. Any changes in these 
assumptions may impact on the amounts disclosed in the Group balance sheet and the Group income statement.
The expected return on plan assets is calculated by reference to the plan investments at the balance sheet date and is a 
weighted average of the expected returns on each main asset type based on market yields available on these asset types at the 
balance sheet date.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate used to calculate 
the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the defined benefit obligations. In 
determining the discount rate, the Group has considered the prevailing market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated 
average term of the related pension liability. In determining the discount rate, management has accordingly derived an 
appropriate discount rate by consideration of the average annualised yield on medium and longer term AA rated corporate 
bonds in the UK as published by iBoxx, together with consideration of the average yields from Euro Sterling AA, Financial AA 
and Bank AA indices.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit obligations and pension costs are based in part on market conditions at the relevant 
balance sheet dates and additional information is disclosed in note 28.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-
counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and 
makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. 
The assumptions in respect of the valuation of the put option associated with the remaining 30% stake of Serasa Experian 
(‘Serasa’) are set out in note 25(d). 88 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs and monitored for internal management purposes by geographical segment. The allocation is made to 
those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amount of each CGU is generally determined on the basis of value-in-use 
calculations which require the use of cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management, looking 
forward up to five years. Management determines budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations  
for the market development. Cash flows are extrapolated using estimated growth rates beyond a five year period.  The growth 
rates used do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the segment operates.  The discount rates 
used reflect the region’s weighted average cost of capital (‘W ACC’).  The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations 
are:
  Pre-tax  Long term 
Region W ACC growth rate
North America 11.6% 2.3%
Latin America 17.0% 8.0%
UK & Ireland 11.5% 2.3%
EMEA/Asia Pacific 12.5% 4.5%
 
The recoverable amount of the Latin America CGU exceeds the carrying value by approximately US$200m and an increase in 
the pre-tax W ACC of 1.3% or a reduction of 1.5% in the long term growth rate would reduce the value-in-use of its goodwill to an 
amount equal to its carrying value.
Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity settled share-based employee incentive plans. The assumptions used in determining the 
amounts charged in the Group income statement include judgments in respect of performance conditions and length of service 
together with future share prices, dividend and interest yields and exercise patterns. 
Critical judgments
Management has made certain judgments in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies set out above that have 
a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements. The accounting policy descriptions indicate 
where judgment needs exercising and these judgments include the classification of transactions between the Group income 
statement and the Group balance sheet. 
The most significant of these judgments is in respect of intangible assets where certain costs incurred in the developmental 
phase of an internal project are capitalised if a number of criteria are met. Management has made certain judgments and 
assumptions when assessing whether a project meets these criteria, and on measuring the costs and the economic life 
attributed to such projects. On acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised separately from goodwill 
and then amortised over their estimated useful lives. These include such items as brand names and customer lists, to which 
value is first attributed at the time of acquisition. The capitalisation of these assets and the related amortisation charges are 
based on judgments about the value and economic life of such items. The economic lives for intangible assets are estimated at 
between three and seven years for internal projects, which include databases, internal use software and internally generated 
software, and between two and twenty years for acquisition intangibles.
Recent accounting developments
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the IASB and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2008 but 
have had no material effect on the results or financial position of the Group:
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’ * -
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ -

Once adopted by the EU, the following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the IASB and the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee will be effective for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 April 2009:
Amendments to the following standards as a result of the May 2008 annual improvements process:  -
IFRS 5 ‘Non–current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’ * 
IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ * 
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ *

IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’  -
IAS 28 ‘Amendment – Investment in Associates’ * -
IAS 32 ‘Amendment – Financial Instruments: Presentation’ -
IAS 39 ‘Amendment – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ * -
IAS 39 (Revised)  – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ * -
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’ * -
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’ * -
IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’ * -
IFRIC 18 ‘T ransfer of Assets from Customers’ * -
* These standards are still subject to adoption by the EU.
Of these there is only one which is expected to have a material effect on the results and net assets of the Group although a 
number of the developments will lead to additional or revised disclosures. As previously indicated, IFRS 3 (Revised) requires 
amendments to accounting for business combinations and the treatment of associated transaction costs and accordingly will 
impact the accounting treatment of future acquisitions in the financial statements. 
The most significant of those that will lead to additional or revised disclosures is IFRS 8. The Group has reviewed the 
requirements of this IFRS during the year and is adopting it with effect from 1 April 2009. Whilst compliance with IFRS 8 will 
require some revisions to the nature of segmental information disclosed, the structure of the Group’s segmental information 
will be largely unchanged from that currently provided.
Use of non-GAAP measures
The Group has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business. The 
measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. 
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but 
management has included them as they consider them to be important comparables and key measures used within the 
business for assessing performance.  90 Experian Annual Report 2009
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The following are the key non-GAAP measures identified by the Group:
Benchmark profit before tax (‘Benchmark PBT’) 
Benchmark PBT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairments, charges in respect 
of the demerger-related equity incentive plans, exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and tax. It includes the 
Group’s share of associates’ pre-tax profit.
Earnings before interest and tax (‘EBIT’)
EBIT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairments, charges in respect of the 
demerger-related equity incentive plans, exceptional items, net financing costs and tax. It includes the Group’s share of 
associates’ pre-tax profit.
Benchmark earnings per share (‘Benchmark EPS’)
Benchmark EPS represents Benchmark PBT less attributable tax and minority interests divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue, and is disclosed to indicate the underlying profitability of the Group.
Exceptional items
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items gives an indication of the Group’s underlying performance. 
Exceptional items are those arising from the profit or loss on disposal of businesses, closure costs of major business units or 
costs of significant restructuring programmes. All other restructuring costs are charged against EBIT in the segments in which 
they are incurred.
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow is calculated as cash generated from operations adjusted for outflows in respect of the purchase of 
property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets and adding dividends from associates but excluding any cash 
inflows and outflows in respect of exceptional items. It is defined as EBIT less changes in working capital, plus depreciation/
amortisation, less capital expenditure, less profit retained in associates. 
Net debt
Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid bank deposits with original 
maturities greater than three months. T otal debt includes loans and borrowings (and the fair value of derivatives hedging loans 
and borrowings), overdrafts and obligations under finance leases. Accrued interest is excluded from net debt.
3. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk 
and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s financial risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group seeks to reduce its 
exposure to financial risks and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group also ensures 
surplus funds are managed and controlled in a prudent manner which will protect capital sums invested and ensure adequate 
short-term liquidity, whilst maximising returns. 
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions, recognised 
assets and liabilities and investments in, and loans between, undertakings with different functional currencies. The Group 
manages such risk, primarily within undertakings whose functional currencies are sterling, by borrowing in the relevant foreign 
currencies and using forward foreign exchange contracts. The principal transaction exposures are to the US dollar and the euro.
In view of the profile of foreign exchange transaction exposures and an assessment of reasonable possible changes in the 
principal exposures, the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk can be quantified as follows:
At 31 March 2009, if the US dollar had strengthened/weakened by 9% (2008: 6%) against sterling, with all other  -
variables held constant, profit for the financial year would have been unchanged (2008: US$1m higher/lower), and other 
components of equity would have been unchanged.
At 31 March 2009, if the euro had strengthened/weakened by 8% (2008: 3%) against sterling, with all other variables held  -
constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$2m (2008: US$1m) higher/lower, and other components of 
equity would have been unchanged.
The Group has investments in undertakings with other functional currencies, whose net assets are exposed to foreign 
exchange translation risk. In order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of such entities, the Group has 
a policy of borrowing in US dollars and euros, as well as in sterling and of entering into forward foreign exchange contracts in 
the relevant currencies. The above sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of foreign exchange risk on the translation of the net 
assets of such undertakings.

3. Financial risk management (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from its net debt and the portions thereof at variable rates which expose the 
Group to such risk. 
The Group has a policy of normally maintaining between 30% and 70% of net debt at rates that are fixed for more than one year. 
The Group’s interest rate exposure is managed by the use of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate 
swaps to adjust the balance of fixed and floating rate liabilities. The Group also mixes the duration of its borrowings to smooth 
the impact of interest rate fluctuations. 
In view of the profile of net debt and an assessment of reasonable possible changes in the principal interest rates, the 
Group’s sensitivity to interest rate risk as at 31 March 2009 can be quantified as follows:
If interest rates on US dollar denominated net debt had been 1.6% (2008: 1.4%) higher with all other variables held  -
constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$4m (2008: US$1m) higher, mainly as a result of higher  
interest income on interest rate swaps, offset by higher expense on floating rate borrowings. 
If interest rates on sterling denominated net debt had been 1.0% (2008: 0.4%) higher with all other variables held  -
constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$4m higher (2008: US$8m lower), mainly as a result of higher 
interest income on interest rate swaps.
If interest rates on Brazilian real denominated net debt had been 2.9% (2008: 2.4%) higher with all other variables held  -
constant, profit for the financial year would have been US$1m (2008: US$1m) higher mainly as a result of higher interest 
income on deposits.
If interest rates on euro denominated net debt had been 1.0% (2008: 0.7%) higher with all other variables held constant,  -
profit for the financial year would have been US$2m (2008: US$3m) higher, mainly as a result of higher interest income 
on interest rate swaps.
Price risk
The Group is exposed to price risk in connection with investments classified on the balance sheet as available for sale 
financial assets. Such investments are primarily held to provide security in connection with unfunded pension obligations and 
are managed by independent fund managers who seek to mitigate such risk by diversification of the portfolio.
At 31 March 2009, if the relevant stock market and other indices had been 10% higher/lower with all other variables held 
constant, no further gains/losses would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense. 
Credit risk
In the case of derivative financial instruments, deposits and trade receivables, the Group is exposed to credit risk, which 
results from the non-performance of contractual agreements on the part of the contract party. 
This credit risk is minimised by a policy under which the Group only enters into such contracts with banks and financial 
institutions with strong credit ratings, within limits set for each organisation. Dealing activity is closely controlled and 
counterparty positions are monitored regularly. The general credit risk on derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group 
is therefore not considered to be significant. No credit limits were exceeded during the year and the Group does not anticipate 
that any losses will arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
At the balance sheet date trade receivables with financial institutions accounted for some 37% (2008: 41%) of total trade receivables 
in the UK and some 33% (2008: 38%) of total trade receivables in the USA. The remaining balances are distributed across multiple 
industries and geographies. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers 
before granting credit. The maximum credit risk in respect of such financial assets is the carrying value of the assets.
 
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains long-term committed facilities to ensure it has sufficient available funds for operations and planned 
expansions. The Group monitors rolling forecasts of projected cash flows to ensure that it will have adequate undrawn 
committed facilities available.
Details of the facilities available to the Group and their utilisation at the balance sheet date are given in note 22. Maturity analyses  
for financial liabilities are given in note 26 (d). 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives in managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure and cost of capital. 
    
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce net debt. As part of its internal reporting processes the   92 Experian Annual Report 2009
3. Financial risk management (continued) 
Group monitors capital employed by geographical segment. For this purpose, capital employed excludes net debt and tax 
balances and at 31 March 2009 the Group’s capital employed was US$4,205m (2008: US$5,054m). The Group manages its 
working capital in order to meet its target for the conversion of EBIT into operating cash flow and the conversion percentage 
for the year ended 31 March 2009 was 99% (2008: 95%).
4. Segmental information
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or 
services within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments 
operating in other economic environments.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to 
unrelated third parties. There is no material impact from inter-segment transactions on the Group’s results.
 
T otal segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill, inventories, 
derivatives designated as hedges of future commercial transactions, and receivables. They exclude assets which are reported 
at a Group level only which comprise tax assets together with cash, investments and derivative assets designated as hedges of 
borrowings which are reported as part of net debt.
T otal segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities including derivatives designated as hedges of future commercial 
transactions. They exclude tax liabilities, borrowings and related hedging derivatives and the net present value of the put option 
in respect of the Serasa minority which are reported at a Group level only.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding additions resulting 
from acquisitions through business combinations.
The primary and secondary segmental reporting formats for Experian are outlined below. As indicated on page 78, the Group’s 
transaction processing activities in France are now reported as discontinued with comparative information restated as 
appropriate. Additional information in respect of discontinued operations is shown in note 11.
As indicated on page 89, compliance with IFRS 8 from 1 April 2009 will not result in any significant changes in the structure of 
the Group’s segmental information.
Primary reporting format – geographical segments
At 31 March 2009, Experian is organised on a worldwide basis into four core geographies:
North America;  -
Latin America; -
UK & Ireland; and -
Europe, Middle East and Africa (‘EMEA’)/Asia Pacific. -
Unallocated corporate head office costs, which include costs arising from finance, treasury and other global functions, are 
reported as Central Activities.
Secondary reporting format – business segments
Experian operates across four key business segments:
Credit Services;  -
Decision Analytics; -
Marketing Services; and  -
Interactive. -
Credit Services acquires, processes and manages large and complex databases containing the credit histories of consumers 
and businesses.
 
Decision Analytics builds on the Credit Services database information and helps clients by applying analytical tools and 
software to convert data held internally and other data into usable business information.
Marketing Services helps clients to acquire new customers and to manage their relationships with existing customers. By 
appending hundreds of characteristics to the credit and marketing data held in databases, Marketing Services provides 
clients with information designed to assist them in matching the right offer or product to the relevant customer using the most 
appropriate communication channels.
Interactive helps customers to understand and manage their own financial information and assets as well as to make 
more informed purchasing decisions in areas such as financial services, shopping and education and to connect them with 
companies over the internet.

1.  As indicated in note 2 to the financial statements, there have been some reclassifications in respect of three of the Group’s smaller businesses within the reporting of results 
for continuing operations by business segment and the above results reflect the new reporting structure. These reclassifications relate to the V ente, Baker Hill and Experian 
Payments businesses. 
  The effect of these reclassifications on the reported results has been to increase the revenue reported for Decision Analytics and Interactive by US$39m and US$14m respectively 
and to reduce that for Credit Services and Marketing Services by US$15m and US$38m respectively . The associated effect has been to increase operating profit and profit before 
tax for Decision Analytics and Credit Services by US$7m and US$1m respectively and to reduce operating profit and profit before tax for Marketing Services by US$8m.
2.  As indicated in note 2 to the financial statements, discontinued operations comprise the Group’s transaction processing activities in France. Additional information on 
discontinued operations, the results of which were formerly reported within the Credit Services business segment, is shown in note 11.
3. Revenue from external customers arose principally from the provision of services.
4.  No allocation by business segment is made for charges in respect of the demerger-related equity incentive plans as the underlying data is maintained only to provide an 
allocation by geographical segment.

the Group’s smaller businesses reclassified within the reporting of results for continuing operations. Whilst the reported results for Central Activities remain 
unchanged, there are minor reclassifications of revenue and profit measures within the other four segments. These reclassifications relate to the Vente, Baker 
Hill and Experian Payments businesses. 
  The effect of these reclassifications has been to increase the revenue reported for Decision Analytics and Interactive by US$36m and US$21m respectively and 
to reduce that for Credit Services and Marketing Services by US$12m and US$45m respectively. The associated effect has been to increase operating profit and 
profit before tax for Decision Analytics and Interactive by US$6m and US$3m respectively and to reduce operating profit and profit before tax for Marketing

Exceptional items and other non-GAAP measures are in respect of continuing operations. Exceptional items are charged to

Exceptional items           
Expenditure of US$92m (2008: US$52m) arose in the year in connection with the Group’s strategic programme of cost efficiency 
measures. Of this US$51m (2008: US$34m) related to redundancy, US$34m (2008: US$6m) related to offshoring activities, 
infrastructure consolidations and other restructuring activities and US$7m (2008: US$12m) related to asset write-offs.
During the year Experian initiated the closure of its Canadian credit bureau and is in discussions to terminate the joint venture 
bureau in Japan.  Charges associated with the closure of the bureaux include US$13m of fixed asset write offs, including the 
related investment in associate, and a further US$2m of closure costs.
Demerger and related restructuring costs comprise legal and professional fees, together with costs in connection with the 
cessation of a number of subsidiaries of the former GUS plc. 
In April 2006, Experian announced the phased withdrawal from large scale credit card and loan account processing in the UK. 
The anticipated cost of withdrawal of US$26m was charged in the year ended 31 March 2007, and during the year ended 31 
March 2008 an amount of US$2m was released from the provision.
In the year ended 31 March 2008, First American Real Estate Solutions LLC (‘FARES’) recognised gains in respect of a number 
of disposals and the Group recognised US$3m, its 20% share of such gains.
Cash outflows in respect of exceptional items are analysed in note 32(i).
Other non-GAAP measures 
IFRS requires that, on acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised separately from goodwill and then 
amortised over their useful economic lives. These include items such as brand names and customer lists, to which value is first 
attributed at the time of acquisition. The Group has excluded amortisation of these acquisition intangibles from its definition of 
Benchmark PBT because such a charge is based on judgments about their value and economic life.
A goodwill adjustment of US$1m (2008: US$2m) arose under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ on the recognition of previously 
unrecognised tax losses on prior years’ acquisitions. The corresponding tax benefit reduced the tax charge for the year by 
US$1m (2008: US$2m).
Charges in respect of demerger-related equity incentive plans relate to one-off grants made to senior management and at 
all staff levels at the time of the demerger, under a number of equity incentive plans. The cost of these one-off grants is being 
charged to the Group income statement over the five years from flotation in October 2006, but excluded from the definition of 
Benchmark PBT . The cost of all other grants is being charged to the Group income statement and included in the definition of 
Benchmark PBT .
An element of the Group’s derivatives is ineligible for hedge accounting under IFRS. Gains or losses on these derivatives 
arising from market movements, together with gains and losses on put options in respect of acquisitions, are credited or 
charged to financing fair value remeasurements within finance income and finance expense in the Group income statement. 102 Experian Annual Report 2009

based on the profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2009 of US$578m (2008: US$521m) and the associated tax charge 
of US$84m (2008: US$91m). The effective tax rate for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 
28% (2008: 30%) and the differences are explained above. The standard rate of corporation tax for the Group’s UK businesses 
changed from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. 104 Experian Annual Report 2009

is 21.8% (2008: 23.4% as restated (see note 2)). The one-off corporation tax credit in the year ended 31 March 2009 has been 
excluded from the calculation of the effective rate of tax based on Benchmark PBT as it relates to arrangements involving 
entities no longer part of the Group. 
(c) T ax taken directly to equity
A tax credit of US$60m (2008: charge of US$16m) has been taken directly to equity, relating mainly to employee share incentive 
plans, actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit assets and obligations and foreign exchange. This includes US$1m 
(2008:US$nil) in respect of current tax and US$59m (2008: charge of US$16m) in respect of deferred tax.
(d)  Factors that may affect future tax charges
In the foreseeable future, the Group’s tax charge will continue to be influenced by the profile of profits earned in the different 
countries in which the Group’s businesses operate and could be affected by changes in tax law.

12. Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company  
by a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year (excluding own shares held in employee trusts,  
which are treated as cancelled).
The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilutive effect of employee share incentive plans.  
The earnings figures used in the calculations are unchanged for diluted earnings per share.

A dividend of 13.25 US cents per ordinary share will be paid on 24 July 2009 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 26 June 2009 and is not included as a liability in these financial statements. This dividend, together with the first 
interim dividend of 6.75 US cents per ordinary share paid in January 2009, comprises the full year dividend for the year ended  
31 March 2009 of 20.00 US cents.
Unless shareholders elect by 26 June 2009 to receive US dollars, their dividends will be paid in sterling at a rate per share 
calculated on the basis of the exchange rate from US dollars to sterling on 3 July 2009.
Pursuant to the Income Access Share arrangements put in place as part of the demerger of Experian and Home Retail Group 
in October 2006, shareholders in the Company can elect to receive their dividends from a UK source (the ‘IAS election’). 
Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer Experian shares (i) on the date of admission of the Company’s shares to the London 
Stock Exchange and (ii) in the case of shareholders who did not own shares at that time, on the first dividend record date 
after they become shareholders in the Company, unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive 
their dividends under the IAS arrangements. Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their 
dividends from a UK source must make an IAS election. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Unless 
shareholders have made an IAS election, or are deemed to have made an IAS election, dividends will be received from an  
Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
The employee trusts waived their entitlements to dividends of US$2m (2008: US$2m).

retained profits of associated undertakings at 31 March 2009 is US$155m (2008: US$141m).
The Group’s principal interest in associated undertakings is a 20% holding of FARES, which in incorporated in the USA. At 
31 March 2009, the Group’s share of the assets of FARES amounted to US$500m (2008: US$497m) and its share of liabilities is 
US$202m (2008: US$202m). The Group’s share of the revenue of FARES for the year ended 31 March 2009 is US$237m  
(2008: US$249m) and its share of profit after tax US$46m (2008: US$50m). 
First American Corporation, which holds the balance of the capital of FARES, has the right to acquire from Experian its interest 
in FARES at a purchase price pursuant to a specified formula based on the after tax earnings of FARES. Whilst First American 
Corporation is now able to exercise this right, no such notice had been received at 31 March 2009. Experian can elect to delay 
completion of the transaction for a maximum period of two years following First American Corporation giving such notice.
The Group’s interests in other associated undertakings are not individually material but include additions in the year ended  
31 March 2009 of US$29m, in respect of a 40% stake in DP Information Group in Singapore and an investment in Japan with 
CCB. Singapore and Japan are the respective countries of incorporation of these businesses.

difference between the carrying values of the Group’s loans and borrowings and their fair values.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, 6.375% Eurobonds 2009 with a par value of £147m were redeemed. The balance of these 
Eurobonds falls due for repayment in July 2009.

rate for overdrafts at 31 March 2009 is 2% (2008: 4.6%).
Other than finance lease obligations, all the borrowings of the Group shown above are unsecured. Finance lease obligations are 
effectively secured as the rights to the leased assets revert to the lessor in the event of default.

The table above analyses the Group’s derivative liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period 
at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash 
outflows/(inflows) and accordingly differ from the carrying values and fair values. 
(d) Fair values of other financial assets and liabilities
Fair values of derivative financial instruments are set out in note (a).
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on a comparison of the contractual and year end exchange rates. The fair 
values of other derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using 
appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The put option associated with the remaining 30% stake of Serasa is recognised as a liability of US$424m at 31 March 2009 
(2008: US$583m) under IAS 39. The put is valued at the higher of 95% of the equity value of Serasa or the value of Serasa based 
on the P/E ratio of Experian and the latest earnings of Serasa. A Monte Carlo simulation has been used to calculate the 
liability. The key assumptions in arriving at the value of the put are the equity value of Serasa, the future P/E ratio of Experian 
at the date of exercise, the respective volatilities of Experian and Serasa and the risk free rate in Brazil. It is also assumed 
that the put may be exercised in June 2012 and thereafter recorded as a current liability. Gains in respect of the valuation of 
the put option since acquisition in June 2007 have been recorded as financing fair value remeasurements and relate to a fall in 
the expected future Experian P/E ratio since acquisition and changes in the risk free rate in Brazil. The gain in respect of the 
valuation arising in the year ended 31 March 2009 was US$21m (2008: US$69m) with a currency translation gain of US$138m 
(2008: US$61m loss) recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.
(e) Amounts recognised in the Group income statement in connection with the Group’s hedging instruments are disclosed in 
note 9.

27. Share-based payment arrangements 
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans. These include options and awards in  
respect of shares in Experian plc made at or after the demerger in October 2006 together with options and awards previously 
made in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in Experian plc at  
the demerger.       
      
Prior to the demerger, Experian employees participated in share-based employee incentive plans in respect of ordinary shares 
in GUS plc. On demerger, although certain GUS options and awards vested early, the majority of Experian participants’ 
outstanding GUS options and awards rolled over into the Experian equivalent share-based employee incentive plans. 
Accordingly the following information relates to options and awards held by the Group’s employees including details in  
respect of Experian share-based employee incentive plans and, where appropriate, GUS share-based employee incentive plans. 
Option, award and share prices are disclosed in sterling as this is the currency in which ordinary shares in Experian plc are 
quoted and ordinary shares in GUS plc were quoted prior to the demerger.

1.  The North America Stock Option Plan was a former GUS share option plan which was rolled over into an Experian equivalent plan at the demerger. The 
arrangements in respect of other former GUS plans, which were also rolled over into Experian equivalent plans, are broadly similar to those of the equivalent 
Experian plans. These former GUS plans comprise The 1998 Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes and savings related share option 
plans. At roll-over, the quantity and exercise price of grants of all such plans were modified to adjust for the difference between the GUS and Experian share 
prices.
2. Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of an Experian plc share from the London Stock Exchange daily official list.
3. The stated values for expected departures include participants who did not meet the saving requirement of the plans.
4. The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year was £4.00 (2008: £5.02). 120 Experian Annual Report 2009
27. Share-based payment arrangements (continued) 
(ii) Information relating to option valuation techniques
For the above plans the Black-Scholes model is used to determine an appropriate value of the option grants and inputs into  
the model are calculated as follows:
Expected volatility – Calculated as an average over the expected life with an assumption made for volatility in each year of the 
expected life. V olatility in the first year is assumed to be the same as implied volatility on grant date. V olatility for year 4 and 
beyond is assumed to remain at the long run historic volatility. Linear interpolation is assumed for years 2 and 3.
Expected dividend yield – Yields are based on the current consensus analyst forecast figures at the time of grant. The inputs 
utilised are an average of the forecast over the next three financial years.
Risk-free rate – Rates are obtained from the UK Government Debt Management Office website which details historical prices 
and yields for gilt strips.
Expected option life to exercise: Experian plans - Options under the Experian Share Option Plan vest 50% after 3 years and  
50% after 4 years. The expected life is 4 years for the 50% that vest after 3 years and 4.85 years for the 50% that vest after 4 years. 
Options under the Experian Sharesave Plans have expected lives of either 3 or 5 years.
Expected option life to exercise: former GUS plans - Options under The 1998 Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share 
Option Schemes had expected lives of 4 years, The North America Stock Option Plan had an expected life of 3.75 years and  
the savings related share option plans had expected lives of either 3 or 5 years.
Share price on grant date - The closing price on the day the options were granted.
Option exercise price - Exercise price as stated in the terms of each award.

1.  The grant date is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed. This is before the quantity of the shares award is determined but the  
underlying value of the award is known at the grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition. The value of awarded shares reflects the 
performance outcome at the date of their issue to participants.
2.  The Benchmark profit performance condition for the Experian Co-Investment Plan requires Benchmark PBT growth to exceed 6% over a 3 year period. The period 
of assessment commences at the beginning of the financial year of grant. This is not a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
3.  The Benchmark profit performance condition for the Experian Reinvestment Plan and Experian Performance Share Plan requires Benchmark PBT growth at 
least to exceed 7% over a 3 year period with the condition fully satisfied if Benchmark PBT growth is 14%. The period of assessment commences at the beginning 
of the financial year of grant. This is not a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
4.  The Experian Performance Share Plan TSR condition is considered a ‘market-based’ performance condition as defined by IFRS 2. In valuing the awarded  
shares, TSR is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations for comparator companies measured over the 3 year period 
preceding valuation and an implied volatility for Experian plc.

(ii) Information relating to share grant valuation techniques
The majority of the grants under the Experian share award plans were made on the first day of trading for Experian plc shares  
in October 2006 and trading was particularly volatile on that day. The weighted average share price for that day’s trading was 
used to determine the value of demerger share awards. For the former GUS plans the value of awards is determined as the 
market closing price on the date awarded grants are issued to participants. For the Experian Reinvestment Plan and the 
former GUS Co-Investment Plan, this occurs after the first year of performance is assessed. Where appropriate market-based 
performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
Participants in the share award plans have an entitlement to dividend distributions on awarded shares from the issue date  
until the date of vesting. The market price on the day of valuation is considered inclusive of such future dividend distributions 
and no modifications are made for dividend distributions or other factors.

28. Retirement benefit assets/obligations
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans in a number of countries and provides post-retirement 
healthcare benefits to certain former employees. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of contributions that are paid by the 
Group into an independently administered fund.
Pension arrangements for the Group’s UK employees are operated principally through the Experian Pension Scheme which 
is a defined benefit plan and the Experian Money Purchase Pension Plan which is a defined contribution plan. These plans 
are governed by trust deeds which ensure that their finances and governance are independent from those of the Group. In 
North and Latin America, benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided 
accordingly. There are no other material pension arrangements.
The  Experian Pension Scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and is financed accordingly with assets being 
held in independently administered funds. A full actuarial funding valuation of this plan is carried out every three years with 
interim reviews in the intervening years. The latest full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by independent, qualified 
actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, using the projected unit credit method. Under this method of valuation the current service 
cost will increase as members approach retirement due to the ageing active membership of the plan. There was a surplus at the 
date of the latest full actuarial valuation and accordingly no deficit repayment contributions are currently required. The next full 
valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2010.
The disclosures required by IAS 19, which relate to the Group’s UK defined benefit pension arrangements only, are as follows:

The Group’s retirement benefit assets and obligations are denominated primarily in sterling.
The Group has in place arrangements which secure unfunded pension benefit arrangements for certain directors and senior 
managers by granting charges to an independent trustee over independently managed portfolios of marketable securities 
owned by the Group. The amount of assets charged in this way is adjusted annually to keep the ratio of assets charged to the 
discounted value of the accrued benefits secured in this way as close as possible to the corresponding ratio in the Experian 
Pension Scheme. The total value of the assets charged in this way at 31 March 2009 was US$22m (2008: US$34m). Further 
details of the unfunded pension arrangements for directors appear in the report on directors’ remuneration.

Contributions expected to be paid to the Experian defined benefit pension plans during the next financial year are US$11m by 
the Group and US$3m by employees.
Actuarial assumptions
The valuations used at 31 March 2009 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by Watson Wyatt 
Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19. The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the present value 
of the defined benefit obligations were as follows:
  2009 2008
  % %
Rate of inflation 3.4  3.6 
Rate of increase for salaries 5.2  5.4 
Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.4  3.6 
Rate of increase for medical costs 6.5  6.5 
Discount rate 6.9  6.9 
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i.e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. If this 
assumption increased/decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligations would decrease/increase by approximately US$11m 
and the annual current service cost would remain unchanged. The discount rate is based on the market yields on high quality 
corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations. In the case of the Group’s principal plan, 
the Experian Pension Scheme, the obligations are primarily in sterling and have a maturity of some 18 years.
The IAS 19 valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with the P A92 series year of use tables with medium cohort 
mortality improvement projections and an age rating of +1 year.  This includes an explicit allowance for anticipated future 
improvements in life expectancy (medium cohort projections).
The average expectation of life on retirement at age 65 in normal health is assumed to be:
  2009 2008
  years years
For a male currently aged 65 21.3 21.2
For a female currently aged 65 24.2 24.1
For a male currently aged 50 22.2 22.2
For a female currently aged 50 25.0 25.0
An increase in assumed life expectancy of 0.1 years would increase the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2009 by 
approximately US$3m.
The assumptions in respect of discount rate, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 
accounting valuation. Changes to these assumptions in the light of prevailing conditions may have a significant impact on 
future valuations.
The IAS 19 valuation, in respect of post-retirement healthcare benefits, additionally assumes a rate of increase for medical 
costs. If this assumption increased/decreased by 1.0% per annum the obligation would increase/decrease by US$1m and the 
current service cost would remain unchanged.

29. Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences to the extent that 
the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of US$430m (2008: US$32m) in respect of losses that can be carried forward 
against future taxable income. In addition the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of US$16m (2008: US$25m) in 
respect of capital losses that can be carried forward against future taxable gains. These losses are available indefinitely.
Deferred tax liabilities of US$2,062m (2008: US$2,004m) have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that 
would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, 
no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date there were deferred tax assets expected to reverse within the next year of US$129m (2008: US$128m) 
and deferred tax liabilities expected to reverse  within the next year of US$94m (2008: US$57m).

(2008: US$31m) in connection with the programme of cost efficiency measures and US$11m (2008: US$12m) in respect of 
obligations relating to the Group’s withdrawal from large scale credit card and loan account processing in the UK.
The restructuring provision at 31 March 2009 of US$1m (2008: US$8m) disclosed within non-current liabilities related to 
obligations connected with the Group’s withdrawal from large scale credit card and loan account processing in the UK.
Contingent and other liabilities comprise liabilities of Serasa, in connection with local legal and tax issues, which were 
primarily recognised at fair value on the acquisition of that company. Adjustments to the fair values are made as the exposures 
are concluded.
Fair values of provisions at the balance sheet dates do not materially differ from the recognised book values. 130 Experian Annual Report 2009

to the authorised and issued share capital of Experian plc at the balance sheet dates, together with details of ordinary shares 
issued since the balance sheet date, are contained in note K to the parent company financial statements.
The share premium account comprises the amount received in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued (i) by way of 
the share offer in October 2006, net of expenses, and (ii) by way of the subsequent issue of ordinary shares in connection with 
employee share option plans. The balance on this account is not available for distribution.
Retained earnings comprise net profits retained in the Group after the payment of equity dividends. The composition of 
and movements on other reserves are explained below. There are no significant statutory, contractual or exchange control 
restrictions on distributions by Group undertakings.

At 31 March 2009, the balance on the own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Experian 
plc Employee Share T rust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan to satisfy certain of the Group’s obligations 
under its share incentive plans. During the year ended 31 March 2008 these trusts purchased 509,518 shares in the Company at a 
cost of US$6m.
The merger reserve arose on the demerger in October 2006 and represents the difference between the share capital and  
share premium of GUS plc and the nominal value of the share capital of the Company before the global offer and subsequent 
share issues.
Movements on the hedging reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect hedging transactions which are not 
charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related taxation.
Movements on the translation reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect foreign currency translations since  
1 April 2004 which are not charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related taxation. 132 Experian Annual Report 2009

The Group did not enter into any new finance lease arrangements during the year (2008: US$nil). Finance lease obligations of

33. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) Acquisitions for the year ended 31 March 2009
On 10 December 2008, the Group acquired the whole of the issued share capital of SearchAmerica, Inc., a leading provider of 
payment prediction data and analytics to the healthcare industry in the USA, for US$90m. On 1 December 2008, a company in 
which the Group has a 75% interest acquired the whole of the issued share capital of KreditInform (Pty) Ltd, a leading provider 
of commercial credit information and analytics in South Africa. There were no other individually material acquisitions.
In aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed revenues of US$14m to the Group for the periods from their respective 
acquisition dates to 31 March 2009. The acquired businesses contributed aggregate profit after tax of US$4m to the Group for 
the periods from their respective acquisition dates to 31 March 2009. If these acquisitions had been completed on 1 April 2008, 
further revenues of US$22m would have been reported. It has been impracticable to estimate the impact on Group profit after 
tax had the acquired entities been owned from 1 April 2008, due to the acquired entities having different accounting policies 
prior to acquisition and previously reporting to different period ends.
Details of the net assets acquired at provisional fair values are as follows:
  Book value Fair value
  US$m US$m
Intangible assets –  63 
Property, plant and equipment 1  1

Acquisition expenses  2 
Deferred consideration  8

The book values above are the carrying amounts of each class of asset and liability, determined in accordance with IFRS, 
immediately before the acquisition.
The fair values set out above contain certain provisional amounts which will be finalised no later than one year after the date 
of acquisition. Provisional amounts have been included at 31 March 2009 as a consequence of the timing and complexity of the 
acquisitions. Fair value adjustments in respect of acquisitions made during the year resulted in an increase in book value of 
US$58m and arose principally in respect of acquisition intangibles. Goodwill represents the synergies, assembled workforce 
and future growth potential of the businesses acquired. 
Deferred consideration is primarily payable in cash up to three years after the date of acquisition and in some cases is 
contingent on the businesses acquired achieving revenue and profit targets. The deferred consideration settled during the year 
on acquisitions made in previous years was US$59m.
There have been no material gains, losses, error corrections or other adjustments recognised in the year ended 31 March 2009 
that relate to acquisitions that were effected in the current or previous years.

36. Contingencies
In North America and Latin America, there are a number of pending and threatened litigation claims involving Experian which 
are being vigorously defended. The directors do not believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will 
have a materially adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. However, as is inherent in legal proceedings, there is a risk  
of outcomes unfavourable to the Group. In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group would benefit from applicable 
insurance recoveries.
37. Related parties
The ultimate parent company of the Group is Experian plc which is incorporated in Jersey. Significant subsidiary and associate 
undertakings at 31 March 2009 are shown in note Q to the financial statements of that company.
The Group’s only material related parties are associates and key management personnel. T ransactions with such parties 
during the year were as follows:
(a) Associates
The Group made net sales and recharges, under normal commercial terms and conditions that would be available to third 
parties, to FARES and its associate First Advantage Corporation of US$25m (2008: US$28m). Amounts receivable from 
FARES are shown within note 19. These amounts outstanding are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have 
been given or received in the year in connection with the Group’s trading with these entities. No provisions have been made for 
doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by associates.
(b) Key management personnel
Remuneration of key management personnel is disclosed in note 7. Other than remuneration, there were no material 
transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families in either the 
current or previous year.

Company financial statements
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Experian plc 
W e have audited the parent company financial statements of Experian plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise 
the parent company profit and loss account, the parent company balance sheet and the related notes.  These parent company 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  We have also audited the information in 
the report on directors’ remuneration that is described as having been audited.
W e have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Experian plc for the year ended 31 March 2009.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the report on directors’ remuneration and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on A uditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose.  W e do 
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.  We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report 
includes that specific information presented in the business review that is cross referred from the directors’ report.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records or if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We read the other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent 
company financial statements. This other information comprises only the Group financial highlights, the directors’ report, the 
chairman’s statement, the business review, the board of directors, the unaudited part of the report on directors’ remuneration, 
the corporate governance statement and all of the other information listed on the contents listing. W e consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial 
statements.  Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
parent company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by 
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally  -
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of the profit for the year 
then ended;
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law  -
1991; and
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. -

A. Corporate information
Experian plc (the ‘Company’) is incorporated and registered in Jersey as a public company limited by shares. The principal 
legislation under which the Company operates is Jersey Companies Law and regulations made thereunder. The Company 
changed its name from Experian Group Limited on 21 July 2008. 
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the Experian group of companies (the 
‘Group’), whose principal activity is business services. The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
B. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. They have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical 
cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). 
In preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company has used sterling as its local and 
presentational currency. The financial statements for the Company for the year ended 31 March 2010 will be prepared and 
presented in US dollars.
 
The Company financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and related notes. The Company has 
taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’. 
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other 
members of the Group. 
The Experian plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 contain financial instrument disclosures 
required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and these would also comply with the disclosures 
required by FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’. Accordingly, the Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption in FRS 29 and has not presented separate financial instrument disclosures.
Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented.
T angible fixed assets
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset and the remaining life of the lease.
Leases
Gross rental income receivable and payable in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the 
periods of the leases.
Investments in group undertakings
Investments in group undertakings are stated at cost less provision considered necessary for any impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
Where there is an indication of impairment, fixed assets are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 
‘Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill’.  Any impairment is recognised in the year in which it occurs.
Debtors and creditors
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and carried at the lower of cost and recoverable amount.  Where the time value 
of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.  Creditors are initially recognised at fair value and carried at 
amortised cost if the time value of money is material.
Cash at bank and in hand 
Cash at bank and in hand includes deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments. Bank 
overdrafts are shown within current liabilities in the Company balance sheet.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The 
interest differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to interest expense. Forward foreign exchange 
contracts are recognised at fair value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. Gains or 
losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are taken directly to net foreign exchange gains or losses in the profit and loss 
account.

B. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and 
is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. 
Own shares
The Experian plc Employee Share T rust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan are separately administered 
trusts. Liabilities of these trusts are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the trusts mainly comprise shares in the 
Company. The assets, liabilities and expenses of the trusts are included in the Company’s financial statements as if they were 
the Company’s own with shares in the Company held by the trusts shown as a deduction from total equity shareholders’ funds 
at cost.
Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans. These include options and awards in respect 
of shares in the Company made at or after demerger in October 2006 together with options and awards previously granted in 
respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger. 
The fair value of such options and awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised after taking into account the 
Company’s best estimate of the number of options and awards expected to vest. The Company revises the vesting estimate 
at each balance sheet date and non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.  Amounts are 
recognised over the vesting period. Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, 
Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award. Market based performance conditions are 
included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
The issuance by the Company of share incentives to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions 
and the fair value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Company’s investment in group 
undertakings with a corresponding increase in total equity shareholders’ funds.
C. Operating loss
The Company’s operating loss is stated after charging:

(i) Staff costs £m £m
Directors’ fees 1.1 1.1

(i) T ax charge for the year
There was no tax charge for the year (2008: £nil). The rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 25% for investment income.  The 
reconciliation of the tax charge for the year is as follows:
  2009 2008
  £m £m
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities before tax 8.7  (15.2)
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax of 25% 2.2 (3.8)

T ax losses not utilised 4.1 3.4 
Current tax charge for the year –  – 
(ii)  Factors that may affect future tax charges
In the foreseeable future, the Company’s tax charge will continue to be influenced by the nature of its income and expenditure 
and could be affected by changes in tax law.
F . Dividend
During the year the Company paid interim equity dividends of £34.1m (2008: £30.9m) to ordinary shareholders. The directors 
have announced a second interim dividend of 13.25 US cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2009. This dividend 
is not included as a liability in these financial statements as it was not announced before 31 March 2009. For further details of 
payment arrangements see note 13 to the Group financial statements.

Capital Gains T ax (‘CGT’) base cost for UK shareholders
On 10 October 2006, GUS plc separated its Experian business from its Home Retail Group business by way of demerger. 
Following the demerger, GUS shareholders at 4.30pm on 6 October 2006 were entitled to receive one share in  
Experian plc (formerly Experian Group Limited) and one share in Home Retail Group plc for every share they held in GUS plc  
at that time.
The previous base cost of any GUS plc shares held at 4.30pm on 6 October 2006 is apportioned for UK CGT purposes in the 
following ratio: 58.235% to Experian plc shares and 41.765% to Home Retail Group plc shares (based on the closing prices of  
the respective shares on their first day of trading after their admission to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on  
11 October 2006).
For GUS plc shares acquired prior to the demerger of Burberry on 13 December 2005 which are affected by both the Burberry 
demerger and the subsequent separation of Experian and Home Retail Group, the original CGT base cost is apportioned 
50.604% to Experian plc shares, 36.293% to Home Retail Group plc shares and 13.103% to Burberry Group plc shares.

Highlights
For the year ended 31 March 2003: 2
I
am pleased to present
InTechnology’s Annual Report
for 2002-3, a year which has
seen the Company take
significant strides forward both 
in strengthening its UK position
and as a result of the proposed
acquisition of Allasso, in
accessing the wider European
marketplace.
The overall strategic direction of
the Company has been vigorously
pursued with revenues from the
established Storage Solutions
business generating cash to
support investment in the newer
Managed Services business.
Of particular interest has been the
confidence shown in our growing
portfolio of Managed Services by
major enterprises and by
departments at the heart of
Government. These Services have
proved their value and significance
for all organisations concerned
about the safety of data and
business continuity in today’s
world. I am encouraged that the
far-sighted investment by
InTechnology in secure Data
Centres, in robust communications
and in skilled technical staff has
proved to be of key importance
and of great value to our partners
in meeting client needs.
InTechnology’s development is
supported by major vendors in the
IT marketplace, by a strong
network of reseller partners,
system integrators and
consultants and by highly skilled
and committed staff.
I would like to thank them all for
their support in the past year and
look forward to seeing further
growth in the year ahead.
Lord Parkinson
Non-Executive President
Non-Executive President’s introduction
“ ... a year which has
seen the Company
take significant 
strides forward ...” 3
Overview
I
am pleased to present the
results of InTechnology plc for
the year ended 31 March 2003
which show a strong performance
in a challenging market for IT
expenditure. 
Our strategy this year has been
twofold. First and foremost, our
goal has been to align the
business to manage the downturn
across the IT industry by ensuring
that we maintain our significant
market share. We have continued
to consolidate our position by
aggressively driving volumes in
our SSS Division and successfully
offering managed infrastructure
services to new customers. The
result is a robust sales
performance in SSS and
continued growth in the value of
contract wins in MDS, which now
stands in excess of £40m (2002:
£22m) and will generate £10.5m
of recurring revenue per annum
(2002: £6.9m).
A focus on costs has also been
necessary during the year to
protect margins. The closure of
our German subsidiary and better
expenditure control have enabled
us to achieve a consistent cost
level, despite our investment in
new services.
The second strand of our strategy
has been to underpin the future
success of the business through
new developments and expansion.
The first of these has been
achieved through the continued
progress with our MDS division,
as well as exciting new
developments such as our
UK-wide high bandwidth network
and our long-term data storage
proposition. As far as expansion
is concerned, the proposed
acquisition of Allasso not only
adds distribution capability across
Europe, but also introduces a new
and rapidly expanding service line
to our offering.
Trading and operating
performance
As noted in our interim financial
statement, we have not
experienced quite the same
decline in revenues felt by much
of the IT industry and believe that
we have grown our market share.
The volume of data storage
products sold continues to
increase but, on account of the
significant price erosion, we have
reported a marginal decline in
overall revenues compared to the
prior year. We continue to adopt a
rigorous approach to cost control
which has enabled us to maintain
reasonable profit margins.
Turnover for the year was
£156.9m (2002: £158.1m) and
despite the market environment,
gross profit increased to £23.3m
(2002: £22.3m). Net operating
expenses before depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items remained
consistent at £19.3m (2002:
£19.4m). Total net operating
expenses were £29.8m (2002:
£104.6m). Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items improved to
£3.9m (2002: £2.8m). Total
operating loss before interest and
tax was £6.6m (2002: £82.7m).
The Group reported a loss for the
financial year of £7.0m (2002:
£83.2m) resulting in a loss per
share of 5.10p (2002: 60.23p).
InTechnology’s balance sheet
remains strong, with cash of
£18.2m (2002: £23.3m) and 
net cash, after finance leases 
and term loans, of £10.0m 
(2002: £13.7m). 
Executive Chairman’s statement
“ ... the proposed acquisition of Allasso not only adds
distribution capability across Europe, but also
introduces a new and rapidly expanding service 
line to our offering .” 4
SSS Division
The mix of revenues within SSS
has changed over the last year
with growth in our HP, IBM and
Software and Service activities
offset by a decline in sales of Sun
equipment. Software and Services
revenues have continued to
increase and we will continue to
focus on growing these in the
year ahead. 
In the year, SSS has achieved
revenues of £148.7m (2002:
£154.0m) but, with reduced costs,
has reported a small decrease in
operating margins before goodwill
amortisation to 5.5% (2002:
5.7%). Operating margin after
goodwill amortisation was 4.3%
(2002: 4.6%). The Division
returned an operating profit
before goodwill amortisation of
£8.1m (2002: £8.8m). Divisional
operating profit before interest
and tax was £6.4m (2002: £7.1m).
Consultancy, maintenance and
software revenues amounted to
16.6% (2002: 12.8%) of the
Division’s revenue.
MDS Division
MDS has achieved revenues of
£8.2m (2002: £4.1m), with an
operating loss before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional
items of £9.1m (2002: £9.7m),
which reflects our ongoing
investment in the division.
Divisional operating loss before
interest and tax was £13.0m
(2002: £89.4m).
The division secured a number of
high profile customer wins,
including Chrysalis, Harvey
Nichols, Numis, Cheshire Police,
The Department for Transport,
Sitel, Scottish Enterprise and
WS Atkins. Roll out and
deployment of these managed
services tends to commence some
months after the contract is won
so the financial impact of these
recurring revenues tends not to be
seen until up to six months later.
New developments
In February 2003, we introduced a
high bandwidth communications
network running through 19 of
the UK’s major cities to support
MDS. This Wide Area LAN
Extension Service provides
powerful and secure connectivity
for our enterprise clients, enabling
them to backup large data
volumes on a national basis rather
than, as previously, in the London
area alone. 
Although only recently
commissioned, we are already
seeing our clients benefit from its
performance and the expanded
range of services we can now
offer them. Clients who have
adopted our managed storage
service are now also taking
internet access, hosting and pure
connectivity services from us.
This spring we launched a pilot
programme to test our managed
long-term storage proposition to
address clients’ needs to securely
archive data. There is a growing
need to archive electronic records
in industry and the public sector
which is driven in part by
regulatory pressure. We continue
to anticipate that future data
storage solutions will incorporate
these features.

Operational changes
With all the indicators showing
substantial potential for
InTechnology’s services, especially
among blue-chip companies, we
have undertaken two operational
changes this year which we
believe will position InTechnology
more effectively to exploit the
opportunities we see in the
storage market.
• We have grouped all of the
development, support and sales of
our Managed Services into a
single operation, accountable for
the entirety of its activities. While
MDS was in its infancy, it was
beneficial to separately manage
the development, support and
sales of these services. They are
now sufficiently robust to be run
as a single division, run by a
newly appointed executive. 
• In the interests of rigorous
cost control, we closed our
loss-making subsidiary in
Germany in October 2002. This
subsidiary was engaged purely in
the provision of managed services
where we felt that greater critical
mass and relationships were
required to ensure success. The
intended acquisition of Allasso is
expected to provide a firmer
platform for the launch of
managed services again as well as
for storage product sales. 
Allasso
In April 2003, we announced that
we had agreed to purchase the
pan-European specialist security
distributor Allasso from its parent,
Articon-Integralis. Allasso will
provide us with a platform of
some 7,000 additional resellers
across six European countries
through which we can expand our
storage sales. In the year ended
31 December 2002 Allasso
reported proforma revenues of
€152.0m (£104.8m)
1
and EBITDA
of €10.5m (£7.2m)
1
. EBIT was
€8.3m (£5.7m)
1
.
The network security market,
where Allasso is strongest, is
an attractive growing market
and complementary to the
storage market as almost all new
data storage devices are linked
into networks and are in need
of security.
The acquisition is conditional
upon Articon-Integralis
shareholder approval at a general
meeting on 23 June 2003 with
anticipated completion at the end
of July 2003. 
Current trading
The first two months of this
fiscal year show no change in the
data storage market conditions
from the preceding half. The
performance of our SSS Division
in this period has started in the
same vein as at the start of last
year. Encouragingly, activity levels
in our MDS Division remain high
with a run rate of contract wins
in line with our expectations.
Outlook
Data volumes continue to grow
inexorably and organisations of all
sizes are looking for solutions to
the critical problems of data
management and storage. At the
same time, companies everywhere
are looking for ways to contain or
reduce IT spend. So, in close
partnership with vendors and our
customers, we will continue to
explore ways to provide the value
and services that clients need. 
We expect our portfolio of
managed data services (which
includes offsite backup, data
replication, hosting, network
connectivity and other
infrastructure-related services),
to become increasingly popular
among our partners as a means to
enable their clients’ organisations
to outsource the network
computing elements of their IT
which are capital intensive and
time-consuming for enterprises
to manage.

Chief Executive Officer’s report
C
ontinued growth in demand
for data storage solutions,
combined with intense pressure
from companies to reduce the cost
of their IT provision, contributed to
a mixed result from InTechnology’s
two divisions:
• The SSS Division reported a
marginal decline in revenue
versus the prior year but
managed to maintain its
operating margin before goodwill
amortisation at 5.5% (2002:
5.7%) and generate in excess of
£8m of cash. Operating margin
after goodwill amortisation 
was 4.3% (2002: 4.6%).
• The MDS Division, which
provides outsourced secure data
storage and other IT and
network infrastructure services,
has grown by 100.7% in
revenue terms for the third
successive year, though it
remains loss making.
In what has been a challenging
commercial environment in the last
12 months, we have been able to
grow our market share of storage
distribution in the UK; the level of
activity in our MDS Division has
been increasing quarter on quarter;
and in April 2003, we announced
our intention to acquire Allasso,
the specialist pan-European
security products distributor, from
Articon-Integralis, which, if
approved, will provide us with a
firm platform from which we can
replicate our successful UK
business model into other
continental European markets. We,
therefore, look forward to renewed
growth in our business.
SSS Division
Overall revenues for the SSS
division declined by 3.5% against
prior year to £148.7m. However,
this masks some variances in
underlying performance, which saw
year-on-year growth in sales of
IBM and HP products compared to
a relatively significant decline in
sales of Sun storage equipment.
The proportion of software,
maintenance and consultancy
revenue within this division has
also grown in both absolute and
relative terms to some £24.7m
(2002: £19.7m) and we expect this
trend to continue.
Our resilient performance in
challenging circumstances is due in
part to the level of investment we
have made in supporting our
channel partners over a number of
years, (prioritising training,
consultancy for themselves and
their clients) as well as the
commitment of certain leading
vendors to their channel strategies.
The commitment from key vendors
has enabled us to plan our own
investment over an extended
period so that we can secure
adequate returns from this division.
MDS Division
The MDS Division grew revenues
by 100.7% this year as its
contracted pipeline of high quality
customers has expanded from a
cumulative value of £22m of
contracts won in March 2002 to
in excess of £40m today.
We are encouraged by the recent
levels of activity, which have
resulted in winning contracts to
manage the data storage and
infrastructure requirements for
various large private and public
sector clients. In every case we
have worked with consultants,
systems integrators, IT outsourcers
or resellers to provide them with
the infrastructure and skills
necessary to offer a very cost
effective managed service to
their clients.
As companies examine ways to
reduce the costs of their IT
infrastructure; as they recognise the
benefit of having their business-
critical data housed externally with
experts in a post 11 September
world; and, as they become
comfortable with outsourcing
certain infrastructure functions to a
provider like InTechnology with the
skills, economies of scale and an
ability to help them optimise the IT
investments in data storage, so we
expect to see our business grow.
Over the course of this year we are
pleased to have added high-profile
customers such as Harvey Nichols,
The Department for Transport, WS
Atkins, ACAS, GVA Grimley, Scottish
Enterprise, Sitel and Bristows. We
have also increased the average size
and value of contracts won so that
we now manage in excess of 31
terabytes of data for clients and
average customer contract values
have risen to £374,000 from
£311,000 a year ago.
Particularly important this year has
been the increasing level of activity
by our partners with our MDS
Division and the successful
implementation of our high
bandwidth network around the UK, 7
Chief Executive Officer’s report cont.
which we have leased from
Fibernet. Since February 2003, we
have been able to offer a full suite
of managed services in some 19
cities around the UK when
previously we were limited to
central London on account of
regional UK bandwidth prices. As
the benefit of this network to our
Managed Services is just beginning
to be felt, so it should underpin the
continued expansion of this
division in the coming quarters.
We are also beginning to see
renewals of some of the earliest
contracts for our managed storage
service and clients starting to take
incremental infrastructure services
from us such as hosting, VPNs,
firewall management and internet
access. As the trend continues to
outsource IT infrastructure to
specialist companies capable of
providing superior service and
economies of scale, we believe
InTechnology is well positioned to
support such customers’ needs.
Continental Europe
In the course of this year we have
closed our Managed Services
subsidiary in Germany (October
2002) and announced our intention
to acquire the pan-European
specialist security products
distributor, Allasso (April 2003). We
closed the subsidiary because we
believed the time it would take to
generate a profit would be too long
given its limited scale, track record
and nascent relationships with its
channel. Outsourced service
providers are the trusted partners
of clients and these relationships
and reputations take time to
develop. By contrast, Allasso has a
network of well-established and
strong channel relationships; it is
already profitable and has an
experienced management team;
and we believe it will provide a
firm foundation for InTechnology to
expand both its storage distribution
and Managed Services into a
number of Europe’s other major 
IT markets.
The distribution of security
products, particularly firewalls and
VPN technologies, are closely linked
to the sale of network-based
storage products. Allasso has
relationships with some 7,000
resellers, many of whom wish to
become channel partners for
storage. It has 220 employees
operating within the UK, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain
and Italy, and in the year ended
31 December 2002 it generated
revenue of €152.0m and EBITDA of
€10.5m. EBIT was €8.3m.
The acquisition is conditional upon
Articon-Integralis shareholder
approval at a general meeting on
23 June 2003 with anticipated
completion at the end of July 2003.
Creating a competitive 
cost structure
In the market environment in
which we operate it is imperative
to create competitive cost
structures, particularly when our
partners and customers have a
similar focus on value and returns
on investment. In both divisions
and at a central level we have
maintained a policy of careful cost
control this year. This is evidenced
by our continued level of operating
margin within the SSS Division
and a focus of value-engineering
within the MDS Division. The
implementation of our UK network,
for example, has enabled us to
drive substantial levels of cost out
of our higher-end managed 
storage offering.
Outlook
Greater circulation of data,
increased regulation and the use of
more media-rich applications are
obliging companies to continue to
invest in data storage capacity.
Our strategy remains keenly
focused on:
• Consolidating our market share
in storage distribution in the UK;
• Expanding the contribution
to revenue from software
and services;
• Enhancing the rapid growth
of our MDS Division towards
profitability; and 
• The expansion of our businesses
into continental Europe.
While our performance will
continue to be influenced by the
successes and difficulties of our
vendors and partners, we are
confident that we have the
strategy in place to continue to
maximise our performance.

SSS
Turnover in the storage products division fell by 3.5% to
£148.7m (2002: £154.0m). Although sales of hardware
product have declined to £124.1m (2002: £134.3m) there
has been strong sales growth in storage software to £19.2m
(2002: £13.4m). We expect this part of our business to
advance further in the coming year and increase its
contribution to divisional profitability.
MDS
Turnover increased by 100.7% to £8.2m (2002: £4.1m) with
cumulative contract wins now in excess of £40m (2002:
£22m).
Despite an increase in divisional gross profit to £4.9m
(2002: £2.6m) the divisional cost base has increased
leading to operating losses before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items of £9.1m (2002: £9.7m). Operating
losses after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
was £13.0m (2002: £89.4m). This reflects additional
development costs incurred together with set-up costs
expensed to establish LANNet (our high performance UK
wide network).
“The cash generative
nature of our business
continues to be
evidenced by a net cash
inflow from operating
activities of £2.4m
(2002: £4.0m).” 9
German subsidiary
During the year we closed our loss
making subsidiary based in
Germany. Total costs of £1,645,000
are shown as an exceptional
operating expense in the profit and
loss account and comprise the loss
before taxation of £895,000 and a
provision for closure costs of
£750,000 (£209,000 of which
remained at 31 March 2003 against
on-going lease commitments). The
Company was closed on 17 October
2002 leading to annualised cost
savings of £1,800,000.
Goodwill
We have continued to evaluate the
carrying value of the Group’s
goodwill balances by comparing
them to their recoverable amounts,
represented by their value in use to
the Group. The value in use has
been derived from discounted cash
flow projections that cover the
4 years from 1 April 2003. After
this 4-year period, the projections
use a long-term growth rate. Our
confidence in the long-term
success of both SSS and MDS
divisions indicate that no further
impairment write down is
necessary this year.
Cash flow and liquidity
The cash generative nature of our
business continues to be evidenced
by a net cash inflow from operating
activities of £2.4m (2002: £4.0m).
Cash at bank and in hand at the
year end was £18.2m (2002:
£23.3m). With net cash inflow of
£8.7m (2002: £8.4m) SSS 
continues to demonstrate its 
ability to substantially fund 
the growth of the MDS division
towards profitability.
Taxation
The tax charge of £0.4m (2002:
£0.7m) on the loss on ordinary
activities of £6.7m (2002: £82.5m)
arises because goodwill
amortisation and the exceptional
charge in respect of the German
subsidiary are not taxable
deductions. A full reconciliation of
the tax charge is provided in note 5
of the financial statements.
Financial instruments
The Group’s policy is that no
trading in financial instruments is
undertaken. The Group’s financial
instruments comprise borrowings,
cash and liquid resources and
various items that arise directly
from its operations. The main risks
arising from these are interest rate
risk and liquidity risk and as
European expansion occurs, the
Group will become exposed to
foreign currency risk. All these risks
are continually assessed and at
present are considered minimal.
Allasso
On 10 April 2003 InTechnology
announced that it had reached
agreement with Articon-Integralis
AG to acquire the share capital of
its subsidiaries making up the
specialist network and information
security distributor business,
Allasso, for an initial consideration
of €25.0m (£17.2m)
1
, with
potential deferred consideration of
up to €3.8m (£2.6m)
1
. The
consideration for the acquisition
will be paid in cash and will be
financed from InTechnology’s
internal cash resources and new
borrowing facilities which are
currently being negotiated.
Allasso is Europe’s leading
specialist distributor of IT security
products, with over 220 staff and
operations in six countries. In the
year ended 31 December 2002
Allasso reported proforma revenues
of €152.0m (£104.8m)
1
and EBITDA
of €10.5m (£7.2m)
1
. EBIT was
€8.3m (£5.7m)
1
.
Completion is expected on 31 July
2003, and will be subject to
Articon-Integralis shareholder
approval at a shareholder meeting
on 23 June 2003.
Note

An exchange rate of £1 to €1.45

Summary
InTechnology continues to perform
robustly in an environment of
tightening IT expenditure. With the
proposed acquisition of Allasso, the
enlarged Group will be in a strong
position to leverage existing and
new products and services 
into Europe.

Managed Services
InTechnology offers a range of
Managed Services to businesses
seeking to outsource part or all of
their IT infrastructure. With new
regulations on Data Protection and
increasing concerns for Business
Continuity in a climate of risk,
organisations of all sizes are
choosing to have their corporate
data secured offsite by
InTechnology.
These services are bought on a
subscription basis and the sharp rise
in numbers of clients in the past
year includes major Government
Departments and world-class
businesses, medium-sized agencies
and companies, law firms,
consultancies and charities. 11
Products & services review cont.
Data is backed up on an automated
basis, encrypted and sent offsite via
InTechnology’s private network to a
secure Data Centre where it is
supervised by teams of storage
experts and can be retrieved in
seconds. In case of a major disaster,
data can be accessed by staff
working remotely, ensuring 
business continuity.
Clients can be confident that the
integrity and security of their data
is assured at all times and that they
have in place a reliable strategy for
business continuity. 
Because InTechnology has made the
major investment in technical skills,
secure Data Centres and
communications to support these
Managed Services, clients can enjoy
the benefits without having to
invest in their own facilities. Clients
also save on staff costs and
ongoing hardware costs.
Services are configured around the
specific requirements of individual
clients, from SME’s to major
enterprises.
They include:
• Network Services
• Data Centre Services
• Managed Data 
Recovery Solutions
• Professional Services
In February 2003 InTechnology
invested in a high-speed, low cost
communications network, LANnet
to bring Managed Services to
clients of all sizes around the UK 
at lower cost.
InTechnology’s Data Centres in
Harrogate and London offer
connectivity and a secure, top-
quality environment for holding
and storing client data backup,
replication or long term storage.
Storage solutions can be replicated
at high speed between Data
Centres and customer sites utilising
the high capacity LANnet
infrastructure. Clients gain from
secure and immediate storage of all
their data, along with instant and
flexible access to that data from 
all their offices connected to 
the network. 
For enterprises facing rapidly
growing data volumes,
InTechnology offers a long term
storage and data archiving service.
Regulatory and fiscal requirements
mean that businesses increasingly
need to store data securely offsite
for periods of up to 7 years or
longer. InTechnology’s archiving
service enables pre-selected data to
be taken on an automated basis
from client site, fed through a
private network to a Data Centre
and stored securely there for as
long as necessary.
“Clients can be confident
that the integrity and
security of their data is
assured at all times ...” 12
Case studies
Trendsetting technology for world
class fashion
Harvey Nichols has long been
established in its London
Knightsbridge headquarters as an
international leader in high fashion
and style; as the glamorous Harvey
Nichols brand has developed with
stores around the UK, Harvey
Nichols has taken the lead in the
field of modern technology too –
the Group’s business expansion is
underpinned securely with
InTechnology’s Managed Services. 
Harvey Nichols IT Service Delivery
Manager Steve Ellis realised that
business expansion was going to
bring problems in communications
and consistent data backup across
the Harvey Nichols stores; each
store has its own system for
electronic point of sale and data
backup but skilled IT resource to
assure procedures is available only
in the London headquarters. Up to
date and accurate data is vital in
the retail world for business
operations and planning, so action
was required to assure reliable
and secure backup of critical
business data.
“I could see instantly the benefits of
centralised backup with the VBAK
service from InTechnology – with
our new Virtual Private Network
(‘VPN’) infrastructure in place, we
could backup all our servers
remotely across the VPN.”
The VBAK Plus service from
InTechnology now backs up data
from all of Harvey Nichols’ EPOS
systems, office systems at the
stores, merchandising systems,
financial systems, personnel and
payroll systems.
VBAK Plus is a fully managed,
online data backup, restoration,
archiving and business continuity
service. A full copy of client data is
retained online in a secure offsite
location, enabling immediate
restoration of data 24 x 7. Integrity
of data is assured through use of
sophisticated encryption technology
onto a dedicated platform. A simple
'pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-grow'
charging model provides scalability
and predictability of costs. 
“A major benefit of VBAK Plus has
been for our Disaster Recovery
strategy,” says Steve Ellis. “We have
the VPN permanently connected
into a Disaster Recovery centre; in
case of any disaster, we can
decamp to the centre, reconnect
back into the stores with the VPN
and restore all our data using 
VBAK Plus.”
“The September 11th factor is still
very real – we have all our ‘crown
jewels’ as a business in one location
– all our major databases and all
our vital servers – and we need to
know that they are securely backed
up in case of disaster.”
“Our stores can carry on trading
with their own EPOS systems but
the whole system would grind to a
halt quickly without access to
central systems for stock
replenishment and data on
transactions. With VBAK Plus, all
this critical business data is safe.”
Building an efficient 
business solution
The National Housing Federation
leads the way in independent social
housing throughout England. This
important organisation has now
built a robust and secure business
solution for its data management
and backup services, which will
assure the integrity of members’
data and also serve as a model for
the housing associations.
InTechnology’s Managed Services
provide business continuity for this
premier organisation and its 1,400
members, managing around 
1.8m homes.
Safeguarding the records of
members and other corporate data
is a key issue for Rob Green, IT
Manager at The National Housing
Federation. With increasing data
volumes generated by the
Federation’s successful
development, Rob became
concerned that the data backup
system in use was not adequate
for present and future
requirements. As well as practical
concerns about the vulnerability to
error of the existing tape-based,
manual data backup and backup
servers, Rob was also faced with
recurring costs for backup media
and licences and could see
problems ahead with media
changes. The Federation is
planning a disaster recovery
strategy, so that core data needs
to be held safely offsite for restore
after a disaster, rather than on the
Federation premises. Data security
at the regional offices was a
further worry, with local staff
carrying out backups outside the
supervision of the IT department. 13
Rob decided to switch away from
traditional tape-based methods of
data backup and invest in Managed
Services from data storage experts
InTechnology. The VBAK service
provides automated data backup
without the need for manual
intervention and extends around
all of the Federation’s branch
offices as well as head office.
Data is automatically encrypted
at a central point and sent offsite
via a private leased line to a
secure InTechnology Data Centre.
Business continuity is assured as
data can be restored in minutes –
whether as individual files or an
entire application.
“We no longer need to purchase
backup media and licences or worry
about media changes or backup
server upgrades in the future,”
explained Rob.
“We automatically have off-site
storage of backups for Disaster
Recovery and all our regional
offices can be backed up using
the same process with full
control maintained within the
IT department.”
Backup that can keep up 
with Porsche
In the fast-moving and highly-
competitive world of premium
sports cars, Porsche stays ahead of
the competition through an
unremitting focus on top-quality
innovation and excellence. Like all
other leaders in manufacturing,
Porsche keeps up with the pace of
tomorrow by accelerating today –
to protect its vital business data
today and to save on costs, Porsche
Cars Great Britain Ltd has invested
in VBAK, one of the Managed
Services from InTechnology.
“The VBAK system rolls a data
backup solution into a disaster
recovery solution, killing two birds
with one stone,” says Mike
Rowland, Group IT Manager 
at Porsche.
Porsche’s success is due to a
continuous increase in the
efficiency of all processes and
the streamlining of structures -
group-wide. The quality and
performance of the famous sports
cars has to be matched by the
systems that underpin the business.
When Mike Rowland joined Porsche
in 2001 as Group IT Manager, he
rapidly concluded that two areas
needed to be addressed: the
manual, tape backup process had
inherent integrity problems and
there was no adequate disaster
recovery strategy in place.
Although Porsche business systems
are based at the head office in
Germany, the British file servers
hold irreplaceable and confidential
customer information, together
with all current and archived
emails, so disaster recovery for the
system was a big issue.
“If a server goes down it's
absolutely critical that you can rely
on your backups 100%, traditional
tape media, in my opinion, just has
too many inherent problems – our
data is so valuable that you can’t
attach a cost to it!”
Mike was able to show a clear cost
justification for investing in the
VBAK service and was given the
go-ahead for installation of the
system at Porsche UK headquarters
near Reading.
“VBAK speaks for itself – we
compared the initial cost and
ongoing subscription against the
costs of the tape system with its
tapes, disks, cost of offsite storage
and the costs of staff time doing
the backups and waiting hours for
restores. There are lots of high-
profile people driving Porsche cars
and our customer lists are highly
confidential. This coupled with our
servicing and warranty information
means that our data needs to be
100% reliable and VBAK gives us
the comfort factor of knowing that
our backups are completed in a
secure off-site environment," said
Mike Rowland. 14

Going concern
Under company law, the Directors
are required to consider whether it
is appropriate to prepare financial
statements on the basis that the
Company and Group are going
concerns. As part of its normal
business practice, budgets, cash
flow forecasts and longer term
financial projections are prepared
and in reviewing this information,
the Directors are satisfied that the
Company and the Group have
adequate resources to enable them
to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. The Directors
have therefore adopted the going
concern basis in the preparation of
the financial statements.
Director’s report 17
Employees
The Group places considerable
value on the involvement of its
employees and has continued its
practice of keeping them informed
of matters affecting them as
employees and the various factors
affecting the performance of 
the Group.
The Directors recognise that
continued and sustained
improvement in the performance of
the Group depends on its ability to
attract, motivate and retain
employees of the highest calibre.
Furthermore, the Directors believe
that the Group’s ability to sustain a
competitive advantage over the
long term depends in a large part
on ensuring that all employees
contribute to the maximum of their
potential. The Group is committed
to improving the performance of all
employees through development
and training.
The Group is an equal opportunity
employer. The Group’s policies seek
to promote an environment free
from discrimination, harassment
and victimisation and to ensure
that no employee or applicant is
treated less favourably on the
grounds of gender, marital status,
age, race, colour, nationality or
national origin, disability or sexual
orientation or is disadvantaged by
conditions or requirements, which
cannot objectively be justified.
Entry into, and progression within
the Group, is solely determined on
the basis of work criteria and
individual merit.
Share schemes
Share ownership is at the heart of
the Group’s remuneration
philosophy and the Directors
believe that the key to the Group’s
future success lies in a motivated
workforce holding a stake in the
Company. The schemes are
described in the Board’s
Remuneration report and details of
the options granted under the
schemes are set out in note 18 to
the financial statements. All
permanent employees are eligible
to join the schemes.
Research and development
The Group continues to undertake
research and development of new
products with the objective of
increasing future profitability. The
cost to the Group is charged to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Policy and practice on 
payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to agree
terms and conditions for its
business transactions with its
suppliers. The Group seeks to
abide by the payment terms
agreed with suppliers whenever it
is satisfied that the supplier has
provided the goods or services in
accordance with the agreed terms
and conditions.
Average creditor days for the year
ended 31 March 2003 was 41 days
(2002: 41 days).
Environment
The Group recognises the
importance of environmental
responsibility. The nature of its
activities has a minimal effect on
the environment but where they
do, the Group acts responsibly and
is aware of its obligations at 
all times.
Annual General Meeting
The next AGM of the Company will
be held on 6 August 2003. Details
of the business to be proposed at
the AGM are contained within the
Notice of Meeting, which is set out

Principles of Corporate
Governance
The Board recognises the value of
good corporate governance as a
positive contribution to the well
being of the business and believes
in applying these principles,
(including those set out in Section
1 of the Principles of Good
Governance and Code of Best
Practice ‘the Combined Code’
published by the London Stock
Exchange in June 1998), in a
sensible and pragmatic manner.
Peter Wilkinson, as majority
shareholder in the Company, has
signed an agreement undertaking
that he will not seek to influence
the Board by reason of his
shareholding.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors consists
of ten members, including a
non-Executive President and two
other non-Executive Directors.
The roles of President, Executive
Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer are separated and clearly
defined. The activities of the Group
are controlled by the Board, which
meets throughout the year. There is
a formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved for the full
Board’s decision, together with a
policy enabling Directors to take
independent advice in the
furtherance of their duties at the
Group’s expense. The Board
programme is designed so that
Directors have regular opportunity
to consider the Group’s strategy,
policies, budgets, progress reports
and financial position and to arrive
at a balanced assessment of the
Group’s position and prospects.
The Board is assisted by the
Company Secretary, who provides a
point of reference and regular
support for all Directors and senior
managers. He has responsibility for
ensuring that Board procedures are
followed, for establishing the
Group’s corporate governance
policies and for assisting the Board
in facilitating compliance by the
Company with its legal obligations.
The Board has appointed two
standing committees, which are as
follows:
The Audit Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive
Directors and the non-Executive
President and is chaired by Lord
Parkinson. Its duties include a
comprehensive review of the
annual and interim financial
statements before they are
presented to the Board for
approval. The Audit Committee
meets at least twice a year to
review the findings of the external
auditors, key accounting policies
and judgements. It has unrestricted
access to the Company’s auditors.
The Remuneration Committee
Comprises the two non-Executive
Directors and the non-Executive
President and is chaired by Joe
McNally. It meets at least once a
year and is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on
remuneration policy for Executive
Directors and for setting salaries,
incentive payments and share
options granted.
Relations with shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that
all shareholders are kept informed
about the Company and its
activities. A comprehensive annual
report and accounts and an interim
report are sent to shareholders and
there is frequent dialogue with
institutional investors, including
presentations following the
preliminary and interim
announcements.
The Annual General Meeting is a
forum for shareholders’
participation with the opportunity
to meet and question Board
members including the non-
Executive President and the
Chairmen of the Board committees.
Corporate governance 19
Internal control
The Board of Directors
acknowledges its overall
responsibility for the Company’s
systems of internal control and for
monitoring their effectiveness. The
Board has control over strategic,
financial and compliance issues
and has introduced a structure of
responsibility with appropriate levels
of authority. The Board as a whole
has continued to annually review
the effectiveness of the Company’s
systems of internal control.
The Company’s Directors and
varying levels of management have
clear responsibilities in ensuring
that the control environment
operates efficiently. Clear lines of
responsibility are developed
through the Company’s
organisation structure. Ethical
policies are communicated through
all forms of personnel training and
via appropriate procedures, in
establishing a code of ethics.
Although no system of internal
control can provide absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the
Company’s systems are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that
problems are identified on a timely
basis and are dealt with
appropriately. The principal features
of the Company’s internal financial
control structures can be
summarised as follows:
a. Preparation of budgets and
forecasts approved by the Board.
b. Monthly management accounts,
showing comparisons of actual
results against budget and prior
year results, are reviewed by the
Board. Variances from budget
are thoroughly investigated.
Where lapses in internal control
are detected, these are rectified.
c. The Company’s cash flow is
also monitored monthly
compared to forecast.
d. The Board authorises capital
expenditure where this is
significant.
In the light of the Turnbull
Committee guidance published in
September 1999, the Board has
continued to enhance its risk
control programme, in particular,
those elements which relate to
ensuring that risk reviews are
formally embedded in control
systems rather than being the
subject of formal annual reviews.
Statement of Directors’
responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors
to prepare financial statements for
each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group as
at the end of the financial year and
of the profit or loss of the Group
for that year.
The Directors confirm that suitable
accounting policies have been used
and applied consistently as
explained on pages 28 to 29 under
the heading ‘Accounting policies’ .
They also confirm that reasonable
and prudent judgements and
estimates have been made in
preparing the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2003,
that applicable accounting policies
have been followed and that
the financial statements have
been prepared on the going
concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the
Group and to enable them to
ensure that the financial
statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of
the InTechnology website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the
work carried out by the auditors
does not involve consideration of
these matters and, accordingly, the
auditors accept no responsibility
for any changes that may have
occurred to the financial
statements since they were initially
presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial
statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration of 
non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-
Executive Directors is determined
by the Board, with the assistance
of independent advice concerning
comparable organisations and
appointments. The non-Executive
Directors do not take part in
discussions on their remuneration.
Neither the non-Executive
President nor the other
non-Executive Directors received
any pension or other benefits from
the Group, nor did they participate
in any of the bonus schemes.
The non-Executive President and
Directors have interests in share
options as disclosed on page 22.
Remuneration of 
Executive Directors
The main aim of the Company’s
Executive pay policy is to secure
the skills and experience needed to
meet its strategic business
objectives. Furthermore, the
Company aims to align the
interests of all employees as
closely as possible with the
interests of shareholders through
share-based incentives.
The Company’s Remuneration
Committee decides the
remuneration policy that applies to
Executive Directors. In setting the
policy it considers a number of
factors including:
a. The basic salaries and benefits
available to Executive Directors
of comparable companies.
b. The need to attract and
retain Directors of an
appropriate calibre.
c. The need to ensure Executive
Directors’ commitment to the
continued success of the Group
by means of incentive schemes.
The Company’s remuneration 
policy is to:
a. Have regard to the Directors’
experience and the nature
and complexity of their work
in order to pay a competitive
salary that attracts and

having regard to the needs of the
Company, individual
responsibilities, personal
performance and independently
compiled salary survey information.
Pensions
The Executive Directors are
members of defined contribution
pension schemes, the assets of
which are held independently of
the Company. The amounts
contributed by the Company,
(based on salaries excluding
bonuses), for the year ended
31 March 2003 were £51,000

We have audited the financial
statements which comprise the

account, consolidated statement
of total recognised gains and
losses, reconciliation of
movements in Group shareholders’
funds, balance sheets,
consolidated cash flow statement,
the statement of accounting
policies and the related notes.
Respective responsibilities of
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the annual report and
the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting
standards are set out in the
statement of Directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance
with the relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and
United Kingdom Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for
no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance
with the United Kingdom
Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion,
the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has
not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration
and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information
contained in the Annual Report
and consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. The other
information comprises only the
Non-Executive President’s
introduction, Executive Chairman’s
statement, Chief Executive
Officer’s report, the Financial
review, the products and services
review, the case studies, the
Directors’ Report, the Corporate
Governance report and the
Remuneration report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made
by the Directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our
audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations
which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient
evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial
statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in
the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial
statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group as at
31 March 2003 and of the loss and
cash flows of the Group for the
year then ended and have been
properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting policies
The Directors have performed a
review of the Group’s accounting
policies in accordance with FRS 18
‘Accounting policies’ . This review
did not result in any changes in
accounting policies because the
Directors concluded that the
accounting policies adopted by the
Group are the most appropriate for
its circumstances.
The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with
applicable Accounting Standards in
the United Kingdom. A summary of
the main accounting policies which
have been applied consistently, is
set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the
historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss
account and balance sheet include
the financial statements of the
company and its subsidiary
undertakings up to 31 March. The
results of subsidiaries acquired are
included in the consolidated profit
and loss account from the date on
which control passes. Intra-group
sales and profits are eliminated
fully on consolidation.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, its
assets and liabilities that exist at
the date of acquisition are recorded
at their fair values. All gains and
losses that arise after the group
has gained control of the subsidiary
are included in the post acquisition
profit and loss account.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation
represents the excess of the fair
value of the consideration paid over
the fair value of the identifiable net
assets acquired and is amortised
through the profit and loss account
over its useful economic life. The
Directors have assessed the
estimated useful economic life of
goodwill at 20 years from date of
acquisition based on the strengths
of the underlying businesses and
projected future market growth.
The Directors review the level
of goodwill for impairment at the
end of the first full financial year
following acquisition and in
other periods if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not
be recoverable.
Tangible fixed assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets
is their purchase cost, together
with any incidental expenses
of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to
write-off the cost of tangible fixed
assets less their estimated residual
values, on a straight line basis over
the expected useful economic lives
of the assets concerned. The
principal annual rates used for this
purpose are:
Freehold buildings - 2%
Leasehold improvements - 20%
Office fixtures and fittings - 25%
to 50%
Vehicles and computer equipment -
25% to 50%
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The Directors review tangible fixed
assets for impairment if events or
changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not
be recoverable.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of
cost and net realisable value.
Provisions are made for obsolete,
slow-moving and defective items
where appropriate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue on the outright sale of
equipment and software is
recognised on invoice at the time
of despatch. Service revenues are
recognised evenly over the period
to which the service relates.
Unrecognised service revenue is
included as deferred income in the
balance sheet.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies
are recorded at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Profits and losses of
overseas subsidiary undertakings
are translated into sterling at the
rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising 
on the re-translation of the
opening net assets and profits and
losses incurred are taken directly 
to reserves.
Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies
are translated to sterling at the
exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date. 29
Accounting policies continued
Lease agreements
Finance lease arrangements, which
transfer to the Group substantially
all the benefits and risks of
ownership of an asset, are treated
as if the asset had been purchased
outright. The assets are included in
fixed assets and the capital
element of the finance leases is
shown as obligations under finance
leases. The finance lease rentals are
treated as consisting of capital and
interest elements. The capital
element is applied to reduce the
outstanding obligations and the
interest element is charged to the
profit and loss account in
proportion to the reducing capital
element outstanding. Assets held
under finance leases are
depreciated over the useful lives of
equivalent owned assets.
Costs in respect of operating leases
are charged to the profit and loss
account on a straight line basis
over the term of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred
taxation resulting from timing
differences between profits
computed for taxation purposes
and profits stated in the financial
statements to the extent that there
is an obligation to pay more tax
in the future as a result of the
reversal of those timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent they are expected to
be recoverable in the foreseeable
future.
Research and development
Research and development
expenditure is written off to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension costs
The Company operates a defined
contribution pension scheme for
employees and directors. The assets
of the scheme are held separately
from those of the Company. The
annual contributions payable are
charged to the profit and loss
account. The Company provides no
other post-retirement benefits to
its employees and directors.
Share schemes
The Group grants share options to
employees and directors on a
discretionary basis. The scheme is
‘unapproved’ and all employees
have agreed in writing to accept
liability for any National Insurance
contributions that become due on
exercise of options. 30

As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not
presented in these financial statements. The parent Company’s loss for the year ended 31 March 2003 was
£9,091,000 (2002: £85,383,000). 33

7 (Loss)/earnings per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of £7,042,000 (2002:
£83,172,000) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 138,101,518 (2002:
138,089,272).
The adjusted basic loss per share has been calculated to provide a better understanding of the underlying
performance of the Group as follows:
2003 2002
(Loss)/ (Loss)/ (Loss)/ (Loss)/
earnings earnings earnings earnings
per share per share
£’000 pence £’000 pence
Loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (7,042) (5.10) (83,172) (60.23)
Amortisation of goodwill 3,980 2.88 7,995 5.79
Exceptional costs of German subsidiary 1,645 1.19 --
Exceptional goodwill impairment charge -- 73,493 53.22
Share of operating loss of associate -- 353 0.26
Adjusted basic loss per share (1,417) (1.03) (1,331) (0.96)
The loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose
of calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per ordinary
share. This is because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share
and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of FRS 14 ‘Earnings per share’ .

15 Financial instruments
The main financial risks faced by the Group include interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks. The Group currently has very little exposure to currency risk.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, liquid resources and various items, such as debtors and creditors
that arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that
no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Similarly, the Group did not undertake any financial
hedging arrangements during the year under review. The year end position reflects these policies and there have
been no changes in policies or risks since the year end.
The Group has net cash reserves and therefore has limited interest rate exposure. Group policy is to continue to
monitor financial markets and to repay outstanding loans in line with agreed repayment schedules.
Financial asset returns are maximised by ongoing review of the Group’s cash flow requirements. Any funds surplus
to short-term working capital requirements are placed on interest bearing deposit.
Liquidity risk is further managed by agreeing separate borrowing facilities for any additional working capital and
investment requirements. In accordance with this policy, the Group has negotiated an invoice discounting facility
of £946,000 with IBM, which was unused as at 31 March 2003. This facility is provided on a rolling basis and is
subject to 60 days notice by either party.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.

(2002: £nil). 38

Weighted average fixed interest rate 9.14% 6.64%
Weighted average period for which rate is fixed 2.1 years 3.1 years
Financial liabilities include secured loan arrangements with IBM and finance leases and are detailed in note 14. The
loans bear interest by reference to LIBOR and are repayable as set out in note 14.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available as at 31 March,
in respect of which all conditions have been met at that date, were as follows:
2003 2002
£'000 £'000
Expiring within one year 946 2,500
Non-equity shares
A proportion of the Group’s share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of deferred shares
of 1p each. The rights and restrictions attaching to the deferred shares are described in note 18 to the financial
statements.
Fair value
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction
between informed and willing parties, other than by a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. The
fair value of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2003 approximate to the book value at those dates.
Currency exposure
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas are not significant. The Group does not consider current levels
of overseas trade sufficiently significant to warrant actions to mitigate currency exposure.
Hedges
The Group does not operate any hedging instruments. 39

Group and Company
£'000
At 1 April 2002 230
Credited to the profit and loss account 5
At 31 March 2003 235
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in
which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet dates.
The deferred tax asset is included in debtors and is analysed as follows:
Group and Company Amount recognised Amount not recognised
2003 2002 2003 2002
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Accelerated capital allowances - - 322 270
Short term timing differences 235 230 - -
Losses carried forward - - 892 892
235 230 1,214 1,162
Based on current capital expenditure plans, the Group does not expect fixed asset timing differences to reverse in
the foreseeable future, hence no deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of accelerated capital
allowances. In addition, in the light of medium term forecasts prepared, the Group does not at present consider it
more likely than not that suitable taxable profits will be available to offset the losses carried forward, hence no
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses carried forward. In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred
tax’, the Directors will continue to assess whether deferred tax assets should be recognised in respect of these items.

Deferred shares differ to ordinary shares in that they do not entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other
distribution; do not entitle the holder to vote at any general meeting of the Company; do entitle the holder on a
winding up to repayment of amounts paid only after payment in respect of each Ordinary Share of the capital paid
up and a further payment of £10,000 on each Ordinary Share and are treated as non-equity shares.
Share options
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company at prices ranging from 1.8p to 337.5p under
the share option schemes.
During the year the Company did not issue any shares in respect of the exercise of employee share options (2002:
101,589 shares).
